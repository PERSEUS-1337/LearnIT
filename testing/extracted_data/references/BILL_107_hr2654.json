FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) modern and efficient fixed guideway transportation is \n        important to the viability and well-being of metropolitan areas \n        and to the energy conservation and self-sufficiency goals of \n        the United States;\n            (2) public convenience and necessity require the \n        development of fixed guideway transportation systems in \n        metropolitan areas presently without such service, and the \n        expansion of existing systems in metropolitan areas already \n        receiving such service;\n            (3) use of existing railroad trackage and rights-of-way in \n        and around metropolitan areas provides a unique and valuable \n        opportunity for the development and expansion of fixed guideway \n        transportation facilities with a minimum of disruption to the \n        environment and the surrounding community; and\n            (4) voluntary negotiations between mass transportation \n        authorities and rail carriers regarding shared use of existing \n        railroad trackage and rights-of-way have not been adequate to \n        ensure the development of sound and efficient fixed guideway \n        transportation systems.\n\nSEC. 3. RAIL TRANSIT ACCESS.\n\n    (a) Amendment.--Part E of subtitle V of title 49, United States \nCode, is amended by adding at the end the following new chapter:\n\n                   ``CHAPTER 285--RAIL TRANSIT ACCESS\n\n``Sec.\n``28501. Definitions.\n``28502. Shared use of rail carrier trackage by mass transportation \n                            authorities.\n``28503. Shared use of rail rights-of-way by mass transportation \n                            authorities.\n``28504. Applicability of other laws.\n``28505. Standards for Board action.\n``Sec. 28501. Definitions\n    ``In this chapter--\n            ``(1) the term `Board' means the Surface Transportation \n        Board;\n            ``(2) the term `capital work' means maintenance, \n        restoration, reconstruction, capacity enhancement, or \n        rehabilitation work on trackage that would be treated, in \n        accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as a \n        capital item rather than an expense;\n            ``(3) the term `fixed guideway transportation' means mass \n        transportation (as defined in section 5302(a)(7)) provided on, \n        by, or using a fixed guideway (as defined in section \n        5302(a)(4));\n            ``(4) the term `mass transportation authority' means a \n        local governmental authority (as defined in section 5302(a)(6)) \n        established to provide, or make a contract providing for, fixed \n        guideway transportation;\n            ``(5) the term `rail carrier' means a person, other than a \n        governmental authority, providing common carrier railroad \n        transportation for compensation subject to the jurisdiction of \n        the Board under chapter 105;\n            ``(6) the term `segregated fixed guideway facility' means a \n        fixed guideway facility constructed within the railroad right-\n        of-way of a rail carrier but physically separate from trackage, \n        including relocated trackage, within the right-of-way used by a \n        rail carrier for freight transportation purposes; and\n            ``(7) the term `trackage' means a railroad line of a rail \n        carrier, including a spur, industrial, team, switching, side, \n        yard, or station track, and a facility of a rail carrier.\n``Sec. 28502. Shared use of rail carrier trackage by mass \n              transportation authorities\n    ``(a) Authority.--If, after negotiation, a mass transportation \nauthority cannot reach agreement with a rail carrier to use trackage \nof, and have related services provided by, the rail carrier for \npurposes of fixed guideway transportation, the Board shall, upon \napplication of the mass transportation authority or the rail carrier, \nand if the Board finds it necessary or useful to carry out this \nchapter--\n            ``(1) order that the trackage be made available and the \n        related services be provided to the mass transportation \n        authority; and\n            ``(2) prescribe reasonable terms and compensation for use \n        of the trackage and provision of the related services, \n        including the performance of capital work if the mass \n        transportation authority has demonstrated that such capital \n        work is required for efficient and reliable passenger \n        operations on the trackage to be used.\n    ``(b) Standard for Compensation; Quality of Service.--When \nprescribing reasonable compensation under subsection (a)(2), the Board \nshall consider alternative cost allocation principles, including \nincremental cost and fully allocated cost, under rules promulgated by \nthe Board within 6 months after the date of the enactment of the \nTransit Rail Accommodation Improvement and Needs Act for the 21st \nCentury. The Board shall consider quality of service by the rail \ncarrier as a major factor when determining compensation for the use of \nthe trackage and providing the related services.\n    ``(c) Terms of Operation.--When prescribing reasonable terms under \nsubsection (a)(2), the Board may prescribe the number of trains that \nmay be operated by or for the mass transportation authority, the speeds \nat which such trains may be operated, and the trackage maintenance \nlevels to be provided by the rail carrier.\n    ``(d) Additional Trains.--When a rail carrier and a mass \ntransportation authority cannot agree to terms for the operation of \nadditional trains by or for a mass transportation authority over a rail \nline of the carrier, the mass transportation authority or the rail \ncarrier may apply to the Board for an order establishing such terms. If \nthe Board finds it reasonable to carry out this chapter, the Board \nshall order the rail carrier to allow operation of the requested \nadditional trains on such terms as the Board finds reasonable under the \ncircumstances.\n    ``(e) Trackage Maintenance.--If a mass transportation authority \nbelieves that maintenance or related capital work of trackage operated \nby or for the mass transportation authority has fallen below a \nnecessary level to maintain reliable service at speeds necessary to \nprovide convenient and efficient mass transportation service, the mass \ntransportation authority may, after notice to the rail carrier and a \nsufficient period for maintenance or related capital work improvements, \napply to the Board for an order requiring the rail carrier to provide \nincreased or improved maintenance or related capital work on the \ntrackage. If the Board finds it reasonable to carry out this part, the \nBoard shall order the rail carrier to provide such increased or \nimproved maintenance or related capital work as the Board finds \nreasonable under the circumstances. The remedy available under this \nsubsection shall be in addition to any contract rights that a mass \ntransportation authority may possess with respect to trackage \nmaintenance or related capital work.\n    ``(f) Accelerated Speeds.--If a rail carrier refuses to allow \naccelerated speeds for trains operated by or for a mass transportation \nauthority, the mass transportation authority may apply to the Board for \nan order requiring the rail carrier to allow the accelerated speeds and \nrelated capital work required to permit operation at the accelerated \nspeeds. The Board shall decide whether accelerated speeds are \npracticable and which capital work would be required to make \naccelerated speeds practicable. The Board shall establish the maximum \nallowable speeds for trains operated by or for a mass transportation \nauthority on terms the Board decides are reasonable.\n    ``(g) Preference Over Freight Transportation.--Except in an \nemergency, fixed guideway transportation provided by or for a mass \ntransportation authority pursuant to an order issued under subsection \n(a) has preference over freight transportation in using a rail line, \njunction, or crossing unless the Board orders otherwise under this \nchapter. A rail carrier affected by this subsection may apply to the \nBoard for relief. If the Board decides that preference for fixed \nguideway transportation materially will lessen the quality of freight \ntransportation provided to shippers, the Board shall establish the \nrights of the rail carrier and the mass transportation authority on \nreasonable terms.\n    ``(h) Final Determination.--The Board shall make a determination \nunder this section not later than 120 days after a mass transportation \nauthority or a rail carrier submits an application to the Board.\n``Sec. 28503. Shared use of rail rights-of-way by mass transportation \n              authorities\n    ``(a) General Authority.--If, after negotiation, a mass \ntransportation authority cannot reach agreement with a rail carrier to \nacquire an interest in a railroad right-of-way for the construction and \noperation of a segregated fixed guideway facility, the mass \ntransportation authority may apply to the Board for an order requiring \nthe rail carrier to convey an interest to the authority. The Board, not \nlater than 120 days after receiving the application, shall order the \ninterest conveyed if--\n            ``(1) the mass transportation authority assumes a \n        reasonable allocation of costs associated with any necessary \nrelocation of a rail carrier's trackage within the right-of-way; and\n            ``(2) the fixed guideway transportation purpose of the \n        proposed segregated fixed guideway facility cannot be met \n        adequately at a reasonable cost by acquiring an interest in \n        other property.\n    ``(b) Compensation and Terms.--A conveyance ordered by the Board \nunder this section shall be subject to the payment of just compensation \nand to such other reasonable terms as the Board may prescribe.\n``Sec. 28504. Applicability of other laws\n    ``(a) Board Review or Approval.--Operations or conveyances \nundertaken pursuant to an order issued under section 28502 or 28503 are \nnot subject to Board review or approval under subtitle IV of this title \nunless the Board, on a case-by-case basis, has determined that the mass \ntransportation authority has assumed rights or obligations under such \norder to provide transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the \nBoard under chapter 105.\n    ``(b) Contractual Obligations for Claims.--Nothing in this chapter \nshall be construed to limit a rail transportation provider's right \nunder section 28103(b) to enter into contracts that allocate financial \nresponsibility for claims.\n``Sec. 28505. Standards for Board action\n    ``In proceedings under sections 28502 and 28503 the Board shall \nutilize, to the extent relevant and feasible, the principles, \nstandards, and precedents utilized in proceedings under sections 24308 \nand 24311(c) involving the National Railroad Passenger Corporation.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendments.--\n            (1) Limitations on rail passenger transportation \n        liability.--Section 28103(a) of title 49, United States Code, \n        is amended by inserting ``or other fixed guideway \n        transportation'' after ``commuter''.\n            (2) Table of chapters.--The table of chapters of subtitle V \n        of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding after the \n        item relating to chapter 283 the following new item:\n\n``285. RAIL TRANSIT ACCESS..................................   28501''.\n\nSEC. 4.
