FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The President is required under section 2001 of the \n        Revised Statutes of the United States (22 U.S.C. 1732) to \n        demand the release of any citizen who has been unjustly \n        deprived of his liberty by or under the authority of any \n        foreign government, and to undertake appropriate means to \n        obtain the release of such citizen.\n            (2) In a statement submitted to the Committee on the \n        Judiciary of the Senate on July 27, 2011, Secretary of State \n        Hillary Clinton stated that ``[t]he State Department has no \n        greater responsibility than the protection of U.S. citizens \n        overseas--particularly when Americans find themselves in the \n        custody of a foreign government, facing an unfamiliar, and at \n        times unfair, legal system.''.\n            (3) Some United States citizens imprisoned in foreign \n        countries have been and continue to be denied fundamental due \n        process and human rights under both local and international law \n        by foreign government officials.\n            (4) Mr. Jacob Ostreicher, who has been detained in the \n        notorious Palmasola prison in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, \n        since June 4, 2011, is one of the United States citizens who \n        currently is enduring multiple, egregious, and continuous \n        violations of his fundamental due process and human rights \n        under both local and international law.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that foreign \ngovernment officials responsible for violations of fundamental due \nprocess and human rights of imprisoned United States citizens, as well \nas their immediate family members, should not have the privilege of \ntraveling to the United States while United States citizens unjustly \nlanguish in their prisons.\n\nSEC. 3.
