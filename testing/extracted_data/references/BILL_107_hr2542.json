Creation of an advisory council regarding Program.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) American agricultural producers are stewards of their \n        lands, and should be encouraged to carry out practices to \n        maintain, protect, and care for the natural, environmental, and \n        agricultural resources of their lands.\n            (2) Agricultural producers face increasing challenges in \n        protecting environmental sensitive land while ensuring an \n        abundant and safe food supply and the sound future of \n        agricultural production.\n            (3) Increased access of agricultural producers to \n        conservation programs, particularly by producers facing unique \n        environmental needs, must be a part of the national \n        agricultural conservation policy.\n            (4) Responsible care and stewardship of natural resources \n        by agricultural producers would be fostered by incentive \n        initiatives aimed at assisting producers in meeting \n        environmental program requirements, protecting and maintaining \n        endangered habitat and wetlands, improving water quality and \n        water access, treating on-farm discharge, deterring invasive \n        species, and addressing other important environmental \n        challenges.\n            (5) Greater local involvement, as well as increased \n        cooperation between agricultural producers and local, State, \n        and Federal officials, is needed to allow agricultural \n        producers to meet environmental goals.\n            (6) A voluntary incentives based program would encourage \n        greater protection of natural resources by providing economic \n        assistance to agricultural producers to improve and protect \n        natural resources, while permitting them to stay competitive in \n        the world market.\n\nSEC. 3.

Any Federal agency \nparticipating in the Farmland Stewardship Program that has the \nauthority to enter into service contracts and to expend public funds \nunder such contracts may enter into or participate in the funding of an \nagreement.\n    (c) Basic Purposes.--An agreement with the owner or operator of \neligible agricultural lands shall be used--\n            (1) to negotiate a mutually agreeable set of guidelines, \n        practices, and procedures under which services will be provided \n        to the public and rendered by the owner or operator to protect, \n        maintain, and, where possible, improve, the natural and \n        ecological resources on the lands covered by the agreement in \n        return for annual payments to the owner or operator for the \n        services rendered;\n            (2) to implement a conservation program or series of \n        programs where no program now exists or to implement \n        conservation management or ecological service activities where \n        no such activities now exist; and\n            (3) to expand conservation practices, resource management, \n        and ecological service activities to a property where it is not \n        possible at the present time to negotiate or reach agreement on \n        a public purchase of a fee-simple or less-than-fee interest in \n        the property for conservation purposes.\n    (d) Modification of Other Conservation Program Elements.--If most, \nbut not all, of the limitations, conditions, and requirements of a \nconservation program that is implemented in whole, or in part, through \nthe Farmland Stewardship Program are met with respect to a parcel of \neligible agricultural lands, and the purposes to be achieved by the \nagreement to be entered into for such lands are consistent with the \npurposes of the conservation program, then the Secretary may waive any \nremaining limitations, conditions, or requirements of the conservation \nprogram that would otherwise prohibit or limit the agreement.\n    (e) State and Local Conservation Priorities.--To the maximum extent \npracticable, agreements shall address the conservation priorities \nestablished by the State and locality in which the eligible \nagricultural lands are located.\n\nSEC. 103.
