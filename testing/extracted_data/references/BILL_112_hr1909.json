FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \n        more than 60 million low- and moderate-income consumers in \n        America remain unbanked, underbanked, or underserved.\n            (2) The proportion of United States households that are \n        unbanked varies considerably across racial and ethnic groups \n        with certain racial and ethnic groups being more likely to be \n        unbanked than the population as a whole. Minorities more likely \n        to be unbanked include Blacks (21.7 percent of Black \n        households), Hispanics (19.3 percent), and American Indian/\n        Alaskans (15.6 percent). Racial groups less likely to be \n        unbanked are Asians (3.5 percent) and Whites (3.3 percent).\n            (3) Certain racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to \n        be underbanked than the population as a whole. Minorities more \n        likely to be underbanked include Blacks (an estimated 31.6 \n        percent), American Indian/Alaskans (28.9 percent), and \n        Hispanics (24.0 percent). Asians and Whites are less likely to \n        be underbanked (7.2 percent and 14.9 percent, respectively).\n            (4) Households with income under $30,000 account for at \n        least 71 percent of unbanked households. As income increases, \n        the share of households that are unbanked declines \n        considerably. Nationally, nearly 20 percent of lower-income \n        United States households--almost 7 million households earning \n        below $30,000 per year--do not currently have a bank account. \n        In contrast, only 4.2 percent of households with annual income \n        between $30,000 and $50,000 and less than 1 percent of \n        households with yearly income of $75,000 or higher are \n        unbanked.\n            (5) Lack of access to affordable banking products and \n        services deters the economic advancement of low- and moderate-\n        income consumers and stunts the economic growth of communities \n        in which they live.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a vibrant, \nsafe, and commercially viable market for underbanked and unbanked \nindividuals to gain access to financial services and products.\n\nSEC. 3.
