FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Buford Furrow, a white supremacist, used a Glock pistol \n        decommissioned and sold by a law enforcement agency in the \n        State of Washington, to shoot children at a Jewish community \n        center in Los Angeles and kill a postal worker.\n            (2) Twelve firearms were recently stolen during shipment \n        from the Miami-Dade Police Department to Chicago, Illinois. \n        Four of these firearms have been traced to crimes in Chicago, \n        Illinois, including a shooting near a playground.\n            (3) In the past 9 years, decommissioned firearms once used \n        by law enforcement agencies have been involved in more than \n        3,000 crimes, including 293 homicides, 301 assaults, and 279 \n        drug-related crimes.\n            (4) Many State and local law enforcement departments also \n        engage in the practice of reselling firearms that were involved \n        in the commission of a crime and confiscated.
