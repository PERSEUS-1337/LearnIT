FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States is increasingly relying on private \n        security contractors to perform mission critical and emergency \n        essential functions that historically have been performed by \n        United States military or government personnel.\n            (2) The number of private security contractors in Iraq is \n        reported to be at least 48,000 and Department of State funding \n        for private security and law enforcement contractors is \n        estimated to have increased from $1,000,000,000 to \n        $4,000,000,000.\n            (3) The Congressional Research Service reports that about \n        one-quarter of private security contractors are third-party \n        nationals.\n            (4) On October 18, 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates \n        said that the work of many contractors in Iraq was ``at cross-\n        purposes to our larger mission in Iraq'', and that ``right now \n        those missions are in conflict ...''.\n            (5) A December 2006 report by the Government Accountability \n        Office found multiple deficiencies in the Army's oversight of \n        contractors in Iraq, including ``limited visibility over \n        contractors'', a lack of ``adequate contractor oversight \n        personnel'', and ``little or no training on the use of \n        contractors''.\n            (6) The Congress does not have access to security \n        contracts, the number of private security contractors working \n        in Iraq, Afghanistan and other combat zones, the number of \n        contractors who have died or any disciplinary actions taken \n        against them.\n            (7) The relationship between the governments of the United \n        States and Iraq has been negatively impacted by violent \n        incidents involving private military contractors and Iraqi \n        citizens, including a December 24, 2006, shooting of the guard \n        of the Iraqi Vice President and a September 16, 2007, shooting \n        by Blackwater employees that killed 17 Iraqi citizens and \n        wounded 24.\n            (8) The Government of Iraq has demanded that the United \n        States Government sever all contracts in Iraq with Blackwater \n        and expel the company from Iraq within six months, highlighting \n        the danger in relying on private security contractors for \n        mission critical functions.\n            (9) The use of private security contractors for mission \n        critical functions undermines the mission, jeopardizes the \n        safety of American troops conducting military operations in \n        Iraq and other combat zones, and should be phased out.\n\nSEC. 3.
