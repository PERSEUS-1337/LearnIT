EXCEPTIONS FOR SHORT-SUPPLY SITUATIONS.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--\n            ``(1) Petition.--If a short-supply petition is filed under \n        this section and the administering authority determines that a \n        short-supply situation exists with respect to a particular \n        product which is within the same class or kind as merchandise \n        that is the subject of an order or finding described in \n        paragraph (2), the administering authority shall suspend the \n        order or finding and shall authorize the importation of \n        additional quantities of the product free of duties, estimated \n        duty deposits, reporting requirements, or other restrictions, \n        unless the administering authority determines that such imports \n        will erode the pricing structure of the domestic merchandise \n        that is comparable to the class or kind of merchandise subject \n        to an order or finding.\n            ``(2) Order or finding.--An order or finding described in \n        this paragraph is--\n                    ``(A) an antidumping order issued under section \n                736,\n                    ``(B) a finding issued under the Antidumping Act, \n                1921, or\n                    ``(C) a countervailing duty order issued under \n                section 706 or 303.\n    ``(b) Factors.--In determining whether a short-supply situation \nexists in the United States with respect to a product, the \nadministering authority shall consider all relevant factors, \nincluding--\n            ``(1) if there is domestic production of the product with \n        respect to which the short-supply petition has been filed;\n            ``(2) to the extent information is available, the recent \n        levels of capacity utilization of domestic facilities producing \n        the product;\n            ``(3) the quantity of the product requested in the short-\n        supply petition and the ability of domestic producers to supply \n        the product in such quantity;\n            ``(4) the reasonableness of the specifications requested by \n        the purchaser or end-user of the product; and\n            ``(5) the time the product can be delivered to the \n        purchaser or end-user.\n    ``(c) Procedures.--\n            ``(1) Petitions.--An interested party may file with the \n        administering authority a petition requesting a determination \n        under this section at any time an order or finding described in \n        subsection (a)(2) is in effect. The petition shall be in such \n        form and contain such information as the administering \n        authority requires.\n            ``(2) Publication.--If the administering authority finds \n        that a petition filed under paragraph (1) contains adequate \n        information, the administering authority shall promptly publish \n        in the Federal Register a notice that a determination under \n        this section is under consideration.\n            ``(3) Comment.--The administering authority shall provide \n        opportunity for comment by interested parties regarding issues \n        raised in the petition.\n            ``(4) Certification.--The petitioner and any interested \n        party submitting information shall certify that the information \n        contained in the petition (or submission, as the case may be) \n        is accurate and complete to the best of the petitioner's or \n        party's knowledge.\n            ``(5) Consultations.--In making a determination under this \n        section, the administering authority shall consult with \n        domestic users of the product.\n    ``(d) Determination.--\n            ``(1) In general.--In any case in which the administering \n        authority finds that a short-supply petition contains adequate \n        information, the administering authority shall determine, not \n        later than the day specified in paragraph (2)--\n                    ``(A) if a short-supply situation exists in the \n                United States with respect to the product; and\n                    ``(B) if the determination under subparagraph (A) \n                is affirmative, the quantity of the product, if any, \n                that may be imported into the United States without \n                regard to the antidumping or countervailing duty order \n                that would otherwise apply. In making the determination \n                under this subparagraph, the administering authority \n                may consider whether allowing particular quantities of \n                the product to be imported without regard to the \n                antidumping or countervailing duty order will erode the \n                pricing structure of the domestic merchandise that is \n                comparable to the class or kind of merchandise subject \n                to an order or finding.\n            ``(2) Time limit for making short-supply determination.--\n        The administering authority shall make a determination \n        described in paragraph (1) not later than--\n                    ``(A) the 15th day after the date the petition is \n                filed if--\n                            ``(i) the administering authority \n                        authorized the importation of additional \n                        quantities of the product during each of the 2 \n                        years preceding the date the petition is filed, \n                        or\n                            ``(ii) the administering authority finds, \n                        on the basis of available information (without \n                        regard to whether such information is available \n                        as part of the petition under review), that the \n                        product is not produced in the United States; \n                        or\n                    ``(B) the 30th day after the date the petition is \n                filed if clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) does \n                not apply, except that if a petition under this section \n                is received more than 30 days before the issuance of an \n                antidumping or countervailing duty order with respect \n                to the product, the administering authority may make a \n                short-supply determination at the time and as part of \n                such order.\n            ``(3) Rebuttable presumption.--If a petition is filed under \n        this section, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the \n        short-supply situation alleged in the petition exists.\n            ``(4) Short-supply allowance upon failure of a domestic \n        producer to supply.--If the administering authority determines \n        that a short-supply situation does not exist because a producer \n        in the United States states that it is willing and able to \n        supply the product in the quantity requested at the \n        specifications, price, and delivery date requested, and the \n        producer fails to supply the product as promised, the \n        administering authority shall, within 3 days of being notified \n        of the failure, grant a short-supply allowance for the quantity \n        the domestic producer failed to supply.\n    ``(e) Notice.--The administering authority shall publish in the \nFederal Register notice of each determination made under this section \nand the reasons therefore.\n    ``(f) Definitions and Special Rules.--For purposes of this section:\n            ``(1) Interested party.--The term `interested party' \n        means--\n                    ``(A) a United States producer or consumer of the \n                product;\n                    ``(B) a United States importer or distributor of \n                the product; and\n                    ``(C) a foreign exporter or producer who will \n                supply the product to a United States producer, \n                consumer, importer, or distributor.\n            ``(2) Product.--The term `product' means the product for \n        which a short-supply allowance is requested, or material which \n        possesses the same physical characteristics and performance \n        standards and which can be used for the same application \n        without imposing any significant alteration costs for the \n        consumer.\n            ``(3) Reasonable specifications.--The term `reasonable \n        specifications' means specifications that are developed in the \n        ordinary course of business.

The Secretary shall apply a \n        rebuttable presumption that the imported product will not erode \n        the pricing structure of the comparable domestic merchandise \n        whenever--\n                    ``(A) no United States producers have produced a \n                product meeting the reasonable specifications within \n                the last six months, nor have any United States \n                producers either qualified to supply products meeting \n                such specifications (if such qualification is normally \n                required) or signed contracts that would require the \n                delivery of such products within the next six months; \n                or\n                    ``(B) domestic consumption of the product exceeds \n                domestic production by more than fifty percent, and the \n                quantity of product covered by a short supply \n                determination is less than half of the difference \n                between domestic consumption and domestic production.\n        In considering whether a short-supply determination would erode \n        the pricing structure, the administering authority shall \n        consider, among other factors--\n                    (A) the quantity of short supply relief approved \n                within the applicable class or kind of merchandise; and\n                    (B) the interchangeability between products subject \n                to short-supply determinations and other products \n                within the applicable class or kind of merchandise.\n            ``(5) Short-supply allowance.--The term `short-supply \n        allowance' means an authorization by the administering \n        authority to permit importation into the United States, \n        including a foreign trade zone, of a quantity of product free \n        of duties imposed pursuant to an antidumping or countervailing \n        duty order issued under this title.''.\n    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents for title VII of the \nTariff Act of 1930 is amended by inserting after the item relating to \nsection 751 the following new item:\n\n``Sec. 752.
