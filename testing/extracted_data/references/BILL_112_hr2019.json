FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Public investment in the transportation system of the \n        United States is critical to ensuring equitable opportunities, \n        mobility, and economic security and prosperity for all \n        Americans.\n            (2) To prevent and eliminate discrimination on the basis of \n        race, color, or national origin related to Federal \n        transportation funding, the Department of Transportation has \n        issued regulations to effectuate title VI of the Civil Rights \n        Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.), which prohibit \n        discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin, \n        including actions that have the effect of discriminating \n        against individuals of a particular race, color, or national \n        origin.\n            (3) Full enforcement of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of \n        1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.) and related regulations is \n        necessary to establish accountability for recipients of Federal \n        funds and to ensure that Federal funds are not spent in a \n        manner that encourages, subsidizes, or results in \n        discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin, \n        directly or indirectly.\n            (4) The absence of a private right of action to enforce \n        Department of Transportation regulations that effectuate title \n        VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.) \n        would leave full vindication of the right to nondiscrimination \n        solely to the Department of Transportation, which may fail to \n        take necessary and appropriate action because of administrative \n        delay, limited resources, or other reasons.\n            (5) The decision of the Supreme Court in Alexander v. \n        Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001), impairs protections against \n        discrimination intended by Congress, denying a private right of \n        action to redress conduct prohibited by title VI of the Civil \n        Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.) and related \n        regulations.\n            (6) Action by Congress to confirm the existence of an \n        effective private right of action is necessary to ensure that \n        victims of discrimination will have a remedy if they are \n        excluded from, denied the benefits of, or subjected to \n        discrimination by programs or activities receiving Federal \n        financial assistance.\n            (7) Without effective enforcement of equal opportunity and \n        nondiscrimination statutes and regulations, transportation \n        decisions and investments can directly or indirectly result in \n        discriminatory outcomes, including residential segregation, \n        population displacement, exclusion from transportation \n        decisionmaking, disproportionately high rates of exposure to \n        pollutants, and denial of equitable transportation benefits on \n        the basis of race, color, or national origin.\n            (8) Without effective oversight and monitoring of equal \n        opportunity and nondiscrimination statutes and regulations, \n        transportation decisions and investments can directly or \n        indirectly result in the underemployment of racial and ethnic \n        minority workers and the underrepresentation of disadvantaged \n        business enterprises in Federal contracting.\n            (9) The likelihood of owning an automobile varies by race, \n        color, and national origin, with 24 percent of African-American \n        households, 17 percent of Latino households, and 13 percent of \n        Asian-American households not owning an automobile as compared \n        to 7 percent of Caucasian households.\n            (10) Reliance on public transportation varies by race, \n        color, and national origin, as nearly 60 percent of all transit \n        riders are people of color.\n            (11) Public transportation investment decisions are \n        significantly related to access to job opportunities for \n        communities reliant on mass transit.\n            (12) African-Americans, Latinos, and Asian-Americans are \n        more likely to rely on mass transit to get to work and school \n        than Caucasians and, in urban areas, people of color comprise \n        62 percent of all bus riders, 35 percent of all subway riders, \n        and 29 percent of all commuter rail riders.\n            (13) Exposure to pollutants associated with highway, \n        freight facility, and other transportation investments varies \n        by race, color, and national origin, with African-Americans and \n        Latinos disproportionately exposed to harmful air pollutants \n        associated with highways and freeways.\n            (14) Only 6 percent of the roughly 8,000,000 people \n        employed in the construction industry are African-American, \n        which results in African-American workers being less likely to \n        be hired on transportation projects.\n            (15) Racial and ethnic minorities are underrepresented in \n        transportation decisionmaking bodies, as 88 percent of the \n        voting members of the 50 largest metropolitan planning \n        organizations in the United States are Caucasian, 7 percent are \n        African-American, 3 percent are Latino, and one percent are \n        Asian or Pacific Islander, and minorities are underrepresented \n        in State departments of transportation in almost all workforce \n        categories, including the officials and administrators who lead \n        those organizations and make hiring decisions.\n\nSEC.
