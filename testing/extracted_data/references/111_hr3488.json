FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) More than two-thirds of all petroleum used in the \n        United States for transportation is imported petroleum.\n            (2) In 1993, to make the United States economically secure, \n        to lessen petroleum dependence, and to reduce tailpipe and \n        greenhouse gas emissions, the Department of Energy established \n        the Clean Cities program.\n            (3) The program, a partnership between public and private \n        entities, is now the Department of Energy's flagship \n        transportation deployment and petroleum fuel reduction program.\n            (4) The program is based on the concept that Federal \n        support can empower local citizens and organizations to become \n        the leaders of a national movement for change.\n            (5) The program established a national network of nearly 90 \n        coalitions comprised of local partnerships located in \n        communities representing three-quarters of the population of \n        the United States, with nearly 5,700 stakeholders from local \n        businesses, State and local governments, the transportation \n        industry, community organizations, and alternative fuel \n        providers.\n            (6) In the past 10 years, the program has provided \n        $43,000,000 in competitive grant funds, which were leveraged \n        into $214,000,000 in matching funds from other organizations, \n        and the coalitions stretched these dollars even further by \n        obtaining an additional $845,000,000 in funding since 1993.\n            (7) Marking more than 15 years of progress, the Clean \n        Cities program coalitions have reduced petroleum use by more \n        than 2,000,000,000 gallons, placed 500,000 alternative fuel \n        vehicles on the road, established alternative fuel \n        infrastructure in thousands of strategic locations, and moved \n        alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles into the \n        mainstream.\n            (8) The program is ideally positioned to lead the United \n        States toward a clean, secure, and environmentally friendly \n        transportation future.\n\nSEC. 3. CLEAN CITIES PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Authorization.--The Secretary of Energy shall carry out the \nClean Cities program to encourage and accelerate the use of non-\npetroleum based fuels, alternative fuel vehicles, and other advanced \nvehicle technologies and practices that achieve significant reduction \nin the overall use of petroleum in the transportation sector.
