FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n        (1) the British invasion of Maryland and Washington, District \n    of Columbia, during the War of 1812 marks a defining period in the \n    history of our Nation, the only occasion on which the United States \n    of America has been invaded by a foreign power;\n        (2) the Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail traces the \n    arrival of the British fleet in the Patuxent River in Calvert \n    County and St. Mary's County, Maryland, the landing of British \n    forces at Benedict, the sinking of the Chesapeake Flotilla at Pig \n    Point in Prince George's County and Anne Arundel County, Maryland, \n    the American defeat at the Battle of Bladensburg, the siege of the \n    Nation's Capital, Washington, District of Columbia (including the \n    burning of the United States Capitol and the White House), the \n    British naval diversions in the upper Chesapeake Bay leading to the \n    Battle of Caulk's Field in Kent County, Maryland, the route of the \n    American troops from Washington through Georgetown, the Maryland \n    Counties of Montgomery, Howard, and Baltimore, and the City of \n    Baltimore, Maryland, to the Battle of North Point, and the ultimate \n    victory of the Americans at Fort McHenry on September 14, 1814, \n    where a distinguished Maryland lawyer and poet, Francis Scott Key, \n    wrote the words that captured the essence of our national struggle \n    for independence, words that now serve as our national anthem, the \n    Star-Spangled Banner; and\n        (3) the designation of this route as a national historic \n    trail--\n            (A) would serve as a reminder of the importance of the \n        concept of liberty to all who experience the Star-Spangled \n        Banner National Historic Trail; and\n            (B) would give long overdue recognition to the patriots \n        whose determination to stand firm against enemy invasion and \n        bombardment preserved this liberty for future generations of \n        Americans.\n\nSEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF TRAIL FOR STUDY.\n\n    Section 5(c) of the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. 1244(c)) \nis amended--\n        (1) by redesignating paragraph (36) (as added by section 3 of \n    the El Camino Real Para Los Texas Study Act of 1993 (107 Stat. \n    1497)) as paragraph (37) and in subparagraph (C) by striking \n    ``detemine'' and inserting ``determine'';\n        (2) by designating the paragraphs relating to the Old Spanish \n    Trail and the Great Western Scenic Trail as paragraphs (38) and \n    (39), respectively; and\n        (3) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(40) Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail.--\n        ``(A) In general.--The Star-Spangled Banner National Historic \n    Trail, tracing the War of 1812 route from the arrival of the \n    British fleet in the Patuxent River in Calvert County and St. \n    Mary's County, Maryland, the landing of the British forces at \n    Benedict, the sinking of the Chesapeake Flotilla at Pig Point, the \n    American defeat at the Battle of Bladensburg, the siege of the \n    Nation's Capital, Washington, District of Columbia (including the \n    burning of the United States Capitol and the White House), the \n    British naval diversions in the upper Chesapeake Bay leading to the \n    Battle of Caulk's Field in Kent County, Maryland, the route of the \n    American troops from Washington through Georgetown, the Maryland \n    Counties of Montgomery, Howard, and Baltimore, and the City of \n    Baltimore, Maryland, to the Battle of North Point, and the ultimate \n    victory of the Americans at Fort McHenry on September 14, 1814.\n        ``(B) Affected areas.--The trail crosses eight counties within \n    the boundaries of the State of Maryland, the City of Baltimore, \n    Maryland, and Washington, District of Columbia.\n        ``(C) Coordination with other congressionally mandated \n    activities.--The study under this paragraph shall be undertaken in \n    coordination with the study authorized under section 603 of the \n    Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 (16 U.S.C. \n    1a-5 note; 110 Stat. 4172) and the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and \n    Watertrails Network authorized under the Chesapeake Bay Initiative \n    Act of 1998 (16 U.S.C. 461 note; 112 Stat. 2961).
