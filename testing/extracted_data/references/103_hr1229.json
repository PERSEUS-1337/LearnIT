    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Aviation Research and \nCompetitiveness Act of 1993''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) for every dollar increase in shipments of United States \n        aircraft internationally, the United States economy output \n        increases by an estimated $2.30;\n            (2) for every $1,000,000,000 of aircraft shipments \n        internationally, nearly 35,000 jobs are created;\n            (3) many of the advanced aviation technologies developed by \n        the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of \n        Defense have application in security, safety, capacity, \n        communications, and air traffic control;\n            (4) a decrease in military aviation programs will have a \n        negative impact on civil aviation programs;\n            (5) research programs at the Federal Aviation \n        Administration have potential applications in both civil and \n        military aviation;\n            (6) joint technology development programs among the \n        Department of Defense, the Federal Aviation Administration, and \n        industry would allow for transferring skills and technologies \n        from the defense to the civilian aviation sector and would \n        allow for the transfer back to defense, when necessary; and\n            (7) such joint programs could allow for the Department of \n        Defense contribution to the programs to be phased out over 5 \n        years, which would allow the defense industry to make the \n        transfer to the civilian aviation sector and produce needed \n        aviation technology.\n\nSEC. 3. JOINT AVIATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Administrator and the Secretary shall \njointly establish a program for the purpose of conducting research on \naviation technologies that have application to both military and civil \naviation vehicles and airports and that enhance United States \ncompetitiveness. Such program shall include research on--\n            (1) next-generation satellite communications, including \n        global positioning satellites;\n            (2) advanced airport and airplane security;\n            (3) environmentally compatible technologies, including \n        technologies that limit or reduce noise and air pollution; and\n            (4) advanced aviation safety programs.\n    (b) Contracts and Grants.--Contracts and grants entered into under \nthe program established under subsection (a) shall be administered \nusing procedures developed jointly by the Secretary and the \nAdministrator. These procedures should include an integrated \nacquisition policy for contract and grant requirements and for \ntechnical data rights that are not an impediment to joint programs \namong the Department of Defense, the Federal Aviation Administration, \nand industry.\n\nSEC. 4. JOINT AVIATION RESEARCH PLAN.\n\n    (a) Requirement.--Within 180 days after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Administrator and the Secretary, in consultation with the \nadvisory committee, shall prepare and transmit to Congress a national \naviation research plan setting forth the research and development that \nthe Administrator and the Secretary consider necessary to advance \naviation technologies over the 5-year period beginning in fiscal year \n1993.\n    (b) Objectives of Plan.--The objectives of the plan prepared under \nsubsection (a) shall include--\n            (1) selected programs that jointly enhance public and \n        private aviation technology development;\n            (2) an opportunity for private defense contractors to be \n        involved in transition activities to the civilian sector; and\n            (3) the transfer of Federal Government-developed \n        technologies to the private sector to promote economic strength \n        and competitiveness.\n    (c) Contents of Plan.--The plan prepared under subsection (a) shall \ninclude--\n            (1) for the first year, detailed objectives and estimates \n        of the schedule, cost, and manpower levels for each research \n        project, and a description of the scope and content of each \n        major contract or grant;\n            (2) for the second through fifth years, estimates of the \n        total cost of each major project for such year and a list of \n        all major research projects which may be required to meet the \n        objectives;\n            (3) a 5-year schedule for the decrease of Federal \n        contribution and corresponding increase in private sector \n        contributions for the research and development program; and\n            (4) the portion of the Federal contribution that each \n        Federal agency will contribute.\n    (d) Annual Update.--The plan prepared under subsection (a) shall be \nupdated annually, to reflect changes in global aviation technologies \nand United States competitiveness.\n\nSEC. 5.
