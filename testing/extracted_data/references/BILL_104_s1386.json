FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) section 3 of the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (15 \n        U.S.C. 205a)--\n                    (A) sets forth the policy of the United States to \n                convert to the metric system; and\n                    (B) provides that each Federal agency use the \n                metric system of measurement in its procurements, \n                grants, and other business-related activities, except \n                to the extent that use is impractical or is likely to \n                cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to \n                United States firms, such as when foreign competitors \n                are producing competing products in nonmetric units;\n            (2) as of the date of enactment of this Act, Federal \n        construction contracting officers are requiring some industries \n        to implement a hard-metric conversion, which uses metric \n        dimensions, but also requires retooling and other substantial \n        capitalization costs and other expensive production changes to \n        physically change the size of a product, without regard to \n        whether that method is--\n                    (A) impractical; or\n                    (B) likely to cause significant inefficiencies or a \n                loss of markets to United States firms;\n            (3) as of the date of enactment of this Act, contracting \n        officers of many Federal agencies are requiring some industries \n        to use the hard-metric method of conversion, only for the \n        additional purpose of achieving rounded numbers;\n            (4) a small number of domestic industries that manufacture \n        basic construction products would suffer great upheaval by \n        being forced to either--\n                    (A) convert to hard-metric production; or\n                    (B) be foreclosed from effectively bidding on \n                federally owned or assisted projects;\n            (5) the huge capitalization costs and manufacturing \n        problems caused by hard-metric conversion could force many \n        small businesses out of the market for contracts with the \n        Federal Government;\n            (6) hard-metric conversion could--\n                    (A) place domestic producers at a competitive \n                disadvantage with respect to foreign producers;\n                    (B) dramatically reduce--\n                            (i) the number of companies that may \n                        compete for contracts with the Federal \n                        Government; and\n                            (ii) competition for bids; and\n                    (C) force manufacturers to maintain double \n                inventories of similar but incompatible products;\n            (7) as a result of the higher costs of products produced as \n        a result of hard-metric conversion, the Federal Government is \n        often required to pay what is known as a metric premium to \n        procure hard-metric products;\n            (8) the taxpayers of the United States oppose paying a \n        metric premium for hard-metric conversion at a time when budget \n        constraints are causing cutbacks in social services programs \n        with a higher priority;\n            (9) soft-metric conversion is less costly and less \n        intrusive than hard-metric conversion, as the product remains \n        the same size over the course of the conversion, but is \n        expressed in metric dimensions; and\n            (10) in many cases, because the production of a product \n        using a soft-metric conversion uses metric units without a \n        federally mandated change in the size or production of that \n        product, metric conversion may be achieved without causing \n        excessive economic upheaval with respect to domestic industries \n        and small businesses.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Section 4 of the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (15 U.S.C. 205c) is \namended--\n            (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (3);\n            (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (4); and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n            ``(5) `hard-metric product' means a material or product (or \n        type of product) that is produced as a result of a hard-metric \n        conversion;\n            ``(6) `hard-metric conversion' means a conversion that \n        requires, in addition to the expression of the dimensions of a \n        product under the metric system of measurement, a physical \n        change in the size of that product relative to the size of that \n        product established under existing production practices or \n        capabilities of the appropriate industry;\n            ``(7) `industry' has the meaning provided that term by the \n        Board;\n            ``(8) `soft-metric product' means a material or product (or \n        type of product) that is produced as a result of a soft-metric \n        conversion;\n            ``(9) `soft-metric conversion' means a conversion that is \n        based on the expression of the dimension of a product under the \n        metric system of measurement without changing the physical size \n        of the product relative to the size of that product established \n        under existing production practices or capabilities of the \n        appropriate industry; and\n            ``(10) `small business' has the meaning provided that term \n        by the Board.''.\n\nSEC. 4. METRIC CONVERSION.\n\n    Section 12 of the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (15 U.S.C. 205j-1) \nis amended by adding at the end the following new subsections:\n    ``(c) Beginning on the date of enactment of this subsection, no \nagency of the Federal Government may--\n            ``(1) develop, implement, or continue the use of \n        construction design or procurement guidelines to carry out the \n        policy set forth in paragraph (2) of section 3 that require the \n        use of a hard-metric conversion or a hard-metric product; or\n            ``(2) establish or apply any bidding requirement or \n        preference with respect to any federally assisted construction \n        contract that mandates the use of a hard-metric product, if--\n                    ``(A) the production of a soft-metric product is \n                technologically feasible; and\n                    ``(B) the appropriate representative (as determined \n                by the head of the Federal agency involved pursuant to \n                subsection (d)) of the industry that manufactures the \n                product or type of product that would otherwise be \n                subject to a hard-metric conversion certifies that--\n                            ``(i)(I) that product or type of product is \n                        not readily available as a hard-metric product \n                        from 50 percent or more of the domestic \n                        manufacturers in the United States; or\n                            ``(II) a hard-metric product does not \n                        constitute 50 percent or more of the total \n                        production of that product or type of product \n                        by that industry;\n                            ``(ii) a hard-metric conversion would \n                        require manufacturers that are small businesses \n                        that produce that product or type of product to \n                        incur capital outlays in an amount greater than \n                        $25,000 per manufacturer to invest in new \n                        equipment to produce a hard-metric product that \n                        would otherwise be required to carry out that \n                        federally assisted construction contract; and\n                            ``(iii)(I) based on the economic situation \n                        and customs of the industry, any potential \n                        offsetting trade benefits that could be \n                        achieved by that industry by carrying out a \n                        hard-metric conversion to produce that product \n                        or type of products would be negligible;\n                            ``(II) hard-metric conversion would--\n                                    ``(aa) substantially reduce \n                                competition for federally assisted \n                                projects; or\n                                    ``(bb) increase the per unit cost \n                                of that product that taxpayers would \n                                pay; or\n                            ``(III) hard-metric conversion would create \n                        a special hardship with respect to domestic \n                        manufacturers that are small businesses by \n                        placing those domestic manufacturers at a \n                        competitive disadvantage with respect to \n                        foreign competitors.\n    ``(d)(1) The head of each agency of the Federal Government shall \nestablish a list of appropriate representatives of an industry that may \nmake a certification under subsection (c)(2)(B)(i).
