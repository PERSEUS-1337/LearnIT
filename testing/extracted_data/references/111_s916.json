SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Ed Walker Memorial Act for \nImprovements to the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \nProgram''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Beginning in the mid-1940s, workers at hundreds of \n        facilities owned by the Federal Government and entities in the \n        private sector produced and processed radioactive materials for \n        use in the nuclear weapons program of the United States.\n            (2) Those workers at nuclear weapons facilities helped to \n        build the nuclear arsenal that served as a deterrent to the \n        Soviet Union during the Cold War, but many of those workers \n        paid a high price in terms of their health.\n            (3) During the Cold War, many workers at nuclear weapons \n        facilities were exposed to radiation and placed in harm's way \n        by the Department of Energy and contractors, subcontractors, \n        and vendors of the Department--\n                    (A) without the knowledge and consent of the \n                workers;\n                    (B) without adequate radiation monitoring; and\n                    (C) without necessary protections from internal or \n                external occupational radiation exposures.\n            (4) Because of the inequities described in paragraph (3) \n        and the resulting potential harm to workers employed at nuclear \n        weapons facilities, Congress designated classes of Cold War-era \n        workers at the Paducah, Kentucky, Portsmouth, Ohio, Oak Ridge \n        K-25, and Amchitka Island test sites as members of the Special \n        Exposure Cohort under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \n        Compensation Program Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.).\n            (5) The contribution of the State of New York to the \n        security of the United States throughout the Cold War was very \n        significant.\n            (6) Thirty-six former atomic weapons employer facilities or \n        Department of Energy facilities that produced and processed \n        radioactive materials, carried out classified research, \n        operated nuclear reactors, and processed high level nuclear \n        waste are located in New York. Fourteen of those facilities are \n        located in the western region of New York.\n            (7) Research by the Department of Energy, the National \n        Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Advisory \n        Board on Radiation and Worker Health, and congressional \n        committees indicates that--\n                    (A) workers at certain atomic weapons employer \n                facilities and Department of Energy facilities were not \n                adequately monitored for internal or external exposures \n                to ionizing radiation to which the workers were exposed \n                during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s; and\n                    (B) at other facilities, records were not \n                maintained, or the records from those facilities are \n                not reliable or failed to measure the radioactive \n                isotopes to which workers were exposed.\n            (8) No personal radiation dosimetry monitoring records are \n        available from the Bethlehem Steel site in Lackawanna, New \n        York, which falls within the definition of an atomic weapons \n        employer facility under section 3621 of the Energy Employees \n        Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (42 \n        U.S.C. 7384l).\n            (9) Section 3626(b) of the Energy Employees Occupational \n        Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384q(b)) \n        authorizes the President, upon the recommendation of the \n        Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health, to designate \n        additional classes of employees in the Special Exposure Cohort \n        if it is not feasible to estimate with sufficient accuracy the \n        radiation dose that the class received and there is a \n        reasonable likelihood that the radiation dose may have \n        endangered the health of members of the class.\n            (10) On May 28, 2004, the Secretary of Health and Human \n        Services issued a final rule establishing procedures for \n        designating additional classes of employees in the Special \n        Exposure Cohort (69 Fed. Reg. 30,764).\n            (11) Legislation is needed to provide additional parameters \n        to the President, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \n        and the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health for \n        evaluating petitions for inclusion in the Special Exposure \n        Cohort of classes of employees with respect to which there was \n        limited or nonexistent individual radiation exposure monitoring \n        or an absence of records.\n\nSEC. 3.
