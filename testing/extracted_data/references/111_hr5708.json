    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Urban Jobs Act of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) One-third of minority youth are unemployed.\n            (2) The labor force participation rate for persons without \n        a high school diploma is 20 percentage points lower than the \n        labor force participation rate for high school graduates.\n            (3) Nationally, approximately 70 percent of all students \n        graduate from high school, but African-American and Hispanic \n        students have a 55 percent or less chance of graduating from \n        high school.\n            (4) High school dropouts from the class of 2004 will cost \n        the Nation more than $325 billion in lost wages, taxes, and \n        productivity over their lifetimes.\n            (5) Only 52 percent of students in the 50 largest cities in \n        the United States graduate from high school. That rate is below \n        the national high school graduation rate of 70 percent, and \n        also falls short of the 60 percent average for urban districts \n        across the Nation.\n            (6) Over his or her lifetime, a high school dropout earns, \n        on average, about $260,000 less than a high school graduate, \n        and about $1 million less than a college graduate.\n            (7) Approximately 75 percent of State prison inmates and 59 \n        percent of Federal prison inmates have not completed high \n        school. Increasing the high school completion rate by 1 percent \n        for all men ages 20 to 60 would save the United States $1.4 \n        billion annually in reduced costs associated with crime.\n            (8) According to a recent study, a 10 percent increase in \n        the male high school graduation rate would reduce arrest rates \n        for murder and assault by about 20 percent, motor vehicle theft \n        by 13 percent, and arson by 8 percent.\n            (9) The National Urban League is a historic civil rights \n        organization dedicated to economic empowerment in order to \n        elevate the standard of living in historically underserved \n        urban communities. Founded in 1910 and headquartered in New \n        York City, the National Urban League spearheads the efforts of \n        its local affiliates through the development of programs, \n        public policy research, and advocacy.\n            (10) There are more than 100 local affiliates of the \n        National Urban League located in 36 States and the District of \n        Columbia, providing direct services that impact and improve the \n        lives of more than 2 million people nationwide. Local National \n        Urban League affiliates operate programs that focus on \n        education, job training and placement, housing, business \n        development, and many other important initiatives.\n            (11) The National Urban League has a history of success in \n        implementing national programs through its local affiliate \n        network. From 2007 to 2010, 27 local National Urban League \n        affiliates served at-risk young adults by providing job skills \n        training, community service opportunities, and employment for \n        over 3,500 young adults ages 18 to 24.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide adequate \nresources for the National Urban League (acting through local National \nUrban League affiliates) to reduce the disproportionate incarceration \nof minority youth and to prepare eligible young adults for entry into \nthe world of work by providing a comprehensive set of services that \nincludes job training, education, and support services.\n\nSEC. 3. URBAN JOBS PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subtitle D of title I of the Workforce Investment \nAct of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 2911 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating section 174 as section 175;\n            (2) in section 173, by striking ``174'' each place it \n        appears and inserting ``175''; and\n            (3) by inserting after section 173A the following:\n\n``SEC. 174.
