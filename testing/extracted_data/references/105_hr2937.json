    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Electronic Financial Services \nEfficiency Act of 1997''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In recent years, new technological applications have \n        had a significant impact on bank capital markets and the manner \n        in which business enterprises and financial institutions \n        conduct their activities and operations.\n            (2) Financial and consumer transactions and communications \n        are being conducted in digital electronic formats because of \n        the adoption of new technological applications which allow for \n        the instantaneous retrieval and transmission of information and \n        the electronic consummation of business and personal \n        transactions.\n            (3) These changes relate not only to the creation, \n        retention, and delivery of documentation and other data, but \n        also to the purchase and sale of goods and services, the \n        receipt and payment of funds, and other aspects of commerce and \n        finance.-\n            (4) These developments have allowed for the emergence of a \n        new electronic commerce infrastructure for consumer and \n        financial communications and transactions, and the concomitant \n        emergence of electronic authentication methodologies.\n            (5) These new technologies have impacted, and will continue \n        to impact, the national payment system, our financial services \n        industry, and our Nation's capital markets.\n            (6) Parties to consumer and financial transactions have \n        heretofore entered into agreements, consistent with paper-based \n        authentication methodologies.\n            (7) Thus, where the formation of agreements are otherwise \n        valid and effective under applicable law, the parties should be \n        able to use electronic authentication methodologies of equal or \n        greater reliability.\n            (8) Given the size and importance of our domestic economy \n        and the fact that electronic commerce is not limited by \n        geographical or national boundaries and will have a significant \n        impact on international finance, the United States should be \n        actively involved in the development of uniform global \n        standards for electronic authentication.\n            (9) There are many industries that have the technical \n        expertise, can meet proposed national standards, and have the \n        desire to offer electronic authentication services. Therefore, \n        it is important not to prematurely limit market access and \n        stifle growth by narrowly defining industries that may provide \n        electronic authentication services.\n            (10) As a result, it is appropriate for Congress to enable \n        a framework whereby government, business enterprises, financial \n        institutions, and consumers can participate in electronic \n        commerce in a viable, safe, efficient, and consistent manner.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for the \nrecognition of digital and other forms of authentication as an \nalternative to existing paper-based methods, to improve efficiency and \nsoundness of the Nation's capital markets and payment system, and to \ndefine and harmonize the practices, customs, and uses applicable to the \nconduct of electronic authentication.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act, the following definitions shall apply:\n            (1) Electronic commerce.--The term ``electronic commerce'' \n        means the transaction or conduct of business in whole or part \n        by electronic means.\n            (2) Electronic means.--The term ``electronic means'' \n        includes all forms of electronic communication mediated by \n        computer, including telephonic communications, facsimile, \n        electronic mail, electronic data exchanges, satellite, cable, \n        and fiber optic communications.\n            (3) Electronic authentication.--The term ``electronic \n        authentication'' means any methodology, technology, or \n        technique intended to--\n                    (A) establish the identity of the maker, sender, or \n                originator of a document or communication in electronic \n                commerce; and\n                    (B) establish the fact that the document or \n                communication has not been altered.\n            (4) Digital signature.--The term ``digital signature'' \n        means any electronic symbol or series of symbols, created, or \n        processed by a computer, intended by the party using it (or \n        authorizing its use) to have the same legal force and effect as \n        a manual signature.\n            (5) Certification authority.--The term ``certification \n        authority'' means any private or public entity which provides \n        assurance that a particular digital signature, or other form of \n        electronic authentication, is tied to the identity of an \n        individual or legal entity, or attests to the current validity \n        of such a signature.\n            (6) Trusted third party.--The term ``trusted third party'' \n        means a certification authority who is known to 2 transacting \n        parties and whose certificate is relied upon by those parties.\n            (7) Certificate.--The term ``certificate'' is an electronic \n        message the contents of which enable the recipient to determine \n        the attestation made regarding the certificate holder by the \n        certification authority.\n            (8) State.--The term ``State'' has the meaning given to \n        such term in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.\n            (9) Affiliate.--The term ``affiliate'' means any person \n        that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control \n        with another person.\n\nSEC. 4. COMMUNICATIONS WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES.\n\n    In any written communication with an agency, department, or \ninstrumentality of the United States Government, or with any court of \nthe United States, in which a signature is required or used, any party \nto the communication may affix a signature by use of a digital \nsignature with a certificate issued by a trusted third party.\n\nSEC. 5. VALIDITY OF ELECTRONIC AUTHENTICATION.\n\n    (a) Validity of Electronic Communications with Agencies, Courts, \nand Instrumentalities of the United States.--All forms of electronic \nauthentication that comport with standards as described in subsections \n(a) and (b) of section 6 of this Act shall have standing equal to \npaper-based, written signatures, such that, with respect to any \ncommunications with Federal administrative agencies, Federal courts and \nother instrumentalities of the United States government--\n            (1) any rule of law which requires a record to be in \n        writing shall be deemed satisfied; and\n            (2) any rule of law which requires a signature shall be \n        deemed satisfied.\n    (b) Validity of Electronic Communications in General.--Unless \notherwise expressly prohibited by the laws of any State, all forms of \nelectronic authentication that comport with the standards as described \nin subsections (a) and (b) of section 6 shall have standing equal to \npaper-based, written signatures, such that--\n            (1) any rule of law which requires a record to be in \n        writing shall be deemed satisfied; and\n            (2) any rule of law which requires a signature shall be \n        deemed satisfied.-\n\nSEC. 6. CRITERIA FOR ELIGIBILITY.\n\n    (a) Electronic Authentication.--Electronic authentication \ntechnology shall be deemed valid hereunder if such technology--\n            (1) reliably establishes the identity of the maker, sender, \n        or originator of a document or communication in electronic \n        commerce; and\n            (2) reliably establishes the fact that the document or \n        communication has not been altered.\n    (b) Emerging Technologies.--2 currently acknowledged signature \ntechnologies are public key cryptography and signature dynamics \ntechnology. In contemplation of acceptance of other technological \napplications, the following criteria shall be applied in the \ndetermination of their validity for purposes of this Act:\n            (1) The identification methodology shall be unique to the \n        person making, sending, originating a document or \n        communication.\n            (2) The identification technology shall be capable of \n        verification.\n            (3) The identification method or device shall be under the \n        sole control of the person using it\n            (4) The identification technology or device shall be linked \n        to data or communication transmitted in such a manner that if \n        such data or communication has been altered, the authentication \n        becomes invalid.\n\nSEC. 7. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFICATION AUTHORITIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--There is hereby established the National \nAssociation of Certification Authorities (hereafter in this section \nreferred to as the ``Association'').\n    (b) Registration.--Any person or group wishing to provide \nelectronic authentication services in the United States shall be a \nregistered member of the Association.\n    (c) Denial of Membership.--\n            (1) Decertification.--The Association may deny membership \n        to any person or group (or any affiliate of such person or \n        group) who has been decertified pursuant to subsection \n        (e)(5)(D)(iii).\n            (2) Failure to comply with code of conduct.--The \n        Association may deny membership to any provider of electronic \n        authentication services who fails to comply with any \n        guidelines, standards, or codes of conduct regarding the use of \n        electronic authentication established by the Electronic \n        Authentications Standards Review Committee pursuant to \n        subsection (e)(2).\n            (3) Failure to meet standards.--The Association may deny \n        membership to any provider of electronic authentication \n        services to any person or group that is unable to meet \n        standards established pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of \n        section 6.\n            (4) Practices inconsistent with this act.--The Association \n        may bar an individual from becoming affiliated with a member of \n        the Association if such individual has engaged in acts or \n        practices inconsistent with this Act and rules established by \n        the Association.\n            (5) Lack of cooperation.--The Association may bar any \n        person or group from becoming affiliated with a member if such \n        person or group does not agree--\n                    (A) to supply the Association with such information \n                with respect to the relationship and dealings of such \n                person or group with the member as may be specified in \n                the rules of the Association; and\n                    (B) to permit examination of the books and records \n                of such person or group to verify the accuracy of any \n                information so supplied.\n    (d) Dues.--The rules of the Association shall provide for the \nequitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among \nmembers and other persons applying for membership or using any facility \nor system which the Association operates or controls.\n    (e) Standards Review Committee.--\n            (1) In general.--The Association shall establish the \n        Electronic Authentications Standards Review Committee \n        (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the ``Standards \n        Review Committee'') which shall establish, develop, and refine \n        criteria to be applied to the emerging electronic \n        authentication industry, including--\n                    (A) the roles and responsibilities of the parties \n                involved in electronic authentication;\n                    (B) the application of the standards described in \n                section 6(b) to emerging electronic authentication;\n                    (C) recognition of foreign legal and regulatory \n                standards;
