    "content": "SECTION 1. CRITICAL ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--\n            (1) The critical electric infrastructure of the United \n        States and Canada has more than $1 trillion in asset value, \n        more than 200,000 miles of transmission lines, and more than \n        800,000 megawatts of generating capability, serving over 300 \n        million people.\n            (2) The effective functioning of this infrastructure is \n        highly dependent on computer-based control systems that are \n        used to monitor and manage sensitive processes and physical \n        functions.\n            (3) These control systems are becoming increasingly \n        connected to open networks, such as corporate intranets and the \n        Internet. According to the Department of Homeland Security's \n        United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (``US-CERT''), \n        this transition towards widely used technologies and open \n        connectivity exposes control systems to the ever-present cyber \n        risks that exist in the information technology world in \n        addition to control system specific risks.\n            (4) Malicious actors pose a significant risk to this \n        infrastructure. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (``FBI'') \n        has identified multiple sources of threats, including foreign \n        nation states, domestic criminals and hackers, and disgruntled \n        employees.\n            (5) Intentional or naturally occurring Electromagnetic \n        Pulse (``EMP'') events also threaten critical electric \n        infrastructure. The Commission to Assess the Threat to the \n        United States from EMP Attack reported in 2008 that an EMP \n        attack could cause significant damage or disruption to critical \n        electric infrastructure and other critical infrastructure due \n        to the widespread use of Supervisory Control and Data \n        Acquisition (``SCADA'') systems. The National Academy of \n        Sciences also reported in 2008 that Severe Space Weather Events \n        could produce similar results.\n            (6) The Department of Homeland Security's Control Systems \n        Security Program is designed to increase the reliability, \n        security, and resilience of control systems to guard against \n        and enhance domestic preparedness for and collective response \n        to a cyber attack by a terrorist or other person. This is done \n        by developing voluntary cyber risk reduction products, \n        supporting the Department of Homeland Security's Industrial \n        Control Systems Computer Emergency Response Team (``ICS-CERT'') \n        in developing vulnerability mitigation recommendations and \n        strategies, and coordinating and leveraging activities for \n        improving the Nation's critical infrastructure security \n        posture.\n            (7) According to recent news reports, the electronic \n        control systems of the electrical system in the United States \n        have been routinely penetrated and compromised. According to \n        current and former national security officials, cyber spies \n        from China, Russia, and other countries have penetrated the \n        United States electrical system in order to map the system, and \n        have left behind software programs that could be used to \n        disrupt and disable the system.\n            (8) In the interest of national security, and to enhance \n        domestic preparedness for and collective response to a cyber \n        attack by a terrorist or other person, a statutory mechanism is \n        necessary to protect the critical electric infrastructure \n        against cyber threats.\n            (9) In spite of existing mandatory cybersecurity standards, \n        a report from the North American Electric Reliability \n        Corporation (``NERC'') suggests that many utilities are \n        underreporting their assets, potentially to avoid compliance \n        requirements. In April 2009, NERC reported that only 23 percent \n        of responding utilities identified a ``Critical Cyber Asset'' \n        as required by NERC Reliability Standard 002-1. According to \n        NERC, the results of this survey suggest that utilities may not \n        have identified certain qualifying assets as ``Critical''. NERC \n        requested that entities take a fresh, comprehensive look at \n        their methodology in order to identify and secure more Critical \n        Cyber Assets.\n            (10) On May 21, 2008, in testimony before the House \n        Committee on Homeland Security, Joseph Kelliher, then-Chairman \n        of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``the \n        Commission''), stated that his agency is in need of additional \n        legal authorities to adequately protect the electric power \n        system against cyber attack.\n    (b) Research on Cyber Compromise of Critical Electric \nInfrastructure.--(1) Pursuant to section 201 of the Homeland Security \nAct of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 121) and in furtherance of domestic preparedness \nfor and collective response to a cyber attack by a terrorist or other \nperson, the Secretary of Homeland Security, working with other national \nsecurity and intelligence agencies, shall conduct research and \ndetermine if the security of federally owned programmable electronic \ndevices and communication networks (including hardware, software, and \ndata) essential to the reliable operation of critical electric \ninfrastructure have been compromised.\n    (2) The scope of the research referred to in paragraph (1) shall \ninclude: the extent of compromise, identification of attackers, the \nmethod of penetration, ramifications of the compromise on future \noperations of critical electric infrastructure, secondary ramifications \nof the compromise on other critical infrastructure sectors and the \nfunctioning of civil society, ramifications of compromise on national \nsecurity, including war fighting capability, and recommended mitigation \nactivities.\n    (3) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall report the findings to \nthe appropriate committees of Congress, including the Committee on \nHomeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee of the Senate. The report \nmay contain a classified annex.\n    (c) Federal Power Act Amendment.--Part II of the Federal Power Act \n(16 U.S.C. 791a and following) is amended by adding the following new \nsections at the end thereof:\n\n``SEC. 224 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.\n\n    ``(a) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n            ``(1) Critical electric infrastructure.--The term `critical \n        electric infrastructure' means systems and assets, whether \n        physical or cyber used for the generation, transmission, \n        distribution, or metering of electric energy that, in the \n        determination of the Commission, in consultation with the \n        Secretary of Homeland Security and other national security \n        agencies, are so vital to the United States that the incapacity \n        or destruction of such systems and assets, either alone or in \n        combination with the failure of other assets, would cause \n        significant harm to the security, national or regional economic \n        security, or national or regional public health or safety.\n            ``(2) Critical electric infrastructure information.--The \n        term `critical electric infrastructure information' means \n        critical infrastructure information related to critical \n        electric infrastructure.\n            ``(3) Critical infrastructure information.--The term \n        `critical infrastructure information' has the same meaning as \n        is given that term in section 212(3) of the Critical \n        Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 131(3)).\n            ``(4) Cyber threat.--The term `cyber threat' means any act \n        by a terrorist or other person that disrupts, attempts to \n        disrupt, or poses a significant risk of disruption to the \n        operation of programmable electronic devices and communication \n        networks (including hardware, software, and data) essential to \n        the reliable operation of critical electric infrastructure.\n            ``(5) Cyber vulnerability.--The term `cyber vulnerability' \n        means any weakness that, if exploited by a terrorist or other \n        person, poses a significant risk of disruption to the operation \n        of programmable electronic devices and communication networks \n        (including hardware, software, and data) essential to the \n        reliable operation of critical electric infrastructure.\n    ``(b) Assessment, Report, and Determination.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Pursuant to section 201 of the Homeland \n        Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 121), the Secretary of Homeland \n        Security shall assess cyber vulnerabilities or threats to \n        critical infrastructure, including critical electric \n        infrastructure and advanced metering infrastructure, on an \n        ongoing basis and produce reports, including recommendations, \n        on a periodic basis for the purposes of homeland security, \n        including the enhancement of domestic preparedness for and \n        collective response to a cyber attack by a terrorist, nation-\n        state, or other person, and for other purposes.\n            ``(2) Elements of the report.--The Secretary shall--\n                    ``(A) include in the reports under this section \n                findings regarding a cyber vulnerability or terrorist \n                threat or potential terrorist threat, and a nation-\n                state threat or potential threat to critical electric \n                infrastructure; and\n                    ``(B) provide recommendations regarding actions \n                that may be performed to enhance individualized and \n                collective domestic preparedness and response to the \n                cyber vulnerability or terrorist or nation-state.\n            ``(3) Transmittal of report.--The Secretary of Homeland \n        Security shall transmit reports prepared in response to the \n        cyber vulnerability or threat to the Commission and the \n        appropriate committees of Congress, including the Committee on \n        Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the \n        Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee of the \n        Senate, of the Secretary's determinations under this section. \n        Each such report may contain a classified annex.\n            ``(4) Timely determination.--If, in carrying out the \n        assessment required under paragraph (1), the Secretary of \n        Homeland Security determines that a significant cyber \n        vulnerability or threat to critical electric infrastructure has \n        been identified, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall \n        communicate such a determination to the Commission in a timely \n        manner. The Secretary of Homeland Security may incorporate \n        intelligence or information received from other national \n        security or intelligence agencies in making such determination.\n    ``(c) Commission Authority.--\n            ``(1) Issuance of rules or orders.--Following receipt of a \n        finding under subsection (b), the Commission shall issue (and \n        from time to time thereafter amend) such rules or orders as are \n        necessary to protect critical electric infrastructure against \n        vulnerabilities or threats.\n            ``(2) Emergency procedures.--The Commission may issue, in \n        consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, a rule or \n        order under this section without prior notice or hearing if it \n        determines the rule or order must be issued immediately to \n        protect critical electric infrastructure from an imminent \n        threat or vulnerability.\n    ``(d) Duration of Emergency Rules or Orders.--Any rule or order \nissued by the Commission without prior notice or hearing under \nsubsection (c)(2) shall remain effective for not more than 90 days \nunless, during such 90 days, the Commission gives interested persons an \nopportunity to submit written data, views, or arguments (with or \nwithout opportunity for oral presentation) and affirms, amends, or \nrepeals the rule or order.\n    ``(e) Jurisdiction.--Notwithstanding section 201, the provisions of \nthis section shall apply to any entity that owns, controls, or operates \ncritical electric infrastructure, and such entities shall be subject to \nthe jurisdiction of the Commission for purposes of carrying out this \nsection and for purposes of applying the enforcement authorities of \nthis Act with respect to such provisions, but shall not make an \nelectric utility or any other entity subject to the jurisdiction of the \nCommission for any other purposes.\n    ``(f) Protection of Critical Electric Infrastructure Information.--\nThe provisions of section 214 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 \nU.S.C. 133) shall apply to critical electric infrastructure information \nsubmitted to the Commission under this section to the same extent that \nthey apply to critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted \nto the Department of Homeland Security under that Act (6 U.S.C. 101 and \nfollowing).\n\n``SEC. 224B.
