Art. 6b. Victims' rights of victims of offenses under this \n              chapter\n    ``(a) Rights.--Any individual who is the victim of an offense under \nthis chapter (the Uniform Code of Military Justice), regardless of \nwhether such individual is a member of the Armed Forces (in this \nsection referred to as a `victim of a military crime'), has the \nfollowing rights:\n            ``(1) The right to be reasonably protected from the \n        accused.\n            ``(2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice \n        of any public proceeding in an investigation under section 832 \n        of this title (article 32), court-martial, involuntary plea \n        hearing, pre-sentencing hearing, or parole hearing involving \n        the offense or of any release or escape of the accused.\n            ``(3) The right not to be excluded from any such public \n        proceeding, referred to in paragraph (2) unless the military \n        judge, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, \n        determines that testimony by the victim would be materially \n        altered if the victim heard other testimony at that proceeding.\n            ``(4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public \n        proceeding referred to in paragraph (2).\n            ``(5) The reasonable right to confer with the trial counsel \n        in the case.\n            ``(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided \n        in law.\n            ``(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable \n        delay.\n            ``(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with \n        respect for the victim's dignity and privacy.\n    ``(b) Rights Afforded.--In any court-martial proceeding involving \nan offense against a victim of a military crime, the military judge \nshall ensure that the victim is afforded the rights described in \nsubsection (a). Before making a determination described in subsection \n(a)(3), the military judge shall make every effort to permit the \nfullest attendance possible by the victim and shall consider reasonable \nalternatives to the exclusion of the victim from the criminal \nproceeding. The reasons for any decision denying relief under this \nsubsection shall be clearly stated on the record.\n    ``(c) Best Efforts To Accord Rights.--(1) Military judges, trial \nand defense counsel, military criminal investigation organizations, \nservices, and personnel, and other members and personnel of the \nDepartment of Defense engaged in the detection, investigation, or \nprosecution of offenses under this chapter (the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice) shall make their best efforts to see that victims of \nmilitary crimes are notified of, and accorded, the rights described in \nthat subsection.\n    ``(2) The trial counsel in a case shall advise the victim that the \nvictim can seek the advice of an attorney with respect to the rights \ndescribed in subsection (a).\n    ``(3) Notice of release otherwise required pursuant to this chapter \nshall not be given if such notice may endanger the safety of any \nperson.\n    ``(d) Enforcement and Limitations.--(1) A victim of a military \ncrime, the victim's lawful representative, and the trial counsel may \nassert the rights described in subsection (a). A person accused of an \noffense under this chapter (the Uniform Code of Military Justice) may \nnot obtain any form of relief under this section with respect to such \noffense.\n    ``(2) In a case where the military judge finds that the number of \nvictims makes it impracticable to accord all of the victims the rights \ndescribed in subsection (a), the military judge shall fashion a \nreasonable procedure to give effect to this section that does not \nunduly complicate or prolong the proceedings.\n    ``(3) The rights described in subsection (a) shall be asserted in \nthe court-martial in which the accused is being prosecuted for the \noffense. The military judge shall take up and decide any motion \nasserting a victim's right forthwith.

In no \nevent shall proceedings be stayed or subject to a continuance of more \nthan five days for purposes of enforcing this section. If the Court of \nCriminal Appeals denies the relief sought, the reasons for the denial \nshall be clearly stated on the record in a written opinion.\n    ``(4) In any appeal in a case under this chapter (the Uniform Code \nof Military Justice), the Government may assert as error the military \njudge's denial of any victim's right in the proceeding to which the \nappeal relates.\n    ``(5) In no case shall a failure to afford a right under this \nsection provide grounds for a new trial. A victim may make a motion to \nre-open a plea or sentence only if--\n            ``(A) the victim has asserted the right to be heard before \n        or during the proceeding at issue and such right was denied;\n            ``(B) the victim petitions the Court of Criminal Appeals \n        for a writ of mandamus within 14 days; and\n            ``(C) in the case of a plea, the accused has not pled to \n        the highest offense charged.\n    ``(6) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize a \ncause of action for damages or to create, to enlarge, or to imply any \nduty or obligation to any victim or other person for the breach of \nwhich the United States or any of its officers or employees could be \nheld liable in damages. Nothing in this section shall be construed to \nimpair the prosecutorial discretion of a Judge Advocate General or any \nofficer under his direction.\n    ``(e) Certain Victims.--In the case of a victim of a military crime \nwho is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, \nthe legal guardians of the victim or the representatives of the \nvictim's estate, family members, or any other persons appointed as \nsuitable by the military judge, may assume the victim's rights under \nthis section, but in no event shall an accused be named as such \nguardian or representative.''.\n            (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of sections at the \n        beginning of subchapter I of chapter 47 of such title (the \n        Uniform Code of Military Justice) is amended by adding at the \n        end the following new item:\n\n``806b.
