    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States, the People's Republic of China \n        (China), and the Republic of India (India) account for 35 \n        percent of the world's demand for petroleum. All 3 countries \n        are negatively impacted by high and volatile oil and petroleum \n        prices and have a common interest in avoiding global supply \n        shocks, developing alternative fuel sources, and lessening \n        reliance on supplies of oil and petroleum from unstable regions \n        of the world.\n            (2) China, the United States, and India are respectively \n        the top 3 producers and consumers of coal in the world.\n            (3) The United States, China, and India respectively \n        represent the largest, second largest, and fifth largest \n        electricity generators in the world.\n            (4) China is likely the world's largest source of \n        anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, followed closely by the \n        United States, and India is the world's fifth largest \n        greenhouse gas emitter.\n            (5) According to the World Bank, 16 of the world's 20 most \n        polluted cities are in China. Ninety percent of all rivers in \n        China show signs of significant pollution, and 62 percent of \n        China's waterways are unsuitable for fish. Several areas in \n        India have heavy metal and chemical contamination in \n        concentrations many times higher than international health \n        standards.\n            (6) Given these shared energy challenges, the United \n        States, China, and India have a vested interest in partnering \n        on policies that could help avoid future tensions over limited \n        and geographically constrained energy resources.\n            (7) Mutually beneficial scientific, technological, and \n        trade partnerships between the United States, China, and India \n        can accelerate the transition to more sustainable and secure \n        energy supplies, such as wind, solar, biofuels, and clean coal, \n        and provide tremendous economic, environmental, and security \n        benefits for all 3 nations.\n\nSEC. 2. POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to develop an informed \ndialogue with China and India regarding the sustainable use of energy \nand the protection of the environment, the promotion of best practices \nfor clean energy and technology investments, and the development and \ntransfer of energy and environmental technologies based on fair and \nrobust international trading regimes.\n\nSEC. 3.
