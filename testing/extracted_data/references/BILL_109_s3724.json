FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Ensuring regional diversity in research funding is an \n        essential strategy in strengthening international \n        competitiveness.\n            (2) Economic development in high technology fields is often \n        advanced by industrial partnerships with near by strong \n        research institutions from which companies can acquire \n        intellectual property, highly trained staff, and vital \n        resources.\n            (3) The National Science Foundation is an independent \n        Federal agency created by Congress in 1950 ``to promote the \n        progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity \n        and welfare, and to secure the national defense''.\n            (4) Congress has subsequently directed that, ``it shall be \n        an objective of the Foundation to strengthen research and \n        education in the sciences and engineering, including \n        independent research by individuals, throughout the United \n        States, and to avoid undue concentration of such research and \n        education''.\n            (5) Currently, Foundation research investments are \n        concentrated in a small number of States. In contrast, 25 other \n        States together receive less than 10 percent of the \n        Foundation's research funding, yet these States are home to 20 \n        percent of the population, 25 percent of doctoral/research \n        universities, and 18 percent of academic scientists and \n        engineers.\n            (6) Insufficient research infrastructure diminishes the \n        ability of many universities to compete effectively for \n        research funding, and thereby limits their contributions to \n        regional economic development and international \n        competitiveness.\n            (7) The Foundation's Experimental Program to Stimulate \n        Competitive Research, or EPSCoR, is the primary program by \n        which the Foundation seeks to improve the research \n        infrastructure of institutions in States that presently receive \n        small portions of Foundation funding. EPSCoR is thus an \n        important component of national efforts to increase innovation \n        and improve competitiveness.\n\nSEC. 3. FUNDING.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated to the Foundation for \nEPSCoR--\n            (1) $125,000,000 for fiscal year 2007; and\n            (2) for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2011, an amount \n        equal to the sum of--\n                    (A) $125,000,000; and\n                    (B) $125,000,000 multiplied by a percentage equal \n                to the percentage by which the Foundation's budget \n                request for such fiscal year exceeds the total amount \n                appropriated to the Foundation for fiscal year 2007.\n\nSEC. 4. RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT GRANTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--In the administration of the Foundation's research \ninfrastructure improvement grant program, the Director shall authorize \nStates participating in the grant program to include partnerships with \nout-of-State research institutions if the amount of funding transferred \nto another State does not exceed 5 percent of the amount of the grant \nin any fiscal year.\n    (b) Authorization Level.--From amounts appropriated pursuant to \nsection 3, the Director shall make available to the research \ninfrastructure improvement grant program--\n            (1) $65,000,000 for fiscal year 2007; and\n            (2) for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2011, an amount \n        equal to the sum of--\n                    (A) $75,000,000; and\n                    (B) $75,000,000 multiplied by a percentage equal to \n                the percentage by which the Foundation's budget request \n                for such fiscal year exceeds the total amount \n                appropriated to the Foundation for fiscal year 2007.\n\nSEC. 5. CO-FUNDING.\n\n    (a) In General.--For each of fiscal years 2007 through 2011, the \nDirector shall obligate and expend not less than 20 percent of the \namount available for EPSCoR on co-funding projects that are ranked, by \na peer-review process, in the top 20 percent of all proposals submitted \nin response to an announced competition.\n    (b) Annual Report.--The Director shall submit an annual report to \nthe Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the \nHouse of Representatives Committee on Science that provides information \nabout--\n            (1) co-funded projects on a State-by-State basis for the \n        preceding year; and\n            (2) the amount and use of co-funding by each of the \n        Foundation's directorates for that year.\n\nSEC. 6. CYBER INFRASTRUCTURE.\n\n    Within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \nDirector, through the Office of Cyber Infrastructure, shall develop and \npublish a plan enabling States participating in EPSCoR to participate \nfully in the Foundation's Cyber Infrastructure Initiative.\n\nSEC. 7. MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION.\n\n    Within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \nDirector, through the Office of Major Research Instrumentation, shall \ndevelop and publish a plan enabling States participating in EPSCoR to \ndevelop partnerships and participate fully in the Foundation's major \nresearch instrumentation program.\n\nSEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n        the National Science Foundation.\n            (2) EPSCoR.--The term ``EPSCoR'' means the Experimental \n        Program to Stimulate Competitive Research authorized by section \n        113 of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of \n        1988 (42 U.S.C. 1862g).\n            (3) Foundation.--The term ``Foundation'' means the National \n        Science Foundation.D23/"
