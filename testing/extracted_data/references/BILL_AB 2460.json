declares all of the following:\n(1) California is heavily dependent on natural gas.\n(2) The storage and delivery of natural gas relies on aging infrastructure that is prone to leaks that can damage the environment and imperil public health.\n(3) Natural gas is a fossil fuel and a major source of global warming pollution and the pollutants that cause air pollution, including smog.\n(4) California\u2019s growing population and economy will put a strain on energy supplies and threaten the ability of the state to meet its global warming goals unless specific steps are taken to reduce demand and generate energy cleanly and efficiently.\n(5) Water heating for domestic and industrial use relies almost entirely on natural gas and accounts for a significant percentage of the state\u2019s natural gas consumption.\n(6) Solar thermal systems represent the major untapped natural gas saving potential in California.\n(7) In addition to financial and energy savings, solar water heating systems can help protect against future gas and electricity shortages and reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy.\n(8) Solar thermal systems can also help preserve the environment and protect public health by reducing air pollution, including carbon dioxide, a leading global warming gas, and nitrogen oxide, a precursor to smog.\n(9) Growing demand for these technologies will create jobs in California as well as promote greater energy independence, protect consumers from rising energy costs, and result in cleaner air.\n(10) Installing solar thermal systems in disadvantaged communities can provide local economic benefits while advancing the state\u2019s clean energy goals and policies to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases.\n(11) It is in the interest of the State of California to promote solar thermal systems and other technologies that directly reduce demand for natural gas in homes and businesses.\n(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to build a mainstream market for solar thermal systems that directly reduces demand for natural gas in homes, businesses, schools, industrial and government buildings, and buildings occupied by nonprofit organizations.\n(c) It is the intent of the Legislature that the solar thermal system incentives created by this article should lead to cost-effective investments by gas customers. Gas customers will recoup the cost of these investments through lower energy bills as a result of avoiding purchases of natural gas.\nSEC. 4.\nSection 2863 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:\n2863.\n(a) By July 31, 2017, the commission shall do all of the following:\n(1) Implement changes to the program as authorized pursuant to this section as it read on December 31, 2016, applicable to the service territories of a gas corporation to promote the installation of solar thermal systems in homes, businesses, and buildings or facilities of eligible customer classes receiving natural gas service throughout the state. Eligible customer classes shall include single-family and multifamily residential, commercial, industrial, governmental, nonprofit, and primary, secondary, and postsecondary educational customers.
