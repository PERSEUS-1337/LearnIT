FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On January 10, 1994, the leaders of the NATO member \n        nations meeting in Brussels, Belgium, issued an invitation to \n        European countries that do not belong to NATO to participate in \n        a program of expanded cooperation with NATO called the \n        Partnership for Peace.\n            (2) In that invitation, the leaders of the NATO member \n        nations stated: ``We reaffirm that the Alliance, as provided in \n        Article 10 of the Washington Treaty, remains open to the \n        membership of other European states in a position to further \n        the principles of the Treaty and to contribute to the security \n        of the North Atlantic area. We expect and would welcome NATO \n        expansion that would reach to democratic states to our East, as \n        part of an evolutionary process, taking into account political \n        and security developments in the whole of Europe.''.\n            (3) The political and economic transformation of the \n        formerly communist-ruled countries of Europe has been under way \n        since 1989. In establishing a new Strategic Concept for NATO in \n        November 1991, the leaders of the NATO member nations observed: \n        ``All the countries that were formerly adversaries of NATO have \n        dismantled the Warsaw Pact and rejected ideological hostility \n        to the West. They have in varying degrees, embraced and begun \n        to implement policies aimed at achieving pluralistic democracy, \n        the rule of law, respect for human rights and a market \n        economy.''.\n            (4) In particular, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and \n        Slovakia have made significant progress toward establishing \n        democratic institutions, free market economies, civilian \n        control of their armed forces, and the rule of law since the \n        fall of their previous communist governments.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) the leaders of the NATO member nations are to be \n        commended for reaffirming that NATO membership remains open to \n        European countries emerging from communist domination and for \n        welcoming eventual expansion of NATO to include such countries;\n            (2) Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia \n        should be in a position to further the principles of the North \n        Atlantic Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North \n        Atlantic area not later than January 10, 1999, 5 years from the \n        date of the establishment of the Partnership for Peace, and, in \n        accordance with Article 10 of such Treaty, should be invited to \n        become full NATO members not later than that date, provided \n        these countries--\n                    (A) maintain their progress toward establishing \n                democratic institutions, free market economies, \n                civilian control of their armed forces, and the rule of \n                law; and\n                    (B) remain committed to protecting the rights of \n                all their citizens and respecting the territorial \n                integrity of their neighbors;\n            (3) the United States, other NATO member nations, and NATO \n        itself should furnish appropriate assistance to facilitate the \n        transition of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia \n        to full NATO membership not later than January 10, 1999; and\n            (4) other European countries emerging from communist \n        domination may be in a position at a future date to further the \n        principles of the North Atlantic Treaty and to contribute to \n        the security of the North Atlantic area, and at the appropriate \n        time they should receive assistance to facilitate their \n        transition to full NATO membership and should be invited to \n        become full NATO members.\n\nSEC. 4.
