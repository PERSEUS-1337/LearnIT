    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Mandates Information Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) before acting on proposed private sector mandates, \n        Congress should carefully consider their effects on consumers, \n        workers, and small businesses;\n            (2) Congress has often acted without adequate information \n        concerning the costs of private sector mandates, instead \n        focusing only on their benefits;\n            (3) the implementation of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n        of 1995 has resulted in increased awareness of \n        intergovernmental mandates without impacting existing \n        environmental, public health, or safety laws or regulations;\n            (4) the implementation of this Act will enhance the \n        awareness of prospective mandates on the private sector without \n        adversely affecting the environment, public health, or safety \n        laws or regulations;\n            (5) the costs of private sector mandates are often borne in \n        part by consumers, in the form of higher prices and reduced \n        availability of goods and services;\n            (6) the costs of private sector mandates are often borne in \n        part by workers, in the form of lower wages, reduced benefits, \n        and fewer job opportunities; and\n            (7) the costs of private sector mandates are often borne in \n        part by small businesses, in the form of hiring disincentives \n        and stunted economic growth.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to improve the quality of Congress' deliberation with \n        respect to proposed mandates on the private sector, by--\n                    (A) providing Congress with more complete \n                information about the effects of such mandates; and\n                    (B) ensuring that Congress acts on such mandates \n                only after focused deliberation on their effects; and\n            (2) to enhance the ability of Congress to distinguish \n        between private sector mandates that harm consumers, workers, \n        and small businesses, and mandates that help those groups.\n\nSEC. 4.
