PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to present the public and Environmental Protection \n        Agency officials with the most scientifically objective \n        information concerning the nature and magnitude of health, \n        safety, and environmental risks in order to provide for sound \n        regulatory decisions and public education;\n            (2) to provide for full consideration and discussion of \n        relevant data and potential methodologies;\n            (3) to require explanation of significant choices in the \n        risk assessment process which will allow for better peer review \n        and public understanding; and\n            (4) to improve consistency within the Environmental \n        Protection Agency in preparing risk assessments and risk \n        characterizations.\n\nSEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE; APPLICABILITY; SAVINGS PROVISIONS.\n\n    (a) Effective Date.--Except as otherwise specifically provided in \nthis Act, the provisions of this Act shall take effect 2 years after \nthe date of enactment of this Act.\n    (b) Applicability.--(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), this \nAct applies to all risk assessments and risk characterizations prepared \nby or on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency in connection \nwith health, safety, and environmental risks.\n    (2) This Act does not apply to risk assessments or risk \ncharacterizations performed with respect to a situation that the \nAdministrator considers to be an emergency.\n    (c) Savings Provisions.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to \nmodify any statutory standard or requirement designed to protect \nhealth, safety, or the environment.\n\nSEC. 4. PRINCIPLES FOR RISK ASSESSMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency shall apply the principles set forth in subsection (b) when \npreparing risk assessments in order to assure that such risk \nassessments and all of their components are, to the maximum extent \npossible, scientifically objective and inclusive of all relevant data. \nDiscussions or explanations required under this section need not be \nrepeated in each risk assessment document as long as there is a \nreference to the relevant discussion or explanation in another agency \ndocument.\n    (b) Principles.--The principles to be applied when preparing risk \nassessments are the following:\n            (1) The Administrator shall explicitly distinguish \n        scientific findings in risk assessments from other \n        considerations affecting the design and choice of regulatory \n        strategies.\n            (2) The Administrator shall consider and discuss both \n        negative and positive laboratory or epidemiological data of \n        sufficient quality when presenting assessments of human health \n        risks. Where conflicts among such data appear to exist, the \n        assessment shall include discussion of possible reconciliation \n        of conflicting information, which may include differences in \n        study designs, comparative physiology, routes of exposure, \n        bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and any other relevant \n        factor.\n            (3) Where the risk assessment process involves selection of \n        any significant assumption, inference, or model the \n        Administrator shall (A) present a representative list and \n        explanation of plausible and alternative assumptions, \n        inferences, or models; (B) explain the basis for any choices; \n        and (C) identify any policy or value judgments. The \n        Administrator shall also indicate the extent to which any \n        significant model has been validated by or conflicts with \n        empirical data.\n\nSEC. 5. PRINCIPLES FOR RISK CHARACTERIZATION.\n\n    In characterizing risk in any risk assessment document, regulatory \nproposal or decision, report to Congress, or other document which is \nmade available to the public, the Administrator shall comply with each \nof the following:\n            (1) The Administrator shall characterize the populations or \n        natural resources at risk. If a numerical estimate of risk is \n        provided, the departments and agencies shall, to the extent \n        feasible, provide the best estimate or estimates for the \n        populations or natural resources at risk, given the information \n        available to the Administrator, along with a statement of the \n        reasonable range of scientific uncertainty. In addition to the \n        best estimate, the Administrator may present plausible upper-\n        bound or conservative estimates in conjunction with plausible \n        lower bounds estimates. Where appropriate, the Administrator \n        may present, in lieu of a single best estimate, multiple \n        estimates based on assumptions, inferences, or models which are \n        equally plausible, given current scientific understanding.\n            (2) The Administrator shall explain the range of exposure \n        scenarios used in any risk assessment, and, to the extent \n        feasible, provide a statement of the size of the corresponding \n        population at risk and the likelihood of such exposure \n        scenarios.\n            (3) To the extent feasible, the Administrator shall provide \n        appropriate comparisons with estimates of other risks, \n        including those that are familiar to and routinely encountered \n        by the general public.\n            (4) When the Administrator provides a risk assessment or \n        risk characterization for proposed and final regulatory \n        actions, such assessment or characterization shall include a \n        statement of any known and significant substitution risks.\n            (5) In any case in which the Administrator provides a \n        public comment period with respect to a risk assessment or \n        regulation, and a commenter provides a risk assessment and \n        summary of results that is consistent with the principles and \n        the guidance provided under this Act, the Administrator shall \n        present the summary of results of such risk assessment in \n        connection with the presentation of the Environmental \n        Protection Agency's risk assessment (if any) or regulation.\n\nSEC. 6. GUIDANCE, PLAN FOR ASSESSING NEW INFORMATION, AND REPORT.\n\n    (a) Guidance.--Within 18 months after the date of enactment of this \nAct, the Administrator shall issue guidance consistent with the risk \nassessment and characterization principles stated in sections 4 and 5 \nand shall provide a format for summarizing risk assessment results.\n    (b) Additional Subjects Addressed.--In addition to including the \nprinciples set forth in sections 4 and 5, the guidance issued under \nthis section shall include guidance on at least the following subjects: \ninterspecies scaling factors; use of different types of dose-response \nmodels; thresholds; definitions, use, and interpretations of the \nmaximum tolerated dose; weighting of positive and negative findings \nfrom sensitive species; evaluation of benign tumors, and evaluation of \ndifferent health endpoints.\n    (c) Plan.--Within 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, \nthe Administrator shall publish a plan to review and revise any risk \nassessment with respect to which the Environmental Protection Agency \ndetermines there is significant new information or methodologies \navailable that could significantly alter the prior results of the risk \nassessment. The plan shall provide procedures for receiving and \nconsidering new information and risk assessments from the public. The \nplan may set priorities for review and revision of risk assessments \nbased on factors the Administrator considers appropriate.\n    (d) Report.--Within 3 years after the enactment of this Act, the \nAdministrator shall provide a report to the Congress evaluating the \npolicy and value judgments of the type identified under paragraph (3) \nof section 4 which are made by the Administrator in risk assessments \nperformed for programs under the Toxic Substances Control Act and the \neffect these judgments have on the regulatory decisions of such \nprograms.\n    (e) Public Comment and Consultation.--The guidance, plan and report \nunder this section, shall be developed after notice and opportunity for \npublic comment and in consultation with the EPA Science Advisory Board, \nrepresentatives of appropriate State agencies, and such other \ndepartments and agencies, offices, organizations, or persons as the \nAdministrator considers advisable.\n    (f) Review.--Guidance promulgated under this section shall be \nreviewed by the Administrator at least every 4 years in accordance with \nsubsection (d).\n\nSEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) The term ``risk assessment'' means the process of \n        identifying hazards and quantifying or describing the degree of \n        risk they pose for exposed individuals, populations, or \n        resources. It also refers to the document containing the \n        explanation of how the assessment process has been applied to \n        an individual substance, activity, or condition.\n            (2) The term ``risk characterization'' means that element \n        of a risk assessment that involves presentation of the degree \n        of risk in any regulatory proposal or decision, report to \n        Congress, or other document which is made available to the \n        public. The term includes discussions of uncertainties, \n        conflicting data, estimates, extrapolations, inferences, and \n        opinions.\n            (3) The term ``best estimate'' means an estimate based on \n        (A) central estimates of risk using the most unbiased \n        assumptions and models, (B) an approach which combines multiple \n        estimates based on different scenarios and weighs the \n        probability of each scenario or (C) any other methodology \n        designed to provide the most unbiased representation of the \n        most plausible level of risk, given the current scientific \n        information available to the Administrator.\n            (4) The term ``negative data'' means data indicating that \n        under certain conditions a given substance or activity did not \n        induce an adverse effect.\n            (5) The term ``substitution risk'' means a potential \n        increased risk to human health, safety, or the environment from \n        a regulatory option designed to decrease other risks."
