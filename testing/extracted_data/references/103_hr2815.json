FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n        (1) Public Law 99-590 authorized the study of 2 segments of the \n    West Branch of the Farmington River, including an 11-mile headwater \n    segment in Massachusetts and the uppermost 14-mile segment in \n    Connecticut, for potential inclusion in the National Wild and \n    Scenic Rivers System, and created the Farmington River Study \n    Committee, consisting of representatives from the 2 States, the \n    towns bordering the 2 segments, and other river interests, to \n    advise the Secretary of the Interior in conducting the study and \n    concerning management alternatives should the river be included in \n    the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System;\n        (2) the study determined that both segments of the river are \n    eligible for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers \n    System based upon their free-flowing condition and outstanding \n    fisheries, recreation, wildlife, and historic values;\n        (3) the towns that directly abut the Connecticut segment \n    (Hartland, Barkhamsted, New Hartford, and Canton), as well as the \n    Town of Colebrook, which abuts the segment's major tributary, have \n    demonstrated their desire for national wild and scenic river \n    designation through town meeting actions endorsing designation; in \n    addition, the 4 abutting towns have demonstrated their commitment \n    to protect the river through the adoption of ``river protection \n    overlay districts'', which establish a uniform setback for new \n    structures, new septic systems, sand and gravel extraction, and \n    vegetation removal along the entire length of the Connecticut \n    segment;\n        (4) during the study, the Farmington River Study Committee and \n    the National Park Service prepared a comprehensive management plan \n    for the Connecticut segment (the ``Upper Farmington River \n    Management Plan'', dated April 29, 1993) which establishes \n    objectives, standards, and action programs that will ensure long-\n    term protection of the river's outstanding values and compatible \n    management of its land and water resources, without Federal \n    management of affected lands not owned by the United States;\n        (5) the Farmington River Study Committee voted unanimously on \n    April 29, 1993, to adopt the Upper Farmington River Management Plan \n    and to recommend that Congress include the Connecticut segment in \n    the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System in accordance with the \n    spirit and provisions of the Upper Farmington River Management \n    Plan, and to recommend that, in the absence of town votes \n    supporting designation, no action be taken regarding wild and \n    scenic river designation of the Massachusetts segment; and\n        (6) the Colebrook Dam and Goodwin Dam hydroelectric projects \n    are located outside the river segment designated by section 3, and \n    based on the study of the Farmington River pursuant to Public Law \n    99-590, continuation of the existing operation of these projects as \n    presently configured, including associated transmission lines and \n    other existing project works, is compatible with the designation \n    made by section 3 and will not unreasonably diminish the scenic, \n    recreational, and fish and wildlife values of the segment \n    designated by such section as of the date of enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 3.
