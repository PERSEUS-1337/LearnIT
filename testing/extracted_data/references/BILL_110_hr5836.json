FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There is a growing need in developing countries in \n        Africa to educate and properly train future business leaders in \n        such a way to help them adapt to the demanding complexities of \n        leadership.\n            (2) This growing need has led to the call for Africa to \n        develop and train the next generation of leaders that will \n        bring Africa forward into a peaceful and prosperous new century \n        and ensure that democracy lasts across the continent.\n            (3) One of the ways to help train the next generation of \n        leaders is through entrepreneurial education, entrepreneurship \n        may be one of the most important channels through which \n        education raises economic productivity.\n            (4) All youth should be provided with the access to any and \n        all opportunities to develop skills, attitudes, and abilities \n        that are needed in later life that can lead to entrepreneurship \n        and leadership.\n            (5) One of the goals of educators should be to train \n        students to become self-employed after graduation and produce \n        the goods and services that are needed locally, thereby \n        initiating significant internal economic activity.\n            (6) It is important that the youth be assisted to achieve \n        higher levels of access and entry into the economy as \n        potentially self-employed people since there are simply not \n        enough employment opportunities within the private and public \n        sectors for them all.\n            (7) Business and management education is especially \n        critical in Africa where, in the face of huge shortages in both \n        the private and public sectors, only 50 business schools exist \n        to serve nearly 800 million people, compared with 1,000 \n        business schools in India and 1,200 in the United States.\n            (8) While many institutions in Africa do offer a business \n        certificate/degree, the training can lack certain practical \n        elements, which makes it difficult for graduates to readily \n        apply their skills in the real world.\n            (9) Studies have shown that globalization poses great \n        challenges for education, training, and enterprise development, \n        but there are potential opportunities for positive responses in \n        policy and practice, one of which is the enhancement of \n        individual, societal, and enterprise learning.\n            (10) Educational institutions are not rapidly responding to \n        this urgent challenge.\n\nSEC. 3. ASSISTANCE TO ESTABLISH PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN BUSINESSES AND \n              POSTSECONDARY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING \n              COUNTRIES IN AFRICA.\n\n    Chapter 1 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \nU.S.C. 2151 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 105 the \nfollowing new section:\n\n``SEC. 105A.
