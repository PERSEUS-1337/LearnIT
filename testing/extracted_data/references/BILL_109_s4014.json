FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The sustained commitment of the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization (NATO) to mutual defense has made possible the \n        democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe. \n        Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization can and \n        should play a critical role in addressing the security \n        challenges of the post-Cold War era in creating the stable \n        environment needed for those emerging democracies in Europe.\n            (2) Lasting stability and security in Europe requires the \n        military, economic, and political integration of emerging \n        democracies into existing European structures.\n            (3) In an era of threats from terrorism and the \n        proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the North \n        Atlantic Treaty Organization is increasingly contributing to \n        security in the face of global security challenges for the \n        protection and interests of its member states.\n            (4) In the NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title II of \n        Public Law 103-447; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress declared \n        that ``full and active participants in the Partnership for \n        Peace in a position to further the principles of the North \n        Atlantic Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North \n        Atlantic area should be invited to become full NATO members in \n        accordance with Article 10 of such Treaty at an early \n        date...''.\n            (5) In the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996 (title \n        VI of section 101(c) of title I of division A of Public Law \n        104-208; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress called for the prompt \n        admission of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia \n        to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and declared that \n        ``in order to promote economic stability and security in \n        Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, \n        Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine...the process of enlarging NATO \n        to include emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe \n        should not be limited to consideration of admitting Poland, \n        Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia as full members of \n        the NATO Alliance''.\n            (6) In the European Security Act of 1998 (title XXVII of \n        division G of Public Law 105-277; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), \n        Congress declared that ``Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \n        Republic should not be the last emerging democracies in Central \n        and Eastern Europe invited to join NATO'' and that ``Romania, \n        Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria...would make an \n        outstanding contribution to furthering the goals of NATO and \n        enhancing stability, freedom, and peace in Europe should they \n        become NATO members [and] upon complete satisfaction of all \n        relevant criteria should be invited to become full NATO members \n        at the earliest possible date''.\n            (7) In the Gerald B. H. Solomon Freedom Consolidation Act \n        of 2002 (Public Law 107-187; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress \n        endorsed ``...the vision of further enlargement of the NATO \n        Alliance articulated by President George W. Bush on June 15, \n        2001, and by former President William J. Clinton on October 22, \n        1996''.\n            (8) At the Madrid Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization in July 1997, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \n        Republic were invited to join the Alliance, and the North \n        Atlantic Treaty Organization heads of state and government \n        issued a declaration stating ``[t]he alliance expects to extend \n        further invitations in coming years to nations willing and able \n        to assume the responsibilities and obligations of \n        membership...[n]o European democratic country whose admission \n        would fulfill the objectives of the [North Atlantic] Treaty \n        will be excluded from consideration''.\n            (9) At the Washington Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization in April 1999, the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization heads of state and government issued a communique \n        declaring ``[w]e pledge that NATO will continue to welcome new \n        members in a position to further the principles of the [North \n        Atlantic] Treaty and contribute to peace and security in the \n        Euro-Atlantic area...[t]he three new members will not be the \n        last...[n]o European democratic country whose admission would \n        fulfill the objectives of the Treaty will be excluded from \n        consideration, regardless of its geographic location...''.\n            (10) In May 2000 in Vilnius, Lithuania, the foreign \n        ministers of Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the \n        Republic of Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia issued a \n        statement (later joined by Croatia) declaring that--\n                    (A) their countries will cooperate in jointly \n                seeking membership in the North Atlantic Treaty \n                Organization in the next round of enlargement of the \n                North Atlantic Treaty Organization;\n                    (B) the realization of membership in the North \n                Atlantic Treaty Organization by one or more of these \n                countries would be a success for all; and\n                    (C) eventual membership in the North Atlantic \n                Treaty Organization for all of these countries would be \n                a success for Europe and for the North Atlantic Treaty \n                Organization.\n            (11) On June 15, 2001, in a speech in Warsaw, Poland, \n        President George W. Bush stated ``[a]ll of Europe's new \n        democracies, from the Baltic to the Black Sea and all that lie \n        between, should have the same chance for security and freedom--\n        and the same chance to join the institutions of Europe--as \n        Europe's old democracies have...I believe in NATO membership \n        for all of Europe's democracies that seek it and are ready to \n        share the responsibilities that NATO brings...[a]s we plan to \n        enlarge NATO, no nation should be used as a pawn in the agenda \n        of others...[w]e will not trade away the fate of free European \n        peoples...[n]o more Munichs...[n]o more Yaltas...[a]s we plan \n        the Prague Summit, we should not calculate how little we can \n        get away with, but how much we can do to advance the cause of \n        freedom''.\n            (12) On October 22, 1996, in a speech in Detroit, Michigan, \n        former President William J. Clinton stated ``NATO's doors will \n        not close behind its first new members...NATO should remain \n        open to all of Europe's emerging democracies who are ready to \n        shoulder the responsibilities of membership...[n]o nation will \n        be automatically excluded...[n]o country outside NATO will have \n        a veto...[a] gray zone of insecurity must not reemerge in \n        Europe''.\n            (13) At the Prague Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization in November 2002, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \n        Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia were invited to join \n        the Alliance in the second round of enlargement of the North \n        Atlantic Treaty Organization since the end of the Cold War, and \n        the North Atlantic Treaty Organization heads of state and \n        government issued a declaration stating ``NATO's door will \n        remain open to European democracies willing and able to assume \n        the responsibilities and obligations of membership, in \n        accordance with Article 10 of the Washington Treaty''.\n            (14) On May 8, 2003, the United States Senate unanimously \n        approved the Resolution of Ratification to Accompany Treaty \n        Document No. 108-4, Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of \n        1949 on Accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \n        Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, inviting Bulgaria, Estonia, \n        Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia to join the \n        North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n            (15) At the Istanbul Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization in June 2004, the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization heads of state and government issued a communique \n        reaffirming that NATO's door remains open to new members, \n        declaring ``[w]e celebrate the success of NATO's Open Door \n        Policy, and reaffirm tody that our seven new members will not \n        be the last. The door to membership remains open. We welcome \n        the progress made by Albania, Croatia, and the former Yugoslav \n        Republic of Macedonia (1) in implementing their Annual National \n        Programmes under the Membership Action Plan, and encourage them \n        to continue pursuing the reforms necessary to progress toward \n        NATO membership. We also commend their contribution to regional \n        stability and cooperation. We want all three countries to \n        succeed and will continue to assist them in their reform \n        efforts. NATO will continue to assess each country's candidacy \n        individually, based on the progress made towards reform goals \n        pursued through the Membership Action Plan, which will remain \n        the vehicle to keep the readiness of each aspirant for \n        membership under review. We direct that NATO Foreign Ministers \n        keep the enlargement process, including the implementation of \n        the Membership Action Plan, under continual review and report \n        to us. We will review at the next Summit progress by aspirants \n        towards membership based on that report''.\n            (16) Georgia has stated its desire to join the Euro-\n        Atlantic community, and in particular, is seeking to join North \n        Atlantic Treaty Organization. Georgia is working closely with \n        the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its members to meet \n        criteria for eventual membership in NATO.\n            (17) At a press conference with President Mikhail \n        Saakashvili of Georgia in Washington, D.C. on July 5, 2006, \n        President George W. Bush stated that ``... I believe that NATO \n        would benefit with Georgia being a member of NATO, and I think \n        Georgia would benefit. And there's a way forward through the \n        Membership Action Plan...And I'm a believer in the expansion of \n        NATO. I think it's in the world's interest that we expand \n        NATO''.\n            (18) Following a meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers in New \n        York on September 21, 2006, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop \n        Scheffer announced the launching of an Intensified Dialogue on \n        membership between the Alliance and Georgia.\n            (19) Contingent upon their continued implementation of \n        democratic, defense, and economic reform, and their willingness \n        and ability to meet the responsibilities of membership in the \n        North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Congress calls for the \n        timely admission of Albania, Croatia, Georgia, and Macedonia to \n        the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to promote security and \n        stability in Europe.\n            (20) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization heads of state \n        and government will hold a North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n        Summit in Riga, Latvia, in November 2006.\n\nSEC. 3. DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.\n\n    Congress--\n            (1) reaffirms its previous expressions of support for \n        continued enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n        contained in the NATO Participation Act of 1994, the NATO \n        Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996, the European Security Act \n        of 1998, and the Gerald B. H. Solomon Freedom Consolidation Act \n        of 2002;\n            (2) supports the commitment to further enlargement of the \n        North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include European \n        democracies that are able and willing to meet the \n        responsibilities of Membership, as expressed by the Alliance in \n        its Madrid Summit Declaration of 1997, its Washington Summit \n        Communique of 1999, its Prague Summit Declaration of 2002, and \n        its Istanbul Summit Communique of 2004; and\n            (3) endorses the vision of further enlargement of the North \n        Atlantic Treaty Organization articulated by President George W. \n        Bush on June 15, 2001, and by former President William J. \n        Clinton on October 22, 1996, and urges our allies in the North \n        Atlantic Treaty Organization to work with the United States to \n        realize a role for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in \n        promoting global security, including continued support for \n        enlargement to include qualified candidate states, specifically \n        by entering into a Membership Action Plan with Georgia and \n        recognizing the progress toward meeting the responsibilities \n        and obligations of NATO membership by Albania, Croatia, \n        Georgia, and Macedonia at the NATO Summit in Riga, Latvia.\n\nSEC. 4.
