    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Mentor-Mentee Teen Pregnancy \nReduction Act of 2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The U.S. has the highest teenage pregnancy rate of any \n        fully industrialized country.\n            (2) One in three girls in the U.S. becomes pregnant at \n        least once by the age of 20.\n            (3) Girls who become pregnant are more likely to drop out \n        of high school, less likely to complete college, more likely to \n        give birth to low-birth weight babies, and more likely to live \n        in poverty.\n            (4) The children born to teenage mothers are more likely to \n        have learning disabilities, less likely to complete high \n        school, and more likely to live in poverty.\n            (5) Girls born to teenage mothers are more likely to become \n        teenager mothers themselves; boys born to teenage mothers are \n        more likely to end up in prison.\n            (6) Innovative initiatives, such as increasing parental \n        involvement and portraying the consequences of teenage \n        pregnancy through the media, exist that can reduce the rates of \n        teenage pregnancy and give every young person a better hope for \n        the future.\n            (7) Research shows that a wide variety of programs have \n        been successful at delaying sexual activity and reducing \n        teenage pregnancy, including efforts that engage students in \n        community service, promote youth development, provide \n        preventive health services, offer sex and HIV/AIDS education, \n        and more.\n\nSEC. 3. MENTOR-MENTEE TEEN PREGNANCY REDUCTION GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    Title V of the Social Security Act is amended--\n            (1) in section 510(d) (42 U.S.C. 710(d)), by inserting \n        ``and grants under section 511'' after ``under subsection (a)'' \n        ; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n         ``mentor-mentee teen pregnancy reduction grant program\n\n    ``Sec. 511.
