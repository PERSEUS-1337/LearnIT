CIVIL RIGHTS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) bias-motivated crimes of violence constitute crimes in \n        violation of the victim's right to be free from discrimination \n        on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, gender, \n        religion, national origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or \n        physical or mental disability;\n            (2) State and Federal criminal laws do not adequately \n        protect against the bias element of bias-motivated crimes of \n        violence, which separates these crimes from acts of random \n        violence, nor do those laws adequately provide victims of bias-\n        motivated crimes of violence the opportunity to vindicate their \n        interests;\n            (3) existing bias and discrimination in the criminal \n        justice system often deprive victims of bias-motivated crimes \n        of violence of equal protection of the laws and the redress to \n        which they are entitled;\n            (4) bias-motivated crimes of violence have a substantial \n        adverse effect on interstate commerce, by deterring potential \n        victims from traveling interstate, from engaging in employment \n        in interstate business, and from transacting with business, and \n        in places involved, in interstate commerce;\n            (5) bias-motivated crimes of violence have a substantial \n        adverse effect on interstate commerce, by diminishing national \n        productivity, increasing medical and other costs, and \n        decreasing the supply of and the demand for interstate \n        products;\n            (6) a Federal civil rights claim, as created in this \n        section, is necessary to guarantee equal protection of the laws \n        and to reduce the substantial adverse effects of bias-motivated \n        crimes of violence on interstate commerce; and\n            (7) victims of bias-motivated crimes of violence have a \n        right to equal protection of the laws, including a system of \n        justice that is unaffected by bias or discrimination and that, \n        at every relevant stage, treats such crimes as seriously as \n        other violent crimes.\n    (b) Right.--All individuals within the United States, and the \nspecial maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, \nshall have the right to be free from bias-motivated crimes of violence.\n    (c) Claim.--Any person, including a person who acts under color of \nany statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State, who \ndeprives an individual of the right secured by subsection (b) shall be \nliable to the individual injured, in a civil action in any court of \ncompetent jurisdiction, for compensatory damages of not less than \n$100,000, punitive damages, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, or \nany combination thereof.\n    (d) Limitation, Procedure, and Rule of Construction.--\n            (1) Limitation.--Nothing in this section entitles an \n        individual to a claim under subsection (c) for random acts of \n        violence unrelated to bias or for acts that cannot be \n        demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, to be bias-\n        motivated crimes of violence.\n            (2) No prior criminal action.--Nothing in this section \n        requires a prior criminal complaint, prosecution, or conviction \n        to establish the necessary elements of a claim under subsection \n        (c).\n            (3) Concurrent jurisdiction.--The Federal and State courts \n        shall have concurrent jurisdiction over actions brought \n        pursuant to this section.\n            (4) Rule of construction.--Neither section 1367 of title 28 \n        of the United States Code nor subsection (c) of this section \n        shall be construed, by reason of a claim arising under such \n        subsection, to confer on the courts of the United States \n        supplemental jurisdiction of any State law claim seeking the \n        establishment of a divorce, alimony, equitable distribution of \n        marital property, or child custody decree.\n    (e) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n            (1) the term ``bias-motivated'' means committed because of, \n        on the basis of, and due to (at least in part) an animus based \n        on, actual or perceived race, color, gender, religion, national \n        origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or physical or mental \n        disability of the victim;\n            (2) the term ``crime of violence'' means--\n                    (A) an act or series of acts that would constitute \n                State or Federal offense of a kind described in section \n                16 of title 18, United States Code, and punishable by a \n                maximum term of imprisonment exceeding one year, but \n                excludes an offense against property that presents no \n                serious risk of physical or mental disability injury to \n                an individual; or\n                    (B) one or more actions that would constitute such \n                offense but for the relationship between the person who \n                takes such actions and the individual against whom such \n                actions are taken;\n        whether or not such offense or such actions result in criminal \n        charges, prosecution, or conviction and whether or not such \n        actions were taken within the United States or the special \n        maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States;\n            (3) the term ``disability'' has the meaning given it in \n        section 3(2) of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 \n        U.S.C. 12102(2));
