    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``SMA Treatment Acceleration Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the number one genetic \n        killer of children under the age of 2.\n            (2) SMA is an inherited and often fatal disease that \n        destroys the nerves controlling voluntary muscle movement, \n        which affects crawling, walking, head and neck control, and \n        even swallowing.\n            (3) It is estimated that SMA occurs in nearly 1 of every \n        6,000 births and is therefore similar in incidence and severity \n        to other well-known genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis \n        and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, both of which may also benefit \n        from additional focus and progress on SMA.\n            (4) SMA is caused by the mutation of a single gene. This is \n        extremely advantageous for genetic screening and therapeutic \n        development. The gene mutation that causes SMA is carried by \n        one in every 40 people, or approximately 7,500,000 Americans. \n        Each child of 2 carriers of the mutant gene has a 1 in 4 chance \n        of developing SMA.\n            (5) The discovery of the gene responsible for the disease, \n        SMN1, as well as a disease modifying ``back-up'' SMN2 gene has \n        opened the door to new SMA treatments. Modulating genes exist \n        not only for SMA but also for other genetic disorders, \n        including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Parkinson's, and \n        Alzheimer's disease. The modulation of these genes might be \n        expected to impact these disorders. Success with SMN2 induction \n        for SMA will serve as an important proof of principle and \n        impetus for ongoing research in these other conditions.\n            (6) Based on the advanced genetic understanding of SMA, the \n        disease was selected by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \n        and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke \n        (NINDS) as the prototype for the National Institutes of \n        Health's accelerated drug discovery effort, singling out SMA as \n        the disease closest to treatment of more than 600 neurological \n        disorders.\n            (7) In 2003, the National Institute of Neurological \n        Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) established the Spinal Muscular \n        Atrophy Project: A Collaborative Program to Accelerate \n        Therapeutics Development for SMA. The SMA Project's unique \n        collaborative process between private, public, and non-profit \n        partners provides a model translational research program that \n        can be replicated to accelerate the development of safe and \n        effective treatments for a wide variety of disorders.\n            (8) National non-profit organizations dedicated to finding \n        a treatment and cure for SMA continue to provide substantial \n        private funding and are collaborating with private \n        biotechnology companies, large pharmaceutical companies, and \n        clinical investigators to identify new drug compounds and \n        facilitate the rapid translation of promising new therapies to \n        individuals with SMA. The aforementioned investment by national \n        non-profit organizations towards finding a treatment and cure \n        for SMA is approximately equal, on an annual basis, to the \n        resources committed by the Federal Government.\n            (9) A Food and Drug Administration-approved SMA animal \n        model exists that closely mimics the human disease. A number of \n        therapeutics have been identified which are effective in animal \n        models of spinal muscular atrophy.\n            (10) There is an urgent need to provide Federal support \n        enabling investigators to mount national clinical trials to \n        demonstrate that these treatments are safe and effective for \n        SMA patients.\n            (11) The establishment and support of a national clinical \n        trials network and a data coordinating center will promote \n        rigorous patient evaluation using common protocols and allow \n        investigators to study large numbers of patients to provide \n        answers more rapidly than individual sites acting alone.\n            (12) There is a demonstrated need for greater interagency \n        coordination on SMA research and involvement by additional \n        government partners to support the ongoing work of NINDS on the \n        SMA Project as well the work of private SMA voluntary \n        organizations, including most notably the need for active \n        engagement by the National Institute of Child Health and Human \n        Development (NICHD), along with support from the National \n        Center for Research Resources, the Centers for Disease Control \n        and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and the \n        Health Resources and Services Administration\n            (13) Despite such landmark legislation as the Orphan Drug \n        Act and the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, additional \n        incentives for industry to engage early in the drug development \n        process and through to drug approval are warranted for diseases \n        as severe and devastating in infant and children populations as \n        SMA.\n            (14) Educating the public and health care community \n        throughout the country about this devastating disease is of \n        paramount importance and is in every respect in the public \n        interest and to the benefit of all communities. Furthermore, \n        greater awareness of SMA may lead to the identification of pre-\n        symptomatic SMA-afflicted children, which has significant \n        benefits relative to clinical trials and the search for a \n        treatment and cure.\n\nSEC. 3.
