FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds and declares:\n            (1) Federal legislation and regulatory requirements impose \n        burdens on State and local resources to implement federally \n        mandated programs without fully evaluating the costs to State \n        and local governments associated with compliance with those \n        requirements and often times without provision of adequate \n        Federal financial assistance. These Federal legislative and \n        regulatory initiatives--\n                    (A) force State and local governments to utilize \n                scarce public resources to comply with Federal \n                mandates;\n                    (B) prevent these resources from being available to \n                meet local needs; and\n                    (C) detract from the ability of State and local \n                governments to establish local priorities for use of \n                local public resources.\n            (2) Federal legislation and regulatory programs result in \n        inefficient utilization of economic resources, thereby reducing \n        the pool of resources available--\n                    (A) to enhance productivity, and increase the \n                quantity and quality of goods and services produced by \n                the American economy; and\n                    (B) to enhance international competitiveness.\n            (3) In implementing Congressional policy, Federal agencies \n        should, consistent with the requirements of Federal law, seek \n        to implement statutory requirements, to the maximum extent \n        feasible, in a manner which minimizes--\n                    (A) the inefficient allocation of economic \n                resources;\n                    (B) the burden such requirements impose on use of \n                local public resources by State and local governments; \n                and\n                    (C) the adverse economic effects of such \n                regulations on productivity, economic growth, full \n                employment, creation of productive jobs, and \n                international competitiveness of American goods and \n                services.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are:\n            (1) To assist Congress in consideration of proposed \n        legislation establishing or revising Federal programs so as to \n        assure that, to the maximum extent practicable, legislation \n        enacted by Congress will--\n                    (A) minimize the burden of such legislation on \n                expenditure of scarce local public resources by State \n                and local governments;\n                    (B) minimize inefficient allocation of economic \n                resources; and\n                    (C) reduce the adverse effect of such legislation--\n                            (i) on the ability of State and local \n                        governmental entities to use local public \n                        resources to meet local needs and to establish \n                        local priorities for local public resources; \n                        and\n                            (ii) on allocation of economic resources, \n                        productivity, economic growth, full employment, \n                        creation of productive jobs, and international \n                        competitiveness.\n            (2) To require Federal agencies to exercise discretionary \n        authority and to implement statutory requirements in a manner \n        which consistent with fulfillment of each agency's mission and \n        with the requirements of other laws, minimizes the impact \n        regulations and other major Federal actions affecting the \n        economy have on--\n                    (A) the ability of State and local governmental \n                entities to use local public resources to meet local \n                needs; and\n                    (B) the allocation of economic resources, \n                productivity, economic growth, full employment, \n                creation of productive jobs, and international \n                competitiveness of American goods and services.\n\n                      TITLE I--LEGISLATIVE REFORM\n\nSEC. 101.

For this purpose, a year shall be a \nperiod of three hundred and sixty five consecutive days.\n    (b) Duties and Functions of Congressional Budget Office.--The \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office shall prepare for each bill \nor resolution of a public character reported by any committee of the \nHouse of Representatives or of the Senate, an economic analysis of the \neffects of such bill or resolution, satisfying the requirements of \nsubsection (a). The analysis prepared by the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office shall be included in the report \naccompanying such bill or resolution if timely submitted to such \ncommittee before such report is filed.\n    (c) Legislation Subject To Point of Order.--Any bill or resolution \nshall be subject to a point of order against consideration of the bill \nby the House of Representatives or the Senate (as the case may be) if \nsuch bill or resolution is reported for consideration by the House of \nRepresentatives or the Senate unaccompanied by the analysis required by \nthis section.\n\nSEC. 102. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.\n\n    The provisions of this title are enacted by the Congress--\n            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of \n        Representatives and the Senate, respectively, and as such they \n        shall be considered as part of the rules of each House, \n        respectively, and such rules shall supersede other rules only \n        to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and\n            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n        either House to change such rules (so far as relating to such \n        House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent \n        as in the case of any other rule of such House.\n\nSEC. 103.
