FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) in the early 1980s, James Doyle, doing business as \n        Rocky Mountain Ventures and Environmental Land Technologies, \n        Ltd., began assembling land for a massive real estate \n        development in the rapidly growing St. George area of Utah;\n            (2) the centerpieces of this development were 9 golf \n        courses surrounded by luxury homes;\n            (3) during the 1980s, James Doyle acquired 2,440 acres and \n        held preferential rights to an additional 11,000 acres for this \n        development;\n            (4) throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, James Doyle \n        invested large amounts of money to acquire and develop this \n        land, including--\n                    (A) procuring the water rights and engineering \n                studies;\n                    (B) developing proposals and designs for \n                transportation corridors;\n                    (C) constructing 1 golf course and designing nine \n                more;\n                    (D) developing utility layouts and placements;\n                    (E) installing necessary sewer, water, and power \n                for the various properties; and\n                    (F) securing all necessary zoning adjustments and \n                development permissions;\n            (5) with planning and preparation essentially complete by \n        1989, James Doyle was prepared to break ground for the initial \n        phase of his project;\n            (6) on April 2, 1990, the United States Fish and Wildlife \n        Service published a final rule listing the Mojave population of \n        the desert tortoise as ``threatened'' under the Endangered \n        Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.);\n            (7) on February 8, 1994, the United States Fish and \n        Wildlife Service published a final rule designating all of \n        James Doyle's land as critical habitat for the Mojave \n        population of the desert tortoise;\n            (8) the listing of the desert tortoise and designation of \n        James Doyle's land as critical habitat for the tortoise made \n        James Doyle's planned land development, as well as that of \n        other nearby lands, unlawful without the issuance of an \n        incidental take permit by the United States Fish and Wildlife \n        Service;\n            (9) in response to the designation, James Doyle, as a \n        member of the Habitat Conservation Plan Steering Committee, \n        worked with other landowners, as well as Federal, State, and \n        county officials, to create a Habitat Conservation Plan \n        covering Washington County that would have allowed James Doyle \n        to develop a portion of his land;\n            (10) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service rejected \n        the plan, stating that the plan set aside insufficient land to \n        protect the tortoise;\n            (11) James Doyle and the Steering Committee prepared a \n        revised Habitat Conservation Plan, which the United States Fish \n        and Wildlife Service approved on February 23, 1996;\n            (12) the approved Habitat Conservation Plan allowed the \n        development of 350,000 acres of tortoise habitat, and set aside \n        61,022 acres, including all of James Doyle's land, as protected \n        tortoise habitat reserve where no development was allowed;\n            (13) to this end, the Habitat Conservation Plan expressly \n        provided that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service would \n        issue no incidental take permits for desert tortoises on \n        reserve lands;\n            (14) in return for placing the land in the tortoise \n        reserve, the United States promised that it would acquire title \n        to all of the private land, including James Doyle's, by \n        exchange or purchase at fair market value;\n            (15) despite extensive negotiations, the United States \n        acquired only about 400 acres of James Doyle's land for the \n        tortoise reserve, leaving the remainder of his acreage vacant \n        and unproductive;\n            (16) as the years passed, James Doyle's inability to \n        develop or sell this remaining acreage resulted in severe \n        financial limitations, leaving him unable to service the \n        mortgages he had incurred on the land to finance acquisition \n        and development costs;\n            (17) on March 30, 2004, unable to develop, exchange, or \n        sell the land, in which James Doyle had invested millions of \n        dollars, James Doyle was forced to seek bankruptcy protection;\n            (18) in 2010, James Doyle completed, and the bankruptcy \n        court approved, a plan under which James Doyle was required to \n        transfer to his creditors all but 274 acres of his land, which \n        he still owns but cannot develop;\n            (19) in 2015, James Doyle filed suit in the United States \n        Court of Federal Claims, seeking just compensation for the land \n        that has served as a tortoise reserve since 1996, and was taken \n        without compensation;\n            (20) the United States Court of Federal Claims dismissed \n        James Doyle's claim, without prejudice, ruling that he must \n        first seek and be denied a United States Fish and Wildlife \n        Service permit to develop his land, even though it is within \n        the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve where no development is allowed; \n        and\n            (21) the permit process would take several years and would \n        be futile.\n\nSEC. 3. SETTLEMENT OF CLAIM.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay James \nDoyle, out of money not otherwise appropriated, a sum of money, in an \namount to be determined by the United States Court of Federal Claims, \nrepresenting the amount to which James Doyle may be entitled in order \nto make James Doyle whole for any damages and losses sustained by James \nDoyle by reason of the Federal Government's taking of approximately \n2,000 acres of his land located in the St. George area of Utah, now \ndesignated as the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve and set aside as habitat \nfor the Mojave desert tortoise, a species listed under the Endangered \nSpecies Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n    (b) Full Satisfaction of Claims.--The payment made under subsection \n(a) shall be in full satisfaction of all claims of James Doyle against \nthe United States."
