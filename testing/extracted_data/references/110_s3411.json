    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Superior National Forest Land \nAdjustment Act of 2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Fragmentation of property rights on certain lands \n        described herein within and adjacent to the Superior National \n        Forest in Minnesota hampers the ability of the Forest Service \n        to manage associated forested areas as well as the ability of \n        private mineral owners to utilize their mineral rights.\n            (2) The United States primarily owns the surface estate in \n        the lands described in section 3, subject to reserved and \n        outstanding mineral rights, with such lands located within a \n        well-established mining district with a large open pit mine \n        lying directly to the north and a mine railroad lying directly \n        to the south.\n            (3) The public interest in selling the federally owned \n        property estate interests in lands described in section 3 under \n        the terms and conditions of this Act would appear to outweigh \n        the interest served by maintaining such lands under Federal \n        ownership subject to a final determination under this Act.\n            (4) The sale of some Federal surface and subsurface rights \n        in land under this Act will facilitate mining in the areas \n        described in section 3, and thereby improve the local and \n        national economy by providing needed mineral resources, \n        enhancing the property tax base, and promoting employment \n        opportunities through expanded job creation and will allow for \n        the acquisition of desirable public holdings that are located \n        within or adjacent to Forest Service land by the Forest \n        Service.\n            (5) Minnesota and the Army Corps of Engineers, in \n        cooperation with the Forest Service, are preparing an \n        environmental impact statement for the proposed mining \n        operations by PolyMet Mining, Inc., on and adjacent to the \n        lands authorized for conveyance by this Act, more fully \n        described in the notice of intent of the Department of Defense \n        (70 Fed. Reg. 38122 (July 1, 2005)) and a draft environmental \n        impact statement is expected to be released for public review \n        and comment in the near future.\n            (6) Proceeds from the sale of lands authorized by this Act \n        shall be used by the Forest Service to purchase desirable \n        private inholdings within and adjacent to the Superior National \n        Forest consistent with the land and resource management plan \n        for the Superior National Forest.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this Act:\n            (1) The term ``lands'' includes interests in lands.\n            (2) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n        Agriculture.\n            (3) The term ``surface mining'' means the excavation of \n        lands for the purposes of obtaining minerals, including \n        excavation by such methods as contour, strip, auger, open pit, \n        and area mining.\n\nSEC. 3.
