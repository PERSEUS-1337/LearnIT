ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL CENTER ON VOLUNTEER SCREENING.\n\n    The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (42 \nU.S.C. 5601 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n           ``TITLE VI--NATIONAL CENTER ON VOLUNTEER SCREENING\n\n``SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    ``This title may be cited as the `National Child Protection \nVolunteer Screening Assistance Act'.\n\n``SEC. 602. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) More than 87,000,000 children are involved each year \n        in activities provided by child and youth organizations which \n        depend heavily on volunteers to deliver services through such \n        activities.\n            ``(2) The vast majority of activities provided to children \n        by public and nonprofit private agencies and organizations \n        result in the delivery of much needed services in safe \n        environments that could not be provided without the assistance \n        of virtually millions of volunteers, but abuses of children do \n        occur.\n            ``(3) Estimates of the incidence of child sexual abuse in \n        child care settings, foster care homes, and schools range from \n        1 to 7 percent.\n            ``(4) Although the incidence of child abuse may be \n        relatively small, abuse traumatizes the victims and shakes \n        public trust in care providers and organizations serving \n        vulnerable populations.\n            ``(5) Congress addressed concerns about this type of abuse \n        by enacting the National Child Protection Act of 1993 and the \n        Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, to set forth a framework \n        through which States could authorize screening through criminal \n        record checks of care providers, including volunteers who work \n        with children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities, \n        but problems regarding the safety of children remain.\n            ``(6) While State screening alone is sometimes adequate to \n        conduct volunteer background checks, more extensive national \n        criminal history checks using fingerprints are often advisable, \n        especially when a prospective volunteer may have lived in more \n        than 1 State.\n            ``(7) The high cost for fingerprint background checks is \n        unaffordable for organizations that use a large number of \n        volunteers and, if such cost is passed on to volunteers, often \n        discourages their participation.\n            ``(8) The current system of retrieving national criminal \n        background information on volunteers through an authorized \n        agency of the State is cumbersome and often requires months \n        before vital results are returned.\n            ``(9) In order to protect children, volunteer agencies must \n        currently depend on a convoluted, disconnected, and sometimes \n        duplicative series of checks that leave children at risk.\n            ``(10) A national volunteer screening center is needed to \n        protect children by providing effective, efficient, and no-cost \n        national criminal history background checks of volunteers who \n        provide care through public and nonprofit private agencies and \n        organizations.\n\n``SEC. 603. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    ``For purposes of this title:\n            ``(1) Public or nonprofit private qualified entity.--The \n        term `public or nonprofit private qualified entity' means an \n        agency or organization, whether public or nonprofit, that \n        provides care placement services, including an organization \n        that licenses or certifies others to provide care placement \n        services.\n            ``(2) Volunteer provider.--The term `volunteer provider' \n        means an individual who provides or seeks to provide services \n        as a volunteer to a public or nonprofit private qualified \n        entity.\n            ``(3) National criminal background check system.--The term \n        `national criminal background check system' means the criminal \n        history record system maintained by the Federal Bureau of \n        Investigation based on fingerprint identification or any other \n        method of positive identification.\n            ``(4) Child.--The term `child' has the meaning given such \n        term in section 5(2) of the Child Protection Act of 1993.\n            ``(5) State.--The term `State' has the meaning given such \n        term in section 5(11) of the Child Protection Act of 1993.\n\n``SEC. 604.
