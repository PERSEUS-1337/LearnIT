FEDERAL CONSERVATION OF GASOLINE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) each day, as Americans contend with rising gasoline \n        prices, personal stories reflect the ways in which Americans \n        are altering their family budgets, including food budgets, to \n        cope with record high gasoline costs;\n            (2) as a consequence of economic pressures, Americans are \n        taking initiatives to reduce consumption of gasoline, such as--\n                    (A) driving less frequently;\n                    (B) altering daily routines; and\n                    (C) changing, or even cancelling, family vacation \n                plans;\n            (3) the conservation efforts being taken by Americans, on \n        their own initiative, bring hardships but save funds that can \n        be redirected--\n                    (A) to meet essential family needs; and\n                    (B) to relieve, to some extent, the demand for \n                gasoline;\n            (4) just as individuals are taking initiatives to reduce \n        gasoline consumption, the Federal Government, including \n        Congress, should take initiatives to conserve gasoline;\n            (5) such Government-wide initiatives to conserve gasoline \n        would send a signal to Americans that the Federal Government--\n                    (A) recognizes the burdens imposed by unprecedented \n                gasoline costs; and\n                    (B) will participate in activities to reduce \n                gasoline consumption;\n            (6) an overall reduction of gasoline consumption by the \n        Federal Government by even 3 percentage points would send a \n        strong signal that, as a nation, the United States is working \n        to conserve energy;\n            (7) in 2005, policies directed at reducing the usage of \n        energy in Federal agency and department buildings by 20 percent \n        by 2015, at a rate of a 2-percent reduction per calendar year, \n        were enacted by the President and Congress;\n            (8) in 2007, policies increasing the energy reduction goal \n        to 30 percent by 2015, at a rate of a 3-percent reduction per \n        calendar year, were enacted by the President and Congress; and\n            (9) Congress and the President should extend the precedent \n        of those mandatory conservation initiatives taken in 2005 and \n        2007 to usage by the Federal Government of gasoline.\n    (b) Reduction of Gasoline Usage by Federal Departments and \nAgencies.--For fiscal year 2009, each Federal department and agency \nshall develop and carry out initiatives to reduce by not less than 3 \npercent the annual consumption of gasoline by the department or agency.\n    (c) Congressional Conservation of Gasoline.--For fiscal year 2009, \nCongress shall develop and carry out initiatives to reduce by not less \nthan 3 percent the annual consumption of gasoline by Congress.\n\nSEC. 3. STUDIES AND REPORTS ON NATIONAL SPEED LIMIT AND FUTURE GASOLINE \n              CONSERVATION.\n\n    (a) National Speed Limit.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Energy \n        Information Administration shall conduct, and submit to \n        Congress a report describing the results of, a study of the \n        potential transportation fuel savings of imposing a national \n        speed limit on highways on the Interstate System of 60 miles \n        per hour.\n            (2) Inclusions.--The study under paragraph (1) shall \n        include--\n                    (A) an examination of the fuel efficiency of \n                automobiles in use as of the date on which the study is \n                conducted;\n                    (B) a description of the range at which those \n                automobiles are most fuel-efficient on highways on the \n                Interstate System;\n                    (C) an analysis of actions carried out by the \n                Federal Government, with the full support of Congress, \n                during the 1973-1974 energy crisis, resulting in a \n                national speed limit on highways on the Interstate \n                System of 55 miles per hour, which remained in effect \n                until 1995;\n                    (D) a recognition that in 1974, when fewer than \n                137,000,000 cars traveled in the United States (as \n                compared to 250,000,000 cars in 2006) and only 30 \n                percent of United States oil was imported from foreign \n                sources (as compared to 60 percent of oil so imported \n                on the date of enactment of this Act), 167,000 barrels \n                of oil per day were saved by the imposition of a \n                national speed limit, such that greater savings are \n                possible on the date of enactment of this Act than the \n                savings realized in 1974; and\n                    (E) a determination of whether a limitation on the \n                national speed limit on highways on the Interstate \n                System similar to the limitation described in \n                subparagraph (C) could serve as a model to generate \n                gasoline savings, through a national speed limit on \n                highways on the Interstate System of 60 miles per hour, \n                given the improved fuel efficiency of automobile \n                engines in use on the date of enactment of this Act.\n    (b) Future Gasoline Conservation.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United \n        States shall conduct, and submit to the Committees on Homeland \n        Security and Governmental Affairs, Environment and Public \n        Works, and Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the \n        Committees on House Administration, Transportation and \n        Infrastructure, and Energy and Commerce of the House of \n        Representatives a report describing the results of, a study to \n        determine whether additional gasoline reduction measures by \n        Federal departments and agencies and Congress are technically \n        feasible.\n            (2) Inclusion.--The report under paragraph (1) shall \n        include a proposed schedule of future gasoline reduction \n        measures, if the measures are determined to be technically \n        feasible."
