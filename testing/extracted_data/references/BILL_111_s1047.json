FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Internet is an invaluable tool that is critical to \n        the ability of the Nation to compete in a global economy. The \n        Internet provides instant access to research and boundless \n        information, and establishes digital connections between \n        individuals around the world.\n            (2) About 93 percent of youth ages 12 through 17 years are \n        online and nearly 45 percent of children ages 3 to 11 years \n        will use the Internet on a monthly basis in 2009. Eighty-nine \n        percent of youth 13 through 19 years of age have a profile on \n        social-networking sites. Eighty percent of teens 13 through 17 \n        years of age use cell phones, most of which have built-in \n        cameras.\n            (3) Internet safety education, coupled with technology \n        tools, is the most effective way to resolve and prevent the \n        problems and dangers relating to misuse of the Internet and \n        other new media.\n            (4) According to an empirical study of 1,379 fourth grade \n        students in Virginia, the first State to mandate Internet \n        safety education in its schools, the students improved their \n        responses to 8 of 10 questions after completing an Internet \n        safety education program, especially in 2 major areas, \n        uncomfortable content and cyberbullying.\n            (5) As a result of the enactment of the Children's Internet \n        Protection Act (Public Law 106-554; 114 Stat. 2763A-336) in \n        2000, which mandated that schools implement Internet safety \n        policies and technology protection measures to receive E-Rate \n        funding, most schools have developed acceptable use policies \n        and implemented filtering and other technology-based solutions \n        to help protect children.\n            (6) Most elementary and secondary school educators have \n        received little or no professional development training on \n        Internet safety. As a result, many students receive little or \n        no education on safe, responsible, and ethical use of Internet \n        and other new media.\n            (7) The widespread use of the Internet, cell phones, \n        interactive gaming, and other electronic communication devices \n        by children both inside and outside of school suggest that \n        acceptable use policies and filtering alone cannot resolve \n        Internet safety concerns, and that a greater focus on education \n        would be beneficial.\n            (8) In a national poll on children's health, parents ranked \n        Internet safety fifth among their top health concerns for \n        children. Educating parents about Internet safety is key to \n        empowering them to understand actual risks and to take an \n        active role in protecting their children.\n            (9) The problem of online harassment or cyberbullying of \n        youth by other youths is widespread, and results in a range of \n        children's experiences from minor irritation to severe \n        emotional harm. The Bureau of Justice Statistics has found that \n        online harassment tends to begin in third and fourth grade, \n        peaks in seventh and eighth grade, and continues in reduced \n        amounts throughout high school, college, and professional \n        schools.\n            (10) Young people face greater risks in the form of \n        electronic aggression and sexual solicitation from other young \n        people known to them than from strangers.\n            (11) Gang members increasingly are using the Internet as a \n        recruitment tool to entice would-be members and as an \n        intimidation tool to threaten rival gangs. Gang members use the \n        Internet in particular to promote their message.\n            (12) More research is needed in several areas of youth \n        online safety, including--\n                    (A) minor-to-minor solicitation to use the Internet \n                in an inappropriate manner;\n                    (B) the creation of problematic content by youths;\n                    (C) lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth \n                and youth with disabilities who may be particularly \n                vulnerable;\n                    (D) the interplay between socioeconomic class and \n                risk factors;\n                    (E) the role that pervasive digital image and video \n                capture devices play in harassment of youth by other \n                youth and youth production of problematic content;\n                    (F) the intersection of different mobile and \n                Internet-based technologies; and\n                    (G) the online activities of registered sex \n                offenders.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) facilitate research and identify best practices in \n        Internet safety education; and\n            (2) establish a competitive grant program for State \n        educational agencies, local educational agencies, and nonprofit \n        organizations to promote Internet safety education in the \n        community.\n\nSEC. 3.
