FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Tobacco use caused 20,800,000 premature deaths in the \n        United States in the 50 years since the Surgeon General's first \n        report on smoking in 1964.\n            (2) The 1964 Surgeon General's report linked cigarette \n        smoking to cancer, and since then, other tobacco products, \n        including cigars, cigarillos, roll-your-own products, and \n        smokeless tobacco have been causally linked to cancer.\n            (3) While substantial gains have been made since 1964, \n        tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in \n        the United States, responsible for approximately 500,000 \n        premature deaths each year.\n            (4) Tobacco use costs the United States approximately \n        $170,000,000,000 in direct medical costs and $156,000,000,000 \n        in lost productivity every year.\n            (5) More than 42,000,000 people in the United States still \n        smoke, and the tobacco industry continues to challenge tobacco \n        control victories in court, manipulate products to evade \n        existing regulations, introduce new and dangerous tobacco \n        products, and spend billions on marketing to deceive the public \n        and addict more children.\n            (6) An estimated 5,600,000 youth aged 17 and under are \n        projected to die prematurely from a tobacco-related illness if \n        prevalence rates do not change.\n            (7) Use of tobacco products in any form is not safe, \n        especially during adolescence, as such use can lead to nicotine \n        dependence and subsequent tobacco-related diseases and death.\n            (8) Adolescents are especially vulnerable to the effects of \n        nicotine and nicotine addiction and appear to show signs of \n        nicotine addiction at lower levels of exposure compared to \n        adults.\n            (9) Nicotine exposure during adolescence may have long \n        lasting adverse consequences on brain development.\n            (10) The likelihood of developing smoking-related cancers \n        increases with duration of smoking. Therefore those users that \n        start at younger ages and continue to smoke are at higher risk \n        for tobacco-related disease and death.\n            (11) National data show that 95 percent of adult smokers \n        begin smoking before they turn 21. The ages of 18 to 21 are a \n        critical period when many smokers move from experimental \n        smoking to regular, daily use.\n            (12) Young adults aged 18 to 24 are more than 2 times as \n        likely to use smokeless products as compared to older adults \n        aged 45 to 64.\n            (13) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the \n        Institute of Medicine recommend comprehensive and sustained \n        tobacco control programs and policies at the Federal, State, \n        and local level in order to reduce youth initiation and the \n        prevalence of tobacco use.\n            (14) Regulating the retail environment, actively enforcing \n        laws, and educating retailers are strategies that Federal, \n        State, and local governments can take to restrict the \n        availability of tobacco products to youth.\n            (15) The recent report of the Institute of Medicine \n        entitled, ``Public Health Implications of Raising the Minimum \n        Age of Legal Access to Tobacco Products'', concluded that \n        raising the minimum legal age of sale of tobacco products \n        nationwide will reduce tobacco initiation, particularly among \n        adolescents aged 15 to 17, and will improve health across the \n        lifespan and save lives. Specifically, the report said that \n        raising the minimum legal age of sale of tobacco products \n        nationwide to age 21 would, over time, lead to a 12-percent \n        decrease in smoking prevalence.\n            (16) The Institute of Medicine report also predicts that \n        raising the minimum legal age of sale of tobacco products \n        nationwide to age 21 would result in 223,000 fewer premature \n        deaths, 50,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer, and 4,200,000 \n        fewer years of life lost for those born between 2000 and 2019. \n        In addition, the report concluded that raising the minimum \n        legal age of sale would result in near immediate reductions in \n        preterm birth, low birth weight, and sudden infant death \n        syndrome.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION AND ENFORCEMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \nincluding any Federal regulation, it shall be unlawful to sell or \ndistribute a tobacco product to anyone under the age of 21.\n    (b) Enforcement.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n        is authorized to enforce the prohibition under subsection (a) \n        and shall take necessary action to enforce such prohibition, \n        including, as appropriate--\n                    (A) conducting undercover compliance checks, \n                performing retailer inspections, initiating enforcement \n                actions for noncompliance, and taking any other \n                measures appropriate to help ensure nationwide \n                compliance with such prohibition; and\n                    (B) establishing requirements that retailers check \n                identification or use other methods to ensure \n                compliance with subsection (a), or issuing guidance \n                concerning the responsibility of retailers to ensure \n                such compliance.\n            (2) Enforcement authority.--In the case of a violation of \n        subsection (a), the Secretary of Health and Human Services may \n        apply the penalties under section 303 of the Federal Food, \n        Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 333), as though such \n        subsection (a) were a regulation promulgated under section \n        906(d)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n        U.S.C. 387f(d)(1)), notwithstanding paragraph (3)(A)(ii) of \n        such section 906(d).\n    (c) Definition.--In this Act, the term ``tobacco product'' has the \nmeaning given such term in section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, \nand Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(rr)).\n\nSEC. 4. NON-PREEMPTION.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prevent a State or local \ngovernmental entity from establishing, enforcing, or maintaining a law \nwith respect to sales of tobacco to individuals below a minimum age, \nprovided that such State or local law is at least as restrictive as the \nFederal law."
