FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) In 1985, the number of bachelor's degrees awarded \n        annually in engineering peaked at 77,572, and that number has \n        decreased every year since 1985. According to the National \n        Science Foundation, the number of people who earned bachelor's \n        degrees in engineering declined to approximately 60,000 in \n        2002.\n            (2) In 1996, the number of doctoral degrees awarded \n        annually in engineering peaked at 6,309.\n            (3) Since 1983, the unemployment rate for science and \n        engineering jobs has been at least 2 percent lower than the \n        unemployment rate in the United States for all fields of \n        employment.\n            (4) In 2004, engineers held 1,400,000 jobs in the United \n        States, and the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Studies \n        has projected that 611,000 new engineering jobs will open up \n        during the 10-year period from 2004 through 2014.\n            (5) Over one-quarter of the science and engineering \n        workforce is comprised of individuals who are older than age 50 \n        and who are expected to retire in the next 15 years.\n            (6) The United States is facing a shortage of engineers \n        because the number of engineering graduates is consistently \n        surpassed by the growth in engineering jobs, many engineers are \n        nearing retirement, and many new engineering graduates take \n        jobs in other fields.\n            (7) The United States should take advantage of available \n        intellectual resources by recruiting students from the top \n        third of high school graduates to pursue engineering degrees \n        and to become the next generation of engineers.\n            (8) The United States should develop education standards, \n        assessments, and curricula that reflect the engineering needs \n        of our Nation now and in the future.\n            (9) Most engineering jobs require a bachelor's degree in \n        engineering, and many States require additional years of study \n        beyond a bachelor's degree to qualify for and maintain the \n        Professional Engineer designation.\n            (10) The years of study required to be able to perform \n        engineering jobs result in a large financial burden.\n            (11) Providing scholarships and loan forgiveness for \n        engineering graduates who work in the engineering field will \n        make it easier for such graduates to enter and continue to work \n        in the engineering profession, a profession that is vital to \n        the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. STRATEGIC TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING PROGRAM (STEP).\n\n    Title VII of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1133 et \nseq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new part:\n\n                             ``PART E--STEP\n\n``SEC. 771.
