FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Students in the United States should be the world \n        leaders in mathematics achievement within the next decade.\n            (2) The Third International Mathematics and Science Study \n        (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the ``TIMSS''), the \n        largest international study ever undertaken of how students \n        perform in mathematics and science, demonstrated that the \n        mathematics skills of students in the United States (including \n        the top 10 percent of students in the United States) lag far \n        behind the skills of students in many other nations, even \n        though students in the United States spend more class time on \n        mathematics and science and usually are assigned more homework.\n            (3) Research indicates that the problems of mathematics and \n        science education in the United States stem largely from the \n        lack of a coherent and focused curriculum designed for high-\n        level learning goals, the lack of assessment instruments \n        aligned with such curricula, and the lack of a sufficient \n        commitment by colleges and universities in the United States to \n        high-quality teacher preparation and professional development \n        programs.\n            (4) Core problems exist with the courses of study and the \n        teaching style on which many schools in the United States rely \n        to instruct students in mathematics and science, as reflected \n        in the conclusion of the National Science Foundation that \n        schools in the United States teach math concepts in \n        superficial, and ultimately ineffective, ways.\n            (5) A developed framework for mathematics and science \n        should be coherent, focused, and give balanced attention to \n        basic skills, conceptual understanding, problem solving, \n        reasoning, and communication skills, and appropriate uses of \n        technology.\n            (6) The failure of mathematics and science teaching methods \n        in the United States requires a systemic retraining of, and an \n        increased emphasis on the professional development of, teachers \n        in the United States.\n            (7) Teachers of mathematics and science should be well-\n        trained professionals who combine sound knowledge of subject \n        matter with the necessary skills and a good understanding of \n        student learning and assessment.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is hereby established a commission to be \nknown as the ``Commission for American Mathematics Leadership'' (in \nthis Act referred to as the ``Commission'').\n    (b) Composition.--The Commission shall be composed of 12 members as \nfollows:\n            (1) Four members appointed by the President.\n            (2) Four members appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n        Representatives, in consultation with the minority leader of \n        the House of Representatives.\n            (3) Four members appointed by the President pro tempore of \n        the Senate, in consultation with the minority leader of the \n        Senate.\n\nSEC. 4. DUTIES OF COMMISSION.\n\n    The Commission shall, in coordination with the National Academy of \nSciences--\n            (1) review the existing research base on mathematics \n        education leadership, including the status of mathematics \n        education in the United States relative to international \n        competitors;\n            (2) propose professional development priorities to assure \n        that the teaching of mathematics at all educational levels in \n        the United States is strengthened; and\n            (3) formulate an implementation proposal, including \n        specific recommendations which can be implemented by \n        appropriate public and private agencies, for assuring world \n        class achievement of the United States in mathematics education \n        within a decade.\n\nSEC. 5. REPORT.\n\n    Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this \nAct, the Commission shall submit to the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives and to the President pro tempore of the Senate a report \nincluding the findings and recommendations of the Commission under \nsection 4.\n\nSEC. 6. POWERS.\n\n    The Commission may, for the purpose of carrying out its duties, \nhold such hearings, sit and act at such times and places, take such \ntestimony, and receive such evidence, as the Commission considers \nappropriate.\n\nSEC. 7. COMMISSION PROCEDURES.\n\n    (a) Chairman.--A chairman of the Commission shall be elected by the \nmembers of the Commission.\n    (b) Quorum.--Seven members of the Commission shall constitute a \nquorum for the purpose of conducting meetings.\n\nSEC. 8. PERSONNEL MATTERS.\n\n    (a) Pay of Members.--Members of the Commission shall not be paid by \nreason of their service as members.\n    (b) Travel Expenses.--The members of the Commission shall be \nallowed, while away from their homes or regular places of business in \nthe performance of services for the Commission, travel expenses \n(including per diem in lieu of subsistence) in the same manner as \npersons employed intermittently in Government service are allowed \nexpenses under section 5703 of title 5, United States Code.\n\nSEC. 9. ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT.\n\n    The National Academy of Sciences shall provide the administrative \nsupport services necessary for the Commission to carry out its duties \nunder this Act.\n\nSEC. 10. FUNDING.\n\n    Out of any amounts appropriated for the National Science \nFoundation, $750,000 shall be available for activities of the \nCommission.\n\nSEC. 11. TERMINATION OF COMMISSION.\n\n    The Commission shall terminate 30 days after submitting the report \nrequired under section 5."
