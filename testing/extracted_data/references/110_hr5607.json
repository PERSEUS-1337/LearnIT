    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``State Secret Protection Act of \n2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. STATE SECRET PRIVILEGE.\n\n    In any civil action brought in Federal or State court, the \nGovernment has a privilege to refuse to give evidence and to prevent \nany person from giving evidence only if the Government shows that \npublic disclosure of the evidence that the Government seeks to protect \nwould be reasonably likely to cause significant harm to the national \ndefense or the diplomatic relations of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. PROTECTION OF SECRETS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The court shall take steps to protect sensitive \ninformation that comes before the court in connection with proceedings \nunder this Act. These steps may include reviewing evidence or pleadings \nand hearing arguments ex parte, issuing protective orders, requiring \nsecurity clearance for parties or counsel, placing material under seal, \nand applying security procedures established under the Classified \nInformation Procedures Act for classified information to protect the \nsensitive information.\n    (b) In Camera Proceedings.--All hearings and other proceedings \nunder this Act may be conducted in camera, as needed to protect \ninformation or evidence that may be subject to the privilege.\n    (c) Participation of Counsel.--Participation of counsel in \nproceedings under this Act shall not be limited unless the court \ndetermines that the limitation is a necessary step to protect evidence \nthe Government asserts is protected by the privilege or that supports \nthe claim of privilege and that no less restrictive means of protection \nsuffice. The court shall give a written explanation of its decision to \nthe parties and their counsel, which may be placed under seal.\n    (d) Production of Adequate Substitute Pending Resolution of the \nClaim of Privilege.--If at any point during its consideration of the \nGovernment's claim, the court determines that disclosure of information \nto a party or counsel, or disclosure of information by a party that \nalready possesses it, presents a risk of a harm described in section 2 \nthat cannot be addressed through less restrictive means provided in \nthis section, the court may require the Government to produce an \nadequate substitute, such as a redacted version, summary of the \ninformation, or stipulation regarding the relevant facts, if the court \ndeems such a substitute feasible. The substitute must be reviewed and \napproved by the court and must provide counsel with a substantially \nequivalent opportunity to assess and challenge the Government's claim \nof privilege as would the protected information.\n\nSEC. 4. ASSERTION OF THE PRIVILEGE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Government may assert the privilege in \nconnection with any claim in a civil action to which it is a party or \nmay intervene in a civil action to which it is not a party to do so.\n    (b) Supporting Affidavits.--If the Government asserts the \nprivilege, the Government shall provide the court with an affidavit \nsigned by the head of the executive branch agency with responsibility \nfor, and control over, the evidence asserted to be subject to the \nprivilege. In the affidavit, the head of the agency shall explain the \nfactual basis for the claim of privilege. The Government shall make \npublic an unclassified version of the affidavit.\n\nSEC. 5. PRELIMINARY PROCEEDINGS.\n\n    (a) Preliminary Review by Court.--Once the Government has asserted \nthe privilege, and before the Court makes any determinations under \nsection 6, the court shall undertake a preliminary review of the \ninformation the Government asserts is protected by the privilege and \nprovide the Government an opportunity to seek protective measures under \nthis Act. After any initial protective measures are in place, the Court \nshall proceed to the consideration of additional preliminary matters \nunder this section.\n    (b) Consideration of Whether to Appoint Special Master or Expert \nWitness.--The court shall consider whether the appointment of a special \nmaster with appropriate expertise or an expert witness, or both, would \nfacilitate the court's duties under this Act.\n    (c) Index of Materials.--The court may order the Government to \nprovide a manageable index of evidence the Government asserts is \nsubject to the privilege. The index must correlate statements made in \nthe affidavit required under this Act with portions of the evidence the \nGovernment asserts is subject to the privilege. The index shall be \nspecific enough to afford the court an adequate foundation to review \nthe basis of the assertion of the privilege by the Government.\n    (d) Prehearing Conferences.--After the preliminary review the court \nshall hold one or more conferences with the parties to--\n            (1) determine any steps needed to protect sensitive \n        information;\n            (2) define the issues presented by the Government's claim \n        of privilege, including whether it is possible to allow the \n        parties to complete nonprivileged discovery before determining \n        whether the claim of privilege is valid;\n            (3) order disclosure of evidence to the court needed to \n        assess the claim, including all evidence the Government asserts \n        is protected by the privilege and other evidence related to the \n        Government's claim;\n            (4) resolve any disputes regarding participation of counsel \n        or parties in proceedings relating to the claim, including \n        access to the Government's evidence and arguments;\n            (5) set a schedule for completion of discovery related to \n        the Government's claim; and\n            (6) take other steps as needed, such as ordering counsel or \n        parties to obtain security clearances.\n    (e) Security Clearances.--If the court orders a party or counsel to \nobtain a security clearance, the Government shall promptly conduct the \nnecessary review and determine whether or not to provide the clearance. \nIf the necessary clearance is not promptly provided to counsel for a \nparty, the party may propose that alternate or additional counsel be \ncleared. If within a reasonable time, alternative or additional counsel \nselected by the party cannot be cleared, then the court, in \nconsultation with that party and that party's counsel, shall appoint \nanother attorney, who can obtain the necessary clearance promptly, to \nrepresent the party in proceedings under this Act. When a security \nclearance for counsel sought under this Act is denied, the court may \nrequire the Government to present an ex parte explanation of that \ndenial.\n\nSEC. 6. PROCEDURES AND STANDARD FOR ASSESSING THE PRIVILEGE CLAIM.\n\n    (a) Hearing.--The court shall conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether the privilege claim is valid.\n    (b) Basis for Ruling.--\n            (1) Generally.--The court may not determine that the \n        privilege is valid until the court has reviewed--\n                    (A) except as provided in paragraph (2), all of the \n                evidence that the Government asserts is privileged;\n                    (B) the affidavits, evidence, memoranda and other \n                filings submitted by the parties related to the \n                privilege claim; and\n                    (C) any other evidence that the court determines it \n                needs to rule on the privilege.\n            (2) Sampling in certain cases.--Where the volume of \n        evidence the Government asserts is privileged precludes a \n        timely review of each item of evidence, or the court otherwise \n        determines a review of all of that evidence is not feasible, \n        the court may substitute a sufficient sampling of the evidence \n        if the court determines that there is no reasonable possibility \n        that review of the additional evidence would change the court's \n        determination on the privilege claim and the evidence reviewed \n        is sufficient to enable to court to make the independent \n        assessment required by this section.\n    (c) Standard.--In ruling on the validity of the privilege, the \ncourt shall make an independent assessment of whether the harm \nidentified by the Government, as required by section 2, is reasonably \nlikely to occur should the privilege not be upheld. The court shall \nweigh testimony from Government experts in the same manner as it does, \nand along with, any other expert testimony.\n    (d) Burden of Proof.--The Government shall have the burden of proof \nas to the nature of the harm and as to the likelihood of its \noccurrence.\n\nSEC. 7. EFFECT OF COURT DETERMINATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--If the court determines that the privilege is not \nvalidly asserted as to an item of evidence, the item may be disclosed \nto a nongovernmental party or admitted at trial, subject to the other \nrules of evidence. If the court determines that the privilege is \nvalidly asserted as to an item, that item shall not be disclosed to a \nnongovernmental party or the public.\n    (b) Nonprivileged Substitute.--\n            (1) Court consideration of substitute.--If the court finds \n        that the privilege is validly asserted as to an item of \n        material evidence and it is possible to craft a nonprivileged \n        substitute, such as those described in section 3(d), for the \n        privileged evidence that would provide the parties a \n        substantially equivalent opportunity to litigate the case, the \n        court shall order the Government to produce the substitute to \n        the satisfaction of the court.\n            (2) Refusal to provide.--In a civil action brought against \n        the Government, if the court orders the Government to provide a \n        nonprivileged substitute for evidence or information and the \n        Government fails to comply, in addition to any other \n        appropriate sanctions, the court shall find against the \n        Government on the factual or legal issue to which the \n        privileged information is relevant. If the action is not \n        brought against the Government, the court shall weigh the \n        equities and make appropriate orders as provided in subsection \n        (d).\n    (c) Opportunity to Complete Discovery.--The court shall not resolve \nany issue or claim and shall not grant a motion to dismiss or motion \nfor summary judgment based on the state secrets privilege and adversely \nto any party against whom the Government's privilege claim has been \nupheld until that party has had a full opportunity to complete \ndiscovery of nonprivileged evidence and to litigate the issue or claim \nto which the privileged evidence is relevant without regard to that \nprivileged information.\n    (d) Appropriate Orders in the Interest of Justice.--After reviewing \nall available evidence, and only after determining that privileged \nevidence, for which it is impossible to create a nonprivileged \nsubstitute, is necessary to decide a factual or legal issue or claim, \nthe court shall weigh the equities and make appropriate orders in the \ninterest of justice, such as striking the testimony of a witness, \nfinding in favor of or against a party on a factual or legal issue to \nwhich the evidence is relevant, or dismissing a claim or counterclaim.\n\nSEC. 8. INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL.\n\n    (a) In General.--The courts of appeal shall have jurisdiction of an \nappeal by any party from any interlocutory decision or order of a \ndistrict court of the United States under this Act.\n    (b) Appeal.--\n            (1) In general.--An appeal taken under this section either \n        before or during trial shall be expedited by the court of \n        appeals.\n            (2) During trial.--If an appeal is taken during trial, the \n        district court shall adjourn the trial until the appeal is \n        resolved and the court of appeals--\n                    (A) shall hear argument on appeal as expeditiously \n                as possible after adjournment of the trial by the \n                district court;\n                    (B) may dispense with written briefs other than the \n                supporting materials previously submitted to the trial \n                court;\n                    (C) shall render its decision as expeditiously as \n                possible after argument on appeal; and\n                    (D) may dispense with the issuance of a written \n                opinion in rendering its decision.\n\nSEC. 9. REPORTING.\n\n    (a) In General.--Consistent with applicable authorities and duties, \nincluding those conferred by the Constitution of the United States upon \nthe executive and legislative branches, the Attorney General shall \nreport in writing to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of \nthe House of Representatives, the Select Committee on Intelligence of \nthe Senate, and the chairmen and ranking minority members of the \nCommittees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and Senate \non any case in which the Government invokes a state secrets privilege, \nnot later than 30 calendar days after the date of such assertion. Each \nreport submitted under this subsection shall include all affidavits \nfiled under this Act by the Government.\n    (b) Operation and Effectiveness.--\n            (1) In general.--The Attorney General shall deliver to the \n        committees of Congress described in subsection (a) a report \n        concerning the operation and effectiveness of this Act and \n        including suggested amendments to the Act.\n            (2) Deadline.--The Attorney General shall submit this \n        report not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of \n        this Act, and every year thereafter until the date that is 3 \n        years after that date of enactment. After the date that is 3 \n        years after that date of enactment, the Attorney General shall \n        submit a report under paragraph (1) as necessary.\n\nSEC. 10. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n    This Act provides the only privilege that may be asserted based on \nstate secrets and the standards and procedures set forth in this Act \napply to any assertion of the privilege.\n\nSEC. 11. APPLICATION.\n\n    This Act applies to claims pending on or after the date of \nenactment of this Act. A court also may relieve a party or its legal \nrepresentative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding that was \nbased, in whole or in part, on the state secrets privilege if--\n            (1) the motion for relief is filed with the rendering court \n        within one year of the date of enactment of this Act;\n            (2) the underlying judgment, order, or proceeding from \n        which the party seeks relief was entered after January 1, 2002; \n        and\n            (3) the claim on which the judgement, order, or proceeding \n        is based is--\n                    (A) against the Government; or\n                    (B) arises out of conduct by persons acting in the \n                capacity of a Government officer, employee, or agent."
