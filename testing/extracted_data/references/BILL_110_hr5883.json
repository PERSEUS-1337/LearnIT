FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) As the world's largest economy, the United States has \n        an enormous stake in the future of the global trading system.\n            (2) Exports are a crucial force driving the United States \n        economy and job creation.\n            (3) While nearly 97 percent of United States exporters are \n        small and medium enterprises (SMEs), SMEs account for just over \n        one-fourth of exports, leaving much room for growth.\n            (4) Two-thirds of United States exporters have fewer than \n        20 employees and sell to just one foreign market.\n            (5) Manufacturers account for 61 percent of total United \n        States exports with small manufacturers accounting for \n        approximately 15 percent of total United States exports. Thirty \n        percent of small manufacturers do not currently export but \n        would consider doing so if they had more help in securing vital \n        information on foreign markets, customers, and export \n        procedures.\n            (6) United States small and medium enterprises face tough \n        competition from trading partners of the United States that \n        aggressively undertake export promotion programs that directly \n        support and underwrite the expanded growth in trade of their \n        small and medium enterprises.\n            (7) United States trade promotion is carried out in part by \n        21 departments and agencies of the Federal Government. \n        Representatives from these Federal departments and agencies are \n        members of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC), a \n        Federal committee that has not lived up to congressional intent \n        to provide a seamless offering of export promotion products and \n        services due in part to the inadequate allocation of resources \n        and a lack of ultimate decision making budget input authority \n        to ensure effective results are achieved for the invested \n        resources.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act and the amendments made by this Act is to \nimprove the performance and results of trade promotion policies and \nprograms of the Federal Government in accordance with the Government \nPerformance and Results Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-62).\n\n         TITLE I--AMENDMENTS TO EXPORT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 1988\n\nSEC. 101.
