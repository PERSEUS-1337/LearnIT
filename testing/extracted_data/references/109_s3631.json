    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Missing Mercury in Manufacturing \nMonitoring and Mitigation Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) mercury and mercury compounds are highly toxic to \n        humans, ecosystems, and wildlife;\n            (2) as many as 10 percent of women in the United States of \n        childbearing age have mercury in their bloodstreams at a level \n        that could pose risks to their unborn babies, and as many as \n        630,000 children born annually in the United States are at risk \n        of neurological problems relating to mercury exposure in utero;\n            (3) the most significant source of mercury exposure to \n        people in the United States is ingestion of mercury-\n        contaminated fish;\n            (4) the Environmental Protection Agency reports that, as of \n        2004, as a result of mercury contamination--\n                    (A) 44 States have fish advisories covering more \n                than 13,000,000 lake acres and more than 750,000 river \n                miles;\n                    (B) in 21 States, the freshwater fish advisories \n                are statewide; and\n                    (C) in 12 States, the coastal fish advisories are \n                statewide;\n            (5) the long-term solution to mercury pollution is to \n        minimize global mercury use and releases of mercury to \n        eventually achieve reduced contamination levels in the \n        environment, rather than reducing fish consumption, since \n        uncontaminated fish represents a critical and healthy source of \n        nutrition for people worldwide;\n            (6) an estimated additional 24,000 to 30,000 tons of \n        mercury are used at mercury cell chlor-alkali plants worldwide;\n            (7) mercury pollution is a transboundary pollutant that--\n                    (A) is deposited locally, regionally, and globally; \n                and\n                    (B) affects bodies of water near industrial areas, \n                such as the Great Lakes, as well as bodies of water in \n                remote areas, such as the Arctic Circle;\n            (8)(A) of the approximately 30 plants in the United States \n        that produce chlorine, only 8 use the obsolete ``mercury cell'' \n        chlor-alkali process; and\n            (B) the 8 plants described in subparagraph (A) that use the \n        mercury cell chlor-alkali process release or lose a quantity of \n        mercury that rivals the mercury emissions of all coal-fired \n        power plants in the United States;\n            (9)(A) only about 10 percent of the total quantity of \n        chlorine and caustic soda produced comes from the chlor-alkali \n        plants described in paragraph (8) that use the mercury cell \n        chlor-alkali process; and\n            (B) cost-effective alternatives are available and in use in \n        the remaining 90 percent of chlorine and caustic soda \n        production, and other countries, including Japan, have already \n        banned the mercury cell chlor-alkali process;\n            (10) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the chlor-\n        alkali industry in the United States possesses approximately \n        2,500 tons of mercury at facilities using the mercury cell \n        process and historically has used substantially greater \n        quantities of mercury because many more facilities in the past \n        used the mercury cell process;\n            (11) the chlor-alkali industry acknowledges that--\n                    (A) mercury can contaminate products manufactured \n                at mercury cell facilities; and\n                    (B) the use of some of those products results in \n                the direct and indirect release of mercury;\n            (12) despite those quantities of mercury known to have been \n        used or to be in use, the chlor-alkali industry and the \n        Environmental Protection Agency have failed--\n                    (A) to adequately account for the disposition of \n                the mercury used at those facilities; and\n                    (B) to accurately estimate current mercury \n                emissions; and\n            (13) it is critically important that the United States work \n        aggressively toward the monitoring and mitigation of \n        domestically-used mercury.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    Congress declares that the United States should develop policies \nand programs that will--\n            (1) reduce mercury use and emissions within the United \n        States;\n            (2) reduce mercury releases from the reservoir of mercury \n        currently in use or circulation within the United States; and\n            (3) reduce exposures to mercury, particularly exposures of \n        women of childbearing age and young children.\n\nSEC. 4. USE OF MERCURY IN CHLORINE AND CAUSTIC SODA MANUFACTURING.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title I of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 \nU.S.C. 2601 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 6 the \nfollowing:\n\n``SEC. 6A.
