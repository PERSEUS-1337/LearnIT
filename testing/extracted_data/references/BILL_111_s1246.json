FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) many families lack access to upfront capital to make \n        cost-effective energy improvements to homes and apartments;\n            (2) a number of States, local governments, and energy \n        utilities are considering enacting, or have already enacted, \n        innovative energy efficiency and renewable energy finance \n        programs;\n            (3) home retrofits create and support jobs in the United \n        States in a number of fields, including jobs for electricians, \n        heating and air conditioning installers, carpenters, \n        construction, roofers, industrial truck drivers, energy \n        auditors and inspectors, construction managers, insulation \n        workers, renewable energy installers, and others;\n            (4) cost-effective energy improvements pay for themselves \n        over time and also save consumers energy, reduce energy demand \n        and peak electricity demand, move the United States towards \n        energy independence, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and \n        improve the value of residential properties;\n            (5) modeling has shown that--\n                    (A) energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades \n                in just 15 percent of residential buildings in the \n                United States would require $280,000,000,000 in \n                financing; and\n                    (B) the upgrades described in subparagraph (A) \n                could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than a \n                gigaton; and\n            (6) home retrofits--\n                    (A) are a key strategy to reducing global warming \n                pollution; and\n                    (B) create and support green jobs.\n\nSEC. 3.
