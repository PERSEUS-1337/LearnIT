    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Radiation Experimentation \nCompensation Act of 1994''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND APOLOGY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) since the 1940's, the Federal Government has \n        intentionally conducted secret radiation experiments in the \n        United States without the informed consent or knowledge of the \n        individuals on whom the experiments were performed;\n            (2) such radiation experiments included, but were not \n        limited to, experiments involving injections of plutonium, \n        ingestion of irradiated food, exposure to atmospheric \n        radiation, and the prescription of radioactive medication to \n        pregnant women;\n            (3) the Federal Government performed such experiments not \n        in order to achieve medical or health benefits for the \n        individuals used in the tests, but for research purposes, to \n        allow Federal Government scientists and health specialists to \n        study the effects of radiation on the human body;\n            (4) at the time of such experiments and in the years \n        following the experiments, the Federal Government failed to \n        inform the individuals tested, or their families, about the \n        nature and effects of the tests;\n            (5) the Federal Government has harmed the subjects of such \n        radiation experiments;\n            (6) the Congress presumes that the exposure to radiation of \n        the subjects of such experiments has generated an excess of \n        cancers and other debilitating diseases and health problems for \n        such subjects;\n            (7) the Federal Government should recognize that the lives \n        and health of the innocent individuals who were the subjects of \n        such experiments were put at risk by the individuals' unknowing \n        and involuntary participation in radiation experiments; and\n            (8) the Federal Government should assume responsibility for \n        the harm caused by its actions regarding the experiments.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a \nprocedure to make partial restitution to the individuals described in \nsubsection (a) for the burdens they have borne for the Nation as a \nwhole, although monetary compensation can never fully compensate them.\n    (c) Apology.--The Congress apologizes on behalf of the Nation to \nthe individuals described in subsection (a) and their families for the \nhardships they have endured because of the experiments described in \nsubsection (a).\n\nSEC. 3. TRUST FUND.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is established in the Treasury of the \nUnited States a trust fund to be known as the ``Radiation \nExperimentation Compensation Trust Fund'' (in this Act referred to as \nthe ``Fund''), which shall be administered by the Secretary of the \nTreasury.\n    (b) Investment of Amounts in Fund.--Amounts in the Fund shall be \ninvested in accordance with section 9702 of title 31, United States \nCode, and any interest on, and proceeds from, any such investment shall \nbe credited to and become a part of the Fund.\n    (c) Availability of Fund.--Amounts in the Fund shall be available \nonly for disbursement by the Attorney General under section 5.\n    (d) Termination.--\n            (1) Time of termination.--The Fund shall terminate not \n        later than the earlier of--\n                    (A) the date on which the amount authorized to be \n                appropriated to the Fund by subsection (e), and any \n                income earned on such amount, have been expended from \n                the Fund; or\n                    (B) 22 years after the date of the enactment of \n                this Act.\n            (2) Amounts remaining in fund.--At the end of the 22-year \n        period referred to in paragraph (1)(B), if all of the amounts \n        in the Fund have not been expended, investments of amounts in \n        the Fund shall be liquidated, the receipts of such liquidation \n        shall be deposited in the Fund, and all funds remaining in the \n        Fund shall be deposited in the miscellaneous receipts account \n        in the Treasury.\n    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to the Fund $100,000,000.
