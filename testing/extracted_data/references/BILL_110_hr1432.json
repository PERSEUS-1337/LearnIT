CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) prescription drugs make up 11 percent of the national \n        health care spending but are 1 of the largest and fastest \n        growing health care expenditures;\n            (2) 56 percent of all prescriptions dispensed in the United \n        States are generic drugs, yet they account for only 13 percent \n        of all expenditures;\n            (3) generic drugs, on average, cost 63 percent less than \n        their brand-name counterparts;\n            (4) consumers and the health care system would benefit from \n        free and open competition in the pharmaceutical market and the \n        removal of obstacles to the introduction of generic drugs;\n            (5) full and free competition in the pharmaceutical \n        industry, and the full enforcement of antitrust law to prevent \n        anticompetitive practices in this industry, will lead to lower \n        prices, greater innovation, and inure to the general benefit of \n        consumers;\n            (6) the Federal Trade Commission has determined that some \n        brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers collude with generic \n        drug manufacturers to delay the marketing of competing, low-\n        cost, generic drugs;\n            (7) collusion by the brand name pharmaceutical \n        manufacturers is contrary to free competition, to the interests \n        of consumers, and to the principles underlying antitrust law;\n            (8) in 2005, 2 appellate court decisions reversed the \n        Federal Trade Commission's long-standing position, and upheld \n        settlements that include pay-offs by brand name pharmaceutical \n        manufacturers to generic manufacturers designed to keep generic \n        competition off the market;\n            (9) in the 6 months following the March 2005 court \n        decisions, the Federal Trade Commission found there were three \n        settlement agreements in which the generic received \n        compensation and agreed to a restriction on its ability to \n        market the product;\n            (10) the Federal Trade Commission found that more than \\2/\n        3\\ of the approximately ten settlement agreements made in 2006 \n        include a pay-off from the brand in exchange for a promise by \n        the generic company to delay entry into the market; and\n            (11) settlements which include a payment from a brand name \n        manufacturer to a generic manufacturer to delay entry by \n        generic drugs are anti-competitive and contrary to the \n        interests of consumers.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to enhance competition in the pharmaceutical market by \n        prohibiting anticompetitive agreements and collusion between \n        brand name and generic drug manufacturers intended to keep \n        generic drugs off the market;\n            (2) to support the purpose and intent of antitrust law by \n        prohibiting anticompetitive agreements and collusion in the \n        pharmaceutical industry; and\n            (3) to clarify the law to prohibit payments from brand name \n        to generic drug manufacturers with the purpose to prevent or \n        delay the entry of competition from generic drugs.\n\nSEC. 3. UNLAWFUL COMPENSATION FOR DELAY.\n\n    The Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating section 28 as section 29; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 27 the following:\n\n``SEC. 28.
