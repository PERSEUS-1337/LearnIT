    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``International Uranium Extraction and \nMilling Control Act of 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Uranium is a naturally occurring element found around \n        the world in low levels in rock, soil, and water.\n            (2) Uranium ore extracted through mining and other methods \n        is the principal component of the concentrate known as \n        yellowcake, a precursor to the production of highly enriched \n        uranium.\n            (3) Uranium is a necessary element in any fuel cycle \n        capable of producing fissile material usable for a nuclear \n        explosive device, whether such device utilizes uranium or \n        plutonium.\n            (4) According to the World Nuclear Association, over 40,000 \n        metric tons of uranium ore were produced worldwide in 2007.\n            (5) The wide availability of naturally occurring uranium, a \n        favorable commercial environment, and the growing demand for \n        nuclear power may lead to a significant expansion of the \n        production of uranium ore worldwide, including in countries \n        with nuclear weapons programs such as Iran and North Korea, \n        which maintain that their production is intended for peaceful \n        purposes.\n            (6) Over the past two decades, Iran has opened as many as \n        10 uranium mines. The ore from these mines is estimated to \n        contain concentrations of uranium too low to be suitable for \n        legitimate commercial use.\n            (7) During the 1980s and 1990s, Syria, with technical \n        assistance from the International Atomic Energy Agency, studied \n        the feasibility of uranium extraction and conducted preliminary \n        extraction activities. Like Iran, Syria's uranium ore was found \n        to be unsuitable for commercial use.\n            (8) Iran and Syria can make use of their domestic sources \n        of uranium ore for military purposes only if they have access \n        to extraction and milling goods, services, and technology from \n        other countries.\n            (9) The significant reserves of uranium ore in North Korea \n        are a potential source for other countries with covert nuclear \n        weapons programs.\n            (10) Unlike other nuclear materials and facilities, the \n        processes of extracting uranium ore and milling it into \n        yellowcake are not subject to safeguards by the International \n        Atomic Energy Agency.\n            (11) Iran, North Korea, and Syria have been sanctioned by \n        the United States and other countries as a result of their \n        nuclear and other programs involving weapons of mass \n        destruction.\n            (12) Transfers of nuclear and certain other sensitive \n        goods, services, or technology to Iran, North Korea, and Syria \n        are prohibited by the laws of the United States.\n            (13) Foreign persons that make such transfers may be \n        sanctioned by the United States pursuant to the Iran, North \n        Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act.\n            (14) Denying Iran, North Korea, and Syria access to the \n        goods, services, and technology needed to utilize their \n        domestic sources of uranium ore for their nuclear weapons \n        programs should be a significant nonproliferation goal of the \n        United States and like-minded countries.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It shall be the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to oppose the transfer to Iran, North Korea, and Syria \n        of goods, services, or technology relevant to their capability \n        to extract or mill uranium ore; and\n            (2) to work with like-minded countries to impose \n        restrictions on such transfers internationally.\n\nSEC. 4. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE IRAN, NORTH KOREA, AND SYRIA \n              NONPROLIFERATION ACT.\n\n    Section 2(a) of the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation \nAct (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1), by redesignating subparagraphs (A) \n        through (E) as clauses (i) through (v), respectively;\n            (2) by redesignating paragraphs (1) and (2) as \n        subparagraphs (A) and (B), respectively;\n            (3) in subparagraph (B), as redesignated--\n                    (A) by striking ``paragraph (1)'' and inserting \n                ``subparagraph (A)''; and\n                    (B) by striking the period at the end and inserting \n                ``; or'';\n            (4) by striking all that precedes subparagraph (A), as \n        redesignated, and inserting the following:\n    ``(a) Reports.--The President shall, at the times specified in \nsubsection (b), submit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House \nof Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate \na report identifying every foreign person with respect to whom there is \ncredible information indicating that person--\n            ``(1) on or after January 1, 1999, transferred to or \n        acquired from Iran, on or after January 1, 2005, transferred to \n        or acquired from Syria, or on or after January 1, 2006, \n        transferred to or acquired from North Korea--''; and\n            (5) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(2) on or after January 1, 2009, transferred to Iran, \n        Syria, or North Korea goods, services, or technology that could \n        assist efforts to extract or mill uranium ore within the \n        territory or control of Iran, North Korea, or Syria.''.\n\nSEC. 5. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.\n\n    The Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act (50 U.S.C. \n1701 note) is further amended by striking ``Committee on International \nRelations'' each place it appears and inserting ``Committee on Foreign \nAffairs''."
