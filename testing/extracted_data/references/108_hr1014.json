    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Gateway Communities Cooperation \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. IMPROVED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FEDERAL LAND MANAGERS AND GATEWAY \n              COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT COMPATIBLE LAND MANAGEMENT OF BOTH \n              FEDERAL AND ADJACENT LANDS.\n\n    (a)  Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Many communities that abut or are near Federal lands, \n        including units of the National Park System, units of the \n        National Wildlife Refuge System, units of the National Forest \n        System, and lands administered by the Bureau of Land \n        Management, are vitally impacted by the management and public \n        use of these Federal lands.\n            (2) Some of these communities, commonly known as gateway \n        communities, fulfill an integral part in the mission of the \n        Federal lands by providing necessary services, such as schools, \n        roads, search and rescue, emergency service, medical support, \n        logistical support, living quarters, and drinking water and \n        sanitary systems for visitors to the Federal lands and \n        employees of Federal land management agencies.\n            (3) Provision of these vital services by gateway \n        communities is an essential ingredient for a meaningful and \n        enjoyable experience by visitors to the Federal lands because \n        Federal land management agencies are unable to provide, or are \n        prevented from providing, these services.\n            (4) Many gateway communities serve as an entry point for \n        persons who visit the Federal lands and are ideal for \n        establishment of visitor services, including lodging, food \n        service, fuel, auto repairs, emergency services, and visitor \n        information.\n            (5) Development in some gateway communities may impact the \n        management and protection of these Federal lands.\n            (6) The planning and management decisions of Federal land \n        managers can have unintended consequences for gateway \n        communities and the Federal lands when the decisions are not \n        adequately communicated to, or coordinated with, the elected \n        officials and residents of gateway communities.\n            (7) Experts in land management planning are available to \n        Federal land managers, but persons with technical planning \n        skills are often not readily available to gateway communities, \n        particularly small gateway communities.\n            (8) Gateway communities are often affected by the policies \n        and actions of several Federal land management agencies and the \n        communities and the agencies would benefit from greater \n        interagency coordination of those policies and actions.\n            (9) Persuading gateway communities to make decisions and \n        undertake actions in their communities that would also be in \n        the best interest of the Federal lands is most likely to occur \n        when such decisionmaking and actions are built upon a \n        foundation of cooperation and coordination.\n    (b)  Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to require Federal \nland managers to communicate, coordinate, and cooperate with gateway \ncommunities in order to--\n            (1) improve the relationships among Federal land managers, \n        elected officials, and residents of gateway communities;\n            (2) enhance the facilities and services in gateway \n        communities available to visitors to Federal lands when \n        compatible with the management of these lands, including the \navailability of historical and cultural resources; and\n            (3) result in better local land use planning in gateway \n        communities and decisions by the relevant Secretary.\n    (c) Definitions.--For the purpose of this section, the following \ndefinitions apply:\n            (1) Gateway community.--The term ``gateway community'' \n        means a county, city, town, village, or other subdivision of a \n        State, a federally recognized Indian tribe, or Alaska Native \n        village, that--\n                    (A) is incorporated or recognized in a county or \n                regional land use plan or within tribal jurisdictional \n                boundaries;
