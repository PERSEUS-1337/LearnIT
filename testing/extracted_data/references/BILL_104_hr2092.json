FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) employment of private security officers in the United \n        States is growing rapidly;\n            (2) the private security industry provides numerous \n        opportunities for entry-level job applicants, including \n        individuals suffering from unemployment due to economic \n        conditions or dislocations;\n            (3) sworn law enforcement officers provide significant \n        services to the citizens of the United States in its public \n        areas, and are only supplemented by private security officers \n        who provide prevention and reporting services in support of, \n        but not in place of, regular sworn police;\n            (4) given the growth of large private shopping malls, and \n        the consequent reduction in the number of public shopping \n        streets, the American public is more likely to have contact \n        with private security personnel in the course of a day than \n        with sworn law enforcement officers;\n            (5) regardless of the differences in their duties, skill, \n        and responsibilities, the public has difficulty in discerning \n        the difference between sworn law enforcement officers and \n        private security personnel; and\n            (6) the American public demands the employment of \n        qualified, well-trained private security personnel as an \n        adjunct, but not a replacement for sworn law enforcement \n        officers.\n\nSEC. 3. BACKGROUND CHECKS.\n\n    (a) In General.--An association of employers of private security \nofficers, designated for the purpose of this section by the Attorney \nGeneral, may submit fingerprints or other methods of positive \nidentification approved by the Attorney General, to the Attorney \nGeneral on behalf of any applicant for a State license or certificate \nof registration as a private security officer or employer of private \nsecurity officers. In response to such a submission, the Attorney \nGeneral may, to the extent provided by State law conforming to the \nrequirements of the second paragraph under the heading ``Federal Bureau \nof Investigation'' and the subheading ``Salaries and Expenses'' in \ntitle II of Public Law 92-544 (86 Stat. 1115), exchange, for licensing \nand employment purposes, identification and criminal history records \nwith the State governmental agencies to which such applicant has \napplied.\n    (b) Regulations.--The Attorney General may prescribe such \nregulations as may be necessary to carry out this section, including \nmeasures relating to the security, confidentiality, accuracy, use, and \ndissemination of information and audits and recordkeeping and the \nimposition of fees necessary for the recovery of costs.\n    (c) Report.--The Attorney General shall report to the Senate and \nHouse Committees on the Judiciary 2 years after the date of enactment \nof this bill on the number of inquiries made by the association of \nemployers under this section and their disposition.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that States should participate in the \nbackground check system established under section 3.\n\nSEC. 5.
