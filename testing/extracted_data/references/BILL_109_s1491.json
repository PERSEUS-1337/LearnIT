FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) nutrient pollution from point sources and nonpoint \n        sources continues to be the most significant water quality \n        problem in the Chesapeake Bay watershed;\n            (2) a key commitment of the Chesapeake 2000 agreement, an \n        interstate agreement among the Administrator, the Chesapeake \n        Bay Commission, the District of Columbia, and the States of \n        Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, is to achieve the goal of \n        correcting the nutrient-related problems in the Chesapeake Bay \n        by 2010;\n            (3) by correcting those problems, the Chesapeake Bay and \n        its tidal tributaries may be removed from the list of impaired \n        bodies of water designated by the Administrator of the \n        Environmental Protection Agency under section 303(d) of the \n        Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1313(d));\n            (4) more than 300 major sewage treatment plants located in \n        the Chesapeake Bay watershed annually discharge approximately \n        60,000,000 pounds of nitrogen, or the equivalent of 20 percent \n        of the total nitrogen load, into the Chesapeake Bay; and\n            (5) nutrient removal technology is 1 of the most reliable, \n        cost-effective, and direct methods for reducing the flow of \n        nitrogen from point sources into the Chesapeake Bay.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental \n        Protection Agency to provide financial assistance to States and \n        municipalities for use in upgrading publicly-owned wastewater \n        treatment plants in the Chesapeake Bay watershed with nutrient \n        removal technologies; and\n            (2) to further the goal of restoring the water quality of \n        the Chesapeake Bay to conditions that are protective of human \n        health and aquatic living resources.\n\nSEC. 3. SEWAGE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n\n                       ``TITLE VII--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n``SEC. 701.
