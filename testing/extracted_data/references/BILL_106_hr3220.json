FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The growth of electronic commerce and electronic \n        government transactions represent a powerful force for economic \n        growth, consumer choice, improved civic participation and \n        wealth creation.\n            (2) The promotion of growth in private sector electronic \n        commerce through Federal legislation is in the national \n        interest because that market is globally important to the \n        United States.\n            (3) A consistent legal foundation, across multiple \n        jurisdictions, for electronic commerce will promote the growth \n        of such transactions, and that such a foundation should be \n        based upon a simple, technology neutral, nonregulatory, and \n        market-based approach.\n            (4) The Nation and the world stand at the beginning of a \n        large scale transition to an information society which will \n        require innovative legal and policy approaches, and therefore, \n        States can serve the national interest by continuing their \n        proven role as laboratories of innovation for quickly evolving \n        areas of public policy, provided that States also adopt a \n        consistent, reasonable national baseline to eliminate obsolete \n        barriers to electronic commerce such as undue paper and pen \n        requirements, and further, that any such innovation should not \n        unduly burden inter-jurisdictional commerce.\n            (5) To the extent State laws or regulations do not provide \n        a consistent, reasonable national baseline or in fact create an \n        undue burden to interstate commerce in the important burgeoning \n        area of electronic commerce, the national interest is best \n        served by Federal preemption to the extent necessary to provide \n        such consistent, reasonable national baseline or eliminate said \n        burden, but that absent such lack of a consistent, reasonable \n        national baseline or such undue burdens, the best legal system \n        for electronic commerce will result from continuing \n        experimentation by individual jurisdictions.\n            (6) With due regard to the fundamental need for a \n        consistent national baseline, each jurisdiction that enacts \n        such laws should have the right to determine the need for any \n        exceptions to protect consumers and maintain consistency with \n        existing related bodies of law within a particular \n        jurisdiction.\n            (7) Industry has developed several electronic signature \n        technologies for use in electronic transactions, and the public \n        policies of the United States should serve to promote a dynamic \n        marketplace within which these technologies can compete. \n        Consistent with this Act, States should permit the use and \n        development of any authentication technologies that are \n        appropriate as practicable as between private parties and in \n        use with State agencies.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to permit and encourage the continued expansion of \n        electronic commerce through the operation of free market forces \n        rather than proscriptive governmental mandates and regulations;\n            (2) to promote public confidence in the validity, integrity \n        and reliability of electronic commerce and online government \n        under Federal law;\n            (3) to facilitate and promote electronic commerce by \n        clarifying the legal status of electronic records and \n        electronic signatures in the context of contract formation;\n            (4) to facilitate the ability of private parties engaged in \n        interstate transactions to agree among themselves on the \n        appropriate electronic signature technologies for their \n        transactions; and\n            (5) to promote the development of a consistent national \n        legal infrastructure necessary to support of electronic \n        commerce at the Federal and State levels within areas of \n        jurisdiction.\n\nSEC. 4.

Such barriers include, but are not limited to, \nbarriers imposed by a law or regulation directly or indirectly \nrequiring that signatures, or records of transactions, be accomplished \nor retained in other than electronic form.
