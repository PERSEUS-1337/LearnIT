    "content": "The International Trade Administration (ITA), the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), and the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) are funded through the annual Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) appropriations. This report provides an overview of these agencies' programs and a comparison of the FY2020 CJS proposals with the previous year's enacted legislation.  For FY2019, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ), provided a total of $647.0 million in funding for the three CJS trade-related agencies. The FY2019 act provided $484.0 million in direct appropriations for ITA, $95.0 million for USITC, and a total of $68.0 million for USTR. The FY2019 appropriations for the three CJS trade-related agencies was a 0.2% decrease (-$1.3 million) from FY2018 appropriations ($648.3 million).  For FY2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-93 ), provided $678.7 million for the three trade-related agencies, which was $31.7 million (4.9%) more than the FY2019 amount, and $58.5 million (9.4%) more than the Administration's request. See the Appendix for enacted budget authority for the trade-related agencies for FY2009-FY2020. In the FY2020 budget cycle, the House and Senate each passed different versions of their CJS proposals under the same bill number, H.R. 3055 . In this report, the House and Senate versions of H.R. 3055 refer to the CJS provisions passed on June 25, 2019 (House) and October 31, 2019 (Senate). The CJS provisions were later struck from H.R. 3055 , and a continuing resolution was inserted in their place. The CJS provisions were then inserted into a new measure, H.R. 1158 , which passed both chambers and was signed into law as the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-93 ). The President submitted his FY2020 budget request to Congress on March 11, 2019. The agencies released their congressional budget justification documents in the weeks afterward. In the President's FY2020 budget, the Administration requested a total of $620.2 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies. This request was $26.8 million less (-4.1%) than the FY2019 enacted level.  The House Committee on Appropriations reported its FY2020 CJS appropriations proposal, H.R. 3055 , in early June 2019 and passed the measure on June 25, 2019 by a 227-194 vote. The House-passed bill included a total of $694.0 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies. This proposal was $47.0 million more (7.3%) than the FY2019 enacted funding, and $73.8 million more (11.9%) than the Administration's request. The House-passed bill included $521.0 million for ITA, $101.0 million for USITC, and a total of $72.0 million for USTR. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported its CJS bill, S. 2584 , on September 26, 2019. In late October, the Senate took up the House-adopted proposal, H.R. 3055 , and passed it with amendments by a vote of 84-9. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 3055 included a total of\u00c2\u00a0$678.7 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies, which was $31.7 million more (4.9%) than the FY2019-enacted amount and $58.5 million more (9.4%) than the Administration's request. The Senate-passed version included $510.3 million for ITA, $99.4 million for USITC, and a total of $69.0 million for USTR. The Senate's proposed funding levels were enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-93 ).  The President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-93 ), on December 20, 2019, approving FY2020 annual appropriations for the three CJS trade agencies. The act provided $678.7 million for these agencies, which was $31.7 million more (4.9%) than the FY2019 amount, and $58.5 million more (9.4%) than the Administration's request. (For a full summary, see Table 1 )  The International Trade Administration is a bureau within the Department of Commerce. ITA's mission is to improve U.S. prosperity by strengthening the competitiveness of U.S. industry, promoting trade and investment, and ensuring compliance with trade laws and agreements. ITA provides export promotion services; works to enforce and ensure compliance with trade laws and agreements; administers trade remedies such as antidumping and countervailing duties; and provides analytical support for ongoing trade negotiations. ITA went through a major organizational change in October 2013 in which it consolidated four organizational units into three more functionally aligned units: (1) Global Markets, (2) Enforcement and Compliance, and (3) Industry and Analysis. ITA also has a fourth organizational unit, the Executive and Administrative Directorate, which is responsible for providing policy leadership, information technology support, and administration services for all of ITA. ( Table 2 outlines ITA FY2020 budget proposals by unit, and Table A-1 shows budget amounts for ITA by unit between FY2009 and FY2019.) For FY2020, the Administration requested $460.1 million for ITA in direct appropriations, with an additional $11.0 million to be collected in user fees, for a total of $471.1 million in authorized spending. With respect to direct appropriations, this request was $23.9 million less (-4.9%) than the FY2019 enacted funding level. The House-passed H.R. 3055 included $521.0 million in direct appropriations for ITA, with an additional $11.0 million to be collected from user fees, for a total of $532.0 million in authorized spending. With respect to direct appropriations, this proposal was $37.0 million more (7.6%) than the FY2019 enacted funding level and $60.9 million more (13.2%) than the Administration's request.  The Senate-passed version proposed $510.3 million in direct appropriations for ITA with an additional $11.0 million to be collected from user fees, for a total of $521.3 in authorized spending. With respect to direct appropriations, this proposal was $26.3 million more (5.4%) than the FY2019 funding, and $50.2 million more (10.9%) than the Administration's request. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-93 ), adopted the Senate-proposed funding level of $510.3 for ITA's top-level funding ( Table 1 ). ITA's Global Markets (GM) unit is a combination of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS) program that provides export promotion services to U.S. businesses and the SelectUSA program that works to attract foreign investment into the United States. Through US&FCS, GM aims to promote U.S. exports by helping U.S. exporters research foreign markets and identify opportunities abroad. GM's country and regional experts\u00e2\u0080\u0095in domestic and overseas offices\u00e2\u0080\u0094advise U.S. companies on market access, local standards, and regulations. The unit also helps to make connections through business-to-business trade shows, fairs, and missions. GM is designed to advance U.S. commercial interests by engaging with foreign governments and U.S. businesses, identifying and resolving market barriers, and leading efforts that advocate for U.S. firms with foreign governments. Through its SelectUSA program, the GM unit promotes the United States as a destination for foreign investment. (For more on SelectUSA, see section \" SelectUSA Program \" below.) For FY2020, the Administration proposed reducing funding for the Global Markets unit. The Administration requested $278.0 million for Global Markets, an amount $42.0 million less (-13.1%) than the FY2019-enacted amount ( Table 2 ). The Administration proposed rescaling the Global Markets unit by \"reducing personnel worldwide and closing overseas and domestic offices\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 ITA estimated the need to close 32 offices overseas, 18 offices domestically, and reduce personnel [by 114 positions]\" in an effort \"to reduce fixed operational expenses. \" In the reports accompanying the committee-reported bills, the House and Senate Committees did not adopt the Administration's proposed cuts to Global Markets, and instead recommended boosting funding for the Global Markets unit. For FY2020, the House Appropriations Committee recommended $338.6 million for Global Markets, an amount $18.6 million more (5.8%) than the FY2019 enacted funding level and $60.7 million more (21.8%) than the Administration's request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $335.3 for Global Markets, which was $15.3 million more (4.8%) than the FY2019 enacted amount, and $57.3 million more (20.6%) than the Administration's request. The report to accompany the Senate committee-reported CJS appropriations bill included language directing ITA to spend \"no less than $130 million on employee compensation [for Global Markets];\" and noted that, \"at this funding level, the Committee will not approve any request to close foreign or domestic offices.\" As outlined in the explanatory statement accompanying the act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, provided \"no less than $333,000,000 for Global Markets.\" The mission of ITA's Enforcement and Compliance unit is to enforce U.S. trade laws and ensure compliance with negotiated international trade agreements. The Enforcement and Compliance unit is responsible for enforcing U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) laws; overseeing a variety of programs and policies regarding the enforcement and administration of U.S. trade remedy laws; assisting U.S. industry and businesses with unfair trade matters; and administering the Foreign Trade Zone program and other U.S. import programs. For FY2020, the Administration proposed $93.8 million for Enforcement and Compliance. This request was $5.3 million more (6.0%) than the FY2019 budget authority ( Table 2 ). According to ITA's congressional budget submission, some of the Administration's objectives for the proposed increase for Enforcement and Compliance were: to address increasing caseloads of AD/CVD investigations; to provide technical assistance on Section 232 exclusion requests; and to establish a dedicated team to investigate allegations of circumvention and duty evasion by foreign exporters and their U.S. importers. For FY2020, the House-passed version of H.R. 3055 included $94.8 million for Enforcement and Compliance, which was $6.3 million more (7.2%) than the FY2019 budget authority, and $1.0 million more (1.1%) than the Administration's request ( Table 2 ). In the Senate, language in the report accompanying the Senate committee-reported bill recommended \"$1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2019 enacted level [$88.5 million] for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance to establish a dedicated anti-circumvention and duty evasion enforcement unit.\" The explanatory statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, did not provide specific funding levels. The statement outlined that: The agreement does not assume House levels for Industry and Analysis, Enforcement and Compliance, and Executive Direction and Administration. However, ITA is directed to take steps to fill important vacancies across the agency in support of trade promotion, facilitation, and enforcement, as well as additional staff to support the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and the new Anti-Circumvention and Evasion Unit. ITA's Industry and Analysis unit brings together ITA's industry, trade, and economic experts to advance the competitiveness of U.S. industries through the development and execution of international trade and investment policies, export promotion strategies, and investment promotion. It develops economic and international policy analysis to improve market access for U.S. businesses, and designs and implements trade and investment promotion programs. The unit serves as the primary liaison between U.S. industries and the federal government on trade and investment promotion. It administers programs that support small and medium-sized enterprises, such as the Market Development Cooperator Program. For FY2020, the Administration proposed increasing funding for the Industry and Analysis unit. The Administration requested $62.6 million for Industry and Analysis. This request was $10.0 million more (19.1%) than the FY2019 budget authority ( Table 2 ). According to ITA's budget justification, some of the Administration's objectives for the proposed increase were: to meet the expected increase in cases related to foreign investment in the United States and to implement the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA); to develop staff with economic modeling skills and sectoral expertise; to manage the trade processes related to the tariffs imposed under certain U.S. trade law (Sections 301, 201, 232 ); and to provide analysis relevant to ongoing and future trade negotiations and the resolutions of trade barriers. For FY2020, the House-passed bill included $62.6 million for Industry and Analysis, which was $10.0 million (19.1%) more than the FY2019 budget authority and equal to the Administration's request ( Table 2 ). In the Senate, a specific funding level was not provided for Industry and Analysis. Language in the report accompanying the Senate committee-reported CJS bill did recommend \"provid[ing] the requested program changes for Industry and Analysis to implement \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 [FIRRMA] ( P.L. 116-115 \u00e2\u0080\u0093232) and for increased analytical capabilities.\" The explanatory statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, did not provide specific funding levels. The statement outlined that: The agreement does not assume House levels for Industry and Analysis, Enforcement and Compliance, and Executive Direction and Administration. However, ITA is directed to take steps to fill important vacancies across the agency in support of trade promotion, facilitation, and enforcement, as well as additional staff to support the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and the new Anti-Circumvention and Evasion Unit. USITC is an independent, quasi-judicial agency responsible for conducting trade-related investigations and providing independent technical advice on U.S. international trade policy to Congress, the President, and USTR. The Commission (1) investigates and determines whether imports injure a domestic industry or violate U.S. intellectual property rights; (2) provides independent tariff, trade, and competitiveness-related analysis to the President, Congress, and USTR; and (3) maintains the U.S. tariff schedule. USITC also serves as a federal resource for trade data and other trade policy information. It makes most of its information and analyses available to the public to promote understanding of competitiveness, international trade issues, and the role that international trade plays in the U.S. economy. USITC's annual budget request to Congress is subject to two types of submission: (1) the President's budget request for the Commission, included in the President's annual budget; and (2) the Commission's independent budget request. USITC has the authority to submit its budget directly to Congress without revision by the President, pursuant to Section 175 of the Trade Act of 1974. The President's FY2020 budget requested $91.1 million in funding for USITC. This request was $3.9 million less (-4.1%) than FY2019-enacted appropriation ( Table 1 ). While the President requested a decrease in funding for USITC, the Commission's independent budget submission requested $101.0 million, which was $6.0 million more (6.3%) than FY2019 funding and $9.9 million more (10.9%) than the President's budget request. The House-passed H.R. 3055 included $101.0 million for USITC. This represented $6.0 million more (6.3%) than FY2019 funding and $9.9 million more (10.9%) than the President's budget request. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 3055 included $99.4 million for USITC. This proposal was $4.4 million more (4.6%) than the FY2019 funding, and $8.3 million more (9.1%) than the President's budget request. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-93 ) enacted the Senate's funding level of $99.4 million for USITC ( Table 1 ). USTR has primary responsibility for developing and coordinating U.S. international trade and direct investment policies, as the head of the interagency trade policy coordinating process. Located in the Executive Office of the President, USTR is the President's principal advisor on trade policy and the President's chief negotiator for international trade agreements, including commodity and direct investment negotiations. USTR negotiates directly with foreign governments to create trade agreements and resolve disputes, and participates in global trade policy organizations such as the World Trade Organization. It also meets with business groups, policymakers, and public interest groups on trade policy issues.  In addition to direct appropriations for USTR, supplementary funding for the agency is available through the congressionally established Trade Enforcement Trust Fund. For more detail on the trust fund, see section \" Trade Enforcement Trust Fund (TETF) \" below. For FY2020, the Administration requested a total of $69.0 million for USTR, including $59.0 million for salaries and expenses and $10.0 million to be derived from the TETF for certain trade enforcement activities ( Table 3 ). This request was $1.0 million more (1.5%) than the FY2019 enacted funding level.  The House-passed version of H.R. 3055 recommended a total of $72.0 total for USTR, including $57.0 million for salaries and $15.0 million to be derived from the TETF for certain trade enforcement activities ( Table 3 ). The House proposal for USTR was $4.0 million more (5.9%) than the FY2019 enacted funding and $3.0 million more (4.3%) than the request. The Senate-passed version recommended a total of $69.0 million for USTR, including $54.0 million for salaries and expenses and $15.0 million to be derived from the TETF. The proposed amount was $1.0 million more (1.5%) than the FY2019 funding amount. While the Senate-passed total funding amount for USTR was equal to the Administration's request, it included a different distribution of funds between USTR's salaries and expenses account and funds to be derived from the TETF (see Table 3 ). The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-93 ) enacted the Senate's funding levels of $69.0 million for USTR, including $54.0 million for salaries and expenses and $15.0 million to be derived from the TETF ( Table 3 ).  Over the past decade, Congress has provided funding for specific trade-related programs or activities within broader agency budgets. The following programs are highlighted in this report, due to ongoing congressional interest: (1) ITA's China trade enforcement and compliance activities; (2) ITA's investment promotion activities in its SelectUSA Program; (3) the Survey of International Air Travelers (SIAT) within ITA; and (4) the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund, which funds certain activities of USTR. Since 2004, Congress has dedicated some of ITA's funding to AD/CVD enforcement and compliance activities with respect to China and other nonmarket economies. ITA's Office of China Compliance was established by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-199 ). Its primary role has been to enforce U.S. AD/CVD laws and to develop and implement other policies and programs aimed at countering unfair foreign trade practices in China. ITA's China Countervailing Duty Group was established by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 ( P.L. 111-117 ) to accommodate the workload that resulted from the application of countervailing duty law to imports from nonmarket economy countries. The Office of China Compliance is within the Enforcement and Compliance unit at ITA. ITA's FY2020 budget justification did not provide a breakdown of funding for its China AD/CVD activities. In agreement with both the House and Senate-passed proposals, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-93 ) provided $16.4 million for China antidumping and countervailing duty enforcement and compliance activities in FY2020, an amount equal to the FY2019-enacted funding. SelectUSA was established by executive order in 2011 as a Commerce Department program to (1) promote the United States as an investment market and (2) address investor climate concerns that could impede investment in the United States. SelectUSA coordinates investment-related resources across more than 20 federal agencies; serves as an information resource for international investors; and advocates for U.S. cities, states, and regions as investment destinations. SelectUSA currently is part of ITA's Global Markets unit. ITA's FY2020 budget justification did not provide a breakdown for requested funding for SelectUSA. The House-passed H.R. 3055 also did not include a breakdown for specific funding for SelectUSA, within ITA's Global Markets unit. The Senate-passed H.R. 3055 included up to $10.0 million for SelectUSA for FY2020. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-93 ) adopted the Senate funding level. ITA's Survey of International Air Travelers (SIAT) gathers statistics about air passenger travelers in the United States. Federal agencies use these statistics for a variety of purposes, such as to estimate the contribution of international travel to the economy, develop public policy on the travel industry, and forecast staffing needs at consulates and ports of entry.  SIAT is within the Industry and Analysis unit at ITA. The Administration proposed an increase of $3.0 million to support SIAT in FY2020, within the Industry and Analysis' funding. The House and Senate both recommended $3.0 million to support SIAT in FY2020, within the ITA budget. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, did not provide a specific funding amount for SIAT. In order to provide additional funding for USTR's trade enforcement activities, Congress established the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund (TETF) in 2016. In Section 611 of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 ( P.L. 114-125 ), Congress set up the trust fund and outlined authorized uses of the funds. According to Section 611(d), USTR can use funds from the TETF to (1) monitor and enforce trade agreements and World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments; (2) support trade capacity-building assistance to help partner countries meet their free-trade agreement obligations and commitments; and (3) investigate petitions concerning unfair trade practices under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. USTR can also transfer funds to select federal agencies for trade enforcement activities authorized in Section 611(d) of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. For FY2020, the Administration requested $10.0 million to be derived from the TETF. This request was $5.0 million less than the FY2019-enacted amount. (See Table 3 ). Both the House- and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 3055 included $15.0 million to be derived from the TETF, for trade enforcement activities authorized by the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. The recommendations were equal to the FY2019 enacted funding level, and were $5.0 million more than the Administration's request. (See Table 3 .) The House and Senate Appropriation committees also directed USTR to provide more detailed reporting on how funds from the Trust Fund are used. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-93 ) provided $15.0 million to be derived from the TETF, for trade enforcement activities authorized by the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. The funding level was equal to the FY2019 enacted funding level, and was $5.0 million more than the Administration's request."
