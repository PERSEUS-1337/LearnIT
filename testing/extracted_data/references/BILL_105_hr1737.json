SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Access to Women's \nHealth Care Act of 1997''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Women's health historically has received little \n        attention.\n            (2) A majority of women view their obstetrician-\n        gynecologist as their primary or sole physician.\n            (3) An obstetrician-gynecologist improves the access to the \n        health care of a woman by providing primary and preventive \n        health care throughout the women's lifetime, encompassing care \n        of the whole patient in addition to focusing on the processes \n        of the female reproductive system.\n            (4) 60 percent of all office visits to obstetrician-\n        gynecologists are for preventive care.\n            (5) Obstetrician-gynecologists refer their patients to \n        other physicians less frequently than other primary care \n        providers, thus avoiding costly and time-consuming referrals.\n            (6) Obstetrician-gynecologists manage the health of women \n        beyond the reproductive system, and are uniquely qualified on \n        the basis of education and experience to provide basic health \n        care services to women.\n            (7) While more than 20 States have acted to promote \n        residents' access to obstetrician-gynecologists, patients in \n        other States or in Federally-governed health plans are not \n        protected from access restrictions or limitations.\n\nSEC. 2.
