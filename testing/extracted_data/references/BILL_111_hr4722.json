FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Nearly half of the trips taken in the United States are \n        within a 20-minute bicycle ride, and a quarter of such trips \n        are within a 20-minute walk.\n            (2) Approximately 90 percent of public transportation trips \n        are accessed by walking or bicycling.\n            (3) More than 100 communities across the Nation have \n        adopted complete streets policies, thereby proving the \n        commitment of these communities to creating streets that are \n        safe and convenient for users of all ages and abilities, \n        including those who are walking, bicycling, taking public \n        transportation, or driving.\n            (4) Communities that invest in active transportation \n        infrastructure experience significant increases in bicycling \n        and walking rates over time, and such investments are in strong \n        demand because they enhance the livability of communities.\n            (5) The communities that perform best in encouraging active \n        transportation create interconnected systems that make it \n        convenient and safe to travel on foot or by bicycle to \n        destinations on a routine basis.\n            (6) Achieving a mode shift to active transportation within \n        a community requires intensive, concentrated funding of active \n        transportation systems rather than discrete, piecemeal \n        projects.\n            (7) Increased use of active transportation leads to \n        reductions in traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, \n        vehicle miles traveled, oil dependence, air pollution, and \n        obesity and diseases associated with physical inactivity.\n            (8) Given the contribution that active transportation makes \n        to these national policy goals, and the opportunity active \n        transportation provides to accommodate short trips at the least \n        cost to the public and individuals, funding of active \n        transportation is one of the most strategic and cost effective \n        Federal transportation investments available.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act, the following definitions apply:\n            (1) Active transportation.--The term ``active \n        transportation'' means mobility options powered solely by human \n        energy, such as bicycling and walking.\n            (2) Indian tribe.--The term ``Indian tribe'' has the \n        meaning given that term in section 4(e) of Indian Self-\n        Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b(e)).\n            (3) Program.--The term ``program'' means the active \n        transportation investment program established under section 4.\n\nSEC. 4.
