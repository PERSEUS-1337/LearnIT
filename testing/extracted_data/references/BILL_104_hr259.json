FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) in 1970, Amtrak was created as a 2-year, federally \n        assisted experiment that was to become an independent and self-\n        sufficient entity shortly thereafter;\n            (2) although Amtrak is not a department, agency, or \n        instrumentality of the Federal Government, it cannot operate \n        without large, annual Federal subsidies;\n            (3) while Amtrak carries only .3 percent of all intercity \n        travelers, it has cost the American taxpayers over \n        $15,000,000,000 in subsidies since its creation;\n            (4) Amtrak has been appropriated nearly $1,000,000,000 in \n        Federal subsidies for fiscal year 1995, and General Accounting \n        Office estimates show it could require another $10,000,000,000 \n        in subsidies over the next 5 years to remain viable;\n            (5) the General Accounting Office has concluded that \n        Amtrak's expenses will continue to increase steadily over the \n        next few years due to its need to--\n                    (A) renegotiate its operating agreements with the \n                freight railroads;\n                    (B) renegotiate work rules and labor compensation \n                with the 14 unions that represent its employees; and\n                    (C) invest in modern locomotives and passenger \n                cars;\n            (6) the General Accounting Office has concluded that \n        Amtrak's financial condition has deteriorated to the point that \n        its future costs make recovery difficult;\n            (7) the statutory requirements imposed on Amtrak ensure \n        that its rail passenger service will be costly, inefficient, \n        and unable to post a profit; and\n            (8) the application of the Railway Labor Act and the \n        Federal Employers' Liability Act to rail passenger service \n        employees is excessive, costly, and burdensome and should be \n        reduced to a more realistic level.\n    (b) Repeal.--Section 24101 of title 49, United States Code, and the \nitem relating thereto in the table of sections of chapter 241 of such \ntitle, are repealed.\n\nSEC. 2.
