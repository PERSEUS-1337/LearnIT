CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There has been a recent trend toward issuing debit \n        cards which can be used like credit cards, largely as \n        replacements for debit cards which could be used only with a \n        personal identification number at automated teller machines and \n        a limited number of retail establishments.\n            (2) According to industry analysts, as many as 1,300,000 \n        new debit cards which can be used like credit cards are issued \n        each month.\n            (3) If current trends continue, debit cards that can be \n        used like credit cards will soon rival the popularity of credit \n        cards and some banking experts predict that more than \\2/3\\ of \n        the households in the United States will have such a card by \n        the year 2000.\n            (4) Many times, debit cards that can be used like credit \n        cards have been issued without providing adequate disclosure \n        that--\n                    (A) the card may be used to initiate an electronic \n                fund transfer without the use of a personal \n                identification number or similar code or means of \n                access; and\n                    (B) even though the card may carry a logo \n                associated with credit cards, the card is not a credit \n                card and the consumer may bear a significantly larger \n                liability for an unauthorized transaction involving \n                such debit card than would be the case for a similar \n                unauthorized transaction involving a credit card.\n            (5) Thus, millions of Americans are--\n                    (A) receiving cards in a form they didn't request; \n                and\n                    (B) are carrying such cards around with them--\n                            (i) without realizing that the cards have \n                        an expanded capability without the protections \n                        against unauthorized transfers which are \n                        typical of cards issued to make cash \n                        withdrawals from automated teller machines; and\n                            (ii) without fully appreciating the risks \n                        associated with such cards.\n            (6) Economic stimulation would be enhanced and competition \n        among the various financial institutions and other companies \n        which issue debit cards would be strengthened by the informed \n        use of debit cards by consumers.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Section 903 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693a) \nis amended--\n            (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (10);\n            (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (11) and \n        inserting a semicolon; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n            ``(12) ATM card.--The term `ATM card' means any card issued \n        by a financial institution for use in initiating electronic \n        fund transfers at automated teller machines and other \n        electronic terminals which requires a code or other unique form \n        of identification (other than a signature) in order to access \n        the account of the consumer; and\n            ``(13) Check card.--The term `check card' means any card \n        issued by a financial institution for use in initiating \n        electronic fund transfers from the account of a consumer which \n        does not require the protection of a code or other means of \n        access that uniquely identifies the consumer (and for purposes \n        of this paragraph, a signature shall not be treated as a means \n        of access which uniquely identifies the consumer).''.\n\nSEC. 4. CHECK CARD REQUIREMENT.\n\n    Section 911 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693i) \nis amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(e) Check Card Requirement.--Any check card issued by any \nfinancial institution to any consumer shall bear the legend `Check \nCard' in a prominent typeface and in a conspicuous place on the face of \nthe check card.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
