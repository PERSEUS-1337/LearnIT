FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On January 13, 2018, a ballistic missile alert reading: \n        ``BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII.

As those countries continue to develop and exchange \n        this technology, there is also an increasing threat of those \n        technologies falling into the hands of hostile non-state \n        groups.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
