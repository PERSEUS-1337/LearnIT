Under this alternative dispute \n        resolution process, all matters appealable under section 7512 \n        shall be subject to early intervention alternative dispute \n        resolution unless the Board determines that the matter is not \n        appropriate for the program or a statute or collective \n        bargaining agreement precludes inclusion of the matter in the \n        alternative dispute resolution program.\n    ``(c) Alternative Dispute Resolution After an Appeal or Petition \nfor Review Is Filed.--\n            ``(1) Appeal or petition for review.--Once an appeal or \n        petition for review is filed with the Board, any employee or \n        agency may request that a case be selected for alternative \n        dispute resolution.

Establishment of alternative dispute resolution program.''.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY AND FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Policy.--Chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code, is amended \nto establish an MSPB Administrative Judge Pay Schedule and to provide \nMSPB administrative judges with pay that is comparable to that of \nimmigration judges (IJs) and administrative law judges (ALJs).\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) MSPB administrative judges perform work at the same \n        level of importance and complexity as immigration judges and \n        administrative law judges. Federal employees deserve to have \n        their cases heard by judges with the same pay and status as the \n        judges who hear private sector benefits and employment law \n        cases. Veterans in the Federal workforce deserve to have their \n        cases heard by judges with the same pay and status as the \n        judges who hear cases involving illegal aliens.\n            (2) MSPB administrative judges are leaving the Board for \n        positions with other adjudicatory agencies. During the past 4 \n        years, the Board has lost 20 percent of its most experienced \n        judges to other adjudicatory agencies. MSPB administrative \n        judges should not have to leave the agency to achieve the pay \n        and status they deserve when they are adjudicating cases with \n        the same importance and complexity as cases heard by IJs and \n        ALJs.\n\nSEC. 4. MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGES AND \n              COMPENSATION.\n\n    (a) Amendment to Chapter 53 of Title 5.--Chapter 53 of title 5, \nUnited States Code, is amended by adding immediately after section \n5372a the following:\n``Sec. 5372b.
