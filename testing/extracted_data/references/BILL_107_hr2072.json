FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the storage \n        of high-level radioactive waste, transuranic waste, and spent \n        nuclear fuel is to be located at a central repository.\n            (2) The Department of Energy estimates that completing the \n        Yucca Mountain central repository project will cost \n        $58,000,000,000, making the project one of the most costly \n        public works projects in the world.\n            (3) Numerous geological and hydrological conditions found \n        at Yucca Mountain support the contention that Yucca Mountain is \n        not a suitable site for a central repository.\n            (4) Public health and safety regulations have consistently \n        been altered in order to make Yucca Mountain appear to be a \n        feasible option.\n            (5) Storing high-level radioactive waste in a central \n        repository at Yucca Mountain would require the transportation \n        of more than 70,000 tons of nuclear waste through 43 States, \n        and through hundreds of cities and towns. Fifty million \n        Americans live within one half mile of the shipping routes, \n        creating an unacceptable risk of catastrophic radiation \n        exposure.\n            (6) Current nuclear power reactor sites can safely store \n        high-level radioactive waste for another 100 years (according \n        to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission). By implementing the most \n        advanced existing technology, nuclear power reactor sites could \n        store waste for an additional 100 years, thus eliminating the \n        need to immediately site a central repository.\n            (7) The United States can create solutions to the long-term \n        problems of storing high-level radioactive waste by exploring \n        emerging technologies with the potential to neutralize highly \n        radioactive waste.\n            (8) The research, development, and utilization in the \n        United States of risk-decreasing technologies for the safe \n        disposal of nuclear waste is not only feasible, but it is our \n        best alternative to storing high-level nuclear waste at a \n        central repository.\n            (9) The Nuclear Waste Fund has accumulated more than \n        $10,000,000,000 to store high-level nuclear radioactive waste \n        in a central repository, a failed concept. Given the scientific \n        evidence against the Yucca Mountain site, and the health and \n        safety problems inherent in the concept of a central high-level \n        radioactive waste repository, the Nuclear Waste Fund should be \n        directed toward the research, development, and utilization of \n        these alternative waste storage and disposal technologies to \n        better protect our environment.\n            (10) The insurmountable problems associated with storing \n        nuclear waste in a central repository requires the Congress to \n        terminate the Yucca Mountain Project and to immediately launch \n        a focused research and development program to develop safe \n        nuclear waste disposal technologies.\n\nSEC. 3. NUCLEAR WASTE FUND.\n\n    Section 302 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. \n10222) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)--\n                    (A) by striking ``Contracts.--(1) In the'' and all \n                that follows through ``described in subsection (d).'' \n                and inserting ``Payments.--(1) The Secretary shall \n                provide for payments into the Nuclear Waste Fund of \n                fees pursuant to paragraph (2) for use as provided in \n                this section.'';\n                    (B) by striking paragraphs (3), (5), and (6) and \n                redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (3); and\n                    (C) in paragraph (3), as so redesignated by \n                subparagraph (B) of this paragraph--\n                            (i) by striking ``paragraphs (2) and (3) \n                        above'' and inserting ``paragraph (2)'';\n                            (ii) by striking ``offset the costs as \n                        defined in subsection (d) herein'' and \n                        inserting ``support the uses described in \n                        subsection (c)'';\n                            (iii) by striking ``recover the costs \n                        incurred'' and all that follows through ``full \n                        cost recovery.'' and inserting ``support the \n                        uses described in subsection (c), the Secretary \n                        shall propose an adjustment to the fee to fully \n                        support those uses.
