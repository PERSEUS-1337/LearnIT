    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Girls Count Act of 2014''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the United States Census Bureau's 2014 \n        international figures, 1 person in 8--or 12 percent of the \n        total population of the world--is a girl or young woman age 10 \n        through 24.\n            (2) The Census Bureau's data also asserts that young people \n        are the fastest growing segment of the population in developing \n        countries.\n            (3) Even though most countries have birth registration \n        laws, every year 51,000,000 children under age 5 are not \n        registered at birth, most of whom are girls.\n            (4) A nationally recognized proof of birth system is the \n        key to determining a child's citizenship, nationality, place of \n        birth, parentage, and age. Without such a system, a passport, \n        drivers license, or national identification card is extremely \n        difficult to obtain. The lack of such documentation prevents \n        girls and women from officially participating in and \n        benefitting from the formal economic, legal, and political \n        sectors in their countries.\n            (5) Without the ability to gain employment and \n        identification necessary to officially participate in these \n        sectors, women and girls are confined to the home and remain \n        unpaid and often-invisible members of society.\n            (6) Girls undertake much of the domestic labor needed for \n        poor families to survive: carrying water, harvesting crops, \n        tending livestock, caring for younger children, and doing \n        chores.\n            (7) Accurate assessments of access to education, poverty \n        levels, and overall census activities are hampered by the lack \n        of official information on women and girls. Without this \n        rudimentary information, assessments of foreign assistance and \n        domestic social welfare programs cannot be accurately gauged.\n            (8) To ensure that women and girls are fully integrated \n        into United States foreign assistance policies and programs, \n        that the specific needs of girls are, to the maximum extent \n        possible, addressed in the design, implementation, and \n        evaluation of development assistance programs, and that women \n        and girls have the power to effect the decisions that affect \n        their lives, all girls should be counted and have access to \n        birth certificates and other official documentation.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to--\n            (1) encourage countries to uphold the Universal Declaration \n        of Human Rights and enact laws that ensure girls and boys of \n        all ages are full participants in society, including requiring \n        birth certifications and some type of national identity card to \n        ensure that all citizens, including girls, are counted;\n            (2) enhance training and capacity-building in developing \n        countries, local nongovernmental organizations, and other civil \n        society organizations to effectively address the needs of birth \n        registries in countries where girls are undercounted;\n            (3) include organizations representing children and \n        families in the design, implementation, and monitoring of \n        programs under this Act; and\n            (4) incorporate into the design, implementation, and \n        evaluation of policies and programs at all levels an \n        understanding of the distinctive impact that such policies and \n        programs may have on girls.\n\nSEC. 4.
