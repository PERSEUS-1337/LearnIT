    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) In 2005, the oil industry recorded revenues of \n        $1,620,000,000,000, and profits for the industry totaled almost \n        $140,000,000,000.\n            (2) In 2005, multilateral development institutions such as \n        those in the World Bank Group, and United States agencies such \n        as the Export-Import Bank of the United States and the United \n        States Overseas Private Investment Corporation, alone provided \n        more than $3,000,000,000 in financing to the international oil \n        and gas industry, including major oil companies.\n            (3) Limited public resources for international finance and \n        development assistance should support the many critical needs \n        of developing countries, not the international oil and gas \n        industry which has significant access to private capital \n        markets.\n            (4) Providing financing to oil and gas operations overseas \n        increases the dependence of the United States on oil and gas \n        imported from these operations.\n            (5) Providing financing to oil and gas operations overseas \n        increases the dependence of the developing world on oil and gas \n        imported from these operations.\n            (6) Oil and gas production in developing countries has \n        generally not alleviated poverty, but has instead been widely \n        associated with increased levels of poverty and economic \n        inequality.\n            (7) Oil and gas production has often exacerbated poor \n        governance, corruption and conflict in many developing \n        countries.\n            (8) Oil and gas production has historically led to \n        increased levels of developing country debt due to these \n        countries' reliance on external debt financing to provide \n        infrastructure for oil and gas extraction projects.\n            (9) Emissions from combustion of oil and gas account for \n        just over one-third of all global greenhouse gas emissions.\n            (10) While the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions \n        have occurred in the wealthy countries belonging to the \n        Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, it will \n        be the poorest countries, who can least afford to adapt to a \n        changing climate, who will suffer first and worst.\n            (11) Following a 2-year multi-stakeholder process that \n        evaluated the effects of international oil projects on \n        developing country poverty, local environments, and global \n        climate, the Extractive Industries Review by the World Bank \n        Group recommended an end to financing of oil projects by the \n        World Bank Group by 2008.\n\nSEC. 2. EXPORT-IMPORT BANK.\n\n    Section 2(b) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. \n635(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(14) Prohibition on financing for oil and gas projects.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The Bank may not guarantee, \n                insure, or extend (or participate in an extension of) \n                credit--\n                            ``(i) in connection with an oil or gas \n                        project; or\n                            ``(ii) to any entity that may use the \n                        guarantee, insurance, or credit to finance such \n                        a project.\n                    ``(B) Oil or gas project defined.--The term `oil or \n                gas project' means an oil or gas field development \n                project (including surveying and extraction), \n                processing facility, pipeline, or terminal, or other \n                oil or gas production or distribution operation or \n                facility.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
