FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Many poor countries have been struggling under the \n        burden of international debts for many years.\n            (2) Many poor countries have debts that are odious because \n        they were incurred by dictatorships that did not use the funds \n        in ways that benefitted the population of the country.\n            (3) The international Jubilee coalitions have been working \n        to raise awareness of the needs of these impoverished countries \n        for full debt cancellation.\n            (4) The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has imposed \n        onerous structural adjustment requirements on many poor \n        countries as a condition of past loans and of participation in \n        debt relief programs.\n            (5) Justice requires that debts owed by these countries to \n        the IMF be cancelled.\n\nSEC. 3.
