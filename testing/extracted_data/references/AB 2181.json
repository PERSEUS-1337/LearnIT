    "title": "An act to add Sections 10130, 10503.5, and 10727 to the Public Contract Code, relating to public contracts.",
    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\n(a) It is the intent of the Legislature to create a green infrastructure program that would encourage state agencies to account for and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with\nenergy-intensive\nemissions-intensive\nproducts that are used in major infrastructure projects and funded in whole or in part with state funds. This program would reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with\nenergy-intensive\nemissions-intensive\nproducts by providing a market for high-quality goods with the lowest overall greenhouse gas emissions.\n(b) If\nenergy-intensive\nemissions-intensive\nproducts are sourced from facilities that do not comply with California\u2019s climate energy goals or if a product is transported a long distance to the job site, it creates a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions that is part of the emissions total California is seeking to reduce by 2020. By ignoring these emissions, California is shifting the burden of emissions reductions to other portions of the economy and this places additional burden on California\u2019s businesses and consumers. It would be better for consumers if the state acknowledges the emissions associated with large infrastructure projects and crafts a procurement process to procure a green product, a product that lowers greenhouse gas emissions while still meeting quality standards.\n(c) Executive Order B-30-15 issued by Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. stipulates that \u201cState agencies shall take climate change into account in their planning and investment decisions and employ full life-cycle cost accounting to evaluate and compare infrastructure investments and alternatives.\u201d It also notes that state agencies\u2019 planning investments shall be guided by principles that build climate preparedness and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 10130 is added to the Public Contract Code, to read:\n10130.\n(a) As used in this section:\n(1) \u201cProject\u201d means a project for infrastructure subject to this chapter that is estimated to cost one million dollars ($1,000,000) or more.\n(2)\n\u201cEnergy-intensive product\u201d\n\u201cEmissions-intensive product\u201d\nmeans a product that is produced by\na company\nthe following industry sectors, as\nidentified by the cap-and-trade program of the State Air Resources Board as\nenergy\nemissions\nintensive, trade\nexposed.\nexposed:\n(A) Cement manufacturing.\n(B) Flat glass manufacturing.\n(C) Iron and steel mills.\n(D) Rolled shape manufacturing.\n(b) (1) On or before January 1, 2018, the department shall prepare and submit to the Legislature and the Governor a report on the greenhouse gas emissions that are associated with\nenergy-intensive\nemissions-intensive\nproducts in projects within the jurisdiction of the department. The emissions total shall take into account the greenhouse gas emissions that are produced when the\nenergy-intensive\nemissions-intensive\nproduct is manufactured or produced and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the transportation of the\nenergy-intensive\nemissions-intensive\nproduct from the site of its manufacture to the project site.\n(2) A report submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be submitted in accordance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.\n(3) The requirement for submitting a report pursuant to this subdivision is inoperative on January 1, 2021, pursuant to Section 10231.5 of the Government Code.\n(c) As of January 1, 2018, the department shall incorporate the greenhouse gas emissions information described in subdivision (b) into its procurement processes, including bid specifications, to procure\nenergy-intensive\nemissions-intensive\nproducts with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions profile that meet standards imposed by a state agency for quality or safety purposes.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 10503.5 is added to the Public Contract Code, to read:\n10503.5.\n(a) As used in this section:\n(1) \u201cProject\u201d means a project for infrastructure subject to this chapter that is estimated to cost one million dollars ($1,000,000) or more.\n(2)\n\u201cEnergy-intensive product\u201d\n\u201cEmissions-intensive product\u201d\nmeans a product that is produced by\na company\nthe following industry sectors, as\nidentified by the cap-and-trade program of the State Air Resources Board as\nenergy\nemissions\nintensive, trade\nexposed.\nexposed:\n(A) Cement manufacturing.\n(B) Flat glass manufacturing.\n(C) Iron and steel mills.\n(D) Rolled shape manufacturing.\n(b) (1) On or before January 1, 2018, the Regents of the University of California shall prepare and submit to the Legislature and the Governor a report on the greenhouse gas emissions that are associated with\nenergy-intensive\nemissions-intensive\nproducts in projects within the jurisdiction of the Regents of the University of California. The emissions total shall take into account the greenhouse gas emissions that are produced when the\nenergy-intensive\nemissions-intensive\nproduct is manufactured or produced and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the transportation of the\nenergy-intensive\nemissions-intensive\nproduct from the site of its manufacture to the project site.\n(2) A report submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be submitted in accordance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.\n(3) The requirement for submitting a report pursuant to this subdivision is inoperative on January 1, 2021, pursuant to Section 10231.5 of the Government Code.\n(c) As of January 1, 2018, the Regents of the University of California shall incorporate the greenhouse gas emissions information described in subdivision (b) into University of California procurement processes, including bid specifications, to procure\nenergy-intensive\nemissions-intensive\nproducts with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions profile that meet standards imposed by a state agency for quality or safety purposes.\nSEC. 4.\nSection 10727 is added to the Public Contract Code, to read:\n10727.\n(a) As used in this section:\n(1) \u201cProject\u201d means a project for infrastructure subject to this chapter that is estimated to cost one million dollars ($1,000,000) or more.\n(2)\n\u201cEnergy-intensive product\u201d\n\u201cEmissions-intensive product\u201d\nmeans a product that is produced by\na company\nthe following industry sectors, as\nidentified by the cap-and-trade program of the State Air Resources Board as\nenergy\nemissions\nintensive, trade\nexposed.\nexposed:\n(A) Cement manufacturing.\n(B) Flat glass manufacturing.\n(C) Iron and steel mills.\n(D) Rolled shape manufacturing.\n(b) (1) On or before January 1, 2018, the trustees shall prepare and submit to the Legislature and the Governor a report on the greenhouse gas emissions that are associated with\nenergy-intensive\nemissions-intensive\nproducts in projects within the jurisdiction of the trustees. The emissions total shall take into account the greenhouse gas emissions that are produced when the\nenergy-intensive\nemissions-intensive\nproduct is manufactured or produced and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the transportation of the\nenergy-intensive\nemissions-intensive\nproduct from the site of its manufacture to the project site.\n(2) A report submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be submitted in accordance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.\n(3) The requirement for submitting a report pursuant to this subdivision is inoperative on January 1, 2021, pursuant to Section 10231.5 of the Government Code.\n(c) As of January 1, 2018, the trustees shall incorporate the greenhouse gas emissions information described in subdivision (b) into California State University procurement processes, including bid specifications, to procure\nenergy-intensive\nemissions-intensive\nproducts with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions profile that meet standards imposed by a state agency for quality or safety purposes."
