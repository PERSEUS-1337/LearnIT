FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Parkinson's disease and related disorders (hereafter \n        referred to in this Act as ``Parkinson's'') is a neurological \n        disorder affecting as many as 1,500,000 Americans.\n            (2) Approximately 40 percent of persons with Parkinson's \n        are under the age of 60.\n            (3) While science has yet to determine what causes the \n        disease, research has found that cells that produce a \n        neurochemical called dopamine inexplicably degenerate, causing \n        uncontrollable tremors, muscle stiffness, and loss of motor \n        function.\n            (4) Eventually, Parkinson's renders the afflicted \n        individuals incapable of caring for themselves. In addition to \n        causing disability and suffering for the afflicted individuals, \n        Parkinson's places tremendous and prolonged physical, \n        emotional, and financial strain on family and loved ones.\n            (5) It is estimated that the disease costs society nearly \n        $6,000,000,000 annually.\n            (6) To date, the federally funded research effort has been \n        grossly underfunded. Only $26,000,000 is allocated specifically \n        for research on Parkinson's, or only about one dollar for every \n        $200 in annual societal costs.\n            (7) In order to take full advantage of the tremendous \n        potential for finding a cure or effective treatment, the \n        Federal investment in Parkinson's must be expanded, as well as \n        the coordination strengthened among the National Institutes of \n        Health research institutes.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide for the \nexpansion and coordination of research concerning Parkinson's, and to \nimprove care and assistance for afflicted individuals and their family \ncaregivers.\n\nSEC. 3. BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH ON PARKINSON'S DISEASE.\n\n    Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 284 \net seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following section:\n\n                         ``parkinson's disease\n\n    ``Sec. 409B.
