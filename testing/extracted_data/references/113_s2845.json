    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Southern Prairie Potholes National \nWildlife Refuge Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the area of the State of Iowa known as the Southern \n        Prairie Potholes and consisting primarily of the Willow Creek \n        watershed in Greene County offers exceptional potential for \n        restoration into a bountiful native wildlife habitat area;\n            (2) ongoing restoration and preservation of this wildlife \n        habitat area will significantly enhance opportunities for \n        outdoor recreation in this region, including waterfowl and \n        upland hunting, wildlife viewing, and hiking;\n            (3) the Southern Prairie Potholes area is located at the \n        southwestern edge of the Des Moines Lobe left by glaciers \n        12,000 years ago;\n            (4) the sloughs and grassland offer a substantial oasis of \n        both wetland and grassland habitat at the southwestern boundary \n        of the most heavily cropped region in Iowa;\n            (5) because of the location of the Southern Prairie \n        Potholes at the edge of the multistate and international region \n        known as the Prairie Potholes Region, and along important \n        migratory flyways, the restoration and preservation of the area \n        is critical to providing wildlife habitat across the full \n        extent of the Prairie Potholes Region;\n            (6) this 23,500-acre area has for years been designated by \n        the Prairie Pothole Joint Venture as a priority area for \n        restoration and preservation because of the importance of the \n        area to wildlife, facilitating gradual public land acquisition \n        for habitat restoration;\n            (7) the area already includes the 2,134-acre Dunbar Slough \n        wetland complex of Federal and State land managed as popular \n        wildlife and hunting areas serving Carroll, Greene, and Guthrie \n        Counties and beyond;\n            (8) national wildlife refuges increasingly follow a mosaic \n        pattern with a core of publicly held land surrounded by \n        privately held land also located within the refuge boundary;\n            (9) private ownership and uses are not affected for private \n        land within the designated boundaries of the refuge, but \n        private landowners may be provided increased opportunities for \n        partnering on conservation or restoration practices;\n            (10) restoration and preservation of the Southern Prairie \n        Potholes area will benefit hundreds of birds, mammals, \n        butterflies, reptiles, and amphibians that have been classified \n        as species of greatest conservation need, including the \n        endangered Blanding's turtle;\n            (11) restoration of grassland and wetland in the area will \n        contribute to improved flood control and water quality \n        downstream, as the Middle Raccoon River is the major water \n        source for the Des Moines metropolitan region and other \n        communities;\n            (12) the Southern Prairie Potholes area offers unique \n        recreational appeal because the area is adjacent to the \n        existing Whiterock Conservancy, a 4,300-acre land trust \n        dedicated to conserving and protecting the natural resources of \n        Iowa and engaging the public with the landscape;\n            (13) Whiterock Conservancy offers outdoor recreation and \n        education and includes a major new Backcountry Trail complex;\n            (14) the proximity of the Southern Prairie Potholes to the \n        largest metropolitan area in Iowa adds to the ability of the \n        area to provide natural resource experiences to a broad \n        community; and\n            (15) the area is already attracting cyclists, and that \n        appeal will grow with ongoing development of the cross-country \n        American Discovery Trail transecting the area.\n\nSEC. 3.
