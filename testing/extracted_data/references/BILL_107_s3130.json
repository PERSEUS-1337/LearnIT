PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to--\n            (1) increase the safety and medical devices labeled as \n        single-use devices that are reprocessed for additional use;\n            (2) provide health professionals with more accurate \n        information on the medical devices that they are using; and\n            (3) provide the Food and Drug Administration with more \n        accurate information on adverse events that may be caused by \n        device failure.\n\nSEC. 3. DEVICE REPROCESSING AND REUSE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 352) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(u)(1) The reprocessing for reuse of a device (including the \nmanufacture or repeated manufacture of a previously used device) that \nis intended for use on a single patient, unless such reprocessed \ndevice--\n            ``(A)(i) is subject to an order under section 515 approving \n        the reprocessed device as safe and effective for the number of \n        intended uses by the reprocessor as set forth in its \n        submission, or\n            ``(ii) is subject to an order determining that the \n        reprocessed device is substantially equivalent under \n        subsections (f) and (i) of section 513 to a legally marketed \n        device, specifically taking into account the number of uses \n        specified in the label of the reprocessed device;\n            ``(B) is labeled with the number of times the device has \n        been reprocessed;\n            ``(C) prominently and conspicuously bears the name of the \n        reprocessor and the original manufacturer of the device, a \n        generally recognized abbreviation of such names, or a unique \n        and generally recognized symbol identifying such manufacturers, \n        except that the Secretary may waive any requirement under this \n        subparagraph with respect to a device if the Secretary \n        determines that compliance with the requirement is not feasible \n        or would compromise the provision of reasonable assurance of \n        the safety or effectiveness of the device; and\n            ``(D) prominently and conspicuously bears on its label the \n        following statement: `Reprocessed device for single use \n        reprocessed by ________________' (the name of the reprocessor \n        shall be placed in the blank space to identify the person \n        responsible for reprocessing).\n    ``(2)(A) Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this \nsubsection, the Secretary shall review each reprocessed device that is \nexempt on such date from the requirement to submit a report under \nsection 510(k) and shall--\n            ``(i) in the case of an exempt class I reprocessed device, \n        determine whether the device is intended for a use which is of \n        substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health \n        or presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury, \n        including a review of the risks presented by reprocessing the \n        device; and\n            ``(ii) in the case of an exempt class II reprocessed \n        device, determine whether such a report is necessary to assure \n        the safety and effectiveness of the devices, including a review \n        of the risks presented by reprocessing the device.\nThe Secretary shall solicit public comment during such 60 day period \nconcerning whether each device should remain exempt.\n    ``(B) Based on the finding of the review conducted under \nsubparagraph (A) the Secretary shall, not later than 120 days after \nsuch date of enactment, publish in the Federal Register a list of the \nreprocessed devices that are no longer exempt from submission of a \nreport under section 510(k). The reprocessor of any such device will be \nrequired to make a submission under section 510(k) not later than 120 \ndays after the publication by the Secretary of such list in the Federal \nRegister.\n    ``(C) During such 120-day period, the Secretary may not determine \nthat the device is misbranded under subsection (o) or adulterated under \nsection 501(f)(1)(B) on the basis that such report has not been \nsubmitted to the Secretary. After the submission of the report to the \nSecretary, the Secretary may not determine that the device is \nmisbranded under subsection (o) or adulterated under section \n501(f)(1)(B) until the Secretary determines the classification of the \ndevice under section 513 or the Secretary determines that the \nsubmission was insufficient to make a classification.\n    ``(D) Subsection (o) applies with respect to a failure to submit a \nreport under subsection (k) that is required pursuant to subparagraph \n(A), including a failure of the report to include validation data \nrequired in such subparagraph.\n    ``(E) The termination under subparagraph (A) of an exemption under \nsubsection (l) or (m) for a reprocessed device does not terminate the \nexemption under subsection (l) or (m) for the original device.\n    ``(v) The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate \ncommerce of a device which was previously used in a patient and labeled \nin a manner that represents directly or indirectly that the device is \nnew or unused.''.\n    (b) Exemptions.--Section 510 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (l), by adding at the end the following: \n        ``The Secretary, in determining whether an exemption under this \n        subsection applies, shall consider whether such an exemption \n        would also apply to such a device when reprocessed with \n        consideration given to whether additional risks, if any, from \n        reprocessing should preclude such an exemption.''; and\n            (2) in subsection (m), by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(3) The Secretary in determining whether an exemption under this \nsubsection applies shall consider whether such an exemption would also \napply to such a device when reprocessed with consideration given to \nwhether additional risks, if any, from reprocessing should preclude \nsuch an exemption.''.\n    (c) Premarket Notification.--Section 510 of the Federal Food, Drug \nand Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(o) With respect to reprocessed single-use devices for which \nreports are required under subsection (k):\n            ``(1)(A) The Secretary shall identify such devices or types \n        of devices for which reports under such subsection must, in \n        order to ensure that the device is substantially equivalent to \n        a predicate device, include validation data, the types of which \n        shall be specified by the Secretary, regarding cleaning and \n        sterilization, and functional performance demonstrating that \n        the single-use device will remain substantially equivalent to \n        its predicate device, after the maximum number of times the \n        device is reprocessed as intended by the person submitting the \n        premarket notification.\n            ``(B) Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of \n        this subsection, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal \n        Register a list of the device types identified under \n        subparagraph (A), and shall revise the list as appropriate.\n            ``(C) Reports under subsection (k) for devices or types of \n        devices within a type included on the list under subparagraph \n        (B) are, upon publication of the list, required to include such \n        validation data.\n            ``(2)(A) In the case of each report under subsection (k) \n        that was submitted to the Secretary prior to the publication of \n        the initial list under paragraph (1), or any revision thereof, \n        and that was for a device or type of device included on such \n        list, the person who submitted the report under subsection (k) \n        shall submit validation data as described in paragraph (1) to \n        the Secretary not later than 9 months after the publication of \n        the list under paragraph (1)(B).\n            ``(B) During the 9-month period described in subparagraph \n        (A), the Secretary may not take any action under this Act \n        against a device solely on the basis that the validation data \n        for the device has not been submitted to the Secretary.\n            ``(C) After the submission of the validation data to the \n        Secretary, the Secretary may not determine that the device is \n        misbranded under section 502(o) adulterated under section \n        501(f)(1)(B), or take action against the device under section \n        301(p) for failure to provide any information required by \n        subsection (k) until--\n                    ``(i) the review is terminated by withdrawal of the \n                submission of the report under subsection (k);\n                    ``(ii) the Secretary finds the data to be \n                acceptable and issues a letter;
