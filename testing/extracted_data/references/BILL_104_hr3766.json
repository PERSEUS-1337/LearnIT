FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Although a 1991 Sudanese criminal law prohibited \n        abduction, kidnapping, forced labor, unlawful confinement, and \n        unlawful detention, and although Sudan categorically denies the \n        practice of slavery in Sudan, slavery continues unabated in \n        Sudan.\n            (2) The United States Department of State's Country Human \n        Rights Report for 1995 noted that ``government forces carried \n        out massacres, extrajudicial kidnapping, forced labor, and \n        slavery'' in Sudan.\n            (3) Amnesty International reports that the Government of \n        Sudan abducted women and children from Northern Bahr al-Ghazal \n        and the Nuba Mountains and during one of the raids of April and \n        May of 1995 in the Babanusa to Wau area, 500 women and 150 \n        children were taken as slaves.\n            (4) In April 1996, a report by the United Nations Special \n        Representative for Sudan, Gaspar Biro, reported ``an alarming \n        increase in cases of slavery, servitude, slave trade and forced \n        labor''. The taking of slaves, particularly in war zones, and \n        their export to parts of central and northern Sudan, continues \n        in Sudan.\n            (5) Amnesty International reports that Sudan is party to \n        the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the \n        African Charter on Human and People's Rights, the Slavery \n        Convention, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Yet, \n        despite being a party to these agreements, slavery still exists \n        in Sudan.\n\nSEC. 2.
