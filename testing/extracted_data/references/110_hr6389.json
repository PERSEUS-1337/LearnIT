    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System \n        (the System) was created by Congress when it enacted the \n        Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982 (CBRA). The System is a \n        collection of specific areas of land and associated aquatic \n        habitats delineated on maps adopted by Congress.\n            (2) The System was expanded by amendments adopted in 1990 \n        and currently contains 856 units and areas consisting of \n        approximately 3.1 million acres of undeveloped coastal land and \n        associated aquatic habitat.\n            (3) The original non-digital System maps were based on \n        information that is now between 18 and 26 years old and were \n        drawn without precision. Since 1990, to avoid inequities and to \n        correct mapping errors, Congress has enacted 17 public laws to \n        modify 43 units.\n            (4) The State of South Carolina has a well-established and \n        respected coastal management program to manage beachfront \n        development. The State's program is designed to protect \n        sensitive and fragile areas from inappropriate development and \n        to provide adequate environmental safeguards with respect to \n        the construction of facilities in the coastal zone.\n            (5) Between 1988 and 1999, State and local regulations did \n        not authorize development of the western end of Kiawah Island. \n        However, in 1999, South Carolina established a setback line \n        that represents a detailed analysis of long-term accretion \n        trends in the area. Establishment of the setback line \n        authorized development of a portion of Captain Sam's Inlet Unit \n        M08 that was previously not authorized for development. In \n        2005, the Town of Kiawah Island's Town Council adopted a \n        Development Agreement to authorize and regulate development of \n        the area.\n            (6) Kiawah Island is a world-renowned, environmental award \n        winning community known for responsible and sound development.\n            (7) Kiawah Island and the associated beach, dune, and \n        hummock habitats provide a range of opportunities to increase \n        the ecological health and value to numerous native plant and \n        animal species.\n            (8) To maintain the integrity of the System, the \n        modification of Captain Sam's Inlet Unit M08 described in \n        section 3 and the habitat enhancement actions described in \n        section 4 will increase the fish and wildlife habitat value of \n        the Unit and areas in proximity to the Unit.\n    (b) Purpose.--Congress declares that it is the purpose of this Act \nto enhance the ecological value of Captain Sam's Inlet Unit M08 and \nareas in proximity to the Unit by modifying the Unit in a manner that \nadds 178 acres and removes approximately 61.5 acres which will soon be \ndeveloped using a very low density approach, and by encouraging \nimplementation of voluntary, supplemental ecological enhancement \nprojects. The Unit modification will enable all residents of the area \nto be treated comparably.\n\nSEC. 2. DESCRIPTION OF CAPTAIN SAM'S INLET UNIT M08.\n\n    (a) In General.--Captain Sam's Inlet Unit M08 includes the area \nalong Captain Sam's Inlet at Kiawah Island's western end. It was \ncreated in 1982 and expanded in 1990. The Unit currently includes the \nwestern end of Kiawah Island, neighboring fast land to the north and \nassociated aquatic habitat. Current acreage of the Unit is \napproximately 1,182 acres, including roughly 200 acres of fast land and \n982 acres of associated aquatic habitat.\n    (b) Unit M07/M07P or Bird Key.--A separate, much larger System unit \ncovers the eastern portion of Kiawah Island. That Unit, known as Unit \nM07/M07P or Bird Key, is approximately 7,094 total acres, including \nroughly 687 acres of fast land and 6,407 acres of associated aquatic \nhabitat.\n\nSEC. 3. MODIFICATION OF CAPTAIN SAM'S INLET UNIT M08.\n\n    (a) Net Expansion.--The replacement map referenced in section 5 \nexpands Unit M08 by 116 acres. The modified Unit increases in size from \napproximately 1,182 total acres to approximately 1,299 total acres \n(roughly 164 fast land and 1,135 associated aquatic habitat). The \nmodification represents a ratio of approximately 3 acres added:1 acre \nremoved.\n    (b) Specific Changes.--The replacement map referenced in section \n5--\n            (1) adds 178 acres to the Unit--25 acres of land in the \n        northeastern corner of the Unit and 153 acres of associated \n        aquatic habitat; and\n            (2) removes 61.5 acres from the Unit--39 acres authorized \n        for development by the State in 1999 and rezoned by the Town of \n        Kiawah in 2005, and 22.5 acres on two adjacent islands.\n\nSEC. 4. SUPPLEMENTAL PROJECTS TO ENHANCE ECOLOGICAL VALUE.\n\n    (a) Density Reductions and Conservation Easements.--\n            (1) There are existing entitlements for 44 dwelling units \n        on the 25 acres of fast land that are being added to the Unit. \n        To increase the habitat value of the modified Captain Sam's \n        Inlet Unit M08, the owners of this land have indicated a \n        willingness on a voluntary basis to reduce substantially these \n        entitlements and grant conservation easements to an appropriate \n        conservation organization.\n            (2) There are existing entitlements for 460 dwelling units \n        on the 61.5 acres that are being removed from the Unit. To \n        increase the habitat value of the modified Captain Sam's Inlet \n        Unit M08 and the area being removed from the Unit, the owners \n        of this land have indicated a willingness on a voluntary basis \n        to reduce substantially these entitlements and, as a result, \n        reduce allowable density.\n    (b) Ecological Enhancement.--\n            (1) A privately funded project is being developed to \n        increase the ecological health and habitat value of the \n        modified Captain Sam's Inlet Unit M08 and related habitat in \n        and around Kiawah Island. The South Carolina Department of \n        Natural Resources, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and \n        regional and local officials and interested conservation groups \n        are being consulted about project design and implementation.\n            (2) The project is being designed as a valuable public-\n        private partnership project to increase the overall ecological \n        value of habitats for a diversity of native fauna and flora. \n        Species likely to benefit will range from culturally and \n        ecologically significant plant species such as sweetgrass \n        (Muhlenbergia filipes), to indicator mammalian species such as \n        the bobcat (Felis rufus), and declining or threatened avian \n        species such as the piping plover (Charadrius melodus) and \n        painted buntings (Passerine ciris).\n\nSEC. 5. REPLACEMENT OF COASTAL BARRIER RESOURCE SYSTEM MAP RELATING TO \n              CAPTAIN SAM'S INLET UNIT M08 IN CHARLESTON COUNTY, SOUTH \n              CAROLINA.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Coastal Barrier Resource System map of Captain \nSam's Inlet Unit M08 that is dated October 24, 1990, and included in \nthe set of maps referred to in section 4(a) of the Coastal Barrier \nResources Act (16 U.S.C. 3503(a)), is replaced by the map of the unit \nentitled ``John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System Captain \nSam's Inlet Unit M08'' and dated March 2008.\n    (b) Availability.--The Secretary of the Interior shall keep the \nreplacement map referred to in subsection (a) on file and available for \ninspection in accordance with section 4(b) of the Coastal Barrier \nResources Act (16 U.S.C. 3503(b))."
