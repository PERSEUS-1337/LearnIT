FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that:\n            (1) Current commercial fisheries practices in the United \n        States and world wide contribute to a significant waste of \n        edible food resources which are harvested, but discarded \n        without processing for human consumption or other uses.\n            (2) Fish currently harvested but discarded without \n        processing include in some fisheries large numbers of juvenile \n        fish which would have significantly greater value both as an \n        economic asset to the fishery and to the maintenance of the \n        species if they were allowed to reach maturity before \n        harvesting.\n            (3) Fish currently harvested but discarded without \n        processing include in some commercial fisheries significant \n        numbers of adult fish or fish parts which could be processed \n        for human consumption, but which are required to be discarded \n        for various fisheries management purposes, or which are \n        considered unsuitable for a particular market of immediate \n        interest to the fishing vessel operator.\n            (4) Fish currently harvested but discarded without \n        processing include significant numbers of fish of species for \n        which there is presently no viable market, but which, if they \n        remained unharvested, could form the basis for future fisheries \n        as new markets and processing techniques are developed.\n            (5) There is cause for concern that current levels of \n        mortalities among non-target fish species may have adverse \n        environmental consequences.\n            (6) High discard levels, if concentrated geographically, \n        may cause damage to the productivity of the resources using the \n        ocean bottom and near-bottom areas.\n            (7) The current level of scientific knowledge is \n        insufficient to determine if adverse impacts may result from \n        the removal of nutrients presently returned to the ocean \n        through the discard of non-target fish species and of \n        unutilized portions of targeted species.\n            (8) It is in the national interest both environmentally and \n        economically to minimize mortalities among non-target species \n        taken incidentally to the various directed fisheries.\n            (9) It is in the national interest to encourage the \n        utilization where practicable of all parts of fish harvested in \n        directed fisheries for the species.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO MAGNUSON ACT.\n\n    The Fisheries Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et. \nseq.) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection 1801(b)(4) by inserting ``in a non-\n        wasteful manner and'' after ``maintain,'';\n            (2) in subsection 1801(b)(6) by inserting ``in a non-\n        wasteful manner'' after ``such development'';\n            (3) in subsection 1802(21)(B) by inserting ``, including \n        efforts to limit mortality in non-target species for the \n        purposes of resource conservation and food production'' after \n        ``ecological factor'';\n            (4) in section 1802 by adding at the end the following new \n        paragraph:\n            ``(33) The term `non-target species' means fish caught \n        incidentally to fishing for a particular species or group of \n        species and which may or may not be retained aboard the fishing \n        vessel for subsequent processing and/or sale.'';\n            (5) in section 1851(a)(1) by adding ``and encourage the \n        minimization of mortalities among non-target species'' after \n        ``prevent overfishing'';\n            (6) in section 1851(a)(5) by striking the word ``promote'' \n        and inserting in its place the word ``consider'';\n            (7) in section 1851(a) by adding at the end the following \n        new paragraph:\n            ``(8) Conservation and management measures shall encourage \n        the non-wasteful taking of fishery resources, including the \n        reduction of discards of fish and fish parts, and the \n        minimization of mortalities among non-target species.'';\n            (8) in section 1853(a) by redesignating paragraph (4) as \n        paragraph (6) and renumbering the subsequent paragraphs \n        accordingly; and by inserting the following new paragraphs:\n            ``(4) assess and specify--\n                    ``(A) to the maximum extent practicable an estimate \n                by numbers of fish or weight thereof of the extent of \n                anticipated mortalities among non-target species taken \n                incidentally to the fishery or fisheries for which the \n                plan is prepared, and\n                    ``(B) to the maximum extent practicable, an \n                estimate by numbers of fish or weight thereof of \n                anticipated discard levels of fish and fish parts taken \n                pursuant to the fishery, but not utilized;\n            ``(5) contain a description of measures intended to reduce \n        mortalities among non-target species taken incidentally to the \n        fishery or fisheries for which the plan is prepared, and to \n        encourage the use of target species in a manner which minimizes \n        the discard of fish and fish parts;''; and\n            (9) in section 1853 by adding at the end the following new \n        subsection:\n    ``(g) Required Amendment of Management Plans.--Each council shall--\n            ``(1) within one year from the date of enactment of this \n        subsection, submit to the Secretary such amendments for each \n        management plan under its jurisdiction as are needed to comply \n        with subsections (a)(4) and (5) of this section; and\n            ``(2) thereafter submit annually to the Secretary a report \n        identifying any changes to the estimates and descriptions \n        required in subsection (a) (4) and (5) and in paragraph (1) of \n        this subsection, and providing an explanation of the cause or \n        causes of such changes.''."
