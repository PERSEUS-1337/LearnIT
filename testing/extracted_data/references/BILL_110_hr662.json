FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Based on a preliminary study published in December \n1982 by the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \nCivilians, Congress finds the following:\n            (1) During World War II, the United States--\n                    (A) expanded its internment program and national \n                security investigations to conduct the program and \n                investigations in Latin America; and\n                    (B) financed relocation to the United States, and \n                internment, of approximately 2,300 Latin Americans of \n                Japanese descent, for the purpose of exchanging the \n                Latin Americans of Japanese descent for United States \n                citizens held by Axis countries.\n            (2) Approximately 2,300 men, women, and children of \n        Japanese descent from 13 Latin American countries were held in \n        the custody of the Department of State in internment camps \n        operated by the Immigration and Naturalization Service from \n        1941 through 1948.\n            (3) Those men, women, and children either--\n                    (A) were arrested without a warrant, hearing, or \n                indictment by local police, and sent to the United \n                States for internment; or\n                    (B) in some cases involving women and children, \n                voluntarily entered internment camps to remain with \n                their arrested husbands, fathers, and other male \n                relatives.\n            (4) Passports held by individuals who were Latin Americans \n        of Japanese descent were routinely confiscated before the \n        individuals arrived in the United States, and the Department of \n        State ordered United States consuls in Latin American countries \n        to refuse to issue visas to the individuals prior to departure.\n            (5) Despite their involuntary arrival, Latin American \n        internees of Japanese descent were considered to be and treated \n        as illegal entrants by the Immigration and Naturalization \n        Service. Thus, the internees became illegal aliens in United \n        States custody who were subject to deportation proceedings for \n        immediate removal from the United States. In some cases, Latin \n        American internees of Japanese descent were deported to Axis \n        countries to enable the United States to conduct prisoner \n        exchanges.\n            (6) Approximately 2,300 men, women, and children of \n        Japanese descent were relocated from their homes in Latin \n        America, detained in internment camps in the United States, and \n        in some cases, deported to Axis countries to enable the United \n        States to conduct prisoner exchanges.\n            (7) The Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n        Civilians studied Federal actions conducted pursuant to \n        Executive Order 9066 (relating to authorizing the Secretary of \n        War to prescribe military areas). Although the United States \n        program of interning Latin Americans of Japanese descent was \n        not conducted pursuant to Executive Order 9066, an examination \n        of that extraordinary program is necessary to establish a \n        complete account of Federal actions to detain and intern \n        civilians of enemy or foreign nationality, particularly of \n        Japanese descent. Although historical documents relating to the \n        program exist in distant archives, the Commission on Wartime \n        Relocation and Internment of Civilians did not research those \n        documents.\n            (8) Latin American internees of Japanese descent were a \n        group not covered by the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (50 U.S.C. \n        App. 1989b et seq.), which formally apologized and provided \n        compensation payments to former Japanese Americans interned \n        pursuant to Executive Order 9066.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a fact-\nfinding Commission to extend the study of the Commission on Wartime \nRelocation and Internment of Civilians to investigate and determine \nfacts and circumstances surrounding the relocation, internment, and \ndeportation to Axis countries of Latin Americans of Japanese descent \nfrom December 1941 through February 1948, and the impact of those \nactions by the United States, and to recommend appropriate remedies, if \nany, based on preliminary findings by the original Commission and new \ndiscoveries.\n\nSEC. 3.
