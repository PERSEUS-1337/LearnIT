FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Well-woman visits are the foundation on which women's \n        preventive care is built. Such visits include not only specific \n        screening tests, but also a medical history, physical \n        examination, evaluation and counseling, and, as indicated, \n        vaccinations.\n            (2) Over the past 20 years, it has become clear that ``one \n        size does not fit all'' when it comes to prevention. Although a \n        30-year-old woman without risk factors for cervical cancer may \n        only need a Pap test with HPV co-testing every 5 years, the \n        same woman would need more frequent screening if she were \n        infected with HIV or had a history of cervical cancer \n        precursors.\n            (3) It is only after taking a medical history and \n        evaluating and counseling a patient that a physician can make \n        patient-specific recommendations for screening tests, \n        vaccinations, preventive medications, and other preventive \n        services.\n            (4) Well-woman visits facilitate increased access to health \n        care that is shown to identify chronic disease risk factors, \n        promote well-being, and decrease the likelihood or delay the \n        onset of a targeted disease or condition.\n            (5) Heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular \n        diseases are the number one cause of death in American women, \n        claiming over 400,000 lives each year, or nearly one death each \n        minute.\n            (6) Women are less likely than men to receive aggressive \n        diagnosis and treatment for cardiovascular diseases.\n            (7) Women are more likely than men to have forgone needed \n        health care due to cost.\n            (8) Between 2002 and 2010, screening mammography rates \n        among women in the United States who were 50 years of age to 64 \n        years of age declined from about 79 percent to 73 percent.\n            (9) In 2009, only 53 percent of 18- to 64-year-olds in the \n        United States reported having ever received an HIV test.\n            (10) The proportion of women in the United States 22 years \n        of age to 30 years of age who reported never having had a Pap \n        test increased from 6.6 percent in 2000 to 9.0 percent in 2010 \n        despite current recommendations that they receive a Pap test \n        every three years.\n            (11) In 2007, 29.3 percent of women in the United States \n        delivering a live birth did not receive any prenatal care in \n        the first trimester, even though first trimester prenatal care \n        is recommended.\n            (12) Among sexually active females in the United States who \n        are 16 years of age to 20 years of age, only 52.7 percent of \n        such females receiving benefits under the Medicaid program and \n        40.1 percent of such females with health insurance coverage \n        under commercial health insurance plans were screened for \n        genital Chlamydia infections during the measurement year, as \n        reported in 2008. A 2013 analysis published by the Centers for \n        Disease Control and Prevention found that for Chlamydia cases \n        diagnosed in 2008 alone, the associated lifetime direct medical \n        costs amount to $516.7 million.\n            (13) Almost half (49 percent) of the 6.7 million \n        pregnancies in the United States each year (3.2 million) are \n        unintended. Multiple studies have shown that improved access to \n        birth control significantly improves the health of women and \n        their families, as it is directly linked to improved maternal \n        and infant health outcomes. Women that plan their pregnancies \n        are more likely to access prenatal care, improving their own \n        health and the health of their children.\n            (14) Between 2006 and 2010, one-third of all pregnancies \n        were conceived within 18 months of a previous birth, an \n        interval that is potentially harmful to the health of the \n        mother.\n            (15) Improved access to family planning also saves money. \n        For every $1.00 invested in family planning, taxpayers save \n        nearly $4.00 in Medicaid-related expenses.\n            (16) During the 2011-2012 flu season, 53 percent of \n        pregnant women did not receive recommended vaccination against \n        influenza.\n\nSEC. 3. WOMEN'S PREVENTIVE HEALTH AWARENESS CAMPAIGN.\n\n    Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n280g et al.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 399V-6.
