FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Lyme disease is a common but frequently misunderstood \n        illness that, if not caught early and treated properly, can \n        cause serious health problems.\n            (2) Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is \n        transmitted by a tick bite. Early signs of infection may \n        include a rash and flu-like symptoms such as fever, muscle \n        aches, headaches, and fatigue.\n            (3) Although Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics \n        if caught early, the disease often goes undetected because it \n        mimics other illnesses or may be misdiagnosed. Untreated, Lyme \n        disease can lead to severe heart, neurological, eye, and joint \n        problems because the bacteria can affect many different organs \n        and organ systems.\n            (4) If an individual with Lyme disease does not receive \n        treatment, such individual can develop severe heart, \n        neurological, eye, and joint problems.\n            (5) Although Lyme disease accounts for 90 percent of all \n        vector-borne infections in the United States, the ticks that \n        spread Lyme disease also spread other diseases, such as \n        ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, and other strains of Borrelia. All of \n        these diseases in 1 patient makes diagnosis and treatment more \n        difficult.\n            (6) Studies indicate that the actual number of tick-borne \n        disease cases are approximately 10 times the amount reported.\n            (7) Persistence of symptomatology in many patients without \n        reliable testing makes treatment of patients more difficult.\n\nSEC. 3.
