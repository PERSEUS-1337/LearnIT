FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) corporations make significant political contributions \n        and expenditures that directly or indirectly influence the \n        election of candidates and support or oppose political causes;\n            (2) decisions to use corporate funds for political \n        contributions and expenditures are usually made by corporate \n        boards and executives, rather than shareholders;\n            (3) corporations, acting through boards and executives, are \n        obligated to conduct business for the best interests of their \n        owners, the shareholders;\n            (4) historically, shareholders have not had a way to know, \n        or to influence, the political activities of corporations they \n        own;\n            (5) shareholders and the public have a right to know how \n        corporate managers are spending company funds to make political \n        contributions and expenditures benefitting candidates, \n        political parties, and political causes;\n            (6) corporations should be accountable to shareholders in \n        making political contributions or expenditures affecting \n        Federal governance and public policy; and\n            (7) requiring a corporation to obtain the express approval \n        of shareholders prior to making political contributions or \n        expenditures will establish necessary accountability.\n\nSEC. 3. SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF CORPORATE POLITICAL ACTIVITY.\n\n    The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is \namended by inserting after section 14B (15 U.S.C. 78n-2) the following:\n\n``SEC. 14C.
