FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Prescription medications are central to the health care \n        of Americans, accessed by 65 percent of the U.S. public in a \n        given year.\n            (2) Medication related errors, or adverse drug events, are \n        one of the most common types of medical errors and one of the \n        greatest threats to patient safety.\n            (3) Studies and data have documented the prevalence of \n        inappropriate prescribing of medications remains a substantial \n        problem, with an estimated 7,000 deaths in the United States \n        occurring each year as a result of medication errors.\n            (4) Medication errors not only are harmful to patients, but \n        are financially costly to healthcare organizations and \n        providers.\n            (5) Resources that could be spent on direct health care \n        services are diverted to counteract adverse drug events.\n            (6) New tools and systems are necessary to address medical \n        error problems.\n            (7) Technology can be deployed which can vastly improve the \n        medication management process and decrease preventable patient \n        injuries.\n            (8) Electronic prescribing systems hold the potential to \n        substantially improve health care quality by reducing \n        preventable adverse drug events.\n            (9) Investment costs remain an obstacle for healthcare \n        systems to create electronic prescribing systems.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to encourage and create \nincentives for healthcare systems to develop an electronic prescribing \nsystem to improve safety and quality of care for all patients.\n\nSEC. 3.
