    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Change Center and \nClearinghouse Act of 2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There are 26.8 million small business concerns in the \n        United States, and they are the backbone of the American \n        economy. However, small business concerns face overwhelming \n        obstacles in addressing climate change issues, such as reducing \n        their carbon footprint while balancing business needs to remain \n        economically competitive.\n            (2) The United States Government is the largest purchaser \n        of goods and services in the world and plays a large role in \n        influencing the overall business marketplace. In 2006, the \n        United States Government spent over $417 billion on goods and \n        services in 8.3 million separate contract actions. Small \n        business concerns won approximately $80 billion in contracts \n        which is about 21.5 percent of the remaining prime contracts.\n            (3) The Small Business Act of 1953 specified that small \n        business concerns should be given every opportunity to compete \n        fairly for the award of Federal contracts. Congress has long \n        recognized the value of small business concerns because they \n        are important sources of job creation and economic growth; \n        however, small business concerns are typically disadvantaged in \n        competing against large firms.\n            (4) The United States Environmental Protection Agency has \n        created a directory to help small business concerns access \n        financial services by State or service type (i.e. loans, \n        consulting, credit, etc.) to help small business concerns \n        achieve energy efficiency through their Energy Star Small \n        Business--Financial Resources Directory.\n            (5) The fusion of a powerful purchasing mechanism with \n        green business practices provides a small business concern with \n        significant incentives and opportunities for market penetration \n        of environmentally preferable products, for the development of \n        green services, and for the adoption of green practices in \n        their own facilities.\n            (6) Many small business concerns have taken the first step \n        in incorporating sustainable practices into their own business, \n        however small business concerns face obstacles in comparing the \n        cost, performance, and life cycle environmental impacts of \n        alternatives. Most small business concerns do not have the \n        scientific and technical capability to fully assess the issues \n        and choices to address the impact of climate change. In \n        addition, small business concerns offering green products and \n        services often face barriers to market acceptance of \n        environmentally preferable products and services when competing \n        with products or service practices that have long-standing \n        market penetration.\n            (7) It is vital for the competitiveness of the United \n        States that small business concerns, including small, minority-\n        owned, women-owned, historically underutilized businesses \n        (HUBZones), and veteran-owned small business concerns be \n        provided greater opportunity to become a procurement source for \n        goods and services to Federal agencies. It is also critical \n        that small business concerns be encouraged to develop and \n        supply environmentally sound products and services.\n            (8) By utilizing new energy efficient technologies and \n        whole building design practices, small business concerns can \n        save in long-term operating costs, become more competitive, \n        improve the productivity and health of employees, and reduce \n        their carbon footprint.\n            (9) In the National Small Business Association's 2006 \n        energy survey, the majority of owners of small business \n        concerns said they have been affected by rising energy prices \n        and that reducing energy costs would increase profitability. At \n        the same time, over half of these entrepreneurs have not \n        invested in energy efficient programs for their small business \n        concerns.\n            (10) There are many ways to increase energy efficiency. For \n        example, an owner of a small business concern who replaces \n        twenty 100-watt incandescent bulbs with 27-watt compact \n        fluorescent bulbs would pay $400 up-front, but save $980 over \n        one year.\n            (11) Today, buildings account for more than a third of the \n        carbon emissions in the United States. Whole building design \n        practices, also known as green buildings, have a positive \n        effect on the reduction of green house gases and the health of \n        the environment, increase production of workers, and improve \n        the water supply for communities. Studies have shown--\n                    (A) a 2 to 16 percent increase in productivity in \n                buildings that incorporate whole building design \n                practices; and\n                    (B) that an up-front investment of 2 percent in \n                whole building design practices, on average, results in \n                life cycle savings of 20 percent of the total \n                construction costs.\n            (12) Some of the tools that a small business concern could \n        use to design are--\n                    (A) green roofs, vegetated roof systems that \n                passively perform no less than eight highly beneficial \n                and cost-saving functions;\n                    (B) daylighting, because people respond, \n                concentrate, and think better with diffuse, full-\n                spectrum light provided by the sun;\n                    (C) on-site renewable energy, produced from fuels \n                that have a stable, predictable supply such as solar, \n                wind, biomass, and ground sources;\n                    (D) natural ventilation, which can replace all or \n                part of mechanical ventilation systems, improving \n                indoor air quality and occupant comfort; and\n                    (E) integrated design, the method by which the \n                design team identifies systems early in the process to \n                provide a coordinated implementation of efficiency and \n                building methods, realizing an exponential gain in \n                savings and comfort.\n\nSEC. 3. OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENT, ENERGY, AND CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n    The Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.) is amended by \nredesignating section 37 as section 38, and by inserting after section \n36 the following:\n\n``SEC. 38.
