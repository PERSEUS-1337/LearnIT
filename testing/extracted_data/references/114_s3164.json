FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Cities, towns, and rural communities in the United \n        States continue to face enormous challenges regarding domestic \n        violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking, and other \n        forms of intimate partner violence.\n            (2) One in 3 women have experienced rape, physical \n        violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.\n            (3) Approximately 7,000,000 women are raped or physically \n        assaulted by a current or former intimate partner each year.\n            (4) Each day, an average of 3 women are killed by a current \n        or former partner.\n            (5) Researchers estimate that domestic violence costs \n        employers up to $13,000,000,000 each year.\n            (6) A fundamental component of ending domestic and sexual \n        violence is securing safe and affordable housing for victims.\n            (7) Research indicates that--\n                    (A) nearly 50 percent of all homeless women report \n                that domestic violence was the immediate cause of their \n                homelessness;\n                    (B) 92 percent of homeless women report having \n                experienced severe physical or sexual violence at some \n                point in their lives; and\n                    (C) victims become homeless as a result of sexual \n                assault, and once homeless, they are further vulnerable \n                to sexual victimization and exploitation.\n            (8) Surveys show that a majority of victims that experience \n        a sexual assault in their home do not relocate to a safe \n        environment because they do not have sufficient funds, and are \n        not aware of better options.\n            (9) Domestic and sexual violence victims often find \n        themselves trapped in homes where they are further victimized \n        by caregivers, parents, siblings, landlords, intimate partners, \n        neighbors, or others in or near their home. Economic insecurity \n        and the trauma that often follows sexual assault make it \n        difficult, if not impossible, for many victims to access safe, \n        affordable housing options for themselves and their families.\n            (10) Domestic and sexual violence victims continue to face \n        discrimination in securing and maintaining housing based on \n        their status as victims and as a result of crimes committed \n        against them.\n            (11) Research by the Attorney General of the State of New \n        York found that 67 percent of domestic violence victims \n        reported that discrimination by landlords is a significant \n        obstacle in obtaining housing.\n            (12) Research also shows that victims of domestic violence \n        or sexual assault are commonly denied housing opportunities if \n        a previous residence of the victim was a domestic violence \n        shelter, if the victim has secured a protective order, or if \n        there is other evidence that the victim has experienced a \n        previous domestic violence incident.\n            (13) Studies show that victims of domestic violence or \n        sexual assault often face eviction based on a single domestic \n        violence incident.\n            (14) It is in the public interest that victims of domestic \n        violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking, and other \n        forms of intimate partner violence are not discriminated \n        against, particularly with respect to housing, based on their \n        status as victims or the crimes committed against them.\n            (15) Nothing in this Act should be interpreted to limit the \n        ability of victims of domestic violence or sexual assault to \n        recover for claims of discrimination on the basis of sex or \n        race under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.), \n        including with respect to failure to conform to gender \n        stereotypes or policies that disproportionately affect women.\n\nSEC. 3.
