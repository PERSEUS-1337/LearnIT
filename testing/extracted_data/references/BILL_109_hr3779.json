SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``National Women's \nRights History Project Act of 2005''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The women's rights movement is one of the three great \n        protest traditions in United States history, sharing that \n        status with the struggle for racial equality and the labor \n        movement.\n            (2) On July 19, 1848, a group of activists including \n        Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Mary Ann M'Clintock, \n        convened the first Women's Rights Convention at Wesleyan Chapel \n        in Seneca Falls, New York. During the Convention, 68 women and \n        32 men signed the Declaration of Sentiments calling for a broad \n        array of rights for women, including suffrage.\n            (3) Under the leadership of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and \n        Susan B. Anthony, the National American Women Suffrage \n        Association (NAWSA) was formed. NAWSA was instrumental in \n        securing passage of the 19th amendment, which amended the \n        Constitution to give women the right to vote. The 19th \n        amendment was passed by Congress on June 4, 1919, and was \n        ratified on August 18, 1920.\n            (4) Susan B. Anthony formed the Equal Rights Association, \n        refuted ideas that women were inferior to men, and fought for \n        women's right to vote. She also campaigned for the rights of \n        women to own property, to keep their own earnings, and to have \n        custody of their children. In 1900, she persuaded the \n        University of Rochester to admit women.\n            (5) In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the women's \n        movement expanded to also play a critical role in shaping \n        policies on economic and social welfare.\n\nSEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF VOTES FOR WOMEN HISTORY TRAIL ROUTE AS FEATURE \n              OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK.\n\n    Title XVI of Public Law 96-607, which established the Women's \nRights National Historical Park, is amended by inserting after section \n1601 (16 U.S.C. 410ll) the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 1602.
