    "content": "Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) overthrew Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003 and a permanent (4 year) Iraqi government is now running the day-to-day operations of the country. On January 30, 2005, elections were held in Iraq for a transitional National Assembly and a permanent constitution was adopted on October 15, 2005. On December 15, 2005, elections were held for a permanent (4 year) national assembly, and on May 20, 2006, Prime Minister designate Nouri al-Maliki was named and won approval of a 37-member cabinet. However, even with some relative success recently as a result of additional U.S. forces (\"troop surge\") to help stabilize Baghdad, coalition forces continue to combat insurgents and are attempting to improve the security situation in Iraq. Also, the current refugee crisis and internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Iraq have become another major challenge for the Iraqi government and its neighboring countries. It is estimated that there may be 2 million Iraqi refugees who have fled to Jordan, Syria, and other neighboring states, and approximately 2 million Iraqis who have been displaced within Iraq itself.
