FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In 1999, the Institute of Medicine released a report \n        entitled To Err is Human that described medical errors as the \n        eighth leading cause of death in the United States, with as \n        many as 98,000 people dying as a result of medical errors each \n        year.\n            (2) To address these deaths and injuries due to medical \n        errors, the health care system must identify and learn from \n        such errors so that systems of care can be improved.\n            (3) In their report, the Institute of Medicine called on \n        Congress to provide legal protections with respect to \n        information reported for the purposes of quality improvement \n        and patient safety.\n            (4) The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee of \n        the Senate held 4 hearings in the 106th Congress and 1 hearing \n        in the 107th Congress on patient safety where experts in the \n        field supported the recommendation of the Institute of Medicine \n        for congressional action.\n            (5) Myriad public and private patient safety initiatives \n        have begun. The Quality Interagency Coordination Taskforce has \n        recommended steps to improve patient safety that may be taken \n        by each Federal agency involved in health care and activities \n        relating to these steps are ongoing.\n            (6) The research on patient safety unequivocally calls for \n        a learning environment, rather than a punitive environment, in \n        order to improve patient safety.\n            (7) Voluntary data gathering systems are more supportive \n        than mandatory systems in creating the learning environment \n        referred to in paragraph (5) as stated in the Institute of \n        Medicine's report.\n            (8) Promising patient safety reporting systems have been \n        established throughout the United States and the best ways to \n        structure and use these systems are currently being determined, \n        largely through projects funded by the Agency for Healthcare \n        Research and Quality.\n            (9) The Department of Health and Human Services has \n        initiated several patient safety projects. The Joint Commission \n        on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations issued a patient \n        safety standard that went into effect on July 1, 2001, and the \n        peer review organizations are conducting ongoing studies of \n        clinical performance measurement of care delivered to \n        beneficiaries under the medicare program under title XVIII of \n        the Social Security Act.\n            (10) Many organizations currently collecting patient safety \n        data have expressed a need for legal protections that will \n        allow them to review protected information so that they may \n        collaborate in the development and implementation of patient \n        safety improvement strategies. Currently, the State peer review \n        protections provide inadequate conditions to allow the sharing \n        of information to promote patient safety.\n            (11) In 2001, the Institute of Medicine released a report \n        entitled Crossing the Quality Chasm that found that the United \n        States health care system does not consistently deliver high \n        quality care to patients.\n    (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) encourage a culture of safety and quality in the United \n        States health care system by providing for legal protection of \n        information reported voluntarily for the purposes of quality \n        improvement and patient safety; and\n            (2) ensure accountability by raising standards and \n        expectations for continuous quality improvements in patient \n        safety through the actions of the Secretary of Health and Human \n        Services.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n    Title IX of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 299 et seq.) \nis amended--\n            (1) in section 912(c), by inserting ``, in accordance with \n        part C,'' after ``The Director shall'';\n            (2) by redesignating part C as part D;\n            (3) by redesignating sections 921 through 928, as sections \n        931 through 938, respectively;\n            (4) in section 938(1) (as so redesignated), by striking \n        ``921'' and inserting ``931''; and\n            (5) by inserting after part B the following:\n\n                  ``PART C--PATIENT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT\n\n``SEC. 921.
