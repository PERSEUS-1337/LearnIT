    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Freedom To Save \nAct of 2007''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Under current law applicable to the food stamp program, \n        a household may not have assets that exceed $2,000 (or $3,000 \n        in the case of a household that includes an elderly or disabled \n        member). The program is federally funded, but States can modify \n        or eliminate assets through categorical eligibility (automatic \n        benefits through qualifications for other assistance programs). \n        Benefit levels can be reduced by unearned income, which arise \n        from interest on past savings accounts, retirement accounts, or \n        educational accounts. States count the amount that exceeds the \n        fair market value of $4,650 of a household vehicle, unless they \n        follow TANF rules. States have the discretion to exclude some \n        assets that are excluded in TANF or Medicaid.\n            (2) For low-income families who may need to rely on \n        government assistance in the face of an emergency, saving is \n        actively discouraged by asset limit policies, especially in \n        formal financial institutions. Recent qualitative research \n        indicates that asset limits serve to discourage low-income \n        families from saving, especially in formal financial \n        institutions. These men and women realize that saving is \n        penalized in the current welfare system and if they choose to \n        save, their benefits will be reduced or eliminated.\n            (3) Without a safety net of personal savings, it is more \n        difficult for low-income families to graduate from government \n        assistance and achieve true self-sufficiency--the goal of the \n        1996 welfare reform. Forcing individuals to ``spend down'' \n        personal savings in order to qualify for assistance leaves \n        families vulnerable to temporary income shocks due to emergency \n        or temporary unemployment. Precautionary savings will reduce \n        overall dependence on public assistance.\n            (4)(A) SSI is federally administered with asset limits of \n        $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples. Assets may be \n        reduced by unearned income from interest on past savings \n        accounts or other assets. One household vehicle is excluded \n        from the asset tests, but the value of any other vehicles is \n        counted as assets.\n            (B) Individuals with disabilities who receive SSI benefits \n        and are able to work for short periods of time are penalized \n        for saving any money they earn with a complete loss of \n        benefits.\n            (5) TANF is a cash assistance block grant program whose \n        policies are set by individual States. The 1996 welfare reform \n        law gave states the discretion to set asset limits for TANF, or \n        waive the limit entirely. Today, States' asset limits vary from \n        $1,000 to no limit, with most set from $1,000 to $3,000. A \n        number of States have reformed their asset limits:\n                    (A) Virginia and Ohio have already eliminated the \n                asset limit for TANF. To date, Virginia reports \n                administrative savings due to streamlining the \n                eligibility process and has experienced no increase in \n                fraud.\n                    (B) 16 States have liberalized the financial asset \n                limit for TANF to allow assets of more than $2,000. 29 \n                States have liberalized their vehicle allowances by \n                either eliminating the value of at least one vehicle, \n                or by raising the allowable value of a household \n                vehicle.\n            (6)(A) Within broad Federal guidelines for the SCHIP \n        program, each State determines the design of its program, \n        eligibility groups, benefit packages, payment levels for \n        coverage, and administrative and operating procedures. States \n        have substantial flexibility in setting asset criteria in \n        public health insurance plans for children under Medicaid and \n        the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).\n            (B) 49 States waive asset tests altogether; 2 states \n        (Oregon and Texas) have asset limits in their separate SCHIP \n        programs.\n            (C) Parents applying for public health insurance face more \n        restrictive eligibility criteria than children. 19 States have \n        waived the asset test for parents; 6 states continue to limit \n        assets to $1,000 per household; and 26 States have asset limits \n        that range from $2,000 to $30,000.\n            (7) The personal savings rate was negative in 2005 and 2006 \n        according to the Department of Commerce, meaning that spending \n        outstripped disposable income for the first time since the \n        Great Depression.\n            (8) Asset limits are inefficient and, in some programs, \n        entirely unnecessary. According to the Federal Reserve, most \n        poor and near-poor families hold little to no wealth: in 2004, \n        17 percent of all households had zero or negative net worth, \n        while 29.6 percent had a net worth of less than $10,000. Few \n        families who meet the low income eligibility thresholds that \n        govern eligibility for major income support programs have any \n        significant asset holdings. For people with disabilities, 38 \n        percent live on less than $15,000 annually, and that 58 percent \n        are asset poor.\n            (9) A consistent segment of the American population remains \n        outside the financial mainstream where they rely on costly \n        check cashing and lending institutions: 11 percent of \n        households do not have a checking account and 9 percent do not \n        have a transaction account of any kind. 54 percent of people \n        with disabilities have no savings accounts, and 69 percent have \n        no checking accounts. Low-income families who rely on public \n        assistance are less likely to use a formal financial \n        institution, in part out of fear that any account balance will \n        be penalized by a reduction in benefits.\n            (10) According to the Center for Social Development, the \n        presence of savings and even small asset holdings by a \n        household is associated with a range of positive outcomes, \n        including increased economic stability, educational attainment \n        and performance, and health and psychological well-being.\n            (11) Increasing the number of households that save and the \n        amounts that they save will allow more Americans to achieve \n        greater control, security, independence, and choice in their \n        lives.\n\nSEC. 2.
