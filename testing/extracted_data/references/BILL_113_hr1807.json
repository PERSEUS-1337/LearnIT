FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the utility sector is the largest single source of \n        greenhouse gas emissions in the United States today, producing \n        approximately one-third of the country's emissions;\n            (2) heating and cooling homes accounts for nearly 60 \n        percent of residential electricity usage in the United States;\n            (3) shade trees planted in strategic locations can reduce \n        residential cooling costs by as much as 30 percent;\n            (4) strategically planted shade trees can provide \n        significant carbon benefits both directly (sequestration by the \n        growing tree) and indirectly (reductions in carbon emissions \n        from electricity conservation);\n            (5) trees can reduce the rate and magnitude of stormwater \n        runoff and improve surface water quality;\n            (6) trees reduce topsoil erosion, prevent harmful land \n        pollutants contained in soil from getting into our waterways, \n        slow down water run-off, and ensure that our groundwater \n        supplies are continually being replenished; and\n            (7) trees strategically placed on or near residential \n        property can increase a home's property value.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act:\n            (1) The term ``nonprofit tree-planting organization'' means \n        any organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal \n        Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)), that is exempt from \n        taxation under section 501(a) of such Code (26 U.S.C. 501(a)), \n        which exists, in whole or in part, to--\n                    (A) expand urban and residential tree cover;\n                    (B) distribute young trees for planting;\n                    (C) increase awareness of the environmental and \n                energy-related benefits of trees;\n                    (D) educate the public about proper tree planting, \n                care, and maintenance strategies; or\n                    (E) carry out any combination of the foregoing \n                activities.\n            (2) The term ``retail power provider'' means any entity \n        authorized under applicable State or Federal law to generate, \n        distribute, or provide retail electricity, natural gas, or fuel \n        oil service.\n            (3) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Energy.\n            (4) The term ``State'' means each of the several States, \n        the District of Columbia, and each commonwealth, territory, or \n        possession of the United States.\n            (5) The term ``tree-siting guidelines'' means a \n        comprehensive list of science-based measurements outlining the \n        species and minimum distance required between trees planted \n        pursuant to this Act, in addition to the minimum required \n        distance to be maintained between such trees and--\n                    (A) building foundations;\n                    (B) air conditioning units;\n                    (C) driveways and walkways;\n                    (D) property fences;\n                    (E) preexisting utility infrastructure;\n                    (F) septic systems;\n                    (G) swimming pools; and\n                    (H) other infrastructure as determined appropriate.\n\nSEC. 4. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to assist retail power providers with \nthe establishment and operation of targeted residential tree-planting \nprograms, for the following purposes:\n            (1) Reducing the peak-load demand for electricity in \n        residential areas during the summer months through direct \n        shading of residential buildings provided by strategically \n        planted trees.\n            (2) Reducing wintertime demand for energy in residential \n        areas by blocking cold winds from reaching homes, which lowers \n        interior temperatures and drives heating demand.\n            (3) Protecting air quality and public health by removing \n        harmful pollution from the air.\n            (4) Utilizing the natural photosynthetic and transpiration \n        process of trees to lower ambient temperatures and absorb \n        carbon dioxide, thus mitigating the effects of climate change.\n            (5) Lowering electric bills for residential ratepayers by \n        limiting electricity consumption without reducing benefits.\n            (6) Relieving financial and demand pressure on retail power \n        providers that stems from large peak-load energy demand.\n            (7) Protecting water quality and public health by reducing \n        stormwater runoff and keeping harmful pollutants from entering \n        waterways.\n            (8) Promoting community education, involvement, and \n        stewardship of much-needed tree canopy coverage in residential \n        communities.\n\nSEC. 5. GENERAL AUTHORITY.\n\n    (a) Authority.--The Secretary may establish a grant program to \nprovide financial, technical, and related assistance to retail power \nproviders to support the establishment of new, or continued operation \nof existing, targeted residential tree-planting programs.\n    (b) Public Recognition Initiative.--In addition to the authority \nprovided under subsection (a), the Secretary may also create a national \npublic recognition initiative to encourage participation in tree-\nplanting programs by retail power providers.\n    (c) Cooperation.--In carrying out the grant program established \npursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary may cooperate with, and \nprovide financial, technical, and related assistance for such \ncooperation to, State foresters or equivalent State officials.\n    (d) Requirements for Qualified Tree-Planting Programs.--In order to \nqualify for assistance under this Act, a retail power provider shall, \nin accordance with this Act, establish and operate, or continue \noperating, a tree-planting program that meets each of the following \nrequirements:\n            (1) The program shall provide free or discounted shade-\n        providing or wind-reducing trees to residential consumers \n        interested in lowering their home energy costs.\n            (2) The program shall optimize the electricity-consumption \n        reduction benefit of each tree by planting in strategic \n        locations around a given residence.\n            (3) The program shall either--\n                    (A) provide maximum amounts of shade during summer \n                intervals when residences are exposed to the most sun \n                intensity; or\n                    (B) provide maximum amounts of wind protection \n                during fall and winter intervals when residences are \n                exposed to the most wind intensity.\n            (4) The program shall use the best available science to \n        create and utilize tree-siting guidelines which dictate where \n        the optimum tree species are best planted in locations that \n        ensure adequate root development and that achieve maximum \n        reductions in consumer energy demand while causing the least \n        disruption to public infrastructure, considering overhead and \n        underground facilities.\n            (5) The program shall provide tree recipients with tree \n        planting and tree care instruction and education prior to or in \n        conjunction with delivery of free or discounted trees.\n            (6) The program shall receive certification from the \n        Secretary that it is designed to achieve the goals set forth in \n        paragraphs (1) through (5). In designating criteria for such \n        certification, the Secretary shall collaborate with the Forest \n        Service's Urban and Community Forestry Program to ensure that \n        certification requirements are consistent with such goals.\n    (e) New Program Funding Share.--The Secretary shall ensure that no \nless than 30 percent of the funds made available under this Act are \ndistributed to retail power providers which--\n            (1) have not previously established or operated qualified \n        tree-planting programs; or\n            (2) are operating qualified tree-planting programs which \n        were established no more than three years prior to the date of \n        enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 6.
