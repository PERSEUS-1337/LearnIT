FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Traditionally, the Economic Development Administration \n        has primarily helped communities develop the necessary public \n        infrastructure to enable such communities to foster private \n        sector investment and in many communities public infrastructure \n        remains a critical enabler to economic development.\n            (2) However, in many distressed communities the primary \n        economic development challenge is not a lack of public \n        infrastructure but rather a lack of supporting high growth, \n        globally competitive private sector activities as a generator \n        of quality jobs.\n            (3) Therefore, building upon its existing network of \n        programs, the Economic Development Administration should \n        institute a Competitive Communities Demonstration Program to \n        assist distressed communities develop the necessary economic \n        base to compete in the global marketplace.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act include the following:\n            (1) To enable the Economic Development Administration to \n        become a more active partner in bringing community leadership \n        together with competitive growth businesses to build a new \n        competitive economic base in communities outside the mainstream \n        of economic growth.\n            (2) To raise the economic aspirations of such communities \n        beyond the retention of the existing economic base to building \n        a new competitive economic base for the future.\n\nSEC. 3.
