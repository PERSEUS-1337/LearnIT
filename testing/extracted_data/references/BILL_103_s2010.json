(a) If an application submitted under section \n505(b)(1) is approved on or after the date of enactment of this \nsection, and such application includes reports of pediatric studies \ndescribed and requested in subsection (c), and such studies are \ncompleted and the reports thereof submitted in accordance with \nsubsection (c)(2) or completed and the reports thereof accepted in \naccordance with subsection (c)(3), the Secretary may not make the \napproval of an application submitted under section 505(b)(2) or section \n505(j) which refers to the drug for which the section 505(b)(1) \napproval is granted effective prior to the expiration of 6 months from \nthe earliest date on which the approval of such application for the \ndrug under section 505(b)(2) or section 505(j), respectively, could \notherwise be made effective under the applicable provisions of this \nchapter.\n    ``(b) If the Secretary makes a written request for pediatric \nstudies described in subsection (c) to the holder of an approval under \nsection 505(b)(1) for a drug, and such studies are completed and the \nreports thereof submitted in accordance with subsection (c)(2) or \ncompleted and the reports thereof accepted in accordance with \nsubsection (c)(3), the Secretary may not make the approval of an \napplication submitted under section 505(b)(2) or section 505(j) which \nrefers to the drug subject to the section 505(b)(1) approval effective \nprior to the expiration of 6 months from the earliest date on which an \napproval of such application under section 505(b)(2) or section 505(j), \nrespectively, could otherwise be made effective under the applicable \nprovisions of this chapter. Nothing in this subsection shall affect the \nability of the Secretary to make effective a section 505(b)(2) or \nsection 505(j) approval for a subject drug if such approval is proper \nunder such subsection and is made effective prior to the submission of \nthe reports of pediatric studies described in subsection (c).\n    ``(c)(1) The Secretary may, pursuant to a written request for \nstudies after consultation with the sponsor of an application or holder \nof an approval for a drug under section 505(b)(1), agree with the \nsponsor or holder for the conduct of pediatric studies for such drug.\n    ``(2) If the sponsor or holder and the Secretary agree upon written \nprotocols for such studies, the studies requirement of subsection (a) \nor (b) is satisfied upon the completion of the studies in accordance \nwith the protocols and the submission of the reports thereof to the \nSecretary. Within 60 days after the submission of the report of the \nstudies, the Secretary shall determine if such studies were or were not \nconducted in accordance with the written protocols and reported in \naccordance with the Secretary's requirements for filing and so notify \nthe sponsor or holder.\n    ``(3) If the sponsor or holder and the Secretary have not agreed in \nwriting on the protocols for the studies, the studies requirement of \nsubsection (a) or (b) is satisfied when such studies have been \ncompleted and the reports accepted by the Secretary. Within 90 days \nafter the submission of the reports of the studies, the Secretary shall \naccept or reject such reports and so notify the sponsor or holder. The \nSecretary's only responsibility in accepting or rejecting the reports \nshall be to determine, within 90 days, that the studies fairly respond \nto the written request, that such studies have been conducted in \naccordance with commonly accepted scientific principles and protocols, \nand that such studies have been reported in accordance with the \nSecretary's requirements for filing.\n    ``(4) As used in this section, `pediatric studies' or `studies' \nmeans at least 1 human clinical investigation in a population of \nadolescent age or younger. At the Secretary's discretion, \npharmacokinetic studies may be considered as clinical investigations.\n    ``(d) If the Secretary determines that an approval of an \napplication under section 505(b)(2) or section 505(j) for a drug may be \nmade effective after submission of reports of pediatric studies under \nthis section but before the Secretary has determined whether the \nrequirements of subsection (c) have been satisfied, the Secretary may \ndelay the effective date of any approval under section 505(b)(2) or \nsection 505(j), respectively, until the determination under subsection \n(c) is made, but such delay shall not exceed 90 days. In the event that \nthe requirements of this section are satisfied, the 6-month period \nreferred to in subsection (a) or (b) shall be deemed to have begun on \nthe date an approval of an application under section 505(b)(2) or \nsection 505(j), respectively, would have been permitted absent action \nunder this subsection.\n    ``(e) The Secretary shall publish notice of any determination that \nthe requirements of subsection (c)(2) or (c)(3) have been met and that \napprovals for the drug will be subject to deferred effective dates \nunder this section.''."
