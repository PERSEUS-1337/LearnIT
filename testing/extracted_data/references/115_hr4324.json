    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening Oversight of Iran's \nAccess to Finance Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), \n        informally known as the Iran nuclear deal, the Obama \n        administration agreed to license the sale of commercial \n        passenger aircraft to Iran, the world's foremost state sponsor \n        of terrorism and a jurisdiction of primary money laundering \n        concern.\n            (2) In April 2015, prior to the adoption of the JCPOA, \n        Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew, in publicly advocating for \n        its provisions, stated: ``Make no mistake: deal or no deal, we \n        will continue to use all our available tools, including \n        sanctions, to counter Iran's menacing behavior. Iran knows that \n        our host of sanctions focused on its support for terrorism and \n        its violations of human rights are not, and have never been, up \n        for discussion.''.\n            (3) In March 2016 remarks to the Carnegie Endowment for \n        International Peace, Secretary Lew, in reference to U.S. \n        commitments under the JCPOA, stated: ``While we have lifted the \n        nuclear sanctions, we continue to enforce sanctions directed at \n        support for terrorism and regional destabilization, and missile \n        and human rights violations.''.\n            (4) In an April 2016 forum at the Council on Foreign \n        Relations, Secretary Lew stated that, under the JCPOA, the U.S. \n        committed to lifting its nuclear sanctions, ``but the U.S. \n        financial system is not open to Iran, and that is not something \n        that is going to change''.\n            (5) In September 2016, the Department of the Treasury's \n        Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued licenses \n        permitting the export of up to 97 aircraft for use by Iran Air, \n        the Islamic Republic of Iran's flagship state-owned carrier. \n        These licenses included authorization for U.S. financial \n        institutions ``to engage in all transactions necessary to \n        provide financing or other financial services'' in order to \n        effectuate the sales. In November 2016, OFAC licensed an \n        additional 106 aircraft for purchase by Iran Air, which are \n        also eligible for financing authorized by OFAC.\n            (6) The Department of the Treasury had sanctioned Iran Air \n        in 2011 for its use of commercial passenger aircraft to \n        transport rockets, missiles, and other military cargo on behalf \n        of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Iran's \n        Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics, both of which \n        had been designated under Executive Order No. 13382 for weapons \n        proliferation-related activities. In October 2017, the IRGC \n        went on to be designated under Executive Order No. 13224 for \n        its support of the IRGC-Qods Force, which has provided support \n        to terrorist groups such as Hizballah, Hamas, and the Taliban.\n            (7) Among Iran Air's sanctionable activities, the airline \n        delivered missile or rocket components to the Assad government \n        in Syria, which like Iran is classified as a state sponsor of \n        terrorism.\n            (8) The Assad regime is responsible for a civil conflict \n        that has claimed an estimated 400,000 lives, including through \n        the government's deployment of chemical weapons and barrel \n        bombs against unarmed civilians and children.\n            (9) Despite being delisted in 2016, Iran Air has continued \n        to fly known weapons resupply routes to government-controlled \n        areas of Syria. According to research by the Foundation for \n        Defense of Democracies, between Implementation Day of the JCPOA \n        on January 16, 2016, and May 4, 2017, Iran Air operated at \n        least 134 flights to Syria, which included stops in Abadan, \n        Iran, a suspected IRGC logistical hub for airlifts to the Assad \n        regime.\n            (10) In November 2016 correspondence to the Chairman of the \n        House Committee on Financial Services, the Department of the \n        Treasury noted that the commitment to delist Iran Air under the \n        JCPOA ``does not affect our ability to designate, or re-\n        designate, any Iranian airline that engages in sanctionable \n        activity. The United States retains the ability to designate \n        any individual or entity that engages in sanctionable \n        activities under our authorities targeting conduct outside the \n        scope of the JCPOA, including Iran's support for terrorism, \n        human rights abuses, ballistic missile program, and other \n        destabilizing activities in the region.''.\n            (11) In April 2017, Iran announced a deal for Aseman \n        Airlines to purchase up to 60 commercial aircraft, a \n        transaction that would require authorization by OFAC. Aseman \n        Airlines' chief executive officer, Hossein Alaei, has for \n        decades served as a senior member of the IRGC.\n\nSEC. 3.

and\n                            (iii) any financial institution described \n                        under subsection (b)(1) has had since the date \n                        such authorization was made, or, if the \n                        authorization is no longer in effect, had for \n                        the duration of such authorization, appropriate \n                        policies, procedures, and processes in place to \n                        avoid engaging in sanctionable activities that \n                        may result from the financial institutions' \n                        exposure to Iran;
