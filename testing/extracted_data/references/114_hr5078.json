    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Great Lakes Pipeline Safety Act of \n2016''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Great Lakes are an invaluable national resource, \n        containing one-fifth of the world's fresh surface water and 95 \n        percent of the United States freshwater supply;\n            (2) over 40,000,000 people depend on the Great Lakes for \n        fresh drinking water;\n            (3) the Great Lakes provide 56,000,000,000 gallons of water \n        per day for municipal, agricultural and industrial use;\n            (4) there are more than 3,500 species of plants and animals \n        within the Great Lakes ecosystem;\n            (5) hundreds of thousands of jobs, tied to the \n        $7,000,000,000 recreational fishing and $16,000,000,000 \n        recreational boating industries, directly depend on the Great \n        Lakes;\n            (6) currently, several million gallons per day of hazardous \n        liquids are transported by pipeline across various points along \n        the Great Lakes;\n            (7) modeling studies by the University of Michigan in 2014 \n        and 2016 have concluded that an oil spill originating from a \n        pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac would present \n        particularly severe consequences, potentially impacting over \n        700 miles of Great Lakes shoreline;\n            (8) a joint NOAA-U.S. Coast Guard guidebook on oil spill \n        response planning in marine environments states that, during \n        the first 24 to 48 hours of open water exposure, most oil \n        spills become difficult to recover, burn, or chemically \n        disperse;\n            (9) swift currents beneath the straits and waterways which \n        connect the Great Lakes could rapidly disperse oil spill \n        contaminants following a pipeline breach;\n            (10) certain pipelines on the Great Lakes are located in \n        close proximity to municipal drinking water collection intakes \n        for millions of people; and\n            (11) the United States should seek to protect the Great \n        Lakes, as a unique national asset, from unreasonable risk of \n        environmental and economic harm.\n\nSEC. 3. STUDY ON ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS TO THE GREAT LAKES.\n\n    (a) Study.--Notwithstanding a pipeline integrity management \nprogram, integrity management assessment schedule, or considerations by \nthe Secretary of Transportation resulting in a corrective action order \npursuant to section 60112 of title 49, United States Code, not later \nthan 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary \nshall, in consultation with the United States Coast Guard, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, and other agencies as appropriate, conduct a study to \ndetermine the economic and environmental risks to the Great Lakes of \nspills or leaks of oil or other hazardous liquids in the Straits of \nMackinac from a rupture, breakage, or other failure of onshore, \nunderwater pipeline facilities within the Straits.\n    (b) Contents.--The study required under subsection (a) shall--\n            (1) meet the content requirements of an environmental \n        impact statement as described in part 1502 of title 40, Code of \n        Federal Regulations;\n            (2) describe the potential impacts of such spills or leaks \n        to the public health or welfare, wildlife populations, \n        ecosystems, shorelines, public and private property, economic \n        activity, and water quality in the Great Lakes and connecting \n        waterways;\n            (3) include an assessment of spill responses in a variety \n        of likely and worst-case spill scenarios in those waters; and\n            (4) include the supplemental study conducted under \n        subsection (c).\n    (c) Supplemental Study.--The Secretary of Transportation shall \nconduct, in collaboration with pipeline facility operators and any \nnecessary agencies, a supplemental study to evaluate the condition and \nstructural integrity of onshore, underwater pipeline facilities in the \nStraits of Mackinac, taking into consideration the age, construction \nmaterials, external and internal corrosion, weld integrity, pressure, \nunderwater currents, possible external damage caused by anchor strikes \nor dragging by recreational or cargo vessels, and the presence of in-\nline shutoff valves. Such supplemental study shall utilize both \ninternal inspection technology and pipeline route surveys, depth of \ncover surveys, pressure tests, external corrosion direct assessment, or \nother technology that the operator demonstrates can further the \nunderstanding of the condition of the pipeline facility.\n    (d) Termination of Operation.--Not later than 18 months after the \ndate of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Pipeline and \nHazardous Materials Safety Administration shall terminate the \noperations of an onshore, underwater pipeline facility located in the \nStraits of Mackinac if the Administrator determines that, based on the \nstudies conducted under subsections (a) and (c), such facility poses a \nsufficient risk of hazard to life, property, or the environment to \nnecessitate the termination."
