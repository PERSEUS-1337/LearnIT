FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Small manufacturers are hurt much more than their \n        larger competitors when delays in payments of accounts \n        receivable occur. These small firms hold millions of dollars in \n        outstanding receivables. Especially in an economic slowdown, \n        many larger firms delay payments to their downstream suppliers \n        causing disruptions in the domestic industrial supply chain, \n        creating a greater need to insure payment on terms.\n            (2) As the number and size of accounts receivables \n        outstanding increases, these businesses have fewer resources to \n        buy raw materials, hire workers, and access adequate lines of \n        credit. Small manufacturers and their creditors need additional \n        assurance that customers will pay their accounts on reasonable \n        terms.\n            (3) Failure of payment to downstream suppliers in a \n        reasonable amount of time has had a significant negative impact \n        on the cash flow of small suppliers. The moment a lender sees \n        that a supplier is involved in a financially troubled industry \n        such as the auto industry, they move the supplier into a high \n        risk category or will not extend credit. Government guaranteed \n        account receivables insurance would allow the middle-market \n        companies access to credit lines they need to continue day-to-\n        day operations.\n\nSEC. 3.
