FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n        (1) In 1861, President Lincoln established the Uintah Valley \n    Reservation by Executive order. The Congress confirmed the \n    Executive order in 1864 (13 Stat. 63), and additional lands were \n    added to form the Uintah Indian Reservation (now known as the \n    Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation).\n        (2) Pursuant to subsequent Acts of Congress, lands were \n    allotted to the Indians of the reservation, and unallotted lands \n    were restored to the public domain to be disposed of under \n    homestead and townsite laws.\n        (3) In July 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt reserved lands \n    for the townsite for Duchesne, Utah, by Presidential proclamation \n    and pursuant to the applicable townsite laws.\n        (4) In July 1905, the United States, through the Acting United \n    States Indian Agent in Behalf of the Indians of the Uintah Indian \n    Reservation, Utah, filed two applications, 43-180 and 43-203, under \n    the laws of the State of Utah to appropriate certain waters.\n        (5) The stated purposes of the water appropriation applications \n    were, respectively, ``for irrigation and domestic supply for \n    townsite purposes in the lands herein described'', and ``for the \n    purpose of irrigating Indian allotments on the Uintah Indian \n    Reservation, Utah, * * * and for an irrigating and domestic water \n    supply for townsite purposes in the lands herein described''.\n        (6) The United States subsequently filed change applications \n    which provided that the entire appropriation would be used for \n    municipal and domestic purposes in the town of Duchesne, Utah.\n        (7) The State Engineer of Utah approved the change \n    applications, and the State of Utah issued water right \n    certificates, identified as Certificate Numbers 1034 and 1056, in \n    the name of the United States Indian Service in 1921, pursuant to \n    the applications filed, for domestic and municipal uses in the town \n    of Duchesne.\n        (8) Non-Indians settled the town of Duchesne, and the \n    inhabitants have utilized the waters appropriated by the United \n    States for townsite purposes.\n        (9) Pursuant to title V of Public Law 102-575, Congress \n    ratified the quantification of the reserved waters rights of the \n    Ute Indian Tribe, subject to reratification of the water compact by \n    the State of Utah and the Tribe.\n        (10) The Ute Indian Tribe does not oppose legislation that will \n    convey the water rights appropriated by the United States in 1905 \n    to the city of Duchesne because the appropriations do not serve the \n    purposes, rights, or interests of the Tribe or its members, because \n    the full amount of the reserved water rights of the Tribe will be \n    quantified in other proceedings, and because the Tribe and its \n    members will receive substantial benefits through such legislation.\n        (11) The Secretary of the Interior requires additional \n    authority in order to convey title to those appropriations made by \n    the United States in 1905 in order for the city of Duchesne to \n    continue to enjoy the use of those water rights and to provide \n    additional benefits to the Ute Indian Tribe and its members as \n    originally envisioned by the 1905 appropriations.\n\nSEC. 3.
