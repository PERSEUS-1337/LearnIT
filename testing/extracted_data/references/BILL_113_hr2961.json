SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Christopher Bryski \nStudent Loan Protection Act'' or ``Christopher's Law''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) No requirement exists for private educational lenders' \n        promissory notes to include a clear and conspicuous description \n        of the responsibilities of a borrower and cosigner in the event \n        the borrower or cosigner becomes disabled, incapacitated, or \n        dies.\n            (2) According to the Annual Report of the Bureau of \n        Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) Student Loan Ombudsman, \n        dated October 16, 2012:\n                    (A) ``In less than seven months, the CFPB has \n                handled approximately 2,900 private student loan \n                complaints.''.\n                    (B) ``Co-signers complain that information about \n                discharge or alternative arrangements in the case of \n                death of the primary borrower is not readily available \n                and that decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, \n                giving co-signers little understanding of how the \n                process works, or if they will be successful.''.\n                    (C) ``The complaints and input received by the CFPB \n                resemble many of the same issues experienced by \n                mortgage borrowers, such as improper application of \n                payments, untimeliness in error resolution, and \n                inability to contact appropriate personnel in times of \n                hardship.''.\n                    (D) ``The difference between federal and private \n                student loans in periods of disability was not well-\n                understood.''.\n                    (E) ``There are at least $8 billion of private \n                student loans in default, representing more than \n                850,000 individual loans.''.\n                    (F) ``While lenders do provide the terms of \n                agreement in promissory notes, including associated \n                benefits and protections, many borrowers state they \n                were unaware of the categorical differences between \n                federal and private protections.''.\n            (3) No requirement exists for a private education loan \n        borrower to designate an alternate point of contact on their \n        account in the event of their death or permanent disability.\n            (4) An estimated 1,700,000 people sustain a traumatic brain \n        injury each year, with older adolescents aged 15 to 19 years \n        old more likely to sustain a traumatic brain injury than other \n        age groups.\n            (5) It has been estimated that the annual incidence of \n        spinal cord injury, not including those who die at the scene of \n        an accident, is approximately 40 cases per 1,000,000 people in \n        the United States or approximately 12,000 new cases each year. \n        These injuries can lead to permanent disability or loss of \n        movement and can prohibit the victim from engaging in any \n        substantial gainful activity.\n            (6) In the 2007-2008 academic year, 13 percent of students \n        attending a 4-year public institution of higher education, and \n        26.2 percent of students attending a 4-year private institution \n        of higher education, borrowed monies from private educational \n        lenders.\n            (7) According to Sallie Mae, in 2009, the percentage of \n        cosigned private education loans increased from 66 percent to \n        84 percent of all private education loans.\n\nSEC. 2. ADDITIONAL STUDENT LOAN PROTECTIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 140 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. \n1650) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(g) Additional Protections Relating to Death or Disability of \nBorrower or Cosigner of a Private Education Loan.--\n            ``(1) Clear and conspicuous description of borrower's and \n        cosigner's obligation.--In the case of any private educational \n        lender who extends a private education loan, the lender shall \n        clearly and conspicuously describe, in writing, the cosigner's \n        obligations with respect to the loan, including the effect the \n        death, disability, or inability to engage in any substantial \n        gainful activity of the borrower or any cosigner would have on \n        any such obligation, in language that the Bureau determines \n        would give a reasonable person a reasonable understanding of \n        the obligation being assumed by becoming a cosigner for the \n        loan.\n            ``(2) Designation of individual to act on behalf of the \n        borrower.--In the case of any private educational lender who \n        extends a private education loan, the lender shall require the \n        borrower to designate an individual to have the legal authority \n        to act on behalf of the borrower with respect to the private \n        education loan in the event of the borrower's death, \n        disability, or inability to engage in any substantial gainful \n        activity.\n            ``(3) Counseling.--In the case of any private educational \n        lender who extends a private education loan, the lender shall \n        ensure that the borrower, and any cosigner, receives \n        comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the \n        loan and of the responsibilities the borrower has with respect \n        to such loan, including the information described under section \n        485(l)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n        1092(l)(2)).\n            ``(4) Model form.--The Bureau shall publish a model form \n        under section 105 for describing a cosigner's obligation for \n        purposes of paragraph (1).\n            ``(5) Definition of death, disability, or inability to \n        engage in any substantial gainful activity.--For the purposes \n        of this subsection with respect to a borrower or cosigner, the \n        term `death, disability, or inability to engage in any \n        substantial gainful activity'--\n                    ``(A) means any condition described in section \n                437(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n                1087(a)); and\n                    ``(B) shall be interpreted by the Bureau in such a \n                manner as to conform with the regulations prescribed by \n                the Secretary of Education under section 437(a) of such \n                Act (20 U.S.C. 1087(a)) to the fullest extent \n                practicable, including safeguards to prevent fraud and \n                abuse.''.\n    (b) Definitions.--Subsection (a) of section 140 of the Truth in \nLending Act (15 U.S.C. 1650(a)) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (8) as \n        paragraphs (2) through (9), respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting before paragraph (2) (as redesignated by \n        paragraph (1)) the following:\n            ``(1) the term `cosigner'--\n                    ``(A) means any individual who is liable for the \n                obligation of another without compensation, regardless \n                of how designated in the contract or instrument;\n                    ``(B) includes any person whose signature is \n                requested as condition to grant credit or to forbear on \n                collection; and\n                    ``(C) does not include a spouse of an individual \n                referred to in subparagraph (A) whose signature is \n                needed to perfect the security interest in the loan;''.\n    (c) Rulemaking.--Not later than the end of the 1-year period \nfollowing the date of the enactment of this Act, the Bureau of Consumer \nFinancial Protection shall issue regulations to carry out section \n140(g) of the Truth in Lending Act.\n\nSEC. 3.
