OPERATIONALLY REALISTIC TESTING AGAINST COUNTERMEASURES FOR \n              NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE.\n\n    (a) Testing Requirements.--The Secretary of Defense shall direct \nthe Ballistic Missile Defense Organization--\n            (1) to include in the ground and flight testing of the \n        National Missile Defense system that is conducted before the \n        system becomes operational any countermeasures (including \n        decoys) that--\n                    (A) are likely, or at least realistically possible, \n                to be used against the system; and\n                    (B) are chosen for testing on the basis of what \n                countermeasure capabilities a long-range missile could \n                have and is likely to have, taking into consideration \n                the technology that the country deploying the missile \n                would have or could likely acquire; and\n            (2) to determine the extent to which the exoatmospheric \n        kill vehicle and the National Missile Defense system can \n        reliably discriminate between warheads and such \n        countermeasures.\n    (b) Funding Requirements.--The Secretary, in consultation with the \nDirector of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, shall--\n            (1) determine the amount of additional funding, if any, for \n        the National Missile Defense system (in addition to that \n        previously programmed) that may be necessary for the Secretary \n        to fulfill the requirements set forth in subsection (a) in \n        fiscal years after fiscal year 2002; and\n            (2) submit that determination to the congressional defense \n        committees at the same time that the President submits the \n        budget for fiscal year 2003 to Congress under section 1105(a) \n        of title 31, United States Code.\n    (c) Report by Secretary of Defense.--(1) The Secretary of Defense \nshall submit to Congress, not later than April 15 each year, an annual \nreport on the Department's efforts to establish a program for \noperationally realistic testing of the National Missile Defense system \nagainst countermeasures. The report shall be submitted in both \nclassified and unclassified form.\n    (2) Each such report shall include the Secretary's assessment of \nthe following:\n            (A) The countermeasures available to foreign countries with \n        ballistic missiles that the National Missile Defense system \n        could encounter in a launch of such missiles against the United \n        States.\n            (B) The ability of the National Missile Defense system to \n        defeat such countermeasures, including the ability of the \n        system to discriminate between countermeasures and reentry \n        vehicles.\n            (C) The plans to demonstrate the capability of the National \n        Missile Defense system to defeat such countermeasures and the \n        adequacy of the ground and flight testing to demonstrate that \n        capability.\n    (3) No annual report is required under this subsection after the \nNational Missile Defense system becomes operational.\n    (d) Independent Review Panel.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall \nseek to arrange for the National Academy of Science to establish an \nindependent panel to be composed of scientific and technical experts.\n    (2) The Panel shall assess the following:\n            (A) The countermeasures available for use against the \n        United States National Missile Defense system.\n            (B) The operational effectiveness of that system against \n        those countermeasures.\n            (C) The adequacy of the National Missile Defense flight \n        testing program to demonstrate the capability of the system to \n        defeat the countermeasures.\n    (3) After conducting the assessment required under paragraph (2), \nthe Panel shall evaluate--\n            (A) whether sufficient ground and flight testing of the \n        system will have been conducted before the system becomes \n        operational to support the making of a determination, with a \n        justifiably high level of confidence, regarding the operational \n        effectiveness of the system;\n            (B) whether adequate ground and flight testing of the \n        system will have been conducted, before the system becomes \n        operational, against the countermeasures that are likely, or at \n        least realistically possible, to be used against the system and \n        that other countries have or likely could acquire; and\n            (C) whether the exoatmospheric kill vehicle and the rest of \n        the National Missile Defense system can reliably discriminate \n        between warheads and such countermeasures.\n    (4) Not later than April 15 each year, the Panel shall submit to \nthe Secretary of Defense and to Congress a report on its assessments \nand evaluations. The report shall include any recommendations for \nimproving the flight testing program for the National Missile Defense \nsystem or the operational capability of the system to defeat \ncountermeasures that the Panel determines appropriate.\n    (e) Countermeasure Defined.--In this section, the term \n``countermeasure''--\n            (1) means any deliberate action taken by a country with \n        long-range ballistic missiles to defeat or otherwise counter a \n        United States National Missile Defense system; and\n            (2) includes, among other actions--\n                    (A) use of a submunition released by a ballistic \n                missile soon after the boost phase of the missile;\n                    (B) use of anti-simulation, together with such \n                decoys as Mylar balloons, to disguise the signature of \n                the warhead; and\n                    (C) use of a shroud cooled with liquid nitrogen to \n                reduce the infrared signature of the warhead."
