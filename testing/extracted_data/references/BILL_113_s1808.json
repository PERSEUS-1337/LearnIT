FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Leading legal scholars concur that conflicts between \n        same-sex marriage and religious liberty are real and should be \n        legislatively addressed.\n            (2) As the President stated in response to the decision of \n        the Supreme Court on the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013, \n        ``Americans hold a wide range of views'' on the issue of same-\n        sex marriage, and ``maintaining our Nation's commitment to \n        religious freedom'' is ``vital''.\n            (3) Protecting religious freedom from Government intrusion \n        is a Government interest of the highest order. Legislatively \n        enacted measures advance this interest by remedying, deterring, \n        and preventing Government interference with religious exercise \n        in a way that complements the protections mandated by the First \n        Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n            (4) Laws that protect the free exercise of religious \n        beliefs about marriage will encourage private citizens and \n        institutions to demonstrate similar tolerance and therefore \n        contribute to a more respectful, diverse, and peaceful society.\n\nSEC. 3. PROTECTION OF THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the \nFederal Government shall not take an adverse action against a person, \nwholly or partially on the basis that such person acts in accordance \nwith a religious belief that marriage is or should be recognized as the \nunion of one man and one woman, or that sexual relations are properly \nreserved to such a marriage.\n    (b) Adverse Action Defined.--As used in subsection (a), an adverse \naction means any action taken by the Federal Government to--\n            (1) deny or revoke an exemption from taxation under section \n        501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 of the person who \n        is acting in accordance with the religious belief referred to \n        in subsection (a);\n            (2) disallow a deduction for Federal tax purposes of any \n        charitable contribution made to or by such person;\n            (3) alter in any way the Federal tax treatment of, or cause \n        any tax, penalty, or payment to be assessed against, such \n        person or such person's employees with respect to any benefit \n        provided or not provided by such person to such person's \n        employees, wholly or partially on the basis that the benefit is \n        provided or not provided on account of a religious belief \n        referred to in subsection (a);\n            (4) deem any employee benefit plan covering employees of \n        such person to have lost its status as a ``qualified plan'' \n        under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or \n        to be in violation of any part of the Employee Retirement \n        Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), wholly or \n        partially on the basis that the benefit plan fails to provide a \n        benefit, right, or feature on account of such person's \n        religious belief referred to in subsection (a);\n            (5) deny or exclude such person from receiving any Federal \n        grant, contract, cooperative agreement, loan, license, \n        certification, accreditation, employment, or other similar \n        position or status;\n            (6) deny or withhold from such person any benefit under a \n        Federal benefit program; or\n            (7) otherwise discriminate against such person.\n\nSEC. 4. JUDICIAL RELIEF.\n\n    (a) Cause of Action.--A person may assert an actual or threatened \nviolation of this Act as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding \nand obtain compensatory damages, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, \nor any other appropriate relief against the Federal Government. \nStanding to assert a claim or defense under this section shall be \ngoverned by the general rules of standing under Article III of the \nConstitution.\n    (b) Attorneys' Fees.--Section 722(b) of the Revised Statutes (42 \nU.S.C. 1988(b)) is amended by inserting ``the Marriage and Religious \nFreedom Act,'' after ``the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized \nPersons Act of 2000,''.\n    (c) Authority of United States To Enforce This Act.--The Attorney \nGeneral may bring an action for injunctive or declaratory relief \nagainst an independent establishment described in section 104(1) of \ntitle 5, United States Code, or an officer or employee of that \nindependent establishment, to enforce compliance with this Act. Nothing \nin this subsection shall be construed to deny, impair, or otherwise \naffect any right or authority of the Attorney General, the United \nStates, or any agency, officer, or employee of the United States, \nacting under any law other than this subsection, to institute or \nintervene in any proceeding.\n\nSEC. 5. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n    (a) Broad Construction.--This Act shall be construed in favor of a \nbroad protection of religious beliefs described in section 3, to the \nmaximum extent permitted by the terms of this Act and the Constitution.\n    (b) No Preemption, Repeal, or Narrow Construction.--Nothing in this \nAct shall be construed to preempt State law, or repeal Federal law, \nthat is equally as protective of religious beliefs as, or more \nprotective of religious beliefs than, this Act. Nothing in this Act \nshall be considered to narrow the meaning or application of any other \nState or Federal law protecting religious beliefs.\n    (c) Severability.--If any provision of this Act or any application \nof such provision to any person or circumstance is held to be \nunconstitutional, the remainder of this Act and the application of the \nprovision to any other person or circumstance shall not be affected.\n\nSEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Federal benefit program.--The term ``Federal benefit \n        program'' has the meaning given that term in section 552a of \n        title 5, United States Code.\n            (2) Federal government.--The term ``Federal Government'' \n        includes each authority of any branch of the Government of the \n        United States.\n            (3) Person.--The term ``person'' means a person as defined \n        in section 1 of title 1, United States Code, and includes any \n        such person regardless of religious affiliation or lack \n        thereof, and regardless of for-profit or nonprofit status."
