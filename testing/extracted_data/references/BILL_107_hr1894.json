FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Many African farmers and farmers in Caribbean Basin \n        countries use antiquated techniques to produce their crops, \n        which results in poor crop quality and low crop yields.\n            (2) Many of these farmers are losing business to farmers in \n        European and Asian countries who use advanced planting and \n        production techniques and are supplying agricultural produce to \n        restaurants, resorts, tourists, grocery stores, and other \n        consumers in Africa and Caribbean Basin countries.\n            (3) A need exists for the training of African farmers and \n        farmers in Caribbean Basin countries and other developing \n        countries in state-of-the-art farming techniques regarding \n        standard growing practices, insecticide and sanitation \n        procedures, and other farming methods that will produce \n        increased yields of more nutritious and healthful crops.\n            (4) African-American and other American farmers, including \n        banking and insurance professionals, are a ready source of \n        agribusiness expertise that would be invaluable for African \n        farmers and farmers in Caribbean Basin countries.\n            (5) A United States commitment is appropriate to support \n        the development of a comprehensive agricultural skills training \n        program for these farmers that focuses on--\n                    (A) improving knowledge of insecticide and \n                sanitation procedures to prevent crop destruction;\n                    (B) teaching modern farming techniques, including \n                the identification and development of standard growing \n                practices and the establishment of systems for \n                recordkeeping, that would facilitate a continual \n                analysis of crop production;\n                    (C) the use and maintenance of state-of-the-art \n                farming equipment;\n                    (D) expansion of small farming operations into \n                agribusiness enterprises through the development and \n                use of village banking systems and the use of \n                agricultural risk insurance pilot products, resulting \n                in increased access to credit for these farmers; and\n                    (E) marketing crop yields to prospective purchasers \n                (businesses and individuals) for local needs and \n                export.\n            (6) The participation of African-American and other \n        American farmers and American agricultural farming specialists \n        in such a training program promises the added benefit of \n        improving access to African and Caribbean Basin markets for \n        American farmers and United States farm equipment and products \n        and business linkages for United States insurance providers \n        offering agricultural risk insurance products and technical \n        assistance.\n            (7) Existing programs that promote the exchange of \n        agricultural knowledge and expertise through the exchange of \n        American and foreign farmers have been effective in promoting \n        improved agricultural techniques and food security and thus the \n        extension of additional resources to such farmer to farmer \n        exchanges is warranted.\n\nSEC. 3.
