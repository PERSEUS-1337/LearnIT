    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 56000.5 of the Education Code is amended to read:\n56000.5.\n(a) The Legislature finds and declares that:\n(1) Pupils with low-incidence disabilities, as a group, make up less than 1 percent of the total statewide enrollment for kindergarten through grade 12.\n(2) Pupils with low-incidence disabilities require highly specialized services, equipment, and materials.\n(b) The Legislature further finds and declares that:\n(1) Deafness involves the most basic of human needs\u2014the ability to communicate with other human beings. Many\nhard-of-hearing and deaf\nhard-of-hearing\n, deaf, and nonverbal\nchildren use an appropriate communication mode, sign language, which may be their primary language, while others express and receive language orally and aurally, with or without visual signs or cues. Still others, typically young\nhard-of-hearing and deaf\nhard-of-hearing\n, deaf, and nonverbal\nchildren, lack any significant language skills. It is essential for the well-being and growth of\nhard-of-hearing and deaf\nhard-of-hearing\n, deaf, and nonverbal\nchildren that educational programs recognize the unique nature of deafness and ensure that all\nhard-of-hearing and deaf\nhard-of-hearing\n, deaf, and nonverbal\nchildren have appropriate, ongoing, and fully accessible educational opportunities.\n(2) It is essential that\nhard-of-hearing and deaf\nhard-of-hearing, deaf, and nonverbal\nchildren, like all children, have an education in which their unique communication mode is respected, utilized, and developed to an appropriate level of proficiency.\n(3) It is essential that\nhard-of-hearing and deaf\nhard-of-hearing, deaf, and nonverbal\nchildren have an education in which special education teachers, psychologists, speech therapists, assessors, administrators, and other special education personnel understand the unique nature of deafness and are specifically trained to work with\nhard-of-hearing and deaf\nhard-of-hearing, deaf, and nonverbal\npupils. It is essential that\nhard-of-hearing and deaf\nhard-of-hearing\n, deaf, and nonverbal\nchildren have an education in which their special education teachers are proficient in the primary language mode of those children.\n(4) It is essential that\nhard-of-hearing and deaf\nhard-of-hearing\n, deaf, and nonverbal\nchildren, like all children, have an education with a sufficient number of language mode peers with whom they can communicate directly and who are of the same, or approximately the same, age and ability level.\n(5) It is essential that\nhard-of-hearing and deaf\nhard-of-hearing\n, deaf, and nonverbal\nchildren have an education in which their parents and, where appropriate,\nhard-of-hearing and deaf\nhard-of-hearing\n, deaf, and nonverbal\npeople are involved in determining the extent, content, and purpose of programs.\n(6)\nHard-of-hearing and deaf\nhard-of-hearing\n, deaf, and nonverbal\nchildren would benefit from an education in which they are exposed to\nhard-of-hearing and deaf\nhard-of-hearing\n, deaf, and nonverbal\nrole models.\n(7) It is essential that\nhard-of-hearing and deaf\nhard-of-hearing\n, deaf, and nonverbal\nchildren, like all children, have programs in which they have direct and appropriate access to all components of the educational process, including, but not limited to, recess, lunch, and extracurricular social and athletic activities.\n(8) It is essential that\nhard-of-hearing and deaf\nhard-of-hearing\n, deaf, and nonverbal\nchildren, like all children, have programs in which their unique vocational needs are provided for, including appropriate research, curricula, programs, staff, and outreach.\n(9) Each\nhard-of-hearing and deaf\nhard-of-hearing\n, deaf, and nonverbal\nchild should have a determination of the least restrictive educational environment that takes into consideration these legislative findings and declarations.\n(10) Given their unique communication needs,\nhard-of-hearing and deaf\nhard-of-hearing\n, deaf, and nonverbal\nchildren would benefit from the development and implementation of regional programs for children with low-incidence disabilities.\nSECTION 1.\nSection 51210 of the\nEducation Code\nis amended to read:\n51210.\n(a)The adopted course of study for grades 1 to 6, inclusive, shall include instruction, beginning in grade 1 and continuing through grade 6, in the following areas of study:\n(1)English, including knowledge of, and appreciation for literature and the language, as well as the skills of speaking, reading, listening, spelling, handwriting, and composition.\n(2)Mathematics, including concepts, operational skills, and problem solving.\n(3)Social sciences, drawing upon the disciplines of anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, psychology, and sociology, designed to fit the maturity of the pupils.
