FINDINGS.\n\n            (1) The Government of Iran is currently seeking to develop \n        nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and has \n        an active and successful ballistic missile program.\n            (2) Recent revelations have shown that Iran is further \n        along than previously believed in enriching uranium and \n        developing nuclear weapons, and may only be months away from \n        developing the capability to manufacture nuclear weapons.\n            (3) There is currently not a democratic government in Iran. \n        Iran is an ideological dictatorship presided over by an \n        unelected ``Supreme Leader'' with limitless veto power, an \n        unelected Expediency Council, a Council of Guardians capable of \n        eviscerating any reforms, and a President elected only after \n        the Council disqualified 234 other candidates for being too \n        liberal, reformist, or secular.\n            (4) The April 2003 Department of State report on terrorism \n        indicates that Iran remained the most active state sponsor of \n        terrorism in 2002.\n            (5) That report also states that Iran continues to provide \n        funding, safehaven, training, and weapons to known terrorist \n        groups, notably Hizballah, HAMAS, the Palestine Islamic Jihad, \n        and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\n            (6) Human rights have failed to improve in Iran under the \n        pseudo-reformers. Torture, executions after unfair trials, and \n        censorship of all media remain rampant throughout the country. \n        Stoning and beheading are used as methods of punishment.\n            (7) While the Government of Iran remains overtly hostile to \n        the United States, the people of Iran have demonstrated that \n        they wish for improved relations with the United States.\n            (8) The people of Iran have demonstrated their desire for a \n        democratically-elected, more secular government, committed to \n        protecting the human rights of all of its citizens. The people \n        of Iran have also demonstrated their desire to see such changes \n        come about through an internationally-monitored referendum.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to--\n            (1) support transparent, full democracy in Iran;\n            (2) support an internationally-monitored referendum in Iran \n        by which the Iranian people can peacefully change the system of \n        government in Iran;\n            (3) support the aspirations of the Iranian people to live \n        in freedom; and\n            (4) help the Iranian people achieve a free press and build \n        an open, democratic, and free society.\n\nSEC. 4.
