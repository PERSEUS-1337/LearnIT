FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) While expanded access to credit from both prime and \n        subprime lenders has contributed to the highest homeownership \n        rates in the Nation's history, there is growing evidence that \n        some lenders are engaging in predatory lending practices--\n        excessive front-end fees, single-premium credit life insurance, \n        and exorbitant prepayment penalties--that make homeownership \n        much more costly for families that can least afford it.\n            (2) Borrowers with fair to good credit ratings may be able \n        to obtain loans in the ``prime'' mortgage market, with the \n        lowest interest rates and costs.\n            (3) Borrowers with blemished credit histories obtain \n        mortgage loans in the ``subprime'' mortgage market, with higher \n        interest rates and loan fees than are obtainable in the prime \n        market. Some subprime lenders have been making loans on terms \n        that are regarded as ``predatory''.\n            (4) Predatory lending involves home mortgages, mortgage \n        refinancing, home equity loans, and home repair loans with \n        unjustifiably high interest rates, excessive fees, balloon \n        payments, prepayment penalties, and the imposition of other \n        unreasonable, and sometimes fraudulent, terms.\n            (5) Predatory loans are said to have grown rapidly in \n        minority neighborhoods, often stripping away wealth that may \n        have taken owners decades or a lifetime to accumulate.\n            (6) Some communities that have lacked access to traditional \n        institutions were being victimized by second mortgage lenders, \n        home improvement contractors, and finance companies who peddled \n        high interest rate home equity loans with high loan fees to \n        cash-poor homeowners. Borrowers, who may not have fully \n        understood the terms of the loans, and who may not have been \n        offered adequate disclosures of the loan terms, often have \n        struggled to meet overwhelming mortgage payments and too often \n        ultimately lost their homes through foreclosure.\n            (7) A joint report by the Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development and the Department of the Treasury, issued June 21, \n        2000, entitled ``Curbing Predatory Home Mortgage Lending'', \n        urged the Congress to adopt legislation that would restrict \n        abusive terms and conditions on high-cost loans, prohibit \n        harmful sales practices in mortgage markets, improve consumer \n        literacy and disclosures, prohibit government-sponsored \n        enterprises from purchasing loans with predatory features, and \n        establish predatory lending as a factor in evaluations for the \n        Community Reinvestment Act of 1977.\n            (8) The joint report proposed a four-point plan to address \n        predatory lending practices, which included improving consumer \n        literacy and disclosures by requiring lenders to recommend that \n        applicants for high-cost loans avail themselves of home \n        mortgage counseling, to disclose credit scores to all borrowers \n        upon request, and to give borrowers more timely and more \n        accurate information on loan costs and terms.\n            (9) A number of government agencies have become involved in \n        addressing various aspects of the predatory lending issue in an \n        attempt to reduce the number of lenders that use high-pressure \n        telemarketing sales techniques and mislead borrowers about \n        increases in interest rates and monthly payments on adjustable \n        rate mortgages.\n            (10) Predatory lending threatens to undo the work of many \n        nonprofit organizations that have worked with lenders and local \n        governments to improve distressed neighborhoods. More needs to \n        be done to assist borrowers who already have predatory loans, \n        to educate consumers about the dangers and pitfalls of entering \n        into a home loan, and to refer consumers to appropriate \n        governmental agencies or consumer protection organizations for \n        assistance.\n\nSEC. 3.
