FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States is the world leader in technology, \n        encryption, and computer security.\n            (2) The United States Government, through the expert work \n        of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (referred \n        to in this section as ``NIST'') and the Information Assurance \n        Directorate of the National Security Agency, plays a vital role \n        in developing the tools that keep global electronic \n        communications secure.\n            (3) The United States Government should actively promote \n        privacy and computer security. Allegations that entities within \n        the United States Government seek to undermine the security of \n        encryption standards or commercial products weaken privacy and \n        erode trust in the United States Government and in products \n        from the United States.\n            (4) The actions described in paragraph (3) may take a \n        serious toll on the United States economy. The Information \n        Technology and Innovation Foundation has predicted that United \n        States companies may lose 10 percent of the cloud computing \n        market to overseas competitors due to surveillance and security \n        concerns, a loss that could amount to not less than \n        $35,000,000,000 in lost sales by 2016.\n            (5) The cryptographic expertise of NIST is recognized \n        around the world, but widespread adoption of the robust \n        encryption standards that NIST develops depends on trust.\n            (6) To promote privacy protection and restore trust in the \n        encryption standards of the United States and hardware and \n        software from the United States, the United States Government \n        should be prohibited from undermining the security of the \n        United States technologies on which global commerce relies.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERAL INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT.\n\n    (a) Director of OMB Requirement.--Section 3543(a)(3) of title 44, \nUnited States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``assure, to the maximum extent feasible'' \n        and inserting the following: ``assure--\n                    ``(A) to the maximum extent feasible,'';\n            (2) by inserting ``and'' after the semicolon; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n                    ``(B) that any agency or office described in \n                subparagraph (A) does not intentionally weaken, \n                circumvent, undermine, or create any mechanism through \n                which any agency or office of the Federal Government \n                may bypass, the privacy, security, or encryption \n                protections included in any standard or guideline;''.\n    (b) Requirement for NIST Consultees.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 20 of the National Institute of \n        Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278g-3) is amended--\n                    (A) by redesignating subsection (e) as subsection \n                (f); and\n                    (B) by inserting after subsection (d) the \n                following:\n    ``(e) Each agency or office that the Institute consults with under \nsubsection (c)(1) may not intentionally weaken, circumvent, undermine, \nor create any mechanism through which any agency or office of the \nFederal Government may bypass, the privacy, security, or encryption \nprotections included in any standard or guideline required under \nsubsection (a) or (b).''.\n            (2) Technical and conforming amendments.--Section 22 of the \n        National Institute of Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. \n        278h) is amended--\n                    (A) in subsection (a)(2), by striking ``Computer \n                System Security and Privacy Advisory Board under \n                section 20(f)'' and inserting ``Information Security \n                and Privacy Advisory Board under section 21''; and\n                    (B) in subsection (e)(1), by striking ``Computer \n                System Security and Privacy Advisory Board'' and \n                inserting ``Information Security and Privacy Advisory \n                Board under section 21''.\n\nSEC. 4.
