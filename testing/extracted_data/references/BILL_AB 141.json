    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) Educators and policymakers have long acknowledged that the skills and competencies needed to be an effective teacher are supported through early and structured mentoring and assessment.\n(b) Induction programs help beginning teachers transition into the profession by providing standards-based, individualized assistance that combines the application of theory with intensive mentor-based support and formative assessment.\n(c) In 1998, California created its two-tiered teaching credential system and established the completion of a statewide, standards-based induction program, Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA), as a path toward a clear credential.\n(d) Until 2009, the state provided $4,000 per participating teacher to BTSA providers as part of the Teacher Credentialing Block Grant.\n(e) In order to receive state funding, a local educational agency (LEA) was required to make a local in-kind contribution of $2,000 per participating teacher.\n(f) The combined level of dedicated funding was sufficient for running the program and allowed LEAs to provide induction at no charge to beginning teachers.\n(g) In 2009, due to the Great Recession, the state gave increased flexibility to LEAs by allowing Teacher Credentialing Block Grant funds to be used for any educational purpose.\n(h) In 2013, the state eliminated the majority of K\u201312 categorical programs, including the Teacher Credentialing Block Grant, with the establishment of the local control funding formula (LCFF).\n(i) Although former Teacher Credentialing Block Grant funds are included in LEAs\u2019 base LCFF funding, some induction providers have shifted the costs of induction onto teacher participants, while others have closed their programs altogether.\n(j) According to data collected by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, nearly 12 percent of providers are charging teachers an average of $2,000 per year for induction.\n(k) The large fees place heavy financial burdens on teachers just starting their careers and put the entire responsibility of identifying, accessing, and completing a quality induction program solely on new teachers.\n(l) A new teacher\u2019s inability to access an induction program compromises that teacher\u2019s professional growth and greatly reduces the chance that the teacher will stay in the profession.\n(m) This is particularly troubling because enrollment in teacher preparation programs, and the number of new teaching credentials being issued, have reduced considerably in recent years.\n(n) In 2013, according to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, there were fewer than 20,000 students enrolled in teacher preparation programs in the state, less than half of the number that were enrolled in 2008.\n(o) The shortage is expected to worsen within the next 20 years with projected increases in student enrollment and teacher retirements.\n(p) Access to high quality induction programs is critical to addressing the teacher shortage because induction is an important tool for recruiting and retaining teachers.\n(q) Teacher retention data collected by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing in 2008 demonstrates the effectiveness of induction, showing that 87 percent of teachers who participated in a BTSA program were still teaching five years later.\n(r) The Governor and Legislature recognized induction\u2019s importance by including $490 million in the 2015\u201316 Budget Act for activities that promote educator quality and effectiveness, including support and mentoring for both beginning teachers and administrators.\n(s) The 2015\u201316 Budget Act also directs the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, by September 1, 2015, to work with stakeholders to evaluate any burdens of existing induction requirements and identify funding recommendations, including state, LEA, and teacher candidate responsibilities.\n(t) The allocation and forthcoming report by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing provide a great opportunity to protect and support new teachers by strengthening access and the quality of induction programs.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 44259 of the Education Code is amended to read:\n44259.\n(a) Except as provided in subparagraphs (A) and (C) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (b), each program of professional preparation for multiple or single subject teaching credentials shall not include more than two years of full-time study of professional preparation.\n(b) The minimum requirements for the preliminary multiple or single subject teaching credential are all of the following:\n(1) A baccalaureate degree or higher degree from a regionally accredited institution of postsecondary education. Except as provided in subdivision (c) of Section 44227, the baccalaureate degree shall not be in professional education. The commission shall encourage accredited institutions to offer undergraduate minors in education and special education to students who intend to become teachers.\n(2) Passage of the state basic skills proficiency test that is developed and administered by the commission pursuant to Section 44252.5.\n(3) Satisfactory completion of a program of professional preparation that has been accredited by the Committee on Accreditation on the basis of standards of program quality and effectiveness that have been adopted by the commission. In accordance with the commission\u2019s assessment and performance standards, each program shall include a teaching performance assessment as set forth in Section 44320.2 that is aligned with the California Standards for the Teaching Profession. The commission shall ensure that each candidate recommended for a credential or certificate has demonstrated satisfactory ability to assist pupils to meet or exceed academic content and performance standards for pupils adopted by the state board pursuant to Section 60605.
