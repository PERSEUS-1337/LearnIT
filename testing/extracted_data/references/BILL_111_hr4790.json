FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Corporations make significant political contributions \n        and expenditures that directly or indirectly influence the \n        election of candidates and support or oppose political causes. \n        Decisions to use corporate funds for political contributions \n        and expenditures are usually made by corporate boards and \n        executives, rather than shareholders.\n            (2) Corporations, acting through their boards and \n        executives, are obligated to conduct business for the best \n        interests of their owners, the shareholders.\n            (3) Historically, shareholders have not had a way to know, \n        or to influence, the political activities of corporations they \n        own. Shareholders and the public have a right to know how \n        corporations are spending their funds to make political \n        contributions or expenditures benefitting candidates, political \n        parties, and political causes.\n            (4) Corporations should be accountable to their \n        shareholders in making political contributions or expenditures \n        affecting Federal governance and public policy. Requiring the \n        express approval of a corporation's shareholders prior to \n        making political contributions or expenditures will establish \n        necessary accountability.\n\nSEC. 3. SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF CORPORATE POLITICAL ACTIVITY.\n\n    The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended by inserting after \nsection 14B the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 14C. SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF CERTAIN POLITICAL EXPENDITURES AND \n              DISCLOSURE OF VOTES OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS.\n\n    ``(a) Shareholder Authorization for Political Expenditures.--Any \nsolicitation of any proxy or consent or authorization in respect of any \nsecurity of an issuer shall--\n            ``(1) contain a description of the specific nature of any \n        expenditures for political activities proposed to be made by \n        the issuer for the forthcoming fiscal year not previously \n        approved, to the extent the specific nature is known to the \n        issuer and including the total amount of such proposed \n        expenditures; and\n            ``(2) provide for a separate shareholder vote to authorize \n        such proposed expenditures in such amount.\n    ``(b) Requirements for Expenditures.--No issuer shall make any \nexpenditure for political activities in any fiscal year unless--\n            ``(1) such expenditure is of the nature of those proposed \n        by the issuer pursuant to subsection (a)(1); and\n            ``(2) authorization for such expenditures has been granted \n        by votes representing a majority of outstanding shares pursuant \n        to subsection (a)(2).\n    ``(c) Fiduciary Duty; Liability.--A violation of subsection (b) \nshall be considered a breach of a fiduciary duty of the officers and \ndirectors who authorized such an expenditure.

This \nsubsection shall not apply to any institutional investment manager, or \nany employee, officer, or director thereof, unless the institutional \ninvestment manager makes disclosures in accordance with regulations \nprescribed by the Commission.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
