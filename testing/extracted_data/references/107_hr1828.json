FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) in the face of a more politically complicated and \n        commercially integrated world in the post-cold war era, the \n        unilateral economic sanctions policy of the United States must \n        become a more sophisticated tool in order to better serve the \n        national interests of the United States;\n            (2) Members of Congress need more detailed and unbiased \n        information that can be compared on a yearly basis in order to \n        evaluate accurately the costs and benefits of unilateral \n        economic sanctions; and\n            (3) a comprehensive annual report to pertinent \n        congressional committees from the executive branch on sanctions \n        policy will allow the United States Government to view economic \n        sanctions in a more effective, targeted, and flexible manner \n        and better analyze the success of meeting foreign policy \n        objectives.\n\nSEC. 3.
