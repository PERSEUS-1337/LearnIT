FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Poison centers are the primary defense of the United \n        States against injury and deaths from poisoning. Twenty-four \n        hours a day, the general public as well as health care \n        practitioners contact their local poison centers for help in \n        diagnosing and treating victims of poisoning. In 2007, more \n        than 4 million calls were managed by poison centers providing \n        ready and direct access for all people of the United States, \n        including many underserved populations in the United States, \n        with vital emergency public health information and response.\n            (2) Poisoning is the second most common form of \n        unintentional death in the United States. In any given year, \n        there will be between 3 million and 5 million poison exposures. \n        Sixty percent of these exposures will involve children under \n        the age of 6 who are exposed to toxins in their home. Poisoning \n        accounts for 285,000 hospitalizations, 1.2 million days of \n        acute hospital care, and more than 26,000 fatalities in 2005.\n            (3) In 2008, the Harvard Injury Control Research Center \n        reported that poisonings from accidents and unknown \n        circumstances more than tripled in rate since 1990. In 2005, \n        the last year for which data are available, 26,858 people died \n        from accidental or unknown poisonings. This represents an \n        increase of 20,000 since 1990 and an increase of 2,400 between \n        2004 and 2005. Fatalities from poisoning are increasing in the \n        United States in near epidemic proportions. The funding of \n        programs to reverse this trend is needed now more than ever.\n            (4) In 2004, The Institute of Medicine, of the National \n        Academies recommended that the ``Congress should amend the \n        current Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act \n        Amendments of 2003 to provide sufficient funding to support the \n        proposed Poison Prevention and Control System with its national \n        network of poison centers. Support for the core activities at \n        the current level of service is estimated to require more than \n        $100 million annually.''.\n            (5) Sustaining the funding structure and increasing \n        accessibility to poison control centers will promote the \n        utilization of poison control centers and reduce the \n        inappropriate use of emergency medical services and other more \n        costly health care services. The 2004 Institute of Medicine \n        Report to Congress determined that for every $1 invested in the \n        Nation's poison centers $7 of health care costs are saved. In \n        2005, direct Federal health care program savings totaled in \n        excess of $525 million as the result of poison center public \n        health services.\n            (6) More than 30 percent of the cost savings and financial \n        benefits of the Nation's network of poison centers are realized \n        annually by Federal health care programs (estimated to be more \n        than $1 billion), yet Federal funding support (as demonstrated \n        by the annual authorization of $30.1 million in Public Law 108-\n        194) comprises less than 11 percent of the annual network \n        expenditures of poison centers.\n            (7) Real-time data collected from the Nation's certified \n        poison centers can be an important source of information for \n        the detection, monitoring, and response for contamination of \n        the air, water, pharmaceutical, or food supply.\n            (8) In the event of a terrorist event, poison centers will \n        be relied upon as a critical source for accurate medical \n        information and public health emergency response concerning the \n        treatment of patients who have had an exposure to a chemical, \n        radiological, or biological agent.\n\nSEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF POISON CENTERS NATIONAL TOLL-FREE NUMBER.\n\n    Section 1271 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300d-71) \nis amended to read as follows:\n\n``SEC. 1271. MAINTENANCE OF THE NATIONAL TOLL-FREE NUMBER.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall provide coordination and \nassistance to poison centers for the establishment of a nationwide \ntoll-free phone number, and the maintenance of such number, to be used \nto access such centers.\n    ``(b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated $2,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2000 through 2009 \nto carry out this section; and $1,000,000 for each of the fiscal years \n2010 through 2014 for the maintenance of the nationwide toll-free phone \nnumber under subsection (a).''.\n\nSEC. 4.
