FINDINGS.\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) The nonmedical use of prescription drugs is a growing \n    problem in the United States, particularly among teenagers.\n        (2) According to the Department of Justice's 2009 National \n    Prescription Drug Threat Assessment--\n            (A) the number of deaths and treatment admissions for \n        controlled prescription drugs (CPDs) has increased \n        significantly in recent years;\n            (B) unintentional overdose deaths involving prescription \n        opioids, for example, increased 114 percent from 2001 to 2005, \n        and the number of treatment admissions for prescription opioids \n        increased 74 percent from 2002 to 2006; and\n            (C) violent crime and property crime associated with abuse \n        and diversion of CPDs has increased in all regions of the \n        United States over the past 5 years.\n        (3) According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy's \n    2008 Report ``Prescription for Danger'', prescription drug abuse is \n    especially on the rise for teens--\n            (A) one-third of all new abusers of prescription drugs in \n        2006 were 12- to 17-year-olds;\n            (B) teens abuse prescription drugs more than any illicit \n        drug except marijuana--more than cocaine, heroin, and \n        methamphetamine combined; and\n            (C) responsible adults are in a unique position to reduce \n        teen access to prescription drugs because the drugs often are \n        found in the home.\n        (4)(A) Many State and local law enforcement agencies have \n    established drug disposal programs (often called ``take-back'' \n    programs) to facilitate the collection and destruction of unused, \n    unwanted, or expired medications. These programs help get outdated \n    or unused medications off household shelves and out of the reach of \n    children and teenagers.\n        (B) However, take-back programs often cannot dispose of the \n    most dangerous pharmaceutical drugs--controlled substance \n    medications--because Federal law does not permit take-back programs \n    to accept controlled substances unless they get specific permission \n    from the Drug Enforcement Administration and arrange for full-time \n    law enforcement officers to receive the controlled substances \n    directly from the member of the public who seeks to dispose of \n    them.\n        (C) Individuals seeking to reduce the amount of unwanted \n    controlled substances in their household consequently have few \n    disposal options beyond discarding or flushing the substances, \n    which may not be appropriate means of disposing of the substances. \n    Drug take-back programs are also a convenient and effective means \n    for individuals in various communities to reduce the introduction \n    of some potentially harmful substances into the environment, \n    particularly into water.\n        (D) Long-term care facilities face a distinct set of obstacles \n    to the safe disposal of controlled substances due to the increased \n    volume of controlled substances they handle.\n        (5) This Act gives the Attorney General authority to promulgate \n    new regulations, within the framework of the Controlled Substances \n    Act, that will allow patients to deliver unused pharmaceutical \n    controlled substances to appropriate entities for disposal in a \n    safe and effective manner consistent with effective controls \n    against diversion.\n        (6) The goal of this Act is to encourage the Attorney General \n    to set controlled substance diversion prevention parameters that \n    will allow public and private entities to develop a variety of \n    methods of collection and disposal of controlled substances, \n    including some pharmaceuticals, in a secure, convenient, and \n    responsible manner. This will also serve to reduce instances of \n    diversion and introduction of some potentially harmful substances \n    into the environment.\nSEC. 3. DELIVERY OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES BY ULTIMATE USERS FOR \nDISPOSAL.\n    (a) Regulatory Authority.--Section 302 of the Controlled Substances \nAct (21 U.S.C. 822) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(g)(1) An ultimate user who has lawfully obtained a controlled \nsubstance in accordance with this title may, without being registered, \ndeliver the controlled substance to another person for the purpose of \ndisposal of the controlled substance if--\n        ``(A) the person receiving the controlled substance is \n    authorized under this title to engage in such activity; and\n        ``(B) the disposal takes place in accordance with regulations \n    issued by the Attorney General to prevent diversion of controlled \n    substances.\n    ``(2) In developing regulations under this subsection, the Attorney \nGeneral shall take into consideration the public health and safety, as \nwell as the ease and cost of program implementation and participation \nby various communities. Such regulations may not require any entity to \nestablish or operate a delivery or disposal program.\n    ``(3) The Attorney General may, by regulation, authorize long-term \ncare facilities, as defined by the Attorney General by regulation, to \ndispose of controlled substances on behalf of ultimate users who \nreside, or have resided, at such long-term care facilities in a manner \nthat the Attorney General determines will provide effective controls \nagainst diversion and be consistent with the public health and safety.\n    ``(4) If a person dies while lawfully in possession of a controlled \nsubstance for personal use, any person lawfully entitled to dispose of \nthe decedent's property may deliver the controlled substance to another \nperson for the purpose of disposal under the same conditions as \nprovided in paragraph (1) for an ultimate user.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 308(b) of the Controlled \nSubstances Act (21 U.S.C. 828(b)) is amended--\n        (1) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (2) and \n    inserting ``; or''; and\n        (2) by adding at the end the following:\n        ``(3) the delivery of such a substance for the purpose of \n    disposal by an ultimate user, long-term care facility, or other \n    person acting in accordance with section 302(g).''.\nSEC. 4. DIRECTIVE TO THE UNITED STATES SENTENCING COMMISSION.\n    Pursuant to its authority under section 994 of title 28, United \nStates Code, the United States Sentencing Commission shall review and, \nif appropriate, amend the Federal sentencing guidelines and policy \nstatements to ensure that the guidelines and policy statements provide \nan appropriate penalty increase of up to 2 offense levels above the \nsentence otherwise applicable in Part D of the Guidelines Manual if a \nperson is convicted of a drug offense resulting from the authorization \nof that person to receive scheduled substances from an ultimate user or \nlong-term care facility as set forth in the amendments made by section \n3.\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
