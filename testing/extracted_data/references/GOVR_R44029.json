    "content": "The first section of this report provides an overview of the consideration of FY2016 legislative branch appropriations, with subsections covering each action, including the initial submission of the request on February 2, 2015; hearings held by the House and Senate Legislative Branch Subcommittees; the House subcommittee markup on April 23, 2015; the House Appropriations Committee markup on April 30, 2015; adoption of 302(b) suballocations; consideration of a structured rule in the House Rules Committee on May 18, 2015 ( H.Res. 271 ); consideration and passage of H.R. 2250 in the House on May 19, 2015; the Senate Appropriations Committee reporting the bill, with an amendment in the nature of a substitute, on June 11, 2015 ( S.Rept. 114-64 ); the enactment of continuing resolutions (CRs) including a CR funding the legislative branch from October 1 through December 11, 2015 ( P.L. 114-53 ); a second CR, which extended funding through December 16, 2015 ( P.L. 114-96 ); and a third CR enacted on December 16, 2015 ( P.L. 114-100 ); and the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, on December 18, 2015 ( P.L. 114-113 ). It is followed by a section on prior year actions and funding, which contains historical tables.  The report then addresses the FY2016 budget requests, hearings, and requested administrative language or other major funding issues for individual legislative branch agencies and entities.  Finally, Table 5 through Table 9 list enacted funding levels for FY2015 and requested, House-passed, Senate-reported, and enacted levels for FY2016, while the Appendix lists House, Senate, and conference bills and reports; public law numbers; and enactment dates since FY1998. The Budget for Fiscal Year 2016 was submitted on February 2, 2015. It contains a request for $4.528 billion in new budget authority for legislative branch activities.  By law, the legislative branch request is submitted to the President and included in the budget without change.  A budget amendment was transmitted by the President to Congress on April 14, 2015, also without change. The amendment decreased the overall Senate request by $2.5 million, with smaller decreases for the two joint offices with funding disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate.   Table 2 lists the dates of hearings of the legislative branch subcommittees in 2015. Prepared statements of witnesses were posted on the subcommittee websites. On April 23, 2015, the House Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Legislative Branch held a markup of the FY2016 bill. The subcommittee recommended $3.341 billion, not including Senate items. No amendments were offered. On April 30, 2015, the House Appropriations Committee held a markup of the FY2016 bill. At $3.341 billion (not including Senate items, which are determined by the Senate), the bill would have provided the same level of funding as in FY2015.  Three amendments were adopted, all by voice vote, including a manager's amendment which addressed report language related to committee room renovations, encouraging the Capitol Police to relax enforcement of sledding restriction on Capitol Hill, and communications and coordination between the Capitol Police and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority and other first responders; an amendment offered to the report by Representative Wasserman Schultz directing the House Chief Administrative Officer to establish a House Technology Task Force, which is to identify opportunities to enhance coordination of information technology efforts; and an amendment offered by Representative Fortenberry increasing funding for the Open World Leadership Center by $4.7 million, offset by a reduction to the Capitol Power Plant. The amendment would also insert language limiting any funds supporting Russian participants to those \"engaging in free market development, humanitarian activities, and civic engagement, and ... not ... officials of the central government of Russia.\"  Additional amendments, one defeated and two withdrawn, included an amendment offered by Representative Wasserman Schultz directing the House Chief Administrative Officer to issue a solicitation for, and select, a food services contractor who provides a livable wage. The amendment was defeated, 21 yeas and 29 nays; an amendment offered and withdrawn by Representative Quigley related to the publication of a list of nonconfidential CRS products; and an amendment offered and withdrawn by Representative Honda related to the Office of Compliance and reports on discrimination based on sex and gender identification. The bill was ordered reported by voice vote ( H.R. 2250 , H.Rept. 114-110 ). After allocation of a total spending ceiling (referred to as a 302(a) allocation), the House and Senate Appropriations Committees generally consider separate budget allocations for their subcommittees, including the legislative branch. These suballocations (referred to as 302(b) suballocations) include discretionary and mandatory funds. This process is derived from the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Total levels are established by the House and Senate budget resolutions, and they may be influenced by additional legislation (e.g., the Budget Control Act of 2011, P.L. 112-25 ; and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, P.L. 114-74 ). The House Appropriations Committee met to mark up its proposed suballocations on April 22, 2015. A motion to amend the suballocations was defeated 20-29, and the committee approved them by voice vote. In its Report on the Suballocation of Budget Allocations for Fiscal Year 2016 ( H.Rept. 114-97 ), issued April 29, the House Appropriations Committee indicated that it has allocated $4.435 billion in total budget authority for the legislative branch, including $4.300 billion in discretionary spending and $135 million in mandatory spending. This is equivalent to 0.4% of \"general purpose\" (i.e., not including \"Global War on Terror\") discretionary spending, and 0.2% of total (all discretionary and mandatory) spending allocated to the House Appropriations Committee subcommittees.  In its May 21, 2015, report, Allocation to Subcommittees of Budget Totals from the Concurrent Resolution for Fiscal Year 2016 , the Senate Appropriations Committee indicated that it had allocated $4.444 billion in total budget authority for the legislative branch, including $4.309 billion in discretionary spending ($9.0 million more than the House allocation) and $135 million in mandatory spending (equivalent to the House allocation).  A Senate report with revised suballocations was issued on December 18, 2015, and showed a new suballocation of $4.363 billion in nonsecurity discretionary budget authority for the legislative branch ( S.Rept. 114-197 ). The House Rules Committee met on May 18, to discuss a structured rule for H.R. 2250 .  Of the 22 amendments proposed (including two withdrawn and three submitted after the deadline), the rule made in order three.  The committee had two related roll call votes: 1. The committee voted, 4-8, not to make in order and provide the appropriate waivers for an amendment (#20, offered by Representative Polis) related to food services contractors. 2. The committee voted, 9-4, to report the rule ( H.Res. 271 , H.Rept. 114-120 ).  H.Res. 271 was agreed to in the House (242-179) the next day. H.R. 2250 was debated in the House on May 19.  The House considered three amendments, including  1. an amendment offered by Representative Ratcliffe ( H.Amdt. 239 ) eliminating funding for Open World, and transferring the $5.7 million provided in the House-reported bill to the spending reduction account, which was agreed to (224-199); 2. an amendment offered by Representative Flores ( H.Amdt. 240 ) prohibiting any funds for delivering printed copies of the Congressional Pictorial Directory, which was agreed to (voice vote); and 3. an amendment offered by Representative Blackburn ( H.Amdt. 241 ) providing for a 1% across-the-board reduction\u2014with exceptions for the Capitol Police, \"Architect of the Capitol\u2014Capitol Police Buildings, Grounds and Security,\" and funding for the House Office of the Sergeant at Arms\u2014which was not agreed to (172-250).  The bill, as amended, was agreed to (357-67). The Senate Appropriations Committee met on June 11, 2015, to mark up H.R. 2250 . The Senate-reported version of the bill would have provided $4.309 billion. Senator Schatz, the ranking Member of the subcommittee, offered an amendment based on alternative 302(b) funding allocations. The amendment was not agreed to (14-16).  A \"Managers' package\" was adopted by unanimous consent. The package included an amendment to the report adding, under the Office of Compliance heading, language directing the office to develop a pilot project with the Library of Congress to make the office's administrative dispute resolution process available to Library employees. An interim report is due to the committee by December 1, 2015. The amendment was offered by Senator Blunt, who also serves as the chair of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration and the Joint Committee on the Library. The committee favorably reported the bill, as amended, 27-3.  A continuing resolution (CR) funded the legislative branch from October 1 through December 11, 2015 ( P.L. 114-53 ).  On December 10, 2015, the Senate amended the legislative branch bill ( S.Amdt. 2922 to H.R. 2250 ) to delete the text of that bill and insert language extending the CR through December 16. The amended bill was renamed the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2016 ( S.Amdt. 2923 ), and it did not contain any other provisions or anomalies related to the legislative branch.  The Senate agreed to the amended bill by voice vote. The CR extension was agreed to in the House and signed by the President the next day. A third CR was enacted on December 16, 2015 ( P.L. 114-100 ). The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, was enacted on December 18, 2015 ( P.L. 114-113 ). It provides $4.36 billion for legislative branch activities for FY2016, an increase of 1.5% from the FY2015 level ( P.L. 114-113 ). Chairman Rogers of the House Committee on Appropriations submitted an explanatory statement into the Congressional Record on December 17, 2015. FY2015 funding was provided in Division H of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ), which was enacted on December 16, 2014. The $4.300 billion provided by the act represented an increase of $41.7 million (1.0%) from FY2014 and $164.9 million (-3.7%) less than the request.  Neither a legislative branch appropriations bill, nor a continuing appropriations resolution (CR), containing FY2014 funding was enacted prior to the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1, 2013. A funding gap, which resulted in a partial government shutdown, ensued for 16 days. The funding gap was terminated by the enactment of a CR ( P.L. 113-46 ) on October 17, 2013. The CR provided funding through January 15, 2014. Following enactment of a temporary continuing resolution on January 15, 2014 ( P.L. 113-73 ), a consolidated appropriations bill was enacted on January 17 ( P.L. 113-76 ), providing $4.259 billion for the legislative branch for FY2014. FY2013 funding of approximately $4.061 billion was provided by P.L. 113-6 , which was signed into law on March 26, 2013. The act funded legislative branch accounts at the FY2012 enacted level, with some exceptions (also known as \"anomalies\"), and not including across-the-board rescissions required by Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6 . Section 3004 was intended to eliminate any amount by which the new budget authority provided in the act exceeded the FY2013 discretionary spending limits in Section 251(c)(2) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, as amended by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Subsequent to the enactment of P.L. 113-6 , OMB calculated that additional rescissions of 0.032% of security budget authority and 0.2% of nonsecurity budget authority would be required. The act did not alter the sequestration reductions implemented on March 1, which reduced most legislative branch accounts by 5.0%. The accompanying OMB report indicated a dollar amount of budget authority to be canceled in each account containing nonexempt funds.  Division G of the FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 112-74 ) provided $4.307 billion for the legislative branch. This level was $236.9 million (-5.2%) below the FY2011 enacted level. P.L. 112-10 provided $4.543 billion for legislative branch operations in FY2011. This level represented a $125.1 million decrease from the $4.668 billion provided in the FY2010 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-68 ) and the FY2010 Supplemental Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-212 ). The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act provided $4.402 billion. In FY2009, an additional $25.0 million was provided for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. P.L. 111-32 , the FY2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act, also contained funding for a new Capitol Police radio system ($71.6 million) and additional funding for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) ($2.0 million).  As seen in Table 3 , the legislative branch budget in constant dollars remains below the FY2004 level.   Figure 1 demonstrates the division of budget authority across the legislative branch in FY2015.  Figure 2 shows the timing of legislative branch appropriations actions, including the issuance of House and Senate reports, bill passage, and enactment, since FY1996. It shows that fiscal year funding for the legislative branch has been determined on or before October 1 five times during this period (FY1997, FY2000, FY2004, FY2006, and FY2010), with another two bills enacted during the first month of the fiscal year (FY1998 and FY1999), two in November (FY1996 and FY2002), six in December (FY2001, FY2005, FY2008, FY2012, FY2015, and FY2016), and six in the next calendar year (FY2003, FY2007, FY2009, FY2011, FY2013, and FY2014). The following sections discuss the various legislative branch accounts as well as issues discussed during the hearings on the budget requests.  As stated in the Senate report, the House and Senate conform \"to longstanding practice under which each body of Congress determines its own housekeeping requirements and the other concurs without intervention.\" The Senate requested $930.4 million for FY2016 (including the budget amendment), a 7.6% increase over the $864.3 million provided in FY2015. The FY2016 act provides $870.2 million, an increase of $5.9 million (0.7%), the same level recommended in the Senate-reported bill. Additional information on the Senate account is presented in Table 6 . Appropriations for Senate committees are contained in two accounts: The inquiries and investigations account contains funds for all Senate committees except Appropriations. The Senate requested $135.7 million for inquiries and investigations (including the budget amendment), a 1.9% increase from the FY2015 level of $133.3 million. The FY2016 act continues funding at the FY2015 level, as recommended in the Senate-reported bill. The Committee on Appropriations account contains funds for the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate requested $15.3 million (including the budget amendment), an increase of $187,000 (+1.2%) from the $15.1 million provided in FY2015. The FY2016 act continues funding at the FY2015 level, as recommended in the Senate-reported bill. The Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account (SOPOEA) provides each Senator with funds to administer an office. It consists of an administrative and clerical assistance allowance, a legislative assistance allowance, and an official office expense allowance. The funds may be used for any category of expenses, subject to limitations on official mail.  The Senate requested $438.2 million for FY2016 (including the budget amendment), an increase of $48.2 million (12.4%) from the $390.0 million provided in FY2014 and FY2015. The FY2016 act continues funding at the FY2015 level, as recommended in the Senate-reported bill. At the March 11, 2015, Senate hearing, the subcommittee discussed the request for a new Senate financial management system, threat assessments and coordination with other entities, preparations for dignitary visits as well as costs, the impact of current spending caps on office operations, an outage of Senate computer systems, and recent disruptions in Senate hearings. The Senate-reported bill contains two administrative provisions, including the following: 1. One provision which would require amounts remaining in the Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account (SOPOEA) to be used for deficit reduction or to reduce the federal debt. 2. A provision which would amend 2 U.S.C. 6153, relating to transfers between appropriations for salaries and appropriations for expenses, to include a reference to the Office of the Chaplain of the Senate.  Both provisions were included in P.L. 114-113 . The House requested $1.18 billion for FY2016, equivalent to the FY2014 and FY2015 level. The FY2016 act continues funding at the FY2015 level, as recommended in the House-passed bill. Additional information on headings in the House of Representatives account is presented in Table 7 . Funding for House committees is contained in the appropriation heading \"committee employees,\" which comprises two subheadings. The first subheading contains funds for personnel and nonpersonnel expenses of House committees, except the Appropriations Committee, as authorized by the House in a committee expense resolution. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $123.9 million, the same level provided for FY2014 and FY2015 and included in the FY2016 request and House-passed bill.  The second subheading contains funds for the personnel and nonpersonnel expenses of the Committee on Appropriations. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $23.3 million, the same level provided for FY2014 and FY2015 and included in the FY2016 request and House-passed bill.  The Members' Representational Allowance (MRA) is available to support Members in their official and representational duties. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $554.3 million, the same level provided for FY2014 and FY2015 and included in the FY2016 request and House-passed bill. At the February 25, 2015, hearing, the subcommittee discussed a review by the House Inspector General of procurement policies, funding for the Members' Representational Allowance, current challenges facing House officers, litigation costs, security during the State of the Union, and addressing security threats.  The House requested the continuation of administrative provisions from prior years related to unexpended balances from the MRA; limiting amounts available from the MRA for leased vehicles; and limiting or prohibiting the delivery of bills, resolutions, copies of the Congressional Record , the U.S. Code , the Statement of Disbursements , and the Daily Calendar . During consideration of H.R. 2250 in the House on May 19, 2015, an amendment, H.Amdt. 240 , was agreed to adding a general provision that would prohibit funds made available by the act from being used to deliver a printed copy of the Congressional Pictorial Directory to a Member of the House. This provision was included in the House-passed version of H.R. 2250 . The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act contains this provision, although it was moved to the House of Representatives administrative provisions section.  The U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) are responsible for the security of the Capitol Complex, including the U.S. Capitol, the House and Senate office buildings, the U.S. Botanic Garden, and the Library of Congress buildings and adjacent grounds.  The USCP requested $378.9 million for FY2016, an increase of $30.9 million (+8.9%) from the $347.96 million the USCP received for FY2015. The House-passed bill would have provided $369.0 million (+$21.0 million, or 6.0%, from FY2015). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $366.5 million (+$18.5 million, or 5.3%, from FY2015). The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $375.0 million (+$27.0 million, or 7.8%). Additional information on the USCP is presented in Table 8 . Appropriations for the police are contained in two accounts\u2014a salaries account and a general expenses account. The salaries account contains funds for the salaries of employees; overtime pay; hazardous duty pay differential; and government contributions for employee health, retirement, Social Security, professional liability insurance, and other benefit programs. The general expenses account contains funds for expenses of vehicles; communications equipment; security equipment and its installation; dignitary protection; intelligence analysis; hazardous material response; uniforms; weapons; training programs; medical, forensic, and communications services; travel; relocation of instructors for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center; and other administrative and technical support, among other expenses.  Salaries\u2014the Capitol Police requested $307.4 million for salaries, an increase of $20.9 million (+7.3%) from the $286.5 million provided in FY2015. The House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the bill would have provided $300.0 million (+4.7%). The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $309.0 million (+7.9%). General Expenses\u2014the Capitol Police requested $71.5 million for general expenses, an increase of $10.0 million (+16.3%) from the $61.5 million provided in FY2015. The House-passed bill would have provided $69.0 million (+12.3%). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $66.5 million (+8.1%). The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $66.0 million (+7.4%). Another appropriation relating to the Capitol Police appears within the Architect of the Capitol account for Capitol Police buildings and grounds. USCP requested $28.2 million, an increase of $9.1 million (+47.4%) from the $19.2 million provided in FY2015. The House-passed bill would have provided $22.1 million (+15.1%). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $22.5 million (+17.6%). The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $25.4 million (+32.8%). On February 25, 2015, the House subcommittee discussed reports of morale issues, the role and mission of the Capitol Police, coordination with other police forces, the growth of the Capitol Police, and wait times for clearing security and entering the House office buildings. At a hearing on March 12, 2015, the Senate subcommittee discussed officer morale, community relations, drones, and weighing overtime costs versus hiring new officers. These hearings preceded the April 15, 2015, landing of a gyrocopter on the West Lawn of the Capitol. The Chief of the Capitol Police and the House Sergeant at Arms, however, testified at a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on this incident on April 29. The Committee on House Administration also held an oversight hearing on the Capitol Police on May 20, and on June 3 for House officers, including the House Sergeant at Arms. The Capitol Police requested one administrative provision, authorizing reimbursement from non-governmental entities for non-congressionally sponsored activities. This language amends 2 U.S.C. 1905, which addresses reimbursement for law enforcement assistance from any federal, state, or local government agency (including any agency of the District of Columbia). The House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the bill and the Consolidated Appropriations Act all contain this language.  The Office of Compliance is an independent and nonpartisan agency within the legislative branch. It was established to administer and enforce the Congressional Accountability Act, which was enacted in 1995. The act applies various employment and workplace safety laws to Congress and certain legislative branch entities. The Office of Compliance requested $4.0 million for FY2016, an increase of $61,000 (+1.5%) from the $3.96 million in the FY2015 act. The House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the bill and the Consolidated Appropriations Act continue the FY2015 level.  CBO is a nonpartisan congressional agency created to provide objective economic and budgetary analysis to Congress. CBO cost estimates are required for any measure reported by a regular or conference committee that may vary revenues or expenditures. CBO requested $47.3 million, an increase of $1.6 million (+3.4%), from the $45.7 million provided in FY2015. The House-passed bill would have provided the requested level. The Senate-reported bill would have continued funding at the FY2015 level. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $46.5 million (+1.8%). At a March 9, 2015, hearing, the Senate subcommittee discussed requested staff increases, the use of contractors, a requested administrative provision related to nonimmigrant visas, scoring of Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs), cost estimates for exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act, and dynamic scoring.  The House did not hold a hearing on the CBO budget request. CBO requested two administrative provisions, although they were not included in the House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the bill or the Consolidated Appropriations Act: 1. A provision that would make FY2016 funds available for the compensation of employees in specialty occupations with nonimmigrant visas. Similar authority has been requested, but not provided, since FY2012. 2. A provision that would make up to 50% of FY2016 unobligated balances available through the end of FY2017. Similar authority was requested, but not provided, in FY2015.  The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is responsible for the maintenance, operation, development, and preservation of the U.S. Capitol Complex, which includes the Capitol and its grounds, House and Senate office buildings, Library of Congress buildings and grounds, Capitol Power Plant, Botanic Garden, Capitol Visitor Center, and Capitol Police buildings and grounds. The Architect is responsible for the Supreme Court buildings and grounds, but appropriations for their expenses are not contained in the legislative branch appropriations bill. Operations of the Architect are funded in the following 10 accounts: general administration, Capitol building, Capitol grounds, Senate office buildings, House office buildings, Capitol Power Plant, Library buildings and grounds, Capitol Police buildings and grounds, Capitol Visitor Center, and Botanic Garden.  The Architect requested $661.8 million for FY2016, an increase of $61.5 million (+10.2%) from the FY2015 level of $600.3 million.  The House subcommittee mark would have provided $496.9 million, not including funding for the Senate office buildings (a requested $84.7 million). An amendment offered by Representative Fortenberry at the full committee markup, however, would decrease funding for the Architect of the Capitol, Capitol Power Plant budget by $4.7 million to increase the budget of the Open World Leadership Center. The House-reported and House-passed bill would have provided $492.2 million, not including Senate items. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $579.4 million (-$20.9 million, or -3.5%). The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $612.9 million (+$12.6 million, or +2.1%). Additional funding information on the individual AOC accounts is presented in Table 9 . Among the items discussed at the House subcommittee hearing on February 26, 2015, were the deferred maintenance backlog, the Library's request for additional storage at Fort Meade and construction of Storage Module #5, commemorative trees and the AOC effort to incorporate information about them on its website, Capitol Visitor Center cost overruns and an effort to not have similar overruns with the Cannon House Office Building renewal project, and the appropriate use of the historic buildings revitalization trust fund.  At a hearing on March 17, 2015, the Senate subcommittee discussed the restoration of the Capitol Dome, including expectations for completion before the January 2017 presidential inauguration; phasing and prioritization of projects, including the restoration for the Russell Senate Office Building; stone deterioration; conservation of Union Square and the Grant Memorial; the Alexander Calder \"Mountains and Clouds\" sculpture in the Hart Senate Office Building; contract oversight; and the AOC-requested administrative provision related to the acquisition of the 7.34 acre parcel of land at Fort Meade.  Three administrative provisions requested for FY2016 were included in the House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the bill as well as the Consolidated Appropriations Act: 1. A provision prohibiting the use of funds for bonuses for contractors behind schedule or over budget, first included in FY2015; 2. A provision prohibiting scrims containing photographs of building facades during restoration or construction projects performed by the Architect of the Capitol, first included in FY2015; and 3. A new provision authorizing the Architect of the Capitol to acquire the 7.34-acre parcel of land from the Maryland State Highway Administration at Fort George G. Meade, MD.  One additional provision, requiring an approved plan by the Comptroller General and the House Appropriations Committee before certain obligations of funds for projects in excess of $5 million can be made, was also included in the House-passed bill. Neither the Senate-reported version of the bill nor the Consolidated Appropriations Act included this language. The Library of Congress serves simultaneously as Congress's parliamentary library and the de facto national library of the United States. Its broader services to the nation include the acquisition, maintenance, and preservation of a collection of more than 158 million items in a wide range of traditional and new media; service to the general public and scholarly and library communities; administration of U.S. copyright laws by its Copyright Office; and administration of a national program to provide reading material to the blind and physically handicapped. Its direct services to Congress include the provision of legal research and law-related services by the Law Library of Congress, and a broad range of activities by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), including in-depth and nonpartisan public policy research, analysis, and legislative assistance for Members and committees and their staff; congressional staff training; information and statistics retrieval; and continuing legal education for Members of both chambers and congressional staff. The Library requested $624.5 million for FY2016, an increase of $33.6 million (+5.7%) from the $590.9 million provided in FY2015. The House-passed bill would have provided $591.4 million (+0.1%). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $593.2 million (+0.4%). The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $599.9 million (+1.5%). These figures do not include additional authority to spend receipts. The FY2016 budget contains the following headings: Salaries and expenses\u2014The FY2015 act provided $413.0 million, the same level included in the House-passed FY2016 bill. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $415.3 million (+0.5%). The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $419.6 million (+1.6%). The Library requested $438.0 million (+6.1%) for FY2016. These figures do not include $6.35 million in authority to spend receipts. Copyright Office\u2014The FY2015 act provided $20.7 million for the Copyright Office. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $23.1 million, equivalent to the requested level (+11.5%). The House-passed bill would have provided $21.2 million (+2.5%), and the Senate-reported bill would have provided $20.7 million ($8,000 less than FY2015). These levels do not include authority to spend receipts, which increase by $2.2 million (from $33.6 million to $35.8 million) in the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Congressional Research Service\u2014The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $106.9 million, which is equivalent to the FY2015 enacted level and the level contained in the FY2016 House-passed and Senate-reported bills. CRS had requested $111.96 million, an increase of $5.0 million (+4.7%). Books for the Blind and Physically Handicapped\u2014The FY2015 act provided $50.2 million, the same level recommended in the FY2016 House-passed and Senate-reported bills and contained in the FY2016 act. The Library requested $51.4 million (+2.3%) for FY2016.  The Architect's budget also contains funds for the Library buildings and grounds. The FY2015 act provided $42.2 million, and $65.8 million (+56.0%) was requested for FY2016. The House-passed bill would have provided $36.6 million (-13.3%), and the Senate-reported bill would have provided $29.1 million (-30.9%). The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $40.7 million (-3.5%). At a hearing on February 26, 2015, the House subcommittee discussed copyright modernization efforts, the Veterans and Civil Rights History Projects, the Library's collection growth, storage issues, and the ability of CRS to meet the needs of Congress with its current staffing level.  At a hearing on March 17, 2015, the Senate subcommittee discussed staffing requests, the Library's overseas offices, digitization, and the Copyright Office. The Library requested authority to obligate funds for reimbursable and revolving fund activities. The regular provision establishing a ceiling for obligational authority for these activities ($186.0 million in FY2016) was included in the House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the bill and the FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act. An additional provision was included in the act designating James H. Billington as the Librarian of Congress Emeritus. Dr. Billington served as the 13 th Librarian of Congress, having been confirmed by the Senate on July 24, 1987, and remaining in that position until his retirement on September 30, 2015.  GPO requested $120.0 million for FY2016, nearly the same as provided in FY2015 ($119.99 million). The House-passed bill would have provided $110.2 million (-8.1%). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $119.0 million (-0.8%). The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $117.1 million (-2.4%). GPO's budget authority is contained in three accounts. The FY2015 act renamed these accounts: (1) congressional printing and binding became congressional publishing, (2) Office of Superintendent of Documents (salaries and expenses) became Public Information Programs of the Superintendent of Documents (salaries and expenses), and (3) the revolving fund became the Government Publishing Office Business Operations Revolving Fund. 1. Congressional publishing\u2014The FY2016 act provides $79.7 million, the same level as provided in FY2014 and FY2015 and contained in GPO's request and the FY2016 House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the bill. 2. Public Information Programs of the Superintendent of Documents (salaries and expenses)\u2014The FY2016 act provides $30.5 million for FY2016, the same level as requested and contained in the House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the FY2016 bill. This level is $1.0 million less (-3.2%) than the FY2015 level. 3. Government Publishing Office Business Operations Revolving fund\u2014the revolving fund supports the operation and maintenance of the Government Publishing Office. GPO requested $9.8 million, an increase of $1.0 million (+11.5%) from the $8.8 million provided in FY2015. The House-passed bill would not have provided funding for the revolving fund. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $8.8 million (+0.1%). The FY2016 act provides $6.8 million (-22.0%). GAO responds to requests for studies of federal government programs and expenditures. GAO may also initiate its own work.  GAO requested $553.1 million for FY2016 (+5.9%). The House-passed bill would have provided $522.0 million, the same level as provided in FY2015. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $525.0 million (+0.6%). The FY2016 act provides $531.0 million (+1.7%).  These levels do not include offsetting collections ($25.5 million in FY2016). GAO requested one administrative provision, related to the sending and receiving of detailees to other branches or agencies on a reimbursable, partially reimbursable, or nonreimbursable basis. The provision in the House-passed bill would have authorized the receipt of detailees, while the Senate-reported bill contained a provision authorizing the sending and receiving of detailees. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provision authorizes the receipt of detailees. At the House hearing on February 25, 2015, the subcommittee discussed recent GAO products, including those related to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The Senate subcommittee met on March 10, 2015, and discussed the professional background of employees, the operations of the newly established Center for Audit Excellence, and ways for Congress to respond to GAO's findings. The Open World Leadership Center administers a program that supports democratic changes in other countries by inviting their leaders to observe democracy and free enterprise in the United States. The first program was authorized by Congress in 1999 to support the relationship between Russia and the United States. The program encouraged young federal and local Russian leaders to visit the United States and observe its government and society. Established at the Library of Congress as the Center for Russian Leadership Development in 2000, the center was renamed the Open World Leadership Center in 2003, when the program was expanded to include specified additional countries. In 2004, Congress further extended the program's eligibility to other countries designated by the center's board of trustees, subject to congressional consideration. The center is housed in the Library and receives services from the Library through an inter-agency agreement. As in previous years, Open World was the subject of lengthy discussion during a House FY2016 hearing, the House Appropriations subcommittee markup, the full committee markup, and on the House floor. Open World requested $8.0 million for FY2016, the same level it has requested since FY2014. The request represents an increase of 40.4% from the $5.7 million provided in FY2015. The House subcommittee mark proposed $1.0 million for an orderly shutdown of Open World. Language in the full committee print, released prior to the markup of the FY2016 bill, stated,  The Committee believes given our current fiscal environment, and in light of both the lack of quantifiable results from the Open World Leadership Center and its duplication of programs more appropriately offered by the State Department, the program has long outlived its short-term intent. The Committee has provided an allocation to be used for the orderly shutdown during fiscal year 2016 of the Open World Leadership Center. An amendment offered by Representative Fortenberry at the full committee markup would add $4.7 million for Open World, offset from funding for the \"Architect of the Capitol, Capitol Power Plant\" budget. The operations of Open World, including assessments of its impact, were discussed prior to the adoption (by voice vote) of the amendment. An amendment made in order by the House Rules Committee proposed the elimination of the $5.7 million included in the House-reported bill for Open World and would apply the savings to the spending reduction account. The amendment, H.Amdt. 239 , was agreed to (224-199). Open World was also the subject of two amendments proposed but not made in order by the House Rules Committee: (1) one amendment submitted would have redirected the $4.7 million added to Open World during the full committee markup back to the \"Architect of the Capitol, Capitol Power Plant\"; and (2) one amendment would have redirected $2.5 million from Open World to re-institute the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA).  The Senate-reported bill would have provided $5.7 million, equivalent to the FY2015 level.  The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $5.6 million. The location and future of Open World, attempts to assess its effectiveness, and its inclusion in the legislative branch budget, have been discussed at appropriations hearings and in report language for more than a decade. The funding level for Open World has also varied greatly during this period, although it has decreased each year since FY2009. For FY2015, the House committee recommended $3.4 million, while the Senate committee recommended $5.7 million. Both reports discussed the conflict in Ukraine and Open World's activities in the region. The FY2015 act provided $5.7 million.  For FY2014, the House subcommittee mark would have provided $1.0 million. An amendment to restore funding for Open World to the FY2013 post-sequester level was debated and withdrawn during the full committee markup. The House committee report stated, For many years the Committee has had concern with the placement of the Open World Leadership Center (OWLC) in the Legislative Branch. The Committee understands the program has some strong champions on the Committee. However, with further reductions being made to every program within the Legislative Branch, the Committee has provided $1,000,000 to cover the cost associated with the shutdown of the OWLC. The Committee directs the Executive Director of the OWLC to retain any necessary prior year funds in the Trust to cover any cost in excess of the $1,000,000 provided in this bill be utilized for the orderly shutdown. The Executive Director is further directed that the program termination is to be finalized within one year of enactment of the Legislative Branch fiscal year 2014 appropriation bill. The FY2014 Senate-reported bill would have provided $4.0 million, as well as a provision allowing the Librarian of Congress to transfer up to $6.0 million in nonappropriated funds to Open World. The final enacted FY2014 level was $6.0 million. The FY2013 House-reported bill would have provided $1.0 million, a decrease of $9.0 million (-90.0%), from the $10.0 million provided in FY2012 and requested for FY2013. The House report stated that this funding level would \"cover the cost associated with the shutdown\" and directed that \"the program termination is to be finalized within one year of enactment of the Legislative Branch fiscal year 2013 appropriations bill.\" H.Amdt. 1281 , agreed to by recorded vote (204-203, Roll no. 373), eliminated this funding. At the Senate FY2013 budget request hearing on March 1, 2012, the subcommittee discussed potential options for increasing private funding, including the hire of a development professional. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $10.0 million. The FY2013 act provided $8.0 million, not including sequestration or the across-the-board rescission.  The House-passed FY2012 bill ( H.R. 2551 ) would have provided $1.0 million, a decrease of 91.2% from FY2011. The House report stated, \"The program has some strong champions on the Committee, but with reductions being made to most every program within the Federal budget the Committee has elected to shut down the program and recommends $1,000,000 for shutdown expenses.\" The Senate-reported bill, in contrast, would have provided $10.0 million (-12.1%). The Senate report stated that \"despite the fiscal constraints of the budget this program is necessary for the promotion of democratic principles in countries with historically oppressive rule.\" The FY2012 act contained the Senate-reported level.  The FY2011 level of $11.4 million represented a decrease of $623,000 (-5.2%) from the $12.0 million provided for FY2010.  The FY2010 level represented a decrease of $1.9 million (-13.7%) from FY2009. Additionally, the FY2010 House Appropriations Committee report stated that \"the Legislative Branch Subcommittee has been clear that it expects the Open World program to become financially independent of funding in this bill as soon as possible.\" This sentiment was also expressed in the conference report, which stated,  The conferees are fully supportive of expanded efforts of the Open World Center to raise private funding and expect this effort to reduce the requirements for funding from the Legislative Branch appropriations bill in future years. The Committees look forward to a report of progress being made by the Center's fundraising program prior to hearings on its fiscal year 2011 budget request. The FY2009 level of $13.9 million was a $4.92 million increase (+54.8%) from FY2008. The location within the legislative branch was discussed during a hearing on the FY2009 budget. Ambassador John O'Keefe, the executive director of Open World, testified that the program may attract different participants if associated with the executive branch rather than the Library of Congress, which may be seen as more neutral and nonpartisan. The FY2009 explanatory statement directed the Open World Leadership Center Board of Trustees to work with the State Department and the judiciary to establish a shared funding mechanism.  The $8.98 million provided in FY2008 represented a decrease of $4.88 million (-35.2%) from the $13.86 million provided in FY2007 and FY2006. The location of Open World was also discussed during the FY2008 appropriations cycle, and language was included in the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act requiring Open World to prepare a report by March 31, 2008, on \"potential options for transfer of the Open World Leadership Center to a department or agency in the executive branch, establishment of the Center as an independent agency in the executive branch, or other appropriate options.\"  In 2004, GAO issued a report on the Open World program, examining program participation, purpose, and accountability.  The center was created by Congress in 1988 to encourage public service by congressional staff through training and development programs. The FY2016 act provides $430,000, the same level provided in the FY2015 and FY2014 acts and contained in the FY2016 request and the House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the FY2016 bill.  As in past years, Congress considered a number of general provisions related to the legislative branch. Table 4 lists the provisions considered, the stage originally proposed, and final disposition.  Table 5 through Table 9 provide information on funding levels for the legislative branch overall, the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Capitol Police, and the Architect of the Capitol.  The tables are followed by an Appendix , which lists House, Senate, and conference bills and reports, public law numbers, and enactment dates since FY1998."
