FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Women are serving in the Armed Forces at increasing \n        rates, playing a critical role in the national security of the \n        United States. Women comprise just over 15 percent of military \n        service members and more than 200,000 women serve on active \n        duty in the Armed Forces or in the Selected Reserve.\n            (2) More than 95 percent of women serving in the military \n        are of reproductive age. And approximately 1,100,000 female \n        spouses and dependents of active duty military personnel are of \n        reproductive age.\n            (3) TRICARE covered approximately 1,400,000 women of \n        reproductive age in 2015, including female spouses and \n        dependents of active duty military personnel. For approximately \n        900,000 of these women, TRICARE was their only source of \n        coverage.\n            (4) Contraception is critical for women's health and is \n        highly effective at reducing unintended pregnancy. The Centers \n        for Disease Control and Prevention describe contraception as \n        one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the \n        twentieth century.\n            (5) Contraceptive access is strongly connected to women's \n        greater educational and professional opportunities and \n        increased lifetime earnings. Increased wages and increased \n        control over reproductive decisions provide women with \n        educational and professional opportunities that have increased \n        gender equality over the decades since contraception was \n        introduced.\n            (6) Studies have shown that when cost barriers to the full \n        range of methods of contraception are eliminated, and women \n        receive comprehensive counseling on the various methods of \n        contraception (including highly effective and more expensive \n        Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARCs)), rates of \n        unintended pregnancy decline. Costs can be prohibitive, \n        particularly for LARCs which can have high upfront costs.\n            (7) Research has also shown that investments in effective \n        contraception save public and private dollars.\n            (8) In order to fill gaps in coverage and access to \n        preventive care critical for women's health, the Affordable \n        Care Act (ACA) requires all non-grandfathered individual and \n        group health plans to cover without cost-sharing preventive \n        services, including a set of evidence-based preventive services \n        for women supported by the Health Resources and Services \n        Administration (HRSA). These women's preventive services \n        include the full range of female-controlled U.S. Food and Drug \n        Administration-approved contraceptive methods, effective family \n        planning practices, and sterilization procedures. HRSA has \n        affirmed that contraceptive care includes contraceptive \n        counseling, initiation of contraceptive use, and follow-up care \n        (e.g., management, and evaluation as well as changes to and \n        removal or discontinuation of the contraceptive method).\n            (9) Under the TRICARE program, servicewomen on active duty \n        have full coverage of all prescription drugs, including \n        contraception, without cost-sharing requirements. However, \n        servicewomen not on active duty and female dependents of \n        members of the Armed Forces do not have similar coverage of all \n        prescription methods of contraception approved by the Food and \n        Drug Administration without cost-sharing.\n            (10) Studies indicate that servicewomen need comprehensive \n        counseling for pregnancy prevention, particularly in their \n        predeployment preparations, and the lack thereof is \n        contributing to unintended pregnancies among servicewomen.\n            (11) Research studies based on the Department of Defense \n        Survey of Health Related Behaviors Among Active Duty Military \n        Personnel found a high unintended rate of pregnancy among \n        servicewomen. Adjusting for the difference between age \n        distributions in the Armed Forces and the general population, \n        the rate of unintended pregnancy among servicewomen is higher \n        than among the general population.\n            (12) The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the \n        Services (DACOWITS) has recommended that all the Armed Forces, \n        to the extent that they have not already, implement initiatives \n        that inform servicemembers of the importance of family \n        planning, educate them on methods of contraception, and make \n        various methods of contraception available, based on the \n        finding that family planning can increase the overall readiness \n        and quality of life of all members of the Armed Forces.\n            (13) Health care, including family planning for survivors \n        of sexual assault in the Armed Forces is a critical issue, \n        particularly given the prevalence of sexual assault in the \n        military. Recent data show that women in the military are five \n        times more likely to be victims of sexual assault than men. \n        Servicewomen who are survivors of sexual assault should not be \n        treated differently from civilian survivors. The Department of \n        Defense reported that there were more than 3,000 reported \n        sexual assaults involving service members in fiscal year 2011.\n            (14) Servicewomen on active duty report rates of unwanted \n        sexual contact at approximately 16 times those of the \n        comparable general population of women in the United States. \n        Through regulations, the Department of Defense already supports \n        a policy of ensuring that servicewomen who are sexually \n        assaulted have access to emergency contraception.\n\nSEC. 3.
