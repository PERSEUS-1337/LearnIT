FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States-Mexico border is an interdependent \n        and dynamic region of more than 15,000,000 people with \n        significant and unique public health challenges.\n            (2) These challenges include low rates of health insurance \n        coverage, poor access to health care services, high \n        unemployment rates, low educational attainment, and high rates \n        of dangerous diseases, such as tuberculosis, diabetes, obesity, \n        and other non-communicable diseases.\n            (3) As the 2009 novel influenza A (H1N1) pandemic \n        illustrated, diseases do not respect international boundaries, \n        and a strong public health effort at and along the borders is \n        crucial to not only protect and improve the health of Americans \n        but also to help secure the country against threats to \n        biosecurity and other emerging threats.\n            (4) For 11 years, the United States-Mexico Border Health \n        Commission has served as a crucial binational institution to \n        address these unique and truly cross-border health issues.\n            (5) More than 75 percent of Canadians live within 100 miles \n        of the United States border. The 2003 epidemic of severe acute \n        respiratory syndrome caused more than 250 illnesses in the \n        Greater Toronto Area, just 80 miles from New York.\n\nSEC. 3. UNITED STATES-MEXICO BORDER HEALTH COMMISSION ACT AMENDMENTS.\n\n    The United States-Mexico Border Health Commission Act (22 U.S.C. \n290n et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) in section 3--\n                    (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``; and'' and \n                inserting ``;'';\n                    (B) in paragraph (2), by striking the period and \n                inserting a semicolon; and\n                    (C) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(3) to cooperate with the Canada-United States Pan Border \n        Public Health Preparedness Council (referred to in this Act as \n        the `Council'), as appropriate; and\n            ``(4) to serve as an independent and objective body to both \n        recommend and implement initiatives that solve border health \n        issues.'';\n            (2) in section 5--\n                    (A) in subsection (b), by striking ``should be the \n                leader'' and inserting ``shall be the Chair''; and\n                    (B) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(d) Providing Advice and Recommendations.--Members of the \nCommission and the Council may at any time provide advice or \nrecommendations to the Secretary, Congress, or any Member of Congress \nconcerning issues that are considered by the Commission or Council. \nSuch advice or recommendations may be provided regardless of whether a \nrequest for such is made and regardless of whether the member or \nindividual is authorized to provide such advice or recommendations by \nthe Commission or Council or any other Federal official.'';\n            (3) by redesignating section 8 as section 12;\n            (4) by striking section 7 and inserting the following:\n\n``SEC. 7.
