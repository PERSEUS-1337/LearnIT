    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``USA Jobs Protection Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The H-1B and L-1 visa programs were established to \n        enable United States employers to hire workers with the \n        necessary skills and allow the intracompany transfer of certain \n        workers in the employ of companies with operations outside of \n        the United States.\n            (2) Employers have used the H-1B and L-1 visa programs to \n        fill hundreds of thousands of positions in United States firms.\n            (3) According to a General Accounting Office report, 60 \n        percent of the positions being filled by workers provided under \n        the H-1B visa program are related to information technology.\n            (4) The median annual salaries for information technology \n        employment was $45,000 in 1999.\n            (5) In 2001, Congress specifically banned the displacement \n        of United States employees by H-1B visa holders and mandated \n        that employers pay H-1B workers prevailing United States wages.\n            (6) United States unemployment in information technology \n        specialties has increased over the last 2 years making it more \n        difficult for employers to certify that they are unable to find \n        American information technology employees to fill vacancies as \n        required to gain approval of H-1B visa applications.\n            (7) United States consular officers in foreign countries in \n        the past have expressed concerns that the L-1 visa program was \n        being exploited beyond the original purpose of the program by \n        allowing employers to bring in workers who subsequently are \n        employed by other companies.\n            (8) It has been reported that the former Immigration and \n        Naturalization Service was reviewing the L-1 visa program to \n        assess whether companies were using the L-1 visa to circumvent \n        restrictions associated with the H-1B visa program.\n            (9) The Department of Labor has had very limited authority \n        to enforce the program requirements of the H-1B visa program \n        and no legal authority to police the L-1 visa program.\n            (10) Historical weaknesses in the administration of the H-\n        1B program by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service \n        caused unnecessary delays in processing employer requests and \n        also made the H-1B program vulnerable to abuse.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the H-1B \nand L-1 visa programs are utilized for the purposes for which they were \nintended and not to displace American workers with lower cost foreign \nvisa holders, by closing the loopholes in the programs and \nstrengthening enforcement and penalties for violations of laws.\n\nSEC. 3.
