Colmery of Topeka, Kansas, was \n        marked by exemplary service to his country.\n            (2) Harry Colmery served the United States with distinction \n        during World War I as a first lieutenant and pilot instructor \n        in the Army Air Corps.\n            (3) Upon his return, Harry Colmery remained involved in \n        issues important to the United States Armed Forces and veterans \n        community through the American Legion, serving as the national \n        commander of the American Legion from 1936 to 1937.\n            (4) In 1943, the United States faced an unprecedented \n        number of servicemen and women returning from World War II to \n        civilian life, more than 15,000,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, \n        and Marines.\n            (5) Harry Colmery, and others with the American Legion, \n        helped spearhead efforts to ensure that government programs \n        were in place to ensure that these members of the United States \n        Armed Forces would face an easy transition back to civilian \n        life.\n            (6) During a December 1943 emergency meeting of American \n        Legion leadership to address these concerns at the Mayflower \n        Hotel in Washington, DC, Harry Colmery crafted the initial \n        draft of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, also known \n        as the GI Bill of Rights.\n            (7) This pioneering piece of legislation sought to help GIs \n        buy homes, start businesses, and attend college or technical \n        school upon their return from World War II.\n            (8) Due to Harry Colmery's advocacy, President Franklin D. \n        Roosevelt signed the GI Bill of Rights into law on June 22, \n        1944.\n            (9) In the decade following World War II, more than \n        2,000,000 eligible men and women went to college using the GI \n        Bill of Rights, and another 5,000,000 received other schooling \n        or job training under the GI Bill.\n            (10) From 1944 to 1952, the Veterans Administration backed \n        nearly 2,400,000 home loans for World War II veterans due to \n        the GI Bill of Rights.\n            (11) The GI Bill of Rights has been heralded as one of the \n        most significant pieces of legislation ever produced by the \n        Federal Government, one that has impacted the United States \n        socially, economically, and politically.\n\nSEC. 3.
