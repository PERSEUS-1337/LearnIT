FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Many Federal national security, law enforcement, and \n        intelligence agencies are currently accessing large databases, \n        both public and private, containing information that was not \n        initially collected for national security, law enforcement, or \n        intelligence purposes.\n            (2) These databases contain personal and sensitive \n        information on millions of United States persons.\n            (3) Some of these databases are subject to Federal privacy \n        protections when in private sector control.\n            (4) Risks to personal privacy are heightened when personal \n        information from different sources, including public records, \n        is aggregated in a single file and made accessible to thousands \n        of national security, law enforcement, and intelligence \n        personnel.\n            (5) It is unclear what standards, policies, procedures, and \n        guidelines govern the access to or use of these public and \n        private databases by the Federal Government.\n            (6) It is unclear what Federal Government agencies believe \n        they legally can and cannot do with the information once \n        acquired.\n            (7) The Federal Government should be required to adhere to \n        clear civil liberties and privacy standards when accessing \n        personal information.\n            (8) There is a need for clear accountability standards with \n        regard to the accessing or usage of information contained in \n        public and private databases by Federal agencies.\n            (9) Without accountability, individuals and the public have \n        no way of knowing who is reading, using, or disseminating \n        personal information.\n            (10) The Federal Government should not access personal \n        information on United States persons without some nexus to \n        suspected counterintelligence, terrorist, or other illegal \n        activity.\n\nSEC. 3.
