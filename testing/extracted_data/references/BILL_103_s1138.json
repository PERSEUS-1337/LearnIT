SENSE OF THE CONGRESS; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) public-private partnerships between government and \n        community-based organizations offer an opportunity to--\n                    (A) empower distressed and disconnected communities \n                to develop their own resources and abilities in order \n                to meet the needs of children; and\n                    (B) forge innovative solutions to the challenges \n                confronting the development of the children in such \n                communities; and\n            (2) increased resources should be invested in public-\n        private partnerships.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) because of the increased difficulty of supporting \n        families on a single wage and the growth of single parent \n        families, parents have less time to devote to the supervision, \n        education, and nurturing of their children;\n            (2) the lack of supervision and meaningful activity after \n        school contributes to the spread of gang violence, drug \n        trafficking, and lack of hope among children in our Nation;\n            (3) the problems described in paragraphs (1) and (2) and \n        crimes, although widespread, are particularly acute in \n        communities where there is a concentration of low-income \n        housing;\n            (4) the community has a responsibility for developing our \n        Nation's children into productive adults;\n            (5) because of their centrality, public schools are among \n        the best facilities for providing needed space and support \n        services that expand traditional uses of schools;\n            (6) schools are most effective when the people of the \n        community are involved in activities designed to fulfill the \n        needs of children in the community; and\n            (7) homes, community centers, recreational facilities and \n        other places where children gather, have a significant impact \n        on children.\n    (c) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act--\n            (1) to set forth the vision and plan for a nationwide \n        restructuring of the way communities engage in the nurturing \n        and development of children, especially children living and \n        growing up in urban neighborhoods throughout the Nation;\n            (2) to provide (in collaboration with other public, private \n        and nonprofit organizations and agencies) curriculum-based \n        educational, recreational, cultural, health, social, and other \n        related community and human services; and\n            (3) to test the effects of assisting communities located \n        within economically distressed areas to develop and conduct \n        programs that will increase the academic success of students \n        and improve work force readiness.\n\nSEC. 2.
