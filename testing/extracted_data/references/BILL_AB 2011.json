    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 19607 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:\n19607.\n(a) Notwithstanding Sections 19605.8 and 19605.9, when satellite wagering is conducted on thoroughbred races at associations or fairs in the central or southern zone, an amount not to exceed 2 percent of the total amount handled by all of those satellite wagering facilities shall be deducted from the funds otherwise allocated for distribution as commissions, purses, and owners\u2019 premiums and instead distributed to an organization formed and operated by one licensed association from each facility in the central and southern zones at which a thoroughbred or fair racing meeting is conducted, and the organization representing thoroughbred horsemen and horsewomen, for use in accordance with Section 19607.1.\n(b) A vote of the organization representing thoroughbred horsemen and horsewomen shall constitute 50 percent of all voting interests on the board of the organization formed and operated to administer the fund. The other 50 percent of all voting interests shall be allocated equally among the other members of the organization. Any use of funds by the organization shall be approved by the affirmative vote of both (1) the organization representing thoroughbred horsemen and horsewomen, and (2) at least two of the licensed thoroughbred racing associations that are part of the organization formed pursuant to this section, provided, however, that, if there are only two licensed thoroughbred racing associations that are part of the organization formed pursuant to this section, the vote of at least one of those two licensed thoroughbred racing associations shall be sufficient.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 19607.1 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:\n19607.1.\n(a) Notwithstanding Section 19535, the funds distributed to the organization formed pursuant to Section 19607 shall be used to pay the expenses of the organization and compensate the provider of a board-approved auxiliary facility for offsite stabling and training of thoroughbred horses in the central or southern zone. The organization administering the offsite stabling and vanning program shall submit its proposed financial and operational plans for the upcoming calendar year to the board for review no later than November 1 of the preceding year. Neither the organization administering the offsite stabling and vanning program nor any of the entities forming and operating the organization, except an entity operating the auxiliary offsite stabling facility where the injury occurred, shall be liable for any injury to any jockey, exercise person, owner, trainer, or any employee or agent thereof, or any horse occurring at any offsite stabling facility.\n(b) The funds shall also be used to cover all or part of the cost of vanning thoroughbred horses from a board-approved auxiliary offsite stabling and training facility to start in a thoroughbred race at a thoroughbred or fair racing meeting in the central or southern zone. The organization shall determine the extent of and manner in which compensation will be paid for thoroughbred horses that are vanned from the auxiliary facility to the track conducting the thoroughbred or fair racing meeting, but the vanning shall be made available on a consistent and uniform basis for all thoroughbred and fair racing meetings in a given year. Neither the organization administering the offsite stabling and vanning program nor any of the entities that form and operate the organization, except an entity actually engaged in vanning horses, is liable for any injury occurring to any individual or horse during vanning from an offsite stabling facility.\n(c) The auxiliary offsite stabling facilities and amenities provided for offsite stabling and training purposes shall be substantially equivalent in character to those provided by the thoroughbred racing association or fair conducting the racing meeting.\n(d) In order to ensure the long-term availability of facilities for offsite stabling and training, the organization may enter into multiyear contracts for auxiliary facilities in either the central or southern zone. The organization shall submit to the board for its approval multiyear contracts it enters into with providers of auxiliary facilities for the offsite stabling and training. Contracts not disapproved by the board within 60 days of submittal to the board shall be deemed to have been approved by the board. Once a multiyear contract has been approved by the board, it shall be considered to have been approved for its duration.\n(e) At the request of the board, the organization shall submit a report detailing all of its receipts and expenditures over the prior two fiscal years and, upon request of any party within the organization, those receipts and expenditures shall be audited by an independent third party selected by the board at the expense of the organization.\n(f) In addition to the uses of funds described in subdivisions (a) and (b), the organization may use those funds to do both of the following:\n(1) Maintain a reserve fund of up to 10 percent of the total estimated annual vanning and auxiliary offsite stabling costs. In addition to the reserve fund, if the funds generated for the auxiliary offsite stabling facilities and vanning are insufficient to fully cover the expenses incurred, the organization may, in the future, accumulate sufficient funds to fully cover those expenses.\n(2) Pay back commissions, purses, and owners\u2019 premiums to the extent the deductions made pursuant to Section 19607 exceed in any year the amount of funds necessary to achieve the objectives of the organization.\n(g) The amount initially deducted and distributed to the organization shall be 2 percent of the total amount handled by satellite wagering facilities authorized under this article in the central or southern zone on thoroughbred racing, but that allocation may be adjusted by the board, in its discretion. However, the adjusted amount may not exceed 2 percent of the total amount handled by satellite wagering facilities.\n(h) The board shall reserve the right to adjudicate any disputes that arise regarding costs or other matters relating to the furnishing of offsite stabling or vanning. Notwithstanding any other law, the board shall maintain all powers necessary and proper to ensure that offsite stabling and vanning, as provided for in this chapter, is conducted in a manner that protects the public and serves the best interests of horse racing."
