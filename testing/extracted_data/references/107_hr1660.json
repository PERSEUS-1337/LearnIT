FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Mathematics and science education is a vital link to \n        connect today's students with the information age and to the \n        workplace of the 21st century.\n            (2) Today's United States economy depends more than ever on \n        the talents of skilled, high-tech workers.\n            (3) To sustain America's preeminence, we must take drastic \n        steps to change the way we develop our workforce.\n            (4) It is estimated that more than half of the economic \n        growth of the United States today results directly from \n        research and development in science and technology.\n            (5) We must acknowledge that the effectiveness of the \n        United States in maintaining this economic growth will be \n        largely determined by the intellectual capital of the United \n        States.\n            (6) The education of America's students is critical to \n        developing this resource.\n            (7) American students consistently demonstrate average and \n        below average performance compared to their international peers \n        in their skills in mathematics and science.\n            (8) According to the 1999 edition of the National \n        Assessment of Educational Progress, also known as the Nation's \n        Report Card, the trends in mathematics and science are \n        characterized by declines in the 1970's, followed by increases \n        during the 1980's and early 1990's. However, performance has \n        remained unchanged since the early 1990's. Several findings of \n        the Report Card deserve mention, including the following:\n                    (A) In 1999, the average science score for 17-year-\n                olds was lower than the average score in 1969 for the \n                same age group.\n                    (B) In 1999, the average science score for 13-year-\n                olds was similar to the average score in 1970 for the \n                same age group.\n                    (C) In 1999, white students had higher average \n                mathematics scores than their black and Hispanic peers. \n                Although the gap between white and black students \n                narrowed since 1973, there is evidence that the gap may \n                be widening since 1990.\n                    (D) In 1999, males outperformed females in science \n                at ages 13 and 17.\n                    (E) A greater percentage of 13-year-olds in 1999 \n                than in 1986 reported that the content of their science \n                class was general rather than focused on earth, \n                physical, or life science.\n            (9) The National Commission on Mathematics and Science \n        Teaching for the 21st century also finds that recent reports of \n        the performance of our country's students from both the Third \n        International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the \n        National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) echo a \n        dismal message of lackluster performance, now 3 decades old. It \n        is time the Nation heeded it--before it is too late.\n            (10) In an age now driven by the relentless necessity of \n        scientific and technological advancement, the current \n        preparation that students in the United States receive in \n        mathematics and science is, in a word, unacceptable.\n            (11) Proficiency in mathematics, science, and information \n        technology is necessary to prepare American students for \n        participation in the 21st century and to guarantee that the \n        United States economy remains vibrant and competitive.\n            (12) Now is the time to set the stage for advancement in \n        mathematics and science proficiency.\n            (13) The United States must expect more from our educators \n        and students.\n            (14) In order to achieve this, it is important that we show \n        interest in economically disadvantaged students who have not \n        been provided with opportunities that will improve their \n        knowledge of mathematics, science, and information technology.\n            (15) Many economically disadvantaged students in urban and \n        rural America share a common need to receive a quality \n        education, but often their schools lack the needed resources to \n        prepare them for the 21st century global community.\n            (16) The schools and businesses serving these communities \n        are strategically positioned to form a unique partnership with \n        urban and rural students that will increase their mathematics, \n        science, and information technology proficiency for the benefit \n        of the Nation.\n            (17) If our Nation continues failing to prepare citizens \n        from all population groups for participation in the new, \n        technology-driven economy, our Nation will risk losing its \n        economic and intellectual preeminence.\n            (18) America's students must improve their performance in \n        mathematics and science if they are to succeed in today's world \n        and if the United States is to stay competitive in an \n        integrated global economy.\n            (19) It is clear that the most direct route to improving \n        mathematics and science achievement for all students is better \n        mathematics and science teaching.\n\nSEC. 3.
