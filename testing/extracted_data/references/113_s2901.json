FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) there is enormous potential for increasing the quantity \n        of electricity produced in the United States from distributed \n        solar photovoltaic systems;\n            (2) as the market for solar technology continues to grow, \n        the industry will achieve economies of scale that make the cost \n        of solar-generated electricity broadly competitive with the \n        cost of electricity from fossil fuels;\n            (3) producing electricity from distributed solar \n        photovoltaic systems helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \n        and does not result in emissions of harmful air pollutants such \n        as mercury, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides;\n            (4) increasing the quantity of electricity generated from \n        domestic renewable energy sources enhances national energy \n        security;\n            (5) investments in solar energy and other renewable energy \n        sources lead to the creation of green jobs that provide \n        substantial economic benefits;\n            (6) the United States solar industry employed more than \n        140,000 people spread across all 50 States in 2013, which is a \n        53 percent increase over 2010, according to the Solar \n        Foundation; and\n            (7) the solar industry is investing almost $15,000,000,000 \n        in the United States economy annually, according to GTM \n        Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Photovoltaic system.--The term ``photovoltaic system'' \n        includes--\n                    (A) solar panels;\n                    (B) roof support structures;\n                    (C) inverters;\n                    (D) an energy storage system, if the energy storage \n                system is integrated with the photovoltaic system; and\n                    (E) any other hardware necessary for the \n                installation of a photovoltaic system.\n            (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Energy.\n\nSEC. 4. REBATES FOR PURCHASE AND INSTALLATION OF PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish a program under \nwhich the Secretary shall provide rebates to eligible individuals or \nentities for the purchase and installation of photovoltaic systems for \nresidential and commercial properties in order to install, over the 10-\nyear period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, at least an \nadditional 10,000,000 photovoltaic systems in the United States (as \ncompared to the number of photovoltaic systems installed in the United \nStates as of the date of enactment of this Act) with a cumulative \ncapacity of at least 60,000 megawatts.\n    (b) Eligibility.--\n            (1) In general.--To be eligible for a rebate under this \n        section--\n                    (A) the recipient of the rebate shall be a \n                homeowner, business, nonprofit entity, or State or \n                local government that purchased and installed a \n                photovoltaic system for a property located in the \n                United States; and\n                    (B) the recipient of the rebate shall meet such \n                other eligibility criteria as are determined to be \n                appropriate by the Secretary.\n            (2) Other entities.--After public review and comment, the \n        Secretary may identify other individuals or entities located in \n        the United States that qualify for a rebate under this section.\n    (c) Amount.--Subject to subsection (d)(2), the amount of a rebate \nprovided to an eligible individual or entity for the purchase and \ninstallation of a photovoltaic system for a property under this section \nshall be equal to the lesser of--\n            (1) 15 percent of the initial capital costs for purchasing \n        and installing the photovoltaic system, including costs for \n        hardware, permitting and other ``soft costs'', and \n        installation; or\n            (2) $10,000.\n    (d) Intermediate Report.--As soon as practicable after the end of \nthe 5-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the \nSecretary shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress, and \npublish on the website of the Department of Energy, a report that \ndescribes--\n            (1) the number of photovoltaic systems for residential and \n        commercial properties purchased and installed with rebates \n        provided under this section; and\n            (2) any steps the Secretary will take to ensure that the \n        goal of the installation of an additional 10,000,000 \n        photovoltaic systems in the United States is achieved by 2024.\n    (e) Relationship to Other Law.--The authority provided under this \nsection shall be in addition to any other authority under which credits \nor other types of financial assistance are provided for installation of \na photovoltaic system for a property.\n\nSEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary \nto carry out this Act."
