FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The High Threat Urban Areas program created under \n        Public Law 108-7--\n                    (A) was devised as an additional response to the \n                Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Domestic Preparedness Program \n                created under title XIV of the National Defense \n                Authorization Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-201), in \n                recognizing that certain large urban areas remain high \n                threat targets and are inadequately prepared to respond \n                to a weapon of mass destruction event;\n                    (B) addresses the unique equipment, training, \n                planning and exercise needs of selected large high \n                threat urban areas; and\n                    (C) has become known as the Urban Area Security \n                Initiative.\n            (2) The allocation of the funds available for fiscal year \n        2006 for the Urban Areas Security Initiative grants program of \n        the Department of Homeland Security does not reflect the \n        original intent of the program.\n            (3) The needs-based variable used in the funding formula \n        for such allocation is not a proper risk-based variable.\n            (4) The allocation of funds for such program should be \n        based solely on the risk of terrorist attack, and determined \n        based solely on consideration of threat of, vulnerabilities to, \n        and consequence of such an attack.\n\nSEC. 3.
