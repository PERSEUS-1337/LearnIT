PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) create a grant program to encourage the establishment \n        and improvement of State-administered notification systems to \n        help find missing seniors and other individuals with \n        Alzheimer's disease and other dementia-related illnesses before \n        the missing seniors and other individuals harm themselves or \n        others;\n            (2) promote best practices, based on the experiences of \n        existing Silver Alert systems, to guide the establishment of \n        new Silver Alert systems and the improvement of existing Silver \n        Alert systems; and\n            (3) increase awareness about the need for coordinated \n        efforts between families, caregivers, local communities, and \n        law enforcement authorities to help locate missing individuals \n        as quickly as possible to increase the chances of safely \n        reuniting the individuals with their families.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) According to the National Institute on Aging at the \n        National Institutes of Health, as many as 5,000,000 people in \n        the United States may suffer from Alzheimer's disease.\n            (2) The National Institute on Aging reports that, although \n        Alzheimer's disease usually impacts people age 60 and older, \n        younger people can also be affected, and the risk of developing \n        Alzheimer's disease increases with age.\n            (3) An analysis of data on Alzheimer's disease in the \n        United States shows that 1 in 8 people over the age of 65 have \n        Alzheimer's disease, and that every 71 seconds another \n        individual in the United States develops the disease.\n            (4) The aging of the members of the baby boomer generation \n        will increase the number of people suffering from Alzheimer's \n        disease and other dementia-related illnesses in the coming \n        years.\n            (5) The Alzheimer's Association estimates that more than 60 \n        percent of people suffering from Alzheimer's disease will \n        wander away from their homes or care-giving facilities during \n        their lifetimes.\n            (6) Alzheimer's disease and other dementia-related \n        illnesses leave their victims confused, disoriented, and often \n        unable return to their to homes, families, or care-giving \n        facilities.\n            (7) States such as Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North \n        Carolina, and Texas have established State-administered \n        notification systems, modeled after the highly successful Amber \n        Alert system, to help disseminate relevant information about \n        missing seniors and those with other dementia-related illnesses \n        to law enforcement and other appropriate authorities in an \n        expeditious manner. The experiences of these States have shown \n        that the timely notification and dissemination of appropriate \n        information about missing individuals greatly increases the \n        chances of that the individuals will be located.\n            (8) Other States have explored the development of such \n        systems but have faced difficulty creating and implementing \n        such systems due to budget constraints.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) Silver Alert systems--\n                    (A) should include definitive criteria for issuing \n                Silver Alerts to ensure that the impact of such Alerts \n                is not lessened by overly frequent notifications;\n                    (B) should not permit a determination of whether to \n                issue a Silver Alert to be based solely on the age of \n                the missing individual;\n                    (C) should only be used to issue Silver Alerts with \n                respect to individuals who are incapable of making \n                personal care decisions or managing their own personal \n                affairs;\n                    (D) should only be initiated by a person--\n                            (i) who has had recent contact with the \n                        missing individual with respect to whom a \n                        Silver Alert may be issued; and\n                            (ii) who is a legal guardian, a close \n                        family member, a resident of the same \n                        household, or a caregiver of the missing \n                        individual;\n                    (E) should protect the privacy, dignity, \n                independence, and autonomy of the individuals with \n                respect to whom Silver Alerts are issued;\n                    (F) should encourage the training of law \n                enforcement officers and other first responders about \n                the most appropriate methods of locating missing \n                individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other \n                dementia-related illnesses, determining whether an \n                individual suffers from a dementia-related illness, and \n                the most effective way to communicate with such an \n                individual; and\n                    (G) should encourage coordination between \n                appropriate State officials administering such systems \n                and local entities administering programs under the \n                Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert Program; and\n            (2) the Federal Government can play an important role in \n        preventing injuries and loss of life among those with \n        Alzheimer's disease and other dementia-related illnesses by \n        helping States defray the costs of establishing, implementing, \n        and improving Silver Alert systems.\n\nSEC. 4.
