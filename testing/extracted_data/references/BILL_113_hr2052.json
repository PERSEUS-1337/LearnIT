SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the ability of the United States to attract foreign \n        direct investment is directly linked to the long-term economic \n        prosperity, global competitiveness, and security of the United \n        States;\n            (2) it is a top national priority to enhance the global \n        competitiveness, prosperity, and security of the United States \n        by--\n                    (A) removing unnecessary barriers to foreign direct \n                investment and the jobs that it creates throughout the \n                United States; and\n                    (B) promoting policies to ensure the United States \n                remains the premier global destination in which to \n                invest, hire, innovate, and manufacture products;\n            (3) maintaining the United States' commitment to open \n        investment policy encourages other countries to reciprocate and \n        enables the United States to open new markets abroad for United \n        States companies and their products;\n            (4) while foreign direct investment can enhance the \n        Nation's economic strength, policies regarding foreign direct \n        investment should reflect national security interests and \n        should not disadvantage domestic investors or companies; and\n            (5) United States efforts to attract foreign direct \n        investment should be consistent with efforts to maintain and \n        improve the domestic standard of living.\n\nSEC. 4.
