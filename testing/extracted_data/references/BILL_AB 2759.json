The claimant\u2019s judgment shall create a rebuttable presumption of the fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit by the corporation, which presumption shall affect the burden of producing evidence.\n(2) If the civil judgment, arbitration award, or criminal restitution order in the underlying action on which the final judgment in favor of the petitioner was by default, stipulation, consent, or pursuant to Section 594 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or if the action against the corporation or its agent was defended by a trustee in bankruptcy, the petitioner shall have the burden of proving that the cause of action against the corporation or its agent was for fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit.\n(c) If the final judgment is a criminal restitution order against an agent, the petitioner shall have the burden of proving that the defendant named in the criminal restitution order qualifies as an agent as defined in this chapter.

The motion may be supported by affidavit of any person or persons having knowledge of the facts, and may be made on the basis that the petition, and the judgment referred to therein, does not form the basis for a meritorious recovery claim within the purview of Section 2282; provided, however, the Secretary of State shall give written notice at least 10 calendar days before hearing on the motion to the claimant.\nSEC. 6.\nSection 2289 of the Corporations Code is amended to read:\n2289.\n(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter and regardless of the number of persons aggrieved in an instance of corporate fraud, or misrepresentation or deceit resulting in a judgment meeting the requirements of Section 2282, or the number of judgments against a corporation or its agent, the liability of the fund shall not exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for any one claimant per single judgment finding fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit, made with the intent to defraud.\n(b) When multiple corporations or their agents are involved in the same event or series of events that are the basis of the claimant\u2019s final judgment and the conduct of two or more of the corporations or their agents results in a judgment meeting the requirements of Section 2282, the claimant may seek recovery from the fund based on the judgment against any one of the corporations or their agents, subject to the limitations of subdivision (a).\n(c) When multiple claimants are involved in a corporate fraud, or in misrepresentation or deceit by a corporation or its agents, resulting in a judgment meeting the requirements of Section 2282, each claimant may seek recovery from the fund individually, subject to the limitations of subdivision (a).\n(d) Claimants who are spouses, registered domestic partners, or persons other than natural persons, that have obtained an eligible final judgment shall be considered one claimant.\nSEC. 7.\nSection 2290 of the Corporations Code is amended to read:\n2290.\nIf, at any time, the money deposited in the fund is insufficient to satisfy any duly authorized award or offer of settlement, the Secretary of State shall, when sufficient money has been deposited in the fund, satisfy the unpaid awards or offer of settlement, in the order that the awards or offers of settlement were originally filed.\nSEC. 8.\nSection 2293.1 of the Corporations Code is amended to read:\n2293.1.\nIf the Secretary of State pays from the fund any amount in settlement of a claim or toward satisfaction of a final judgment against a corporation or its agent, the corporation or its agent shall be required to pay to the fund the amount paid plus interest at the prevailing legal rate applicable to a judgment rendered in any court of this state, within 30 calendar days of the date that the Secretary of State provided notice of the payment of the award or compromise. If the corporation or its agent fails to make the required payment to the fund within the required time, the corporation shall be suspended until the payment is made. A discharge in bankruptcy shall not relieve a corporation or its agent from the penalties and disabilities provided in this chapter.\nSEC. 9.\nSection 2294 of the Corporations Code is amended to read:\n2294.\nThe Secretary of State shall not make any award to a claimant from the fund if the claimant has received payment from any other restitution funds or for the portions of the judgment that the claimant has collected from the corporation or its agent or any other defendant in the underlying judgment.\nSEC. 10.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution."
