    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Brownfield Cleanup and Redevelopment \nRevolving Loan Fund Pilot Project Act of 1997''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds:\n            (1) Nationwide, older abandoned or under-used commercial \n        and industrial sites known as brownfields are often overlooked \n        for redevelopment because of real or perceived contamination \n        from past commercial or industrial activities.\n            (2) Reuse of these sites often requires site assessment and \n        cleanup, adding costs and uncertainties to the redevelopment \n        process, and prompting many developers to pursue cheaper, less \n        complicated development options on undeveloped sites.\n            (3) Brownfields are at a competitive disadvantage relative \n        to greenfield sites, as capital for their cleanup and \n        redevelopment may not be available. Often located in distressed \n        areas, brownfields, owned by public, private, or nonprofit \n        entities, are frequently unable to secure financing for site \n        remediation.\n            (4) States have created remedial action programs to allow a \n        person to respond voluntarily to a release or suspected release \n        of hazardous substances at low and medium priority facilities. \n        Such programs have flourished due to the States' ability to \n        streamline duplicative State and Federal regulatory \n        requirements and affect a timely, cost-effective, and \n        environmentally protective cleanup of sites.\n            (5) Because of their experience in administering targeted \n        loan assistance programs, States are in a good position to use \n        Federal funds to capitalize revolving loan funds to support \n        local cleanup and redevelopment projects.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a pilot \nproject to revitalize distressed communities by providing loans for \ncleanup of eligible brownfield facilities and properties that are \nremediated through State voluntary cleanup programs and that have the \npotential to attract private investment, foster clean manufacturing, \nand create jobs for local residents.\n\nSEC. 3. PILOT PROJECT PROVIDING REVOLVING LOAN FUND FOR CLEANUPS UNDER \n              STATE VOLUNTARY CLEANUP PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Loan Program.--The Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (hereinafter in this Act referred to as \nthe ``Administrator'') shall establish a pilot project to provide a \ncapitalization loan to one or more States that submit applications to \nthe Administrator to establish or expand a State revolving loan fund \nfor purposes of providing loans for voluntary environmental cleanups of \neligible facilities.\n    (b) Application for Loan.--An application for a capitalization loan \nunder this section shall be in such form as the Administrator considers \nappropriate. At a minimum, the application shall include each of the \nfollowing:\n            (1) Evidence that the State is carrying out a voluntary \n        cleanup program for eligible facilities. The Administrator \n        shall ensure that the State voluntary program provides, at a \n        minimum, adequate opportunities for meaningful public \n        participation, sufficient technical assistance, and adequate \n        oversight and enforcement authority to ensure that cleanups \n        protect human health and the environment, adequate resources \n        are available to carry out cleanup, and certification from the \n        State to the owner or prospective purchaser that the cleanup is \n        complete.\n            (2) Evidence that the State will provide a matching share \n        of at least 20 percent of the costs of such cleanup from either \n        new or existing sources of State funding.\n            (3) A description of the State's proposed revolving loan \n        program and of the State's capability to manage the program. \n        States may use interest income or loan repayments (in an amount \n        equal to not more than 10 percent of their revolving loan \nfund amount) for program administrative purposes. At a minimum, the \nState's revolving loan program shall--\n                    (A) provide loans to both public and private \n                parties conducting voluntary cleanups under the State's \n                voluntary cleanup program who are unable to secure \nloans from private lending institutions or other means of financing;\n                    (B) require that borrowers demonstrate credit \n                worthiness and the ability to carry out the cleanup; \n                and\n                    (C) give priority to loans for the purpose of \n                cleaning up--\n                            (i) facilities that are planned to be \n                        reused for industrial purposes that employ \n                        environmentally sound practices; and\n                            (ii) facilities that will generate jobs for \n                        contractors whose principal place of business \n                        is the political subdivision in which the \n                        facility is located or for laborers who reside \n                        in such political subdivisions.\n            (4) A statement that the State will begin repayment of the \n        loan within 5 years after receipt of the loan, and evidence of \n        the State's ability to repay the loan.\n            (5) A statement that a loan from the revolving loan fund \n        will not be used to pay for any of the following:\n                    (A) New construction at previously undeveloped \n                sites.\n                    (B) Environmental fines or penalties.\n                    (C) Speculative assessments or speculative \n                rehabilitation at facilities with little or no \n                potential for economic development.\n            (6) Such other elements as the Administrator considers \n        appropriate.\n    (c) Amount of Loan.--The Administrator shall determine the \ndistribution of funds among the eligible States. The amount of a \ncapitalization loan made by the Administrator under this Act to a State \nmay not exceed 15 percent of the amount available each year to all the \neligible States.\n    (d) Authorization.--There are authorized to be appropriated to the \nAdministrator for purposes of making capitalization loans to States \nunder the pilot project established by this section the sum of \n$5,000,000 for fiscal year 1998 and $7,500,000 for each of the fiscal \nyears 1999 and 2000.\n\nSEC. 4.
