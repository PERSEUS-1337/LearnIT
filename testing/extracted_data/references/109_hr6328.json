MODERN-DAY SLAVERY.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``modern-day slavery'' means the status or \ncondition of a person over whom any power attaching to the right of \nownership or control is exercised by means of exploitation through \ninvoluntary servitude, forced labor, child labor, debt bondage or \nbonded labor, serfdom, peonage, trafficking in persons for forced labor \nor for sexual exploitation (including child sex tourism and child \npornography), forced marriage, or other similar means.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Modern-day slavery takes many forms, including chattel \n        slavery or slavery by descent, and the exploitation occurs in a \n        myriad of situations, including in the agricultural, commercial \n        sex, construction, manufacturing, and service industries, as \n        well as in domestic servitude.\n            (2) The perpetrators of modern-day slavery violate the \n        dignity of men, women, and children, using violence that at \n        times results in death, sexual abuse, rape, torture, dangerous \n        and degrading working conditions, poor nutrition, drug and \n        alcohol addiction, and psychological trauma.\n            (3) According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \n        ``No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the \n        slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.''.\n            (4) The United States and the international community have \n        acknowledged that modern-day slavery must be abolished in \n        accordance with the International Covenant on Civil and \n        Political Rights; the Slavery, Servitude, Forced Labour and \n        Similar Institutions and Practices Convention of 1926; the \n        Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave \n        Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery; the \n        Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child \n        on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child \n        Pornography; the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the \n        Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed \n        Conflicts; the Convention concerning the Prohibition and \n        Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of \n        Child Labour; the Abolition of Forced Labour Convention; and \n        the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in \n        Persons, especially Women and Children, Supplementing the \n        United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized \n        Crime.\n            (5) The Declaration of Independence recognizes the inherent \n        dignity and worth of all people and states that all people are \n        created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain \n        unalienable rights.\n            (6) The 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United \n        States recognizes that ``Neither slavery nor involuntary \n        servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party \n        shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United \n        States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.''.\n            (7) The United States has given particular priority to \n        combating trafficking in persons, a form of modern-day slavery, \n        through the enactment of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act \n        of 2000 (division A of Public Law 106-386) and the Trafficking \n        Victims Protection Reauthorization Acts of 2003 and 2005 \n        (Public Laws 108-193 and 109-164).\n            (8) The importation into the United States of goods mined, \n        produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured labor, \n        including forced or indentured child labor, is prohibited under \n        the Tariff Act of 1930.\n\nSEC. 4.
