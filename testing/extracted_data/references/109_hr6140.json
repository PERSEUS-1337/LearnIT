    "content": "467 on July 22, 2004, by a \n        unanimous vote of 422-0, which--\n                    (A) declares that the atrocities unfolding in the \n                Darfur region of Sudan, are genocide;\n                    (B) declares that the Government of Sudan has \n                violated the Convention on the Prevention and \n                Punishment of the Crime of Genocide;\n                    (C) urges the Administration to seriously consider \n                multilateral intervention to stop genocide in Darfur \n                should the United Nations Security Council fail to act; \n                and\n                    (D) calls on the Administration to impose targeted \n                sanctions, including visa bans and the freezing of \n                assets of the Sudanese National Congress and affiliated \n                business and individuals directly responsible for the \n                atrocities in Darfur.\n            (2) In the 109th Congress, the House of Representatives \n        passed H.R. 3127, the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of \n        2006, on April 5, 2006, by a vote of 416-3, which--\n                    (A) appeals to the international community, \n                including the United Nations, the European Union, and \n                the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), to \n                immediately mobilize sufficient political, military, \n                and financial resources to support and expand the \n                African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS);\n                    (B) blocks assets and restricts travel of any \n                individual the President determines is responsible for \n                acts of genocide, war crimes, or crimes against \n                humanity in the Darfur region of Sudan; and\n                    (C) offers United States support for the \n                International Criminal Court's efforts to prosecute \n                those responsible for acts of genocide in Darfur.\n            (3) On September 9, 2004, former Secretary of State Colin \n        Powell stated before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n        Senate that genocide was being committed in the Darfur region \n        of Sudan and that the Government of Sudan and the government-\n        supported Janjaweed militias bear responsibility for the \n        genocide.\n            (4) On September 21, 2004, President George W. Bush \n        affirmed the Secretary of State's finding in an address before \n        the United Nations General Assembly, stating that the world is \n        witnessing terrible suffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur \n        region of Sudan, crimes the Government of the United States has \n        concluded are genocide.\n            (5) Although the Government of the United States currently \n        bans United States companies from conducting business \n        operations in Sudan, millions of Americans are inadvertently \n        supporting the Government of Sudan by investing in foreign \n        companies that conduct business operations in Sudan that \n        disproportionately benefit the Sudanese regime in Khartoum.\n            (6) Illinois, New Jersey, Oregon, and Maine have passed \n        legislation mandating divestment of State funds from companies \n        that conduct business operations in Sudan. California, \n        Massachusetts, Rhode Island, North Carolina, Kansas, Wisconsin, \n        Indiana, Georgia, Maryland, New York, Iowa, and Texas have \n        considered or are considering legislation to divest State funds \n        from companies that conduct business operations in Sudan. \n        Connecticut, Ohio, and Vermont have passed non-binding \n        divestment legislation with respect to Sudan. Arizona, \n        Louisiana, Missouri, and Pennsylvania have adopted screening \n        processes for investments in companies that conduct business \n        operations in countries that are sponsors of terrorism, \n        including Sudan.\n            (7) Providence, Rhode Island and New Haven, Connecticut \n        have passed legislation mandating divestment of city funds from \n        companies that conduct business operations in Sudan.\n            (8) Amherst, Boston University, Brandeis, Brown, Columbia, \n        Dartmouth, Harvard, Middlebury, Oberlin, Princeton, the \n        Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, Samford, Simmons, Smith, \n        Stanford, Trinity, the University of California, the University \n        of Maryland, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of \n        Southern California, the University of Vermont, the University \n        of Washington, Williams, and Yale have divested their funds \n        from, or placed restrictions on investment of their funds in, \n        certain companies that conduct business operations in Sudan.\n            (9) No American should have to worry that his or her \n        investments or pension money was earned in support of genocide.\n            (10) Divestment has proven effective in similar situations, \n        as in 1986, when State pension funds and university endowments \n        were divested from companies that conducted business operations \n        in South Africa, which was critical to ending apartheid in that \n        country, and by 1994, when the first free elections in South \n        Africa took place, a substantial number of States, counties, \n        cities, universities and colleges in the United States had \n        adopted partial or total divestment policies.\n            (11) The only type of pressure shown to be effective \n        against Sudan is economic pressure against the Government of \n        Sudan, such as the imposition of sanctions and divestment. \n        Sudan has cooperated with the United States on counterterrorism \n        efforts due to United States sanctions imposed on Sudan in 1997 \n        and Sudan agreed to negotiations with the Sudan People's \n        Liberation Army of South Sudan that resulted in the \n        Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2005 due in part to a \n        successful divestment campaign against Talisman Energy, \n        Incorporated of Canada.\n            (12) Congress acknowledges that divestment should be used \n        sparingly and under extraordinary circumstances. This Act is \n        based on unique circumstances, specifically, the reprehensible \n        and abhorrent genocide occurring in Sudan.\n            (13) The business operations of companies in countries that \n        perpetrate grave abuses of human rights, especially the \n        uniquely monstrous crime of genocide, are of material financial \n        concern to United States investors even when these operations \n        represent a small fraction of a company's total business.\n            (14) State and city pension funds have routinely but \n        unsuccessfully sought to acquire and utilize data from the \n        Federal Government on companies for investment decisions.\n            (15) The deteriorating security situation in the Darfur \n        region of Sudan indicates that the people of Darfur cannot wait \n        long for security to be reestablished.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    Congress recognizes and supports--\n            (1) States and cities that have divested or are in the \n        process of divesting State and city funds from companies that \n        conduct business operations in Sudan; and\n            (2) United States colleges and universities that have \n        divested their funds from, or placed restrictions on \n        investments of their funds in, companies that conduct business \n        operations in Sudan.\n\nSEC. 4.

PROHIBITION ON UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.\n\n    (a) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \nGovernment of the United States shall not enter into or renew a \ncontract for the procurement of goods or services with any company \nidentified under section 4(a).\n    (b) Exception.--The prohibition in subsection (a) shall not apply \nwith respect to a company identified under section 4(a) whose business \noperations in Sudan are limited to activities or transactions relating \nto--\n            (1) southern Sudan, southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains State, \n        Blue Nile State, or Abyei;\n            (2) the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement of May \n        5, 2006;\n            (3) the provision of military equipment to be used by \n        nongovernmental organizations in the Darfur region of Sudan, \n        the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS), or the United \n        Nations; or\n            (4) the provision of humanitarian assistance that is of \n        immediate and substantial benefit to--\n                    (A) the majority of people of the Darfur region of \n                Sudan; or\n                    (B) the majority of people of eastern Sudan, \n                including the Red Sea, Kassala, and Gedaref States.\n    (c) Waiver.--The President may waive the prohibition in subsection \n(a) on a case-by-case basis if the President determines and certifies \nin writing to Congress that it is important to the national security \ninterests of the United States to do so.\n\nSEC. 6.
