STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to protect the economic interests of the \nUnited States and its citizens from the irresponsible conduct of \ncertain foreign states, and agencies and instrumentalities of such \nstates, that willfully refuse to satisfy United States court judgments.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Foreign states and instrumentalities that do business \n        or raise capital in the United States, and then refuse to \n        satisfy judgments of United States courts entered against them \n        in connection with disputes resulting from these activities, \n        inflict billions of dollars of damage on United States \n        taxpayers, and undermine the credibility of the United States \n        courts.\n            (2) The Republic of Argentina is a recent and egregious \n        example of such behavior. Argentina has borrowed tens of \n        billions of dollars in the United States capital markets \n        through the issuance of bonds, notes, and other securities \n        pursuant to which it agreed to be subject to the jurisdiction \n        of the United States courts in actions relating to those bonds \n        notes and securities, and both waived and pledged not to assert \n        immunity in such actions. Argentina defaulted on its debt to \n        foreign creditors in 2001, and scores of judgments, totaling \n        more than $2,000,000,000, have been entered against it by the \n        United States courts based on its default. Rather than satisfy \n        these obligations, Argentina has expressed its intention never \n        to pay any of the resulting judgments.\n            (3) Since its default in 2001, Argentina's economy has \n        recovered dramatically. This recovery has enabled Argentina to \n        accumulate foreign exchange reserves worth tens of billions of \n        dollars, and to use those reserves to pay some creditors \n        preferentially over United States citizens and holders of \n        United States court judgments.\n            (4) Other foreign states have expressed interest in \n        following Argentina's lead. For example, the Republic of \n        Ecuador has recently threatened to default on and repudiate \n        part of its sovereign debt, citing Argentina's default \n        approvingly as a precedent.\n            (5) Foreign states that engage in such behavior can infect \n        the management of businesses within their borders with their \n        profligate and irresponsible habits. When the lax ethical \n        standards that permit government officials to flout lawful \n        judgments corrupt the corporate behavior as well, the injury to \n        United States taxpayers is intensified.\n            (6) United States taxpayers who are injured by such \n        irresponsible conduct often have little or no recourse. The \n        existing laws of the United States are highly protective of \n        foreign states, and public and private corporations of judgment \n        evading foreign states often enjoy a safe haven within their \n        home country's borders from those who are injured by their \n        behavior.\n            (7) Action by the United States Government to combat this \n        growing problem must include measures that both protect United \n        States taxpayers against the irresponsible conduct of judgment \n        evading foreign states and their domestic corporations, and \n        motivate such states and corporations to raise their standards \n        of behavior.\n            (8) An effective means of achieving this important \n        objective without impinging on the President's freedom to act \n        in the foreign policy arena is to deprive judgment evading \n        foreign states and their domestic corporations of the privilege \n        of raising capital in the United States until those states \n        demonstrate that such measures are no longer necessary by \n        satisfying all outstanding judgments of the United States \n        courts.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) Judgment evading foreign state.--The term ``judgment \n        evading foreign state'' means any foreign state that--\n                    (A) has one or more judgments entered against the \n                foreign state by any United States district court or \n                the court of any State, the combined amount of which \n                exceeds $1,000,000; and\n                    (B) fails to satisfy in full any such judgment for \n                a period of more than 6 months after the judgment \n                becomes a final judgment.\n            (2) Domestic corporation of a judgment evading foreign \n        state.--The term ``domestic corporation of a judgment evading \n        foreign state'' means any corporation or entity, other than a \n        natural person--\n                    (A) that is organized under the laws of a judgment \n                evading foreign state; or\n                    (B) a majority of the shares or other ownership \n                interest of which is held, either directly or \n                indirectly, by a judgment evading foreign state, or by \n                one or more corporations or entities that is organized \n                under the laws of a judgment evading foreign state.\n            (3) Final judgment.--The term ``final judgment'' means any \n        judgment of a United States district court or the court of any \n        State, that is no longer eligible to be appealed to any court \n        in the United States.\n            (4) Foreign state.--The term ``foreign state'' has the \n        meaning given that term in 1603(a) of title 28, United States \n        Code.\n            (5) International organization.--The term ``international \n        organization'' means an entity designated by the President as \n        being entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and \n        immunities provided by the International Organizations \n        Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288 et seq.).\n            (6) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n        States, the District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, \n        territory, or possession of the United States.\n\nSEC. 5.

BAR ON ACCESS TO UNITED STATES CAPITAL MARKETS.\n\n    The Securities and Exchange Commission shall take all effective \nmeasures to deny every judgment evading foreign state access to United \nStates capital markets, including the ability, directly or indirectly, \nto borrow or sell securities in the United States unless the proceeds \nof such borrowing or sale are to be used, in the first instance, to \nsatisfy in full all final judgments that form the basis for that \nforeign state's designation as a judgment evading foreign state. If any \njudgment evading foreign state remains in default on any such final \njudgment for more than 2 years, the Securities and Exchange Commission \nshall take all measures to deny any domestic corporation of a judgment \nevading foreign state access to the United States capital markets.\n\nSEC. 7.
