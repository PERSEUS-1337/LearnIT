SHORT TITLE, FINDINGS, AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Oak Park Medical \nCenter Property Acquisition''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Department of Commerce owns and operates about 205 \n        acres of property located in Boulder, Colorado (Boulder Campus \n        of the Department). At this site are facilities and \n        laboratories where employees of the National Institute of \n        Standards and Technology (``NIST''), the National Oceanic and \n        Atmospheric Administration (``NOAA''), and the National \n        Telecommunications and Information Administration (``NTIA''), \n        conduct research.\n            (2) In reviewing its security procedures and facilities at \n        the site, the Department determined that--\n                    (A) the main site entrance should be moved to a \n                more central location (Rayleigh Road and Broadway \n                intersection); and\n                    (B) a perimeter security fence should be \n                constructed to enhance security.\n            (3) As a result of moving this site entrance and the \n        proposed perimeter fence, the Department will have to close the \n        current access road to the Boulder Campus.\n            (4) A parcel of land comprising about one acre, and \n        contiguous to the Boulder Campus on its northern boundary line, \n        is owned by Mr. Bruce Tenenbaum. Such parcel includes a 6,000 \n        square foot medical facility, commonly known as ``Oak Park \n        Medical Center'' (referred to in this Act as the ``Center''), \n        at which a number of out-patient medical services are provided \n        and available to the public. Ingress and egress for the Center \n        is only available from the main entrance that is currently used \n        to access the Boulder Campus. As a result, the Department \n        through NIST entered into an easement agreement with Mr. \n        Tenenbaum to provide continued access for ingress and egress to \n        the Center.\n            (5) Upon the actual construction of the perimeter security \n        fence and the resulting relocation of the main access to the \n        Boulder Campus, NIST is obligated, pursuant to an access \n        easement with the owner of the Center, to provide alternative \n        and equivalent access in order to maintain ingress and egress \n        to the Center. Various alternatives have been explored to \n        provide such access.\n            (6) Given the costs associated with the access road \n        relocation alternatives, the security concerns regarding such \n        alternatives, and the safety of patients requiring access from \n        Broadway Avenue to the Center, NIST, the owner and the Center's \n        medical tenants have not reached agreement with respect to \n        alternative and equivalent access to the Center.\n            (7) Given the continued impasse, the most amenable course \n        of action would be for the Government to purchase the Center \n        and merge the real property comprising the Center into the \n        Boulder Campus.\n    (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize and direct \nthe Department to purchase the Center contiguous to the Boulder Campus \nand for other purposes.\n\nSEC. 2.
