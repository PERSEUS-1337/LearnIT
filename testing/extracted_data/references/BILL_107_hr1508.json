ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL COUNSELING PROGRAMS.\n\n    Section 10102 of title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct of 1965 is amended to read as follows:\n\n``SEC. 10102. ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL COUNSELING PROGRAMS.\n\n    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n            ``(1) The Surgeon General reported in January 2001 that 1 \n        in 10 children suffer from mental illnesses severe enough to \n        impair development and fewer than 1 in 5 children get treatment \n        for mental illnesses.\n            ``(2) The Surgeon General reported that the burden of \n        suffering by children with mental health needs and their \n        families has created a health crisis in this country. Growing \n        numbers of children are suffering needlessly because their \n        emotional, behavioral, and developmental needs are not being \n        met by the very institutions and systems that were created to \n        take care of them.\n            ``(3) As a result of the concern about the failure of the \n        healthcare system to reach children and adolescents with mental \n        illnesses, there is currently great interest in developing new \n        models for the delivery of mental health and counseling \n        services that can reach underserved groups efficiently.\n            ``(4) Schools are a sensible point of intervention because \n        of their central position in many children's lives and \n        development, especially when families are unable to assume a \n        leading role.\n            ``(5) School-based mental health and counseling services \n        allow for the identification of children in need of treatment \n        much earlier in their development.\n            ``(6) Establishing mental health and counseling services in \n        schools provides access to underserved youth with or at risk of \n        emotional or behavioral problems.\n            ``(7) The Surgeon General's 2000 report on youth violence \n        concludes that effective treatment can divert a significant \n        proportion of delinquent and violent youths from future \n        violence and crime.\n            ``(8) Mental health and counseling services can play an \n        important role in violence prevention on all levels, including \n        preventing problem behaviors from developing; identifying and \n        serving specific, at-risk populations; and reducing the \n        deleterious effects of violence on victims and witnesses.\n            ``(9) An evaluation of the model program for the elementary \n        school counseling demonstration program established pursuant to \n        this section prior to the date of enactment of the Elementary \n        and Secondary Counseling Improvement Act of 2001 found that the \n        number of referrals to the principal's office decreased by \n        nearly half, the use of force, weapons, and threatening of \n        others also decreased, school suspensions were reduced, and \n        students felt safer.\n            ``(10) The report produced by the Institute of Medicine, \n        `Schools and Health: Our Nation's Investment', recommended a \n        student-to-school counselor ratio of 250:1, student-to-school \n        psychologist ratio of 1000:1, and a student-to-school social \n        worker ratio of 800:1. The United States average student-to-\n        counselor ratio is 551:1. Ratios for school psychologists and \n        school social workers also exceed the recommended levels.\n    ``(b) Grants Authorized.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary may use funds provided \n        under this section to award grants to local educational \n        agencies to enable such agencies to establish or expand \n        elementary and secondary school counseling programs which meet \n        the requirements of subsection (c).\n            ``(2) Priority.--In awarding grants under this section, the \n        Secretary shall give special consideration to applications \n        describing programs which--\n                    ``(A) demonstrate the greatest need for new or \n                additional counseling services among children in the \n                schools served by the applicant, in part, by providing \n                information on current ratios of students to school \n                counselors, students to school social workers, and \n                students to school psychologists;\n                    ``(B) propose the most promising and innovative \n                approaches for initiating or expanding school \n                counseling;
