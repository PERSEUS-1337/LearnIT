FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In the construction industry, specialty subcontractors \n        now perform the majority of construction work, in certain cases \n        100 percent of the work, under the management of a prime \n        contractor, making the subcontractors' price and performance \n        the key determinant in the overall cost of construction \n        projects, including those performed for the Federal Government.\n            (2) Detrimental practices known as ``bid shopping'' and \n        ``bid peddling'' exist in the construction industry, including \n        construction projects for the Federal Government.\n            (3) ``Bid shopping'' occurs when a contractor, after award \n        of a contract, contracts with subcontractors at a price less \n        than the quoted price of the subcontractor upon which the \n        contractor's fixed bid price was based, in order to increase \n        the contractor's profit on the project without any benefit to \n        the entity for which the contract is being performed.\n            (4) ``Bid peddling'' occurs when a subcontractor that is \n        not selected for inclusion in a contractor's team seeks to \n        induce the contractor, after award of the contract, to \n        substitute the subcontractor for another subcontractor whose \n        bid price was reflected in the successful bid of the contractor \n        by offering to reduce its price for performance of the \n        specified work, suggesting that the previous offer of the \n        subcontractor was padded or incorrect.\n            (5) Bid shopping and bid peddling--\n                    (A) threaten the integrity of the competitive bid \n                system for construction that benefits the Federal \n                Government, the construction industry, and the economy \n                of the United States as a whole;\n                    (B) deprive taxpayers of the benefits of full and \n                open competition among prospective contractors and \n                subcontractors for the performance of Federal \n                construction projects;\n                    (C) expose Federal construction projects to the \n                dangers of substandard performance, substitution of \n                lower quality materials, and other detrimental cost-\n                cutting practices by an unscrupulous substituted \n                subcontractor; and\n                    (D) can be effectively deterred in Federal \n                construction by modifying the Federal Acquisition \n                Regulation to require bid listing, which is the \n                practice of requiring each offeror for a Federal \n                construction contract to list the subcontractors whose \n                performance is reflected in the bid price, procedures \n                for the substitution of listed subcontractors for good \n                cause, and other deterrents to abuse.\n\nSEC. 3. IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT-WIDE PROCUREMENT \n              REGULATIONS.\n\n    (a) Proposed Revisions.--Proposed revisions to the Government-wide \nFederal Acquisition Regulation to implement the provisions in this Act \nshall be published not later than 120 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act and provide not less than 60 days for public \ncomment.\n    (b) Final Regulations.--Final regulations shall be published not \nless than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act and shall be \neffective on the date that is 30 days after the date of publication.\n\nSEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS REGARDING SUBCONTRACTORS FOR FEDERAL CONTRACTORS \n              ON CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.\n\n    (a) Requirement to List Subcontractors.--\n            (1) In general.--(A) Each solicitation by an executive \n        agency for the procurement of construction in an amount in \n        excess of $1,000,000 shall require each bidder to submit as \npart of its bid the name, location of the place of business, and nature \nof the work of each subcontractor with whom the bidder, if awarded the \ncontract, will subcontract for work in an amount in excess of $100,000 \non the contract.\n            (2) Requirements for specific categories.--(A) Except as \n        provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), the bidder shall list \n        only one subcontractor for each category of work as defined by \n        the bidder in its bid or proposal.\n            (B) A bidder may list multiple subcontractors for a \n        category of work if each such subcontractor is listed to \n        perform a discreet portion of the work within a category.\n            (C) A bidder may list itself for any portion of work under \n        the contract, which shall be deemed a representation by the \n        bidder that it is fully qualified to perform that portion of \n        the work itself and that the bidder will perform that portion \n        itself.\n            (3) Result of failure to list subcontractors.--An executive \n        agency shall consider any bidder that fails to list \n        subcontractors in accordance with this Act and the regulations \n        promulgated pursuant to section 3 of this Act to be non \n        responsible.\n    (b) Procedures for Substitution of a Listed Subcontractor.--\n            (1) Consent and good cause required.--No contractor shall \n        substitute a subcontractor in place of the subcontractor listed \n        in the original bid or proposal, except with the consent of the \n        contracting officer for good cause.\n            (2) Examples of good cause.--Good cause under paragraph (1) \n        shall include the following:\n                    (A) Failure of the subcontractor to execute a \n                written contract after a reasonable period if such \n                written contract, based upon the terms, conditions, \n                plans, and specifications of the contract and the terms \n                of the subcontractor's bid or proposal, is presented to \n                the subcontractor by the contractor.\n                    (B) Bankruptcy of the subcontractor.\n                    (C) The death or physical disability of the \n                subcontractor, if the subcontractor is an individual.\n                    (D) Dissolution of the subcontractor, if the \n                subcontractor is a corporation or partnership.\n                    (E) Failure of a subcontractor to meet the surety \n                bond requirements specified by the bidder as a \n                condition of the subcontractor to perform on the \n                contract, if awarded to the bidder.\n                    (F) The subcontractor is ineligible to perform on \n                the subcontract because the subcontractor is suspended, \n                debarred, or otherwise ineligible to perform.\n                    (G) A series of failures by the subcontractor to \n                perform in accordance with the specification, terms, \n                and conditions of its subcontract resulting in the \n                withholding of amounts requested by the subcontractor \n                in accordance with section 3905 of title 31, United \n                States Code, and the regulations implementing such \n                section.\n                    (H) Failure of the subcontractor to comply with a \n                requirement of law applicable to the subcontractor.\n                    (I) Failure or refusal of the subcontractor to \n                perform the subcontract.\n            (3) Requests for substitution.--A request of a contractor \n        for a substitution of a listed subcontractor shall be submitted \n        in writing to the contracting officer and shall include the \n        reasons for the request. The contractor shall provide a copy of \n        its request for substitution to the listed subcontractor by any \n        means that provides written third-party verification of \n        delivery to the last known address of the subcontractor. A \n        subcontractor who has been so notified shall have five working \n        days within which to submit written objections to the \n        substitution to the contracting officer. Failure to file such \n        written objections shall constitute the consent of the listed \n        subcontractor to the substitution.\n    (c) Limitation on Assignment, Transfer, or Substitution.--\n            (1) Limitation on assignment or transfer.--No contractor \n        shall permit any subcontract to be voluntarily assigned or \n        transferred or to be performed by any entity other than the \n        subcontractor listed in the bid or proposal without the consent \n        of the contracting officer. Consent of the contracting officer \n        to a contractor for a substitution shall--\n                    (A) be promptly made in writing; and\n                    (B) be included in the contract file.\n            (2) Limitation on substitution.--No contractor that listed \n        itself for a portion of the work under the contract shall \n        subcontract any portion of the work for which it listed itself, \n        unless authorized by the contracting officer to substitute one \n        or more subcontractors to perform such work.\n    (d) Imposition of Liquidated Damages.--\n            (1) In general.--(A) A contractor shall be subject to \n        payment of liquidated damages if, without obtaining the \n        approval of the contracting officer, the contractor--\n                    (i) replaces a listed subcontractor for a contract \n                with an executive agency; or\n                    (ii) awards a subcontract to a subcontractor to \n                perform work which the contractor had identified as \n                work to be performed directly by the contractor.\n            (B) A subcontractor shall also be subject to the payment of \n        liquidated damages if the subcontractor is determined to have \n        knowingly participated in the failure of the contractor to \n        comply with the regulatory provisions relating to the \n        substitution of a listed subcontractor.\n            (2) Amount of damages to be imposed.--The amount of \n        liquidated damages imposed under this subsection shall be equal \n        to the greater of--\n                    (A) 10 percent of the amount of the bid by the \n                listed subcontractor;\n                    (B) the difference between the amount of the bid by \n                the listed subcontractor and the amount of the bid by \n                the substituted subcontractor; or\n                    (C) the difference between the amount of the bid by \n                a substituted subcontractor and the dollar value \n                specified by the contractor for the work for which the \n                contractor had listed for its own performance.\n    (e) Grounds for Suspension or Debarment.--The imposition of \nliquidated damages on a contractor or subcontractor for failure to \ncomply with the procedures for the substitution of subcontractors on 2 \ncontracts within a 3-year period shall be deemed to be adequate \nevidence of the commission of an offense indicating a lack of business \nintegrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects the \npresent responsibility of a Government contractor within the meaning of \npart 9.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (Debarment, Suspension, \nand Eligibility) (49 CFR 9.4).\n    (f) Modification of Federal Acquisition Regulation.--The \nAdministrator for Federal Procurement Policy shall ensure that the \nFederal Acquisition Regulation is modified, in accordance with section \n25 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 421), to \ncarry out the requirements of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5.
