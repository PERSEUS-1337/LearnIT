    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) interstate public offerings of debt securities by \n        corporations and other entities that are registered under \n        Federal securities laws are required to be covered by a trust \n        indenture meeting the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act \n        of 1939 (``1939 Act'');\n            (2) a trust indenture is a contractual agreement between \n        the issuer of the debt securities and a financial institution \n        as trustee for the benefit and protection of public \n        debtholders;\n            (3) a trust indenture under the 1939 Act sets forth certain \n        responsibilities and rights of the issuer and the trustee, \n        including the obligation of the issuer to make payment of \n        interest and principal on the debt securities to debtholders, \n        and it sets forth events of default which can trigger actions \n        by the trustee on behalf of the debtholders to have the default \n        cured or to otherwise obtain payment for debtholders;\n            (4) the 1939 Act does not, however, contain provisions that \n        would require a successor corporation to the issuer resulting \n        from a merger, consolidation, sale of substantially all of its \n        assets, share exchange or other transaction having \n        substantially equivalent effect, to assume payment \n        responsibility for the predecessor/issuer's debt securities;\n            (5) sample trust indenture provisions set forth in sections \n        801 and 802 of the American Bar Foundation's Model Debenture \n        Indenture Provisions (``ABF Model Indenture'', approved and \n        adopted in 1967) for registered public offerings of debt \n        securities attempt to deal with the ``successor responsibility \n        for payment'' situation, but fail to specifically cover ``share \n        exchanges'' (which are types of corporate reorganization \n        transactions developed subsequent to 1967) or ``equivalent \n        effect'' transactions;\n            (6) issuers of debt securities are not currently required \n        to include in their trust indentures any section dealing with \n        the ``successor liability for payment'' situation, inasmuch as \n        inclusion of the ABF Model Indenture provisions on that \n        subject, in whole or in part, is voluntary by the issuer;\n            (7) certain issuers of debt securities to the public in \n        registered offerings have engaged in share exchange \n        transactions (that are substantially equivalent to mergers), \n        with successor corporations, where such issuers have sought to \n        avoid successor payment responsibility on the debt securities \n        on the premise that the language of their trust indenture \n        provisions regarding successor payment responsibility does not \n        specifically cover share exchanges nor state that such sections \n        would be applicable to any other transactions having effects \n        substantially equivalent to a merger, combination, or sale of \n        substantially all the issuer's assets; and\n            (8) it is appropriate and necessary for the protection of \n        public purchasers of debt securities in publicly registered \n        offerings under the Federal securities laws that trust \n        indentures relating to such debt securities be required under \n        the 1939 Act to have successor payment responsibility \n        provisions, and that such provisions be drafted with language \n        that is both complete and flexible in order to assure that a \n        successor to an issuer of debt securities resulting from a \n        merger or equivalent transaction cannot avoid payment \n        responsibility that would disastrously injure public \n        debtholders.\n\nSEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939.\n\n    The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 is amended by adding after section \n328 (15 U.S.C. 77bbbb) the following new section:\n\n           ``merger, consolidation, conveyance, or transfer.\n\n    ``Sec. 329. (a) Conditions on Transaction.--An issuer of any \nsecurity subject to this title shall not consolidate with or merge into \nany other corporation or convey or transfer its properties and assets \nsubstantially as an entirety to any person, or engage in any equity or \nshare exchange transaction with any other person or with the security \nholders of any other person which results in a reduction of the assets \navailable to the issuer, or engage in any other transaction having a \nsubstantially equivalent effect, unless--\n            ``(1) the corporation formed by such consolidation or into \n        which the issuer is merged or the person which acquires by \n        conveyance or transfer the properties and assets of the issuer \n        substantially as an entirety, or the person which acquires the \n        shares of the issuer or whose equity holders acquire such \n        shares, in a transaction which results in a reduction of the \n        assets available to the issuer, shall be a corporation \n        organized and existing under the laws of the United States of \n        America or any State or the District of Columbia, and shall \n        expressly assume, by an indenture supplemental hereto, executed \n        and delivered to the trustee, in form satisfactory to the \n        trustee, the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and \n        premium, if any) and interest on all the securities and the \n        performance of every covenant of the indenture on the part of \n        the issuer to be performed or observed;\n            ``(2) immediately after giving effect to such transition, \n        no event of default, and no event which, after notice or lapse \n        of time, or both, would become an event of default, shall have \n        happened and be continuing; and\n            ``(3) the issuer has delivered to the trustee an officers' \n        certificate and an opinion of counsel each stating that such \n        consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, equity or share \n        exchange transaction, or transaction having a substantially \n        equivalent effect, and such supplemental indenture comply with \n        this article and that all conditions precedent herein provided \n        for relating to such transaction have been complied with.\n    ``(b) Rights and Obligations Under Indenture of Successor \nCorporation.--Upon any consolidation or merger, or any conveyance or \ntransfer of the properties and assets of the issuer substantially as an \nentirety, or equity or share exchange transaction described in \nsubsection (a), or any transaction having a substantially equivalent \neffect, in accordance with subsection (a), the person subject to \nsubsection (a)(1) shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may \nexercise every right and power of, the issuer under the indenture with \nthe same effect as if such successor corporation had been named as the \nissuer: Provided, however, That no such consolidation, merger, \nconveyance, transfer, or equity or share exchange or other transaction \nshall have the effect of releasing the issuer, or any successor \ncorporation which shall have become a successor by operation of this \nsection from its liability as obligor and maker on any of the \nsecurities.''."
