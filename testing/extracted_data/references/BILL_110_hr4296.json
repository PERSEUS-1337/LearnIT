FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Patient safety is an important issue and a priority \n        among patients, providers, insurers, businesses, and government \n        entities alike.\n            (2) Adverse drug events are defined by the Institute of \n        Medicine as ``any injury due to medication''.\n            (3) According to the Institute of Medicine, more then 1.5 \n        million preventable adverse drug events occur every year in the \n        United States.\n            (4) Studies indicate that at least 530,000 preventable \n        adverse drug events occur each year among the Medicare \n        population, and cost the Federal Government upwards of \n        $887,000,000, or $1,983 per person.\n            (5) Electronic prescription drug programs, or e-\n        prescribing, provide for the electronic transmittal of \n        prescription information from the prescribing health care \n        provider to the dispensing pharmacy and pharmacist.\n            (6) Electronic prescribing provides formulary and coverage \n        information before a prescription is written to better inform \n        the patient and prescriber of lower cost options, including \n        generics.\n            (7) E-prescribing can help to eliminate medical errors, \n        injuries, hospitalizations, and even death that can result from \n        illegible prescriptions and bad drug interactions, in addition \n        to reducing patient medication non-adherence.\n            (8) The Institute of Medicine recommends that all \n        physicians create a plan to implement and use e-prescribing \n        technology by 2010.\n\nSEC. 3.
