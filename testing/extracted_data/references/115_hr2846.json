FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Federal Government serves the people of the United \n        States and should seek to continually improve public services \n        provided by the Federal Government based on customer feedback;\n            (2) the people of the United States deserve a Federal \n        Government that provides efficient, effective, and high-quality \n        services across multiple channels;\n            (3) many agencies, offices, programs, and Federal employees \n        provide excellent service to individuals, however many parts of \n        the Federal Government still fall short on delivering the \n        customer service experience that individuals have come to \n        expect from the private sector;\n            (4) according to the 2016 American Customer Satisfaction \n        Index, the Federal Government ranks among the bottom of all \n        industries in the United States in customer satisfaction;\n            (5) providing quality services to individuals improves the \n        confidence of the people of the United States in their \n        government and helps agencies achieve greater impact and \n        fulfill their missions; and\n            (6) improving service to individuals requires agencies to \n        work across organizational boundaries, leverage technology, \n        collect and share standardized data, and develop customer-\n        centered mindsets and service strategies.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that all \nagencies should strive to provide high-quality, courteous, effective, \nand efficient services to the people of the United States and seek to \nmeasure, collect, report, and utilize metrics relating to the \nexperience of individuals interacting with agencies to continually \nimprove services to the people of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
