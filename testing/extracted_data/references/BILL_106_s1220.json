CLEANUP OF METHAMPHETAMINE LABORATORIES AND PRODUCTION \n              MATERIALS.\n\n    (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated for the Drug Enforcement Administration for each fiscal \nyear after fiscal year 1999, $20,000,000 in order to carry out the \nactivities described in subsection (b).\n    (b) Availability of Amounts.--\n            (1) In general.--Amounts appropriated pursuant to the \n        authorization of appropriations in subsection (a) shall be \n        available to the Drug Enforcement Administration for activities \n        to alleviate the growing financial burden on rural communities, \n        small cities, midsize cities, and other communities resulting \n        from the cleanup of clandestine laboratories and other drug-\n        related hazardous waste.\n            (2) Specific activities.--The activities covered by \n        paragraph (1) shall include the following:\n                    (A) The cleanup of clandestine laboratories and \n                other drug-related hazardous waste across the United \n                States, whether initiated by the Drug Enforcement \n                Administration or by State or local entities.\n                    (B) The improvement of current contract-related \n                response times for cleanup of such laboratories and \n                waste through the provision of additional contract \n                personnel, equipment, and facilities.\n    (c) Supplement Not Supplant.--The amounts authorized to be \nappropriated by subsection (a) for the Drug Enforcement Administration \nfor a fiscal year are in addition to any other amounts authorized to be \nappropriated for the Administration for the fiscal year for the \nactivities described in subsection (b).\n\nSEC. 5. INVESTIGATIVE ASSISTANCE RELATING TO METHAMPHETAMINE FOR STATE \n              AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Because of the strong connection between \n        methamphetamine trafficking and Mexican drug trafficking \n        organizations, many local law enforcement agencies are \n        confronted with methamphetamine trafficking suspects who speak \n        Spanish.\n            (2) Most local law enforcement agencies lack the foreign \n        language and specialized investigative skills necessary to \n        communicate with and monitor suspected drug traffickers, \n        thereby limiting their ability to respond effectively to \n        methamphetamine trafficking.\n            (3) Informants, witnesses, communications intercepts, and \n        other investigative tools are of limited use if an investigator \n        cannot understand the language employed.\n            (4) The timely provision of select Drug Enforcement \n        Administration Special Agents with Spanish language capability \n        and specialized clandestine laboratory training could greatly \n        assist in the efforts of State and local law enforcement \n        against methamphetamine traffickers and their operations.\n    (b) Investigative Assistance.--\n            (1) In general.--The Administrator shall establish within \n        the Drug Enforcement Administration a select cadre of Special \n        Agents with Spanish language capabilities who shall work with \n        State and local law enforcement agencies across the United \n        States on matters relating to the combating of methamphetamine-\n        related drug trafficking.\n            (2) Composition of cadre.--The cadre established under \n        paragraph (1) shall consist of 20 Special Agents with the \n        requisite Spanish language skills.\n            (3) Allocation.--The Administrator shall determine the \n        allocation of the Special Agents in the cadre referred to in \n        paragraph (1) through ongoing assessments of the national \n        methamphetamine threat.\n            (4) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized \n        to be appropriated for the Drug Enforcement Administration for \n        fiscal year 2000, $4,700,000 of which--\n                    (A) $3,000,000 shall be available for purposes of \n                establishing the cadre required by paragraph (1), \n                including the hiring and training of agents to fill the \n                cadre; and\n                    (B) $1,700,000 shall be available to cover the \n                permanent change of stations (PCS) costs associated \n                with the transfer of senior agents selected to staff \n                the cadre.\n\nSEC. 6. ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION AND \n              STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The spread of methamphetamine abuse and production \n        across the United States has forced law enforcement agencies to \n        address challenges that exceed the many years of experience of \n        the personnel within such agencies.\n            (2) Unlike cocaine or heroin, methamphetamine can be \n        produced easily from readily available everyday products using \n        recipes readily available on the Internet.\n            (3) The chemicals involved in methamphetamine production \n        can be caustic or explosive if handled improperly.\n            (4) In order to meet the demand for training and \n        certification of local law enforcement personnel to meet the \n        challenges posed by methamphetamine production and abuse, it is \n        necessary to expand the training capabilities of the Drug \n        Enforcement Administration.\n            (5) Most of the costs associated with the training of State \n        and local law enforcement personnel are cost relating to air \n        travel.\n            (6) Because the Drug Enforcement Administration already \n        provides training for State and local law enforcement \n        personnel, the establishment of regional training centers in \n        the Administration will both reduce travel costs associated \n        with the training of such personnel and enhance the training \n        provided.\n            (7) Such regional training centers will permit enhanced \n        training of State and local law enforcement personnel at \n        reduced cost over the long term.\n    (b) Regional Satellite Training Centers.--\n            (1) Requirement.--The Administrator shall establish within \n        the Drug Enforcement Administration four regional satellite \n        training centers for purposes of providing clandestine \n        laboratory training to Federal, State, and local law \n        enforcement personnel. The Administrator shall establish the \n        training centers at appropriate locations throughout the United \n        States.\n            (2) Personnel.--The Administrator shall assign to the \n        centers established under paragraph (1) 12 Special Agents, 4 \n        Drug Prevention Specialists, and 8 Support personnel, as \n        appropriate.\n            (3) Activities of drug prevention specialists.--The Drug \n        Prevention Specialists assigned to the centers under paragraph \n        (2) shall work with communities that have been previously \n        assisted by the Mobile Enforcement and Regional Enforcement \n        Teams of the Drug Enforcement Administration in order to assist \n        such communities in the development of drug prevention programs \n        and coalitions and provide a solid foundation for the long-term \n        elimination of drug trafficking, abuse, and violence in such \n        communities.\n            (4) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized \n        to be appropriated for the Drug Enforcement Administration for \n        fiscal year 2000, $30,000,000 for purposes of establishing the \n        regional centers required by paragraph (1), including the \n        assignment of personnel to such centers under paragraph (2), \n        and for training-related support for such centers.\n    (c) Specialized Clandestine Laboratory Training.--\n            (1) Specialized clandestine laboratory training.--In \n        addition to any other clandestine laboratory training programs \n        currently administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration, \n        the Administrator shall establish the following:\n                    (A) Advanced Clandestine Laboratory Investigations \n                schools for State and local law enforcement personnel.\n                    (B) Additional Basic Clandestine Laboratory \n                Certification Schools for both Drug Enforcement \n                Administration personnel and State and local law \n                enforcement personnel.\n                    (C) A program, to be known as the ``Train the \n                Trainer'' program, in accordance with paragraph (2).\n            (2) Train the trainer program.--The purpose of Train the \n        Trainer program shall be to provide State and local law \n        enforcement personnel with the skills necessary to provide \n        clandestine laboratory recertification and awareness training \n        to other law enforcement personnel within their jurisdictions.\n            (3) Authorization of appropriations.--\n                    (A) Authorization.--There is authorized to be \n                appropriated for the Drug Enforcement Administration \n                for each fiscal year after fiscal year 1999, the \n                following:\n                            (i) $750,000 for Advanced Clandestine \n                        Laboratory Investigation Schools required under \n                        paragraph (1)(A).\n                            (ii) $2,000,000 for the additional Basic \n                        Clandestine Laboratory Certification Schools \n                        required under paragraph (1)(B).\n                            (iii) $1,000,000 for the awareness \n                        materials required for the Train the Trainer \n                        program required under paragraph (1)(C).\n            (2) Supplement not supplant.--The amounts authorized to be \n        appropriated by subparagraph (A) are in addition to any other \n        amounts authorized to be appropriated for the Drug Enforcement \n        Agency for the activities referred to in paragraph (1).\n\nSEC. 7.
