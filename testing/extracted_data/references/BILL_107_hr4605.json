FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The transportation of nuclear waste to a Yucca Mountain \n        repository would require a massive transportation undertaking. \n        More nuclear waste would be shipped in the first full year of \n        repository operations than has been transported in the entire \n        five-decade history of nuclear waste shipments in the United \n        States.\n            (2) The transportation of this waste would require over \n        96,000 truck shipments over four decades. Almost every major \n        east-west interstate highway and mainline railroad in the \n        country would experience nuclear waste shipments as waste is \n        moved from reactors and other sites in 39 States.\n            (3) The Department of Energy proposes to directly impact 44 \n        States, many of the major metropolitan areas in the Nation, and \n        at least 109 cities with populations exceeding 100,000. Highway \n        shipments alone will impact at least 703 counties with a \n        combined population of 123,000,000 people. Nationally, between \n        7,000,000 and 11,000,000 people reside within one-half mile of \n        the anticipated truck or rail routes.\n            (4) This never-before-attempted nuclear waste \n        transportation effort would bring with it a constellation of \n        hazards and risks, including potentially serious economic \n        damage and property value losses in cities and communities \n        along shipping routes. Also of concern are the increased \n        security risks from shipments that represent numerous mobile \n        targets within some of the country's most populous and \n        vulnerable metropolitan areas.\n            (5) Before any nuclear waste shipments occur, the Federal \n        Government must ensure the safety and security of these \n        shipments. This Act requires the Secretary of Energy to develop \n        a comprehensive safety program that establishes new safety and \n        security measures that greatly exceed the minimal level of \n        protection offered today.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS.\n\n    Section 180 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. \n10175) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsections:\n    ``(d) Comprehensive Safety Program.--The Secretary shall develop a \ncomprehensive safety program that includes, consistent with this title, \ndriver selection, independent inspections, bad weather protocols, road \ncondition reporting, safe parking areas, advance notice, real time \ntracking and monitoring, emergency response, medical preparedness, \nequipment standards, training and exercises, mutual aid agreements, \nemergency alternative routing, program evaluation, and public \ninformation.\n    ``(e) Protecting Populated Communities.--The Secretary may not \ntransport high-level radioactive waste through an incorporated \ncommunity with a population in excess of 50,000 unless the waste \noriginates in that community.\n    ``(f) Oldest Fuel First.--The Secretary shall ensure that the \noldest spent nuclear fuel shall be transported before other spent \nnuclear fuel.\n    ``(g) Full-Scale Cask Testing.--No spent nuclear fuel or high-level \nradioactive waste may be transported by or for the Secretary under this \nAct except in packages the design of which has been certified by the \nCommission and tested at full-scale, including physical tests to \ndestruction, to demonstrate compliance with the Commission performance \nstandards. The Commission shall ensure a stakeholder role in the \ndevelopment of a cask testing program for testing under this \nsubsection, including selection of test facilities, personnel, and peer \nreview.\n    ``(h) State and Local Route Consultation.--Affected State, local, \nand tribal governments shall be consulted in the selection of routes \nfor the transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive \nwaste.\n    ``(i) Private Carrier Prohibition.--Spent nuclear fuel and high-\nlevel radioactive waste shall not be transported under this Act by a \nprivate sector carrier.\n    ``(j) Advance Notification.--The Secretary shall provide a minimum \nof 14 days advance notification to States, Indian tribes, and local \ncommunities through whose jurisdiction the Secretary plans to transport \nspent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.\n    ``(k) Security Precautions.--All transportation of spent nuclear \nfuel and high-level radioactive waste under this Act shall--\n            ``(1) if by train, be on a train dedicated solely to such \n        transportation;\n            ``(2) include at least 3 armed escorts for each nuclear \n        waste convoy, including a lead vehicle and a trailer vehicle;\n            ``(3) be scheduled to avoid regular transportation \n        patterns;\n            ``(4) be planned in order to minimize storage times; and\n            ``(5) occur at a time when the receiver at the final \n        delivery point will be present to accept shipment.''."
