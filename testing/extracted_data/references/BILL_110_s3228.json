TAX CREDIT FOR GREEN ROOFS.\n\n    (a) Findings and Purpose.--\n            (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n                    (A) Green roofs reduce storm water run off.\n                    (B) Green roofs reduce heating and cooling loads on \n                a building.\n                    (C) Green roofs filter pollutants and carbon \n                dioxide out of the air.\n                    (D) Green roofs filter pollutants and heavy metals \n                out of rainwater.\n                    (E) Construction of green roofs has the potential \n                to reduce the size of heating, ventilation, and air \n                conditioning equipment on new or retrofitted buildings \n                resulting in capital and operational savings.\n                    (F) Green roofs have the potential to reduce the \n                amount of standard insulation used.\n                    (G) After installation, green roofs can reduce \n                sewage system loads by assimilating large amounts of \n                rainwater.\n                    (H) Green roofs absorb air pollution, collect \n                airborne particulates, and store carbon.\n                    (I) Green roofs protect underlying roof material by \n                eliminating exposure to the sun's ultraviolet radiation \n                and extreme daily temperature fluctuations.\n                    (J) Green roofs reduce noise transfer from the \n                outdoors.\n                    (K) Green roofs insulate a building from extreme \n                temperatures, mainly by keeping the building interior \n                cool in the summer.\n                    (L) Green roofs provide habitat for beneficial \n                insects, such as honeybees and other pollinators, and \n                small animals such as birds.\n            (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to encourage \n        the construction of green roofs thereby--\n                    (A) reducing rooftop temperatures and heat \n                transfer; decreasing summertime indoor temperatures;\n                    (B) lessening pressure on sewer systems through the \n                absorption of rainwater;\n                    (C) filtering pollution--including heavy metals and \n                excess nutrients;\n                    (D) protecting underlying roof material;\n                    (E) reducing noise;\n                    (F) providing a habitat for birds and other small \n                animals;\n                    (G) improving the quality of life for building \n                inhabitants; and\n                    (H) reducing the urban heat island effect by \n                decreasing rooftop temperatures.\n    (b) Green Roofs Eligible for Energy Credit.--\n            (1) In general.--Subparagraph (A) of section 48(a)(3) of \n        the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking ``or'' \n        at the end of clause (iii), by striking the period at the end \n        of clause (iv) and inserting ``, or'', and by adding at the end \n        the following new clause:\n                            ``(v) a qualified green roof (as defined in \n                        section 25D(d)(4)(B)).''.\n            (2) Credit allowed against alternative minimum tax.--\n        Subparagraph (B) of section 38(c)(4) of such Code is amended by \n        striking ``and'' at the end of clause (iii), by redesignating \n        clause (iv) as clause (v), and by inserting after clause (iii) \n        the following new clause:\n                            ``(iv) so much of the credit determined \n                        under section 46 as is attributable to the \n                        credit determined under section 48, and''.\n            (3) Effective date.--The amendments made by this subsection \n        shall apply to periods after December 31, 2008, under rules \n        similar to the rules of section 48(m) of the Internal Revenue \n        Code of 1986 (as in effect before the date of the enactment of \n        the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990).\n    (c) Credit for Residential Green Roofs.--\n            (1) In general.--\n                    (A) Allowance of credit.--Section 25D(a) of the \n                Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to allowance of \n                credit) is amended by striking ``and'' at the end of \n                paragraph (2), by striking the period at the end of \n                paragraph (3) and inserting ``, and'', and by adding at \n                the end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(4) 30 percent of the qualified green roof property \n        expenditures made by the taxpayer during such year.''.\n                    (B) Limitation.--Section 25D(b)(1) of such Code \n                (relating to maximum credit) is amended by striking \n                ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (B), by striking the \n                period at the end of subparagraph (C) and inserting ``, \n                and'', and by adding at the end the following new \n                subparagraph:\n                    ``(D) $2,000 with respect to any qualified green \n                roof property expenditures.''.\n                    (C) Qualified green roof property expenditures.--\n                Section 25D(d) of such Code (relating to definitions) \n                is amended by adding at the end the following new \n                paragraph:\n            ``(4) Qualified green roof property expenditure.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The term `qualified green roof \n                property expenditure' means an expenditure for a \n                qualified green roof which is installed on a building \n                located in the United States and used as a residence by \n                the taxpayer.\n                    ``(B) Qualified green roof.--The term `qualified \n                green roof' means any green roof at least 40 percent of \n                which is vegetated.\n                    ``(C) Green roof.--The term `green roof' means any \n                roof which consists of vegetation and soil, or a \n                growing medium, planted over a waterproofing membrane \n                and its associated components, such as a protection \n                course, a root barrier, a drainage layer, or thermal \n                insulation and an aeration layer.''.\n                    (D) Maximum expenditures in case of joint \n                occupancy.--Section 25D(e)(4)(A) of such Code (relating \n                to maximum expenditures) is amended by striking ``and'' \n                at the end of clause (ii), by striking the period at \n                the end of clause (iii) and inserting ``, and'', and by \n                adding at the end the following new clause:\n                            ``(iv) $1,667 in the case of any qualified \n                        green roof property expenditures.''.\n            (2) Credit allowed against alternative minimum tax.--\n                    (A) In general.--Subsection (c) of section 25D of \n                the internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as \n                follows:\n    ``(c) Limitation Based on Amount of Tax;
