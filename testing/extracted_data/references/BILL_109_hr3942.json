FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Congress has created some important legal benefits for \n        professional sports leagues, some of which have been \n        instrumental to the enormous success of those leagues. These \n        benefits include antitrust exemptions created under the \n        National Sports Broadcasting Act, labor exemptions to the \n        antitrust laws to engage in collective bargaining agreements, \n        special visas for foreign professional athletes, and several \n        tax benefits including tax write-offs after the sale of a team \n        and tax exemption status for professional sports leagues. \n        Additionally, they enjoy indirect tax benefits which create \n        incentives for cities to build stadiums.\n            (2) The leagues have no entitlement to these benefits and \n        Congress can revoke these benefits away at any time.\n            (3) The illegal use of anabolic steroids, performance \n        enhancing substances, and Schedule I controlled substances by \n        professional athletes poses a significant public health and \n        safety concern not only for the players on the field, but also \n        for the general public. As long as athletes believe the use of \n        these products is necessary to gain a competitive edge and \n        secure recognition in the professional leagues, there will be \n        incentives for amateur athletes to use these products to \n        attempt to reach higher levels of competition.\n            (4) Studies suggest a connection between the use of \n        performance enhancing substances by professional athletes and \n        the increased use of these substances by children and \n        teenagers. Experts estimate that over 500,000 teenagers have \n        used performance-enhancing substances, which can have serious \n        health consequences, especially for teenagers and children.\n            (5) The detrimental health effects of these substances are \n        well-documented including stunted growth, scarring acne, hair \n        loss, hormonal and metabolic imbalances, liver damage, a higher \n        risk of heart attack and stroke, dramatic mood swings, and \n        violent tendencies.\n            (6) The tolerance of the use of performance enhancing \n        substances by professional athletes by the professional sports \n        leagues send the wrong message to youth that these drugs must \n        be used to advance in athletic competition.\n            (7) To continue to enjoy the benefits afforded the leagues \n        by Congress, the leagues must operate as responsible citizens \n        of the United States by adopting strong policies to eliminate \n        the use of these substances and reassure the public that there \n        will be no place in professional sports for the illegal use of \n        performance-enhancing substances or other controlled \n        substances.\n            (8) As of the date of enactment of this Act, Congress is \n        not satisfied that the four major professional leagues have an \n        appropriate testing and penalty policy in place. Minimum \n        standards for testing for the illegal use of performance-\n        enhancing substances and other controlled substances, and \n        minimum penalties for the illegal use of these substances, \n        should be established.\n            (9) Because the list of performance-enhancing substances \n        continues to expand and new substances are always being \n        developed, the list of substances must be frequently monitored \n        and updated. The Department of Justice, as the agency tasked \n        with enforcing the laws on controlled substances, is the \n        appropriate agency to establish, monitor, and update standards \n        for testing for and penalties for illegal use of performance-\n        enhancing and other controlled substances.\n\nSEC. 3.
