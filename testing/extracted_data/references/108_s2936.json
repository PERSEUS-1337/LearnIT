FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Enterprise Rancheria is 1 of several Federally \n        recognized tribes of Maidu Indians in the State of California \n        that function under a government-to-government relationship \n        with the Federal Government;\n            (2) the Maidu people lived for thousands of years along the \n        watershed of the Feather River drainage area in north central \n        California, near what is now known as the Sacramento Valley \n        floor, and near the confluence of the south, middle, north, and \n        west branches of the Feather River;\n            (3) in 1916, pursuant to section 3 of the Act of August 1, \n        1914 (38 Stat. 589, chapter 222), and other Federal laws \n        relating to homeless Indians, a parcel of land comprising \n        approximately 40.64 acres was purchased for Enterprise \n        Rancheria;\n            (4) in 1915, the Secretary of the Interior developed a \n        census of approximately 51 Maidu Indians, which is now used for \n        the purpose of establishing the base membership roll for the \n        Enterprise Rancheria;\n            (5) Enterprise Rancheria has been continuously federally \n        recognized since 1915 and was again recognized by virtue of \n        voting in an election on June 12, 1935, pursuant to section 19 \n        of the Act of June 18, 1934 (commonly known as the ``Indian \n        Reorganization Act'') (48 Stat. 984, chapter 576);\n            (6) Enterprise Rancheria has a constitution recognized by \n        the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a functioning governing body, and \n        approximately 664 enrolled members;\n            (7) on August 20, 1964, Public Law 88-453 was enacted, \n        which authorized the Secretary of the Interior to sell \n        Enterprise Rancheria No. 2 parcel to the State of California \n        for the approximate sum of $12,196, for the sole purpose of \n        construction of Oroville Dam;\n            (8) the State of California requested the law described in \n        paragraph (7) because Enterprise Rancheria No. 2 parcel would \n        be within the reservoir area of the Oroville Dam, an important \n        element of the California water plan;\n            (9) as a result of Public Law 88-453, Enterprise Rancheria \n        No. 2 parcel is nearly all under water within the reservoir of \n        the Oroville Dam;\n            (10) pursuant to Public Law 88-453, $11,175 was paid as \n        consideration for the 40.46 acres of Enterprise Rancheria No. 2 \n        parcel, along with $1,020 for appraised personal property, for \n        a total purchase price of $12,196.00;\n            (11) the payment was distributed to 4 individuals, Henry B. \n        Martin, Vera Martin Kiras, Stanley Martin, and Ralph G. Martin, \n        who received a pro rata share of the proceeds;\n            (12) the remaining heirs and members of the Tribe received \n        no compensation for the sale of the land;\n            (13) subsequent to the sale of the Enterprise Rancheria No. \n        2 parcel, the Enterprise Rancheria members, having lost their \n        homes, community, and traditional homeland, were forced to \n        scatter throughout the surrounding foothill communities and the \n        Sacramento Valley area, which has caused a continuing decay of \n        their culture, language, and traditions;\n            (14) recognizing that the final resolution of any equitable \n        compensation claims based on the inequitable taking of \n        Enterprise Rancheria No. 2 parcel will take many years and \n        entail great expense to all parties, rectifying the loss of the \n        Enterprise Rancheria is imperative at this time;\n            (15) the uncertainty as to the availability of Enterprise \n        Rancheria land taken in 1964 should be settled as soon as \n        practicable to avoid further damage to the long-term economic, \n        social, cultural planning, and development of the Enterprise \n        Rancheria;\n            (16) to advance and fulfill the goals of Federal Indian \n        policy and the responsibility of the United States to protect \n        the land base and members of Enterprise Rancheria, it is \n        appropriate that the United States participate in the \n        implementation of restoring the land in accordance with this \n        Act; and\n            (17) this Act settles all claims Enterprise Rancheria may \n        have regarding any equitable compensation based on the taking \n        of the original Enterprise Rancheria No. 2 parcel in 1964.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to rectify an inequitable taking of land owned by \n        Enterprise Rancheria, specifically that parcel known as \n        Enterprise Rancheria No. 2 parcel, which comprised \n        approximately 40.64 acres, in a manner that is consistent with \n        the trust responsibility of the United States toward Federally \n        recognized Indian tribes;\n            (2) to restore land to the Enterprise Rancheria and improve \n        the socioeconomic, cultural, and traditional aspects of the \n        Maidu people of the Enterprise Rancheria, through land that can \n        be used for economic development to improve the social, \n        cultural, governmental, educational, health, and general \n        welfare of Enterprise Rancheria and members of the Enterprise \n        Rancheria; and\n            (3) to require that land not to exceed 41 acres acquired by \n        Enterprise Rancheria within the 40-mile radius of Enterprise \nRancheria No. 2 parcel and within the Estom Yumeka Maidu aboriginal \nboundaries, if approved for trust status pursuant to part 151 of title \n25, Code of Federal Regulations (or a successor regulation), be treated \nfor all legal purposes as the restoration of land for an Indian tribe \nthat is restored to Federal recognition.\n\nSEC. 3.
