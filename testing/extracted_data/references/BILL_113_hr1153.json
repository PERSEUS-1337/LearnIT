FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) investment in water infrastructure is critical to \n        protecting property and personal safety through flood, \n        hurricane, and storm damage reduction activities;\n            (2) investment in infrastructure on the inland waterways of \n        the United States is critical to the economy of the United \n        States through the maintenance of safe, reliable, and efficient \n        navigation for recreation and the movement of billions of \n        dollars in goods each year;\n            (3) fiscal challenges facing Federal, State, local, and \n        tribal governments require new and innovative financing \n        structures to continue robust investment in public water \n        infrastructure;\n            (4) under existing fiscal restraints and project delivery \n        processes, large-scale water infrastructure projects like the \n        lock and dam modernization on the upper Mississippi River and \n        Illinois River will take decades to complete, with benefits for \n        the lock modernization not expected to be realized until 2047;\n            (5) the Corps of Engineers has an estimated backlog of more \n        than $60,000,000,000 in outstanding projects; and\n            (6) in developing innovative financing options for water \n        infrastructure projects, any prior public investment in \n        projects must be protected.\n\nSEC. 3. WATER INFRASTRUCTURE NOW PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Army, acting through the \nChief of Engineers, shall establish a pilot program to evaluate the \ncost-effectiveness and project delivery efficiency of allowing non-\nFederal interests to carry out authorized flood damage reduction, \nhurricane and storm damage reduction, and navigation projects.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the pilot program are--\n            (1) to identify project delivery and cost-saving \n        alternatives that reduce the backlog of authorized Corps of \n        Engineers projects;\n            (2) to evaluate the technical, financial, and \n        organizational efficiencies of a non-Federal interest carrying \n        out the design, execution, management, and construction of 1 or \n        more projects; and\n            (3) to evaluate alternatives for the decentralization of \n        the project planning, management, and operational \n        decisionmaking processes of the Corps of Engineers.\n    (c) Administration.--\n            (1) In general.--In carrying out the pilot program, the \n        Secretary shall--\n                    (A) identify a total of not more than 15 flood \n                damage reduction, hurricane and storm damage reduction, \n                and navigation projects, including levees, floodwalls, \n                flood control channels, water control structures, and \n                navigation locks and channels, authorized for \n                construction;\n                    (B) notify the Committee on Environment and Public \n                Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation \n                and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives upon \n                the identification of each project under the pilot \n                program;\n                    (C) in consultation with the non-Federal interest, \n                develop a detailed project management plan for each \n                identified project that outlines the scope, budget, \n                design, and construction resource requirements \n                necessary for the non-Federal interest to execute the \n                project, or a separable element of the project;\n                    (D) on the request of the non-Federal interest, \n                enter into a project partnership agreement with the \n                non-Federal interest for the non-Federal interest to \n                provide full project management control for \n                construction of the project, or a separable element of \n                the project, in accordance with plans approved by the \n                Secretary;\n                    (E) following execution of the project partnership \n                agreement, transfer to the non-Federal interest to \n                carry out construction of the project, or a separable \n                element of the project--\n                            (i) if applicable, the balance of the \n                        unobligated amounts appropriated for the \n                        project, except that the Secretary shall retain \n                        sufficient amounts for the Corps of Engineers \n                        to carry out any responsibilities of the Corps \n                        of Engineers relating to the project and pilot \n                        program;

and\n                    (F) regularly monitor and audit each project being \n                constructed by a non-Federal interest under this \n                section to ensure that the construction activities are \n                carried out in compliance with the plans approved by \n                the Secretary and that the construction costs are \n                reasonable.\n            (2) Restrictions.--Of the projects identified by the \n        Secretary--\n                    (A) not more than 12 projects shall--\n                            (i) have received Federal funds and \n                        experienced delays or missed scheduled \n                        deadlines in the 5 fiscal years prior to the \n                        date of enactment of this Act;
