FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Each year, nearly 750,000 American teens ages 15 \n        through 19 become pregnant.\n            (2) In 2002, the pregnancy rate for African American and \n        Latino teens ages 15 through 19 was double the rate for white \n        teens (134.2 and 131.5 compared to 65.0).\n            (3) An estimated 4,883 youth ages 13 through 24 were \n        diagnosed with HIV or AIDS in 2004, representing approximately \n        13 percent of all individuals given a diagnosis during that \n        year.\n            (4) African American youth comprised the largest single \n        group of young people affected by HIV, accounting for 55 \n        percent of all HIV infections among youth ages 13 through 24 in \n        2004.\n            (5) Although African American teens (ages 13 through 19) \n        represent only 16 percent of United States teens, they \n        accounted for 69 percent of new AIDS cases reported among teens \n        in 2005.\n            (6) In 2005, Latino teens, ages 13 through 19, accounted \n        for 17 percent of AIDS cases among teens, the same as their \n        proportion of the United States teenage population that year. \n        Latinos ages 20 through 24 accounted for 22 percent of new AIDS \n        reported among young adults, but represented 18 percent of \n        United States young adults.\n            (7) Recent estimates suggest that while 15- to 24-year olds \n        represent 25 percent of the ever sexually active population, \n        they acquire nearly one-half of all new sexually transmitted \n        infections.\n            (8) In 2005, the gonorrhea rate among African American \n        teens ages 15 through 19 was 17 times higher than among white \n        teens of the same age. The rates of primary and secondary \n        syphilis were 19 times higher among black teens ages 15 through \n        19 than among their white peers.\n            (9) In 2005, nearly three-fourths of all reported cases of \n        gonorrhea occurred among African American teens, for whom the \n        gonorrhea rate was 2,106 per 100,000 population.\n\nSEC. 3.
