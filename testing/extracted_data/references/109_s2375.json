    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Conquer Childhood Cancer Act of \n2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Cancer kills more children than any other disease.\n            (2) Each year cancer kills more children between 1 and 20 \n        years of age than asthma, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and AIDS, \n        combined.\n            (3) Every year, over 12,500 young people are diagnosed with \n        cancer.\n            (4) Each year about 2,300 children and teenagers die from \n        cancer.\n            (5) One in every 330 Americans develops cancer before age \n        20.\n            (6) Some forms of childhood cancer have proven to be so \n        resistant that even in spite of the great research strides \n        made, most of those children die. Up to 75 percent of the \n        children with cancer can now be cured.\n            (7) The causes of most childhood cancers are not yet known.\n            (8) Childhood cancers are mostly those of the white blood \n        cells (leukemias), brain, bone, the lymphatic system, and \n        tumors of the muscles, kidneys, and nervous system. Each of \n        these behaves differently, but all are characterized by an \n        uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells.\n            (9) Eighty percent of the children who are diagnosed with \n        cancer have disease which has already spread to distant sites \n        in the body.\n            (10) Ninety percent of children with a form of pediatric \n        cancer are treated at one of the more than 200 Children's \n        Oncology Group member institutions throughout the United \n        States.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to authorize appropriations to--\n            (1) encourage and expand the support for biomedical \n        research programs of the existing National Cancer Institute-\n        designated multi-center national infrastructure for pediatric \n        cancer research;\n            (2) establish a population-based national childhood cancer \n        database (the Children's Cancer Research Network) to evaluate \n        incidence trends of childhood cancers and to enable the \n        investigations of genetic epidemiology in order to identify \n        causes to aid in development of prevention strategies;\n            (3) provide informational services to patients and families \n        affected by childhood cancer;\n            (4) support the development, construction and operation of \n        a comprehensive online public information system on childhood \n        cancers and services available to families; and\n            (5) establish a fellowship program in pediatric cancer \n        research to foster clinical and translational research career \n        development in pediatric oncologists in the early stages of \n        their career.\n\nSEC. 4. PEDIATRIC CANCER RESEARCH AND AWARENESS.\n\n    Subpart 1 of part C of title IV of the Public Health Service Act \n(42 U.S.C. 285 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \nfollowing:\n\n``SEC. 417E. PEDIATRIC CANCER RESEARCH AND AWARENESS.\n\n    ``(a) Pediatric Cancer Research.--\n            ``(1) Special programs of research excellence in pediatric \n        cancers.--The Director of NIH, acting through the National \n        Cancer Institute, shall establish special programs of research \n        excellence in the area of pediatric cancers. Such programs \n        shall demonstrate a balanced approach to research cause, \n        prognosis, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric \n        cancers that foster translation of basic research findings into \n        innovative interventions applied to patients.\n            ``(2) Fellowship of excellence in pediatric cancer \n        research.--The Secretary shall develop a grant mechanism for \n        the establishment, in cooperation with the National Cancer \n        Institute-supported pediatric cancer clinical trial groups, of \n        Research Fellowships in Pediatric Cancer to support adequate \n        numbers of pediatric focused clinical and translational \n        investigators thereby facilitating continuous momentum of \n        research excellence.\n    ``(b) National Childhood Cancer Registry.--The Director of NIH \nshall award a grant for the operation of a population-based national \nchildhood cancer database, the Childhood Cancer Research Network \n(CCRN), of the Children's Oncology Group, in cooperation with the \nNational Cancer Institute.\n    ``(c) Public Awareness of Pediatric Cancers and Available \nTreatments and Research.--The Secretary shall award a grants to \nrecognized childhood cancer professional and advocacy organizations for \nthe expansion and widespread implementation of activities to raise \npublic awareness of currently available information, treatment, and \nresearch with the intent to ensure access to best available therapies \nfor pediatric cancers.\n    ``(d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to carry out this section, $20,000,000 for each of fiscal \nyears 2007 through 2011.
