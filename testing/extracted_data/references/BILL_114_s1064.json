FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The number of people ever diagnosed with asthma \n        increased by 50 percent between 1998 and 2012. According to the \n        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2012 more than \n        25,500,000 Americans had been diagnosed with asthma, including \n        an estimated 6,800,000 children.\n            (2) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, in 2010 more than 3,400 Americans died from asthma. \n        The rate of mortality from asthma is higher among African \n        Americans and women.\n            (3) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report \n        that asthma accounted for approximately 480,000 \n        hospitalizations and 2,100,000 visits to hospital emergency \n        departments in 2009.\n            (4) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, the annual cost of asthma to the United States is \n        approximately $56,000,000,000, including $5,900,000,000 in \n        indirect costs from lost productivity.\n            (5) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, 10,500,000 school days and 14,200,000 work days are \n        missed annually as a result of asthma.\n            (6) Asthma episodes can be triggered by both outdoor air \n        pollution and indoor air pollution, including pollutants such \n        as cigarette smoke and combustion by-products. Asthma episodes \n        can also be triggered by indoor allergens such as animal dander \n        and outdoor allergens such as pollen and molds.\n            (7) Public health interventions and medical care in \n        accordance with existing guidelines have been proven effective \n        in the treatment and management of asthma. Better asthma \n        management could reduce the numbers of emergency department \n        visits and hospitalizations due to asthma. Studies published in \n        medical journals have shown that better asthma management \n        results in improved asthma outcomes at a lower cost.\n            (8) In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        reported that less than half of people with asthma had been \n        taught how to avoid asthma triggers. More education about \n        triggers, proper treatment, and asthma management methods is \n        needed.\n            (9) The alarming rise in the prevalence of asthma, its \n        adverse effect on school attendance and productivity, and its \n        cost for hospitalizations and emergency room visits, highlight \n        the importance of public health interventions, including \n        increasing awareness of asthma as a chronic illness, its \n        symptoms, the role of both indoor and outdoor environmental \n        factors that exacerbate the disease, and other factors that \n        affect its exacerbations and severity. The goals of the Federal \n        Government and its partners in the nonprofit and private \n        sectors should include reducing the number and severity of \n        asthma attacks, asthma's financial burden, and the health \n        disparities associated with asthma.\n            (10) The high health and financial burden caused by asthma \n        underscores the importance of adherence to the National Asthma \n        Education and Prevention Guidelines of the National Heart, \n        Lung, and Blood Institute. Increasing adherence to guidelines-\n        based care and resulting patient management practices will \n        enhance the quality of life for patients with asthma and \n        decrease asthma-related morbidity and mortality.\n\nSEC. 3.
