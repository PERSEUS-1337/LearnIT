    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Chronic Care Practice \nResearch Network Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Two-thirds of all Medicare spending involves \n        beneficiaries living with 5 or more chronic conditions.\n            (2) Eighty-four percent of people ages 65 to 70 live with \n        at least one of the following chronic conditions: hypertension, \n        heart disease or heart attack, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, or \n        high cholesterol.\n            (3) Medicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions are more \n        likely to undergo duplicative tests, receive contradictory \n        information from their healthcare providers, experience adverse \n        responses to medications, and undergo hospital visits that \n        could have been prevented.\n            (4) Both traditional fee-for-service Medicare and Medicare \n        Advantage are not currently configured to meet the unique needs \n        of beneficiaries living with multiple chronic conditions.\n            (5) Care for these patients is typically fragmented and \n        delivered by multiple providers working at multiple sites.\n            (6) Medicare has implemented a number of demonstration \n        projects focused on ways to improve care for beneficiaries with \n        multiple chronic conditions, yet there has been limited \n        translation of evidence-based results to the wider chronic care \n        community in a timely manner.\n            (7) As the population of Medicare beneficiaries living with \n        multiple chronic conditions continues to increase, the Centers \n        for Medicare & Medicaid Services should seek more effective \n        actions to test various care models, analyze the outcomes, and \n        implement evidence-based best practices as soon as possible.\n            (8) The United States Government should partner with \n        qualified and experienced health care institutions already \n        serving these beneficiaries to effectively and efficiently \n        develop, evaluate, and translate improvements in coordinated \n        care for them. Generating this information and supporting its \n        translation into clinical practice will serve beneficiaries far \n        more effectively.\n\nSEC. 3.
