FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Between 1950 and 2000, the United States population \n        increased nearly 90 percent. In that same period, public demand \n        for water increased 209 percent. Americans now use an average \n        of 100 gallons of water per person each day. This increased \n        demand has put additional stress on water supplies and \n        distribution systems, threatening both human health and the \n        environment.\n            (2) Thirty-six States are anticipating local, regional, or \n        statewide water shortages by 2013. In addition, climate change \n        related effects are expected to exacerbate already scarce water \n        resources in many areas of the country.\n            (3) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2007 \n        assessment states that water stored in glaciers and snow cover \n        is projected to decline, reducing water availability to one-\n        sixth of the world's population that relies upon meltwater from \n        major mountain ranges. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \n        Change also predicts droughts will become more severe and \n        longer lasting in a number of regions.\n            (4) Water conservation should be a national goal and the \n        Environmental Protection Agency should work with \n        nongovernmental partners to achieve that goal. The \n        Environmental Protection Agency should support the research, \n        development, and dissemination of technologies and processes \n        that will achieve greater water use efficiency.\n            (5) WaterSense is a voluntary public-private partnership \n        program established by the Environmental Protection Agency to \n        promote water efficiency by helping consumers identify water-\n        efficient products and practices. The Environmental Protection \n        Agency estimates that if all United States households installed \n        water-efficient appliances, the country would save more than \n        3,000,000,000,000 gallons of water and more than \n        $17,000,000,000 per year.\n            (6) The WaterSense program has developed a network of \n        partners, and therefore can disseminate the results of research \n        on technologies and processes that achieve greater water use \n        efficiency.\n\nSEC. 3. RESEARCH PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Assistant Administrator for Research and \nDevelopment of the Environmental Protection Agency (in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Assistant Administrator'') shall establish a \nresearch and development program consistent with the plan developed \nunder section 4 that promotes water use efficiency and conservation, \nincluding--\n            (1) technologies and processes that enable the collection, \n        storage, treatment, and reuse of rainwater, stormwater, and \n        greywater;\n            (2) water storage and distribution systems;\n            (3) behavioral, social, and economic barriers to achieving \n        greater water use efficiency; and\n            (4) use of watershed planning directed toward water \n        quality, conservation, and supply.\n    (b) Considerations.--In planning and implementing the program, the \nAssistant Administrator shall consider--\n            (1) research needs identified by water resource managers, \n        State and local governments, and other interested parties; and\n            (2) technologies and processes likely to achieve the \n        greatest increases in water use efficiency and conservation.\n    (c) Minority Serving Institutions.--In the execution of this \nprogram, the Assistant Administrator may award extramural grants to \ninstitutions of higher education and shall encourage participation by \nMinority Serving Institutions.\n\nSEC. 4. STRATEGIC RESEARCH PLAN.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Assistant Administrator shall coordinate the \ndevelopment of a strategic research plan (in this Act referred to as \nthe ``plan'') for the water use efficiency and conservation research \nand development program established in section 3 with all other \nEnvironmental Protection Agency research and development strategic \nplans.\n    (b) Plan Contents.--The plan shall--\n            (1) outline research goals and priorities for a water use \n        efficiency and conservation research agenda, including--\n                    (A) developing innovative water supply-enhancing \n                processes and technologies; and\n                    (B) improving existing processes and technologies, \n                including wastewater treatment, desalinization, and \n                groundwater recharge and recovery schemes;\n            (2) identify current Federal research efforts on water that \n        are directed toward meeting the goals of improving water use \n        efficiency, water conservation, or expanding water supply and \n        describe how such efforts are coordinated with the program \n        established in section 3 in order to leverage resources and \n        avoid duplication; and\n            (3) consider and utilize, as appropriate, recommendations \n        in reports and studies conducted by Federal agencies, the \n        National Research Council, the National Science and Technology \n        Council, or other entities in the development of the plan.\n    (c) Science Advisory Board Review.--The Assistant Administrator \nshall submit the plan to the Science Advisory Board of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency for review.\n    (d) Revision.--The plan shall be revised and amended as needed to \nreflect current scientific findings and national research priorities.\n\nSEC. 5.
