DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n    Congress finds and declares the following:\n            (1) The United States commercial airline industry is \n        currently suffering severe financial distress.\n            (2) Sustained record losses and excessive debt burdens are \n        causing air carriers to cancel new aircraft options and orders \n        which, in turn is threatening the economic viability of the \n        United States aerospace manufacturing industry.\n            (3) Many air carriers are increasingly unable to obtain \n        financing at reasonable interest rates for purchasing new \n        equipment.\n            (4) The inability of many air carriers to acquire new, \n        quieter, more fuel efficient Stage 3 aircraft may jeopardize \n        the planned phaseout of noisier stage 2 aircraft.\n            (5) The national goal of conserving scarce natural \n        resources and the airline industry goal of reducing soaring \n        fuel costs would both be enhanced by increasing the average \n        fuel-efficiency of aircraft fleets.\n            (6) States and local communities, the traveling public, \n        aerospace manufacturing companies and workers, airline \n        employees, and airline shareholders would all benefit from \n        stronger, healthy air carriers operating modern, fuel-\n        efficient, quieter aircraft.\n            (7) Prudent investment to facilitate modernization of the \n        industry's aircraft fleet can provide vitally needed economic \n        stimulus for carriers and manufacturers and will ensure that \n        both industries remain competitive into the next century.\n            (8) A revolving fund should, therefore, be established for \n        the purpose of carrying out a Federal loan guarantee program to \n        support the financing of new aircraft in a way that assures the \n        phasing out of less fuel-efficient, noisier, and older aircraft \n        at the same time.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION TO GUARANTEE FINANCING OF NEW AIRCRAFT.\n\n    The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (49 App. U.S.C. 2151 et \nseq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 9310. FINANCING OF NEW AIRCRAFT.\n\n    ``(a) Authorization of Loan Guarantee Program.--The Secretary is \nauthorized to guarantee loans for the financing of new aircraft for use \nby air carriers that meet the terms and conditions set forth in \nsubsection (d) and that agree to pay (directly if the carrier is the \nloan guarantee recipient, or indirectly if another person is loan \nguarantee recipient) subsidy fees, annual administrative fees, and \nsurcharges assessed under subsection (g). Subject to subsection (d), \nsuch guarantees may be made with respect to loans to an air carrier \nthat will use such new aircraft or loans to a person purchasing such \nnew aircraft for lease to and use by an air carrier.\n    ``(b) Establishment of Fund.--There is established in the Treasury \na fund, to be known as the `New Aircraft Guarantee Program Fund', for \nthe purpose of carrying out the loan guarantee program authorized by \nsubsection (a). The Fund shall consist of amounts paid for subsidy \nfees, annual administrative fees, and surcharges required under \nsubsection (g). Amounts in the Fund shall be available to the Secretary \nwithout further appropriations to carry out the purposes of the Fund \nand shall remain available until expended.\n    ``(c) Initial Authorization.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated for deposit in the Fund such sums as are necessary for the \nSecretary to pay the initial administrative expenses of the loan \nguarantee program under this section. Within 2 years after such an \nappropriation, the Secretary shall ensure that an amount from the Fund \nequal to the appropriated amount, together with interest thereon, is \ndeposited in the treasury as miscellaneous receipts.\n    ``(d) Terms and Conditions.--A loan guarantee under this section \nshall be subject to the following terms and conditions:\n            ``(1) The loan guarantee must lead to the delivery of new \n        aircraft to an air carrier certificated under part 121 of title \n        14, Code of Federal Regulations, and such delivery shall occur \n        no later than December 31, 1999.\n            ``(2) The loan guarantee must be made for the purpose of \n        financing the acquisition of new aircraft that comply with \n        stage 3 noise standards.\n            ``(3) The loan guarantee shall only be available for the \n        purchase of new aircraft from companies that both--\n                    ``(A) publish independently audited financial \n                disclosure information and financial results;

except that such \n        modified aircraft must remain configured for all-cargo service \n        and shall not be converted to passenger-cargo combination \n        service.\n            ``(6) Each aircraft removed from service by an air carrier \n        under paragraph (4) shall be taken off the registry of \n        certificated aircraft by the Secretary unless the air carrier \n        continues to use such aircraft solely outside the contiguous \n        United States and may not subsequently be registered in the \n        United States;
