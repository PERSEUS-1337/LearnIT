FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States lacks an effective mechanism for \n        providing and communicating a comprehensive, objective, and \n        credible scientific understanding of environmental issues in a \n        timely manner to policymakers and the public.\n            (2) An appropriate understanding of the diverse scientific \n        issues that underlie the environmental problems facing the \n        United States is essential to finding environmentally and \n        economically sound solutions to these problems.\n            (3) To be useful, this understanding requires the \n        integration of ongoing assessments of the state of scientific \n        knowledge with credible problem-focused research, the \n        communication of scientific information, and the appropriate \n        education and training of environmental scientists, engines, \n        and other professionals.\n            (4) A healthy environment is essential to an enhanced \n        quality of life, a competitive economy, and national security.\n            (5) It is imperative that our Nation wisely expend its \n        fiscal resources by eliminating duplication of certain Federal \n        environmental research, and by consolidating Federal \n        environmental science programs resulting in a more cost-\n        effective and efficient use of resources, to achieve a better \n        integration of an overall national environmental research \n        strategy.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to consolidate certain governmental \nenvironmental science functions and create an independent institute \nto--\n            (1) improve the scientific basis for decision-making on \n        environmental issues by integrating the functions of knowledge \n        assessment, research, information services, and education and \n        training; and\n            (2) provide national leadership in environmental science \n        and research.\n\nSEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n    There is hereby established as an independent agency the National \nInstitute for the Environment. The mission of the Institute shall be to \nimprove the scientific basis for decisionmaking on environment issues.\n\nSEC. 5.
