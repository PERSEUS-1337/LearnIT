FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) North Atlantic Right Whales are one of the most \n        endangered large whales in the world, with fewer than 350 \n        animals remaining in the western North Atlantic.\n            (2) Anthropogenic causes remain the largest source of \n        mortality for North Atlantic Right Whales.\n            (3) Accidental collisions of ships with right whales have \n        been identified as the leading cause of human-related mortality \n        of right whales, with at least 16 deaths attributable to ship \n        strikes along the east coast of the United States since 1970.\n            (4) Entanglement in fishing gear is the other major cause \n        of right whale mortality, estimated to account for at least 3 \n        deaths from 1970 through 2000.\n            (5) The Recovery Plan for Northern Right Whales lists other \n        potential or known anthropogenic sources of mortality such as \n        habitat degradation, contamination by pollutants, ocean noise, \n        and climate change. Although the mortality rate caused by these \n        factors is unknown, they are potentially important and could \n        affect Northern Right Whale birth rates, distribution patterns, \n        and general health.\n            (6) According to a recent study in the Proceedings of the \n        National Academy of Sciences, unless human-related mortalities \n        are reduced, the North Atlantic Right Whale is likely to become \n        extinct.\n            (7) The National Marine Fisheries Service of the Department \n        of Commerce is the agency tasked with protecting and recovering \n        right whales under both the Marine Mammal Protection Act of \n        1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) and the Endangered Species Act of \n        1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n            (8) Recent research has led to limited success in reducing \n        collisions with ships and interactions with fishing gear.\n            (9) The Mandatory Ship Reporting System, implemented in \n        1999 by the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Coast \n        Guard, and approved by the International Maritime Organization, \n        has begun to provide mariners with necessary information to \n        help prevent ship collisions in North Atlantic Right Whale \n        critical habitat in northeast and southeast coastal waters.\n            (10) The National Marine Fisheries Service along with the \n        Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team have begun to develop \n        gear and methods to reduce right whale interactions with \n        fishing gear along the Atlantic Coast.\n            (11) Recent events have revealed the lack of a coordinated \n        Federal plan for recovering North Atlantic Right Whales, in \n        spite of large funding increases by the Congress over the past \n        decade.\n            (12) Greater management and research attention must be \n        focused on reducing mortality caused by ship collisions, \n        entanglement in fishing gear, and other causes of mortality if \n        the population decline of North Atlantic Right Whales is to be \n        reversed.\n\nSEC. 3. NORTH ATLANTIC RIGHT WHALE RECOVERY PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Commerce shall institute a North \nAtlantic Right Whale Recovery Program, in coordination with the \nSecretary of Transportation and appropriate Federal agencies, States, \nthe Southeast and Northeast Northern Right Whale Recovery Plan \nImplementation Teams, and the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team, \npursuant to the authority provided under the Endangered Species Act of \n1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 \n(16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.), and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.).\n    (b) Elements.--The program established under subsection (a) shall \ninclude the following research, management, and enforcement elements:\n            (1) Activities to reduce mortality and injury due to \n        collisions with vessel traffic.\n            (2) Activities to reduce mortality and injury in fishing \n        gear (including disentanglement and gear development).\n            (3) Population monitoring, baseline surveys, assessment, \n        and database management.\n            (4) Support for regional recovery plan implementation \n        teams, take reduction teams, and such meetings or workshops as \n        are necessary to develop and provide expert advice on related \n        research and management activities.\n    (c) Secretary To Identify Agencies, Areas, and Activities.--The \nSecretary, in consultation with the teams described in subsection (a), \nshall identify the following:\n            (1) The appropriate governmental agency or other entity to \n        perform each activity covered by the program.\n            (2) The geographic area or areas in which those activities \n        should be conducted.\n            (3) A timeline for initiation and completion of such \n        activity.\n\nSEC. 4. FEDERAL-STATE COOPERATION.\n\n    The Secretary of Commerce, acting through the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, shall--\n            (1) develop cooperative agreements under section 6 of the \n        Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1535) to support \n        State agency involvement in recovery programs for North \n        Atlantic Right Whales; and\n            (2) determine annually the funding needs and levels \n        appropriate for Federal support to encourage the establishment \n        of, and to help maintain, such programs.\n\nSEC. 5.
