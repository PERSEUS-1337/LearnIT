For purposes of the \n    preceding sentence, an employee's remuneration shall be deemed to \n    include the gross amount of any remuneration that would have become \n    payable to that employee but did not become payable because that \n    employee was not ready or willing to perform suitable work \n    available to that employee on any day within such registration \n    period.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
