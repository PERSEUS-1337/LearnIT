FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Preventing genocide and mass atrocities is a national \n        priority of the United States.\n            (2) Atrocities committed by the Islamic State (IS) against \n        Yazidis and other minorities have included mass murder, \n        crucifixions, beheadings, rape, torture, enslavement, \n        trafficking, and the kidnapping of children.\n            (3) IS engages in, and publicly argues in favor of, the \n        sexual enslavement of Yazidi women and girls.\n            (4) The United Nations Convention on the Prevention and \n        Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, signed and ratified by the \n        United States, defines genocide as follows: ``any of the \n        following acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole \n        or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as \n        such:\n            ``(a) killing members of the group;\n            ``(b) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of \n        the group;\n            ``(c) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of \n        life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in \n        whole or in part;\n            ``(d) imposing measures intended to prevent births within \n        the group; and\n            ``(e) forcibly transferring children of the group to \n        another group.''.\n            (5) In December 2015, the United States Holocaust Memorial \n        Museum's Simon-Skjodt Center for the Prevention of Genocide \n        issued a report titled ``Our Generation Is Gone--the Islamic \n        State's Targeting of Iraqi Minorities in Ninewa'', which \n        concluded that ``IS committed crimes against humanity, war \n        crimes, and ethnic cleansing . . . [and] perpetrated genocide \n        against the Yezidi people''.\n            (6) On December 7, 2015, the United States Commission on \n        International Religious Freedom called on the United States \n        Government ``to designate the Christian, Yezidi, Shi'a, \n        Turkmen, and Shabak communities of Iraq and Syria as victims of \n        genocide by ISIL''.\n            (7) On February 3, 2016, the European Parliament \n        unanimously passed a resolution declaring that IS ``is \n        committing genocide against Christians and Yezidis, and other \n        religious and ethnic minorities''.\n            (8) On March 14, 2016, the United States House of \n        Representatives passed H. Con. Res. 75, expressing the sense of \n        Congress that the atrocities perpetrated by IS against \n        religious and ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria include war \n        crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, by a unanimous \n        vote of 393-0.\n            (9) On March 17, 2016, United States Secretary of State \n        John Kerry declared that IS is ``responsible for genocide \n        against groups under its control including Yazidis, Christians, \n        and Shiite Muslims''.\n            (10) On June 15, 2016, the United Nations Human Rights \n        Council issued the report ``They Came to Destroy: ISIS Crimes \n        Against the Yazidis'' which stated that IS ``has committed the \n        crime of genocide as well as multiple crimes against humanity \n        and war crimes against the Yazidis, thousands of whom are held \n        captive in the Syrian Arab Republic where they are subjected to \n        almost unimaginable horrors''.\n            (11) President Barack Obama established the Atrocities \n        Prevention Board in 2011, and stated that ``preventing \n        atrocities and genocide is a core national security interest \n        and a core moral responsibility of the United States''.\n            (12) Over 3,200 Yazidi women and children are still being \n        held by IS.\n            (13) The atrocities committed by IS should be investigated \n        through the establishment of a United Nations Ad-hoc Tribunal \n        for the purpose of documenting mass graves and prosecuting \n        cases of mass atrocities.\n            (14) It is in the interest of the United States that the \n        United States Armed Forces cooperate with friendly forces in \n        Syria and Iraq for the purpose of securing members of the \n        Yazidi and Christian communities being held captive by IS.\n\nSEC. 3.
