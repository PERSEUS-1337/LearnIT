FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Agreement to establish the United States-Israel \n        Binational Agricultural Research and Development (BARD) Fund, \n        signed on October 25, 1977, between the United States \n        Government and the Government of Israel ``to promote and \n        support agricultural research and development activities which \n        are of mutual benefits to the United States and Israel''.\n            (2) Since its founding, the BARD Fund has cultivated \n        strategic partnerships between United States and Israeli \n        scientists and has been a benchmark for the establishment of \n        cooperative agreements.\n            (3) BARD Fund-sponsored research projects have contributed \n        billions of dollars to both United States and Israeli \n        economies, as determined by independent economic surveys. As \n        the major platform for United States-Israel agricultural \n        research collaboration, the BARD Fund has funded more than \n        1,300 bi-national projects, awarded over $300 million for \n        research and development, and supported other programs such as \n        more than 250 postdoctoral fellows and 50 scientific workshops.\n            (4) BARD Fund-sponsored research projects have led to \n        innovative developments, new technologies, and renewed focus in \n        drip irrigation, pesticides, fish farming, livestock, poultry, \n        disease control, and farm equipment.\n            (5) The BARD Fund has been successful in research \n        collaboration between United States and Israel without fraud, \n        waste, or abuse for 40 years.\n            (6) The Memorandum of Understanding Between the U.S. \n        National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the U.S. Israel \n        Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund To \n        Promote Scientific Collaboration among U.S. and Israeli \n        Scientists and Engineers, signed on November 22, 2013, promotes \n        collaboration between the United States and Israel. The 2013 \n        Memorandum of Understanding was intended to provide a framework \n        whereby Israeli scientists and engineers could receive funding \n        from the BARD Fund and United States scientists and engineers \n        could receive funding from the National Institute for Food and \n        Agriculture.\n            (7) It would be in the interest of the United States to \n        expand the 2013 Memorandum of Understanding to include \n        cooperation with private entities and to statutorily authorize \n        the BARD Fund to enhance prospects for its long-term funding.\n            (8) In 2014, Congress enacted legislation declaring that \n        Israel is a major strategic partner of the United States and \n        authorized the President to promote cooperation with Israel in \n        multiple fields, including agriculture.\n            (9) Joint cooperation can help solve specific challenges, \n        including food safety, food security, food quality, and post-\n        harvest issues, as well as maximize production with limited \n        resources, environmental changes, water scarcity, and water \n        management.\n\nSEC. 3.
