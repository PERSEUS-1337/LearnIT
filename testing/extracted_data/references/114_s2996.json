PHASE OUT OF TAX PREFERENCES FOR FOSSIL FUELS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) United States tax policy has provided tax preferences, \n        such as special

preferences \n        for coal production for over 80 years.\n            (3) In order to ensure that all sources of energy compete \n        on an equal footing, as tax credits for renewable energy are \n        phased out over the next 4 years, fossil fuel tax preferences \n        should be phased out on the same schedule.\n    (b) Expensing of Intangible Drilling Costs.--Section 263 of the
