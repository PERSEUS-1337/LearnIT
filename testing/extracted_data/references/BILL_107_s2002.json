FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) There are over 2,000 domestic violence shelters in the \n        United States.\n            (2) The National Domestic Violence Hotline has received \n        more than 500,000 calls from domestic violence victims \n        nationwide since 1996, and continues to receive 11,000 to \n        13,000 calls per month.\n            (3) Access to shelters that address the specific needs of \n        domestic violence victims and their families is critical for \n        women who are trying to escape violence.\n            (4) In Minnesota, the only State with a statewide, online \n        network of domestic violence shelters, 90 percent of domestic \n        violence victims and their families are assured of receiving \n        the services they need, when and where they need them, in a \n        single call.\n            (5) An online network of shelters would allow victims and \n        their families to relocate to a broader number of areas within \n        a State or in other States so that they can be as safe as \n        possible.\n            (6) An online network would reduce the number of calls \n        women need to make to find a domestic violence shelter.\n            (7) The National Network to End Domestic Violence estimates \n        that only 43 percent of domestic violence shelters in the \n        United States have access to the Internet.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To provide a grant to develop a fully secure, \n        continuously updated network of available domestic violence \n        shelters and services across the United States. Such a network \n        shall be made available to the National Domestic Violence \n        Hotline, shelters nationwide, State and local domestic violence \n        agencies, and other domestic violence organizations, to enable \n        such entities to connect a victim of domestic violence to the \n        most safe, appropriate, and convenient shelter, while the \n        victim remains on the telephone line, or in the most efficient \n        way possible.\n            (2) To ensure that domestic violence victims get the help \n        they need in a single phone call.\n\nSEC. 4.
