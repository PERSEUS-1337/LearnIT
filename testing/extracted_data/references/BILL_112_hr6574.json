FINDINGS.\n\n            (1) Since September 11, 2001, approximately 30,000 veterans \n        have been separated from the Armed Forces on the basis of a \n        personality disorder or adjustment disorder.\n            (2) Nearly all veterans who are separated on the basis of a \n        personality or adjustment disorder are prohibited from \n        accessing service-connected disability compensation, disability \n        severance pay, and disability retirement pay.\n            (3) Many veterans who are separated on the basis of a \n        personality or adjustment disorder are unable to find \n        employment because of the ``personality disorder'' or \n        ``adjustment disorder'' label on their Certificate of Release \n        or Discharge from Active Duty.\n            (4) The Government Accountability Office has found that the \n        regulatory compliance of the Department of Defense in \n        separating members of the Armed Forces on the basis of a \n        personality or adjustment disorder was as low as 40 percent \n        between 2001 and 2007.\n            (5) The establishment of a Mental Health Discharge Board of \n        Review to review the separation of veterans who are separated \n        on the basis of a personality or adjustment disorder is \n        warranted to ensure that any veteran wrongly separated on such \n        basis will have the ability to access disability benefits and \n        employment opportunities available to veterans.\n\nSEC. 3.
