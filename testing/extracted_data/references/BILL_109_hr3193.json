In \n        implementing this paragraph, the Secretary shall not establish \n        any restrictions on the activities that would prevent the \n        occurrence of such necessary activities or that would reduce \n        the water supply provided by the Colorado-Big Thompson Project \n        or the Windy Gap Project.\n            (3) Relation to authority in act establishing park.--\n        Nothing in the first section of the Act of January 26, 1915 (16 \n        U.S.C. 191), shall be construed to allow development within the \n        lands designated as wilderness by section 2 of any reclamation \n        project not in existence as of the date of the enactment of \n        this Act.\n    (d) No Buffer Zones.--Congress does not intend that the designation \nby this Act of the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness creates or \nimplies the creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around \nthe wilderness area. The fact that nonwilderness activities or uses can \nbe seen or heard from within the wilderness area shall not, of itself, \npreclude such activities or uses up to the boundary of the wilderness \narea."
