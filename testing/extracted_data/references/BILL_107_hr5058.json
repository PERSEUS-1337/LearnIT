To accomplish its duty, the \nFASB shall act to--\n            (1) improve the usefulness to present and potential \n        investors, creditors, and other users, of financial reporting \n        made by firms in interstate commerce focusing on the primary \n        characteristics of relevance and reliability;\n            (2) keep standards current to reflect changes in methods of \n        doing business and changes in the economic environment;\n            (3) consider promptly any significant areas of deficiency \n        in financial reporting that might be improved through the \n        standard-setting process;\n            (4) promote the international convergence of accounting \n        standards concurrent with improving the quality of financial \n        reporting; and\n            (5) improve the common understanding of the nature and \n        purposes of information contained in financial reports.\n\nSEC. 5. REQUIREMENTS FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.\n\n    (a) General Principles.--In promulgating and revising standards of \nfinancial accounting and reporting, the FASB shall follow the following \nprinciples:\n            (1) Financial reporting should provide information that is \n        useful to present and potential investors and creditors and \n        other users in making rational investment, credit, and similar \n        decisions. The information should be comprehensible to those \n        who have a reasonable understanding of business and economic \n        activities and are willing to study the information with \n        reasonable diligence.\n            (2) Financial reporting should provide information to help \n        present and potential investors and creditors and other users \n        in assessing the amounts, timing, and uncertainty of \n        prospective cash receipts from dividends or interest and the \n        proceeds from the sale, redemption, or maturity of the \n        securities or loans.\n            (3) Financial reporting should provide information about \n        the economic resources of an enterprise, the claims to those \n        resources (obligations of the enterprise to transfer resources \n        to other entities and owners' equity), and the effects of \n        transactions, events, and circumstances that change resources \n        and claims to those resources.\n    (b) Operating Objectives.--The FASB shall promote the following \nobjectives in the conduct of its activities:\n            (1) To be objective in its decision making and to ensure, \n        insofar as possible, the neutrality of information resulting \n        from its standards. To be neutral, information must report \n        economic activity as faithfully as possible without coloring \n        the image it communicates for the purpose of influencing \n        behavior in any particular direction.\n            (2) To weigh carefully the views of its constituents in \n        developing concepts and standards. However, the ultimate \n        determinant of concepts and standards must be the FASB's \n        judgment, based on research, public input, and careful \n        deliberation about the usefulness of the resulting information.\n            (3) To bring about needed changes in ways that minimize \n        disruption to the continuity of reporting practice, including \n        establishment of reasonable effective dates and transition \n        provisions when new standards are introduced. Change should be \n        evolutionary to the extent that it can be accommodated by the \n        need for relevance, reliability, comparability, and \n        consistency.\n            (4) To review the effects of past decisions and interpret, \n        amend, or replace standards in a timely fashion when such \n        action is indicated.\n    (c) Primary Standard Requiring Adherence to Principles.--\n            (1) Promulgation required.--The FASB shall promulgate a \n        primary standard requiring the application of the principles \n        articulated in subsection (a) of this section to financial \n        accounting and reporting. Except as provided in paragraph (2), \n        such primary standard shall prohibit the application of any \n        other standard of financial accounting and reporting \n        promulgated by the FASB in a manner, or with a result, that \n        fails to comply with such principles.\n            (2) Deviations explained and justified.--The primary \n        standard promulgated pursuant to this subsection may allow for \n        deviation from the application of such principles only if an \n        explanation and justification for the basis of the deviation is \n        specifically articulated and made public.\n    (d) Establishment of Additional Standards.--The FASB shall develop \nadditional standards of financial accounting and reporting to address \nissues relating to--\n            (1) off-balance-sheet accounting practices and standards, \n        and accounting requirements for special-purpose entities, in a \n        manner that is based on principles for determining bona fide \n        economic control; and\n            (2) requirements for marked-to-market accounting, including \n        consideration of the application of fair value to agreements \n        involving commitments on the part of an issuer.\n    (e) Additional Projects.--\n            (1) Fair value project.--Within one year after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, FASB shall complete work on the project \n        entitled ``Measuring All Financial Assets and Liabilities at \n        Fair Value''.\n            (2) Revenue and liability recognition proposal.--Within 18 \n        months after the date of enactment of this Act, FASB shall \n        complete work on the proposal entitled ``Proposal for new \n        agenda project: Issues relating to the recognition of revenues \n        and liabilities''.\n\nSEC. 6. PRESERVATION OF AUTHORITY.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit--\n            (1) the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission \n        under the securities laws (as such term is defined in section \n        3(a)(47) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. \n        78c(a)(47)); or\n            (2) the authority of any other Federal agency under the \n        laws applicable to a Federal regulatory program administered by \n        such agency.\n\nSEC. 7.
