Any such \ncharacteristics or components shall be subject to the requirements of \nsection 15 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 2064).\n\nSEC. 5.

If the Commission does \n        not notify the manufacturer or importer of its action within \n        that 60-day period, the Commission is deemed to have approved \n        the proposed amendment. If the Commission disapproves the \n        proposed amendment, the Commission shall include an explanation \n        in writing of the reasons for the disapproval in the \n        notification to the manufacturer or importer. The approval or \n        disapproval by the Commission of a proposed amendment shall \n        constitute final agency action for purposes of judicial review \n        under chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code.\n    (d) Revocation of Approval; Release of Obligation.--\n            (1) Revocation.--If the Commission determines, after notice \n        and the opportunity for a hearing, that a manufacturer or \n        importer has failed to comply substantially with its \n        obligations under its action plan, the Commission may revoke \n        its approval of the action plan. The revocation shall \n        constitute final agency action for purposes of judicial review \n        pursuant to chapter 7 of title 5, the United States Code. Upon \n        receipt of notice of a revocation of the action plan, the \n        manufacturer or importer shall cease further distribution in \n        commerce of any all-terrain vehicle subject to the ATV \n        standard. The revocation by the Commission of its approval of a \n        manufacturer's or importer's action plan shall not preclude the \n        manufacturer or importer from submitting another action plan \n        under subsection (a)(1).\n            (2) Release.--If the Commission determines that compliance \n        by a manufacturer or importer with a specific requirement of \n        its approved action plan is not necessary to promote all-\n        terrain vehicle safety, it shall notify the manufacturer or \n        importer in writing of its determination and release the \n        manufacturer or importer from any obligation under this Act to \n        comply with that requirement.\n\nSEC. 6.
