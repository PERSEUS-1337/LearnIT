FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Constitution guarantees the right of the people to \n        be secure in their persons, and the Declaration of Independence \n        asserts as self-evident that all men have certain unalienable \n        rights among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of \n        happiness.\n            (2) The first principle of the Nuremberg code states that \n        with respect to human research, the voluntary consent of the \n        human subject is absolutely essential. The Nuremberg code \n        further asserts that such consent must be competent, informed \n        and comprehending.\n            (3) In 1974, the Department of Health, Education and \n        Welfare published regulations (45 CFR 46) governing the \n        protection of human subjects in research. These regulations \n        applied only to research sponsored by the Department. In 1991 \n        these regulations were adopted by 16 additional Federal \n        agencies to apply to any research which these agencies may \n        sponsor.\n            (4) Between 1974 and 1983, Congress enacted 2 Public Laws \n        that established ethical advisory bodies. Public Law 91-348 \n        established the National Commission for the Protection of Human \n        Subjects of Biomedical Research and Public Law 95-622 \n        established the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical \n        Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research. \n        Each of these advisory bodies made recommendations to the \n        President and Congress to expand protections for human research \n        subjects. Some of these recommendations have been incorporated \n        into the Federal regulation (45 CFR 46).\n            (5) In 1995, the President's Advisory Committee on Human \n        Radiation Experiments found that there are significant \n        deficiencies in some aspects of the current system for the \n        protection of human subjects. In particular, the Committee \n        found that some consent forms currently in use are flawed in \n        morally significant aspects.\n            (6) The President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation \n        Experiments recommended the adoption of a Federal policy \n        requiring the informed consent of all human subjects of \n        classified research and that this requirement not be subject to \n        exemption or waiver. The Committee further recommended that in \n        all cases, potential subjects should be informed of the \n        identity of the sponsoring Federal agency and that the project \n        involves classified information.\n            (7) Some agencies of the Federal government sponsor \n        research involving human subjects, but these agencies have not \n        adopted the Common Rule as provided for in part 46 of title 45, \n        Code of Federal Regulations.\n            (8) Private individuals or institutions that do not receive \n        any Federal funding or that are not seeking the approval of the \n        Food and Drug Administration for a drug or device, and that \n        sponsor research involving human subjects, do not need to abide \n        by the requirements of part 46 of title 45, Code of Federal \n        Regulations.\n            (9) Many, but not all, research institutions that receive \n        Federal sponsorship for research involving human subjects may \n        voluntarily apply the protections of the Common Rule to all \n        research conducted at the research institution.\n            (10) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) through (9), no \n        provision of United States law explicitly requires that \n        informed consent and independent review of research involving \n        human subject be obtained.\n            (11) The human research subject activities described in \n        this section are either in interstate (or foreign) commerce or \n        substantially affect such commerce or the free flow thereof, \n        and the regulation of those activities as provided for in this \n        Act is necessary to prevent and eliminate burdens upon such \n        commerce and to effectively regulate such commerce, in order to \ninsure that the rights and welfare of human research subjects are \nprotected.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to apply common rule protections to all human subject \n        research and provide for criminal sanctions for violations of \n        this Act;\n            (2) to prohibit the provision of Federal support for \n        classified research that is not reviewed by an institutional \n        review board and require disclosure to human research subjects \n        of certain information regarding classified research; and\n            (3) to address any potential regulatory conflict of \n        interest within the Department of Health and Human Services and \n        the National Institutes of Health, and establish an Office for \n        Protection of Research Subjects within the Office of the \n        Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nSEC. 3.
