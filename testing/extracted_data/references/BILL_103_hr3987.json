PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To assist in the conservation of rhinoceros and tigers \n        by supporting the conservation programs of nations whose \n        activities affect rhinoceros and tiger populations, and the \n        CITES Secretariat.\n            (2) To provide financial resources for those programs.\n\nSEC. 4.
