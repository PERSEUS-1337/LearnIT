STATEMENTS OF POLICY.\n\n    Congress--\n            (1) supports the strengthening of United States-Israel \n        economic cooperation and recognizes the tremendous strategic, \n        economic, and technological value of cooperation with Israel;\n            (2) recognizes the benefit of cooperation with Israel to \n        United States companies, including by improving American \n        competitiveness in global markets;\n            (3) recognizes the importance of trade and commercial \n        relations to the pursuit and sustainability of peace, and \n        supports efforts to bring together the United States, Israel, \n        the Palestinian territories, and others in enhanced commerce;\n            (4) opposes politically motivated actions that penalize or \n        otherwise limit commercial relations specifically with Israel \n        such as boycotts, divestment or sanctions;\n            (5) notes that the boycott, divestment, and sanctioning of \n        Israel by governments, governmental bodies, quasi-governmental \n        bodies, international organizations, and other such entities is \n        contrary to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) \n        principle of non-discrimination;\n            (6) encourages the inclusion of politically motivated \n        actions that penalize or otherwise limit commercial relations \n        specifically with Israel such as boycotts, divestment from, or \n        sanctions against Israel as a topic of discussion at the U.S.-\n        Israel Joint Economic Development Group (JEDG) and other areas \n        to support the strengthening of the United States-Israel \n        commercial relationship and combat any commercial \n        discrimination against Israel;\n            (7) supports efforts to prevent investigations or \n        prosecutions by governments or international organizations of \n        United States persons on the sole basis of such persons doing \n        business with Israel, with Israeli entities, or in Israeli-\n        controlled territories; and\n            (8) supports American States examining a company's \n        promotion or compliance with unsanctioned boycotts, divestment \n        from, or sanctions against Israel as part of its consideration \n        in awarding grants and contracts and supports the divestment of \n        State assets from companies that support or promote actions to \n        boycott, divest from, or sanction Israel.\n\nSEC. 4.
