    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment \nImplementation Act of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds and declares the following:\n            (1) The Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas are becoming \n        increasingly accessible to shipping, due to thinning ice cover, \n        technological improvements allowing greater efficiencies in the \n        operation of ice-breakers and ice-strengthened cargo and \n        passenger vessels, satellite support for navigation and real-\n        time ice-charting, and growing demand for Arctic tourism and \n        natural resources.\n            (2) It is in the interests of the United States to work \n        with the State of Alaska and our neighbors in the Arctic to \n        ensure that shipping in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas is \n        safe for mariners, protective of the natural environment, \n        including the air, land, water, and wildlife of the Arctic, and \n        mindful of the needs of longstanding subsistence users of \n        Arctic resources.\n            (3) It is further in the interests of the United States to \n        ensure that shipping in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas is \n        secure, and that United States sovereign and security \n        interests, including the rights of United States vessels to \n        innocent passage through international straits, are respected \n        and protected, that access is provided throughout the Arctic \n        Ocean for legitimate research vessels of all nations, and that \n        peaceful relations are maintained in the Arctic.\n            (4) It is further in the interests of the United States to \n        see that a system of international cooperation is established \n        to support reliable shipping, with methods for joint investment \n        in providing mariners aids to navigation, ports of refuge, \n        vessel-to-shore communication, hydrographic mapping, and search \n        and rescue capability.\n            (5) For nearly 500 years, mariners and sea-faring nations \n        have sought national and global benefits from sea routes in the \n        Arctic similar to those provided now by the Panama and Suez \n        canals, but as those benefits may finally be realized, expanded \n        shipping will present risks to residents of the Arctic, and \n        coordinated shipping regulations are needed to protect United \n        States interests even from shipping that may occur in the \n        Arctic outside United States territorial waters.\n            (6) Proven models for international cooperation in \n        management of regional waterways exist, including United States \n        joint administration of the St. Lawrence Seaway with Canada, \n        and existing cooperation between the Coast Guard and its \n        Russian Federation counterpart for fisheries enforcement in the \n        Bering Sea and North Pacific regions.\n            (7) The United States has continuing research, security, \n        environmental, and commercial interests in the Arctic that rely \n        on the availability of icebreaker platforms of the Coast Guard. \n        The Polar Class icebreakers commissioned in the 1970s are in \n        need of replacement.\n            (8) Sovereign interests of the United States in the Arctic \n        Ocean and Bering Sea regions may grow with submission of a \n        United States claim for an extended continental shelf.\n            (9) Building new icebreakers, mustering international plans \n        for aids to navigation and other facilities, and establishing \n        coordinated shipping regulations and oil spill prevention and \n        response capability through international cooperation, \n        including the approval of the International Maritime \n        Organization, requires long lead times. Beginning those efforts \n        now, with the completion of an Arctic Marine Shipping \n        Assessment by the eight-nation Arctic Council, is essential to \n        protect United States interests given the extensive current use \n        of the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas by vessels of many \n        nations.\n\nSEC. 3.
