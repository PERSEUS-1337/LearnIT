    "content": "Native Hawaiian recognition bills have been considered in the 106th-108th Congresses,and at least one of the bills has been reported in each Congress (see Table 1 below). (128) All the billsprovided for a recognition process very similar to that in S. 147 and H.R. 309 , but differed in various other provisions, including the determinationof land transfers to, and the jurisdictional powers of, a Native Hawaiian political entity. Thenature of the federal government's relationship to Native Hawaiians was an issue long beforethe 106th Congress, however, in both the Department of the Interior (129) and the halls ofCongress. Congress came closest to enacting a Native Hawaiian recognition bill in the 106thCongress, when the House passed H.R. 4904 . While the Senate did not passH.R. 4904, the bill would have been enacted through a provision in theConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 ( H.R. 4577 , P.L. 106-554 ), until a Senateconcurrent resolution removed the provision by correcting the enrollment of H.R.4577 ( S.Con.Res. 162 ).  Table 1. Native Hawaiian Recognition Bills inCongress  Congress has enacted a number of programs for Native Hawaiians, in addition to theHawaiian Home Lands program. (130) One concern among proponents of Native Hawaiianrecognition is that many or all of these federal programs for Native Hawaiians may beendangered if a Native Hawaiian political entity is not created. (131) Federal NativeHawaiian programs either are solely for Native Hawaiian communities or organizations orexplicitly include Native Hawaiian communities or organizations among the eligibleapplicants. Some of these programs benefit Indians as well. The programs provide a notinsignificant amount of federal dollars for Native Hawaiians. A 2003 report of the Councilfor Native Hawaiian Advancement estimated that in FY2002 over $70 million flowed intoHawaii because of such Native Hawaiian programs. (132) Among themajor federal Native Hawaiian programs listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) (133) are the following. Native Hawaiian Education Act ( P.L. 107-110 , Title VII, Part B); F2004obligations were $33.3 million, according to the CFDA.
