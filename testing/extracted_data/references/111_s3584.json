    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Responsible Arctic Energy \nDevelopment Act of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Alaska is the only Arctic State in the United States;\n            (2) Alaska contributes 17 percent of the oil production of \n        the United States, and the Arctic region of the State of Alaska \n        is believed to hold considerable reserves of oil and natural \n        gas needed for the future energy security of the United States;\n            (3) the marine mammals and other fish and wildlife \n        resources of the Arctic are--\n                    (A) critical to meet the subsistence needs of \n                indigenous residents of Alaska;\n                    (B) a source of significant nonconsumptive use and \n                nonuse value to the United States; and\n                    (C) vulnerable to the impacts of oil and gas \n                exploration and production;\n            (4) the Arctic and the natural resources of the Arctic are \n        particularly vulnerable to the impacts of oil spills due to the \n        uniqueness of and limited access to the region, including--\n                    (A) remote location that makes oil spill emergency \n                response capabilities slower and more difficult;\n                    (B) cold temperatures and ice cover that slow the \n                natural degradation and dissipation of spilled oil; and\n                    (C) increased susceptibility of Arctic wildlife \n                that are highly dependent on insulation, which would be \n                greatly decreased by oil cover;\n            (5) Alaska lacks the essential geospatial framework for \n        safe navigation, accident prevention, and oil spill response \n        capabilities that are available to the rest of the United \n        States;\n            (6) existing Federal research and science advisory programs \n        focused on the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of oil \n        and gas development in the Arctic would benefit from--\n                    (A) a more cohesive, coordinated, and integrated \n                approach; and\n                    (B) better coordination with State, local, and \n                private-sector Arctic research programs; and\n            (7) oil spill from the mobile offshore drilling unit \n        Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico has highlighted the \n        need for stronger oil spill prevention and response research \n        and planning for future development on the outer Continental \n        Shelf of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
