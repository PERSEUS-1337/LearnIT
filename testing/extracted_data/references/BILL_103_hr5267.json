DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE COORDINATION OF COMPOSTING.\n\n    (a) Composting Program.--Subtitle F of title XIV of the Food, \nAgriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-624; \n104 Stat. 3619) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nchapter:\n\n                ``CHAPTER 2--COORDINATION OF COMPOSTING\n\n``SEC. 1476. FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND DEFINITIONS.\n\n    ``(a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            ``(1) billions of dollars are spent annually on municipal \n        solid waste management in the United States;\n            ``(2) a substantial portion of discarded municipal solid \n        waste is organic material that could be separated at the \n        generating source and composted;\n            ``(3) approximately half of this compostable material could \n        be diverted from the waste stream by composting at home, \n        school, and work, and on farms, thereby avoiding at least 20 \n        percent of the ever increasing social and economic burden of \n        municipal solid waste management;\n            ``(4) the incorporation in soil of organic material derived \n        from composting enhances soil productivity by adding nutrients \n        and natural disease suppressing factors;\n            ``(5) greater use of compost as a soil additive will reduce \n        erosion and run-off by increasing infiltration and \n        permeability, thereby discouraging nonpoint source pollution; \n        and\n            ``(6) composting and use of soil-enriching compost on farms \n        is the most efficient and inexpensive way for farmers to move \n        toward sustainable agriculture.\n    ``(b) Purpose.--The purpose of this chapter is to establish a \nstructure to foster the development of source-separated composting and \nthe use of the resulting compost at home, school, and work and on farms \nin order to demonstrate that communities can achieve `zero-discharge' \nof these materials.\n\n``SEC. 1477.
