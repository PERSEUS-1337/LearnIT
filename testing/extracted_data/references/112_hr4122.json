    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Big Cats and Public Safety \nProtection Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The global illicit trade in wildlife may be worth up to \n        $20,000,000,000 annually and the value of United States legal \n        wildlife trade was recently estimated at $2,800,000,000 \n        annually.\n            (2) The illegal trade in prohibited wildlife species (as \n        that term is defined in the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981) \n        stimulates demand and expands markets in which those species \n        can be illegally sold.\n            (3) The private ownership of and commerce in prohibited \n        wildlife species has a substantial and detrimental effect on \n        the health and general welfare of the American people and on \n        the species themselves.\n            (4) Activities related to prohibited wildlife species that \n        are not an integral part of the interstate or foreign commerce \n        in such species, such as private ownership and possession, \n        nonetheless have a substantial and direct effect upon \n        interstate commerce because--\n                    (A) after breeding, many prohibited wildlife \n                species are transported in interstate commerce; and\n                    (B) privately owned prohibited wildlife species \n                have been transported in interstate commerce before \n                transfer of ownership.\n            (5) Private ownership of prohibited wildlife species \n        contributes to swelling the interstate traffic in those \n        species.\n            (6) Prohibited wildlife species in private ownership or \n        possession, or distributed intrastate, are fungible commodities \n        that cannot be differentiated from prohibited wildlife species \n        possessed or distributed interstate. Thus, it is not feasible \n        to distinguish, in terms of control, between prohibited \n        wildlife species in private ownership or possession or \n        distributed intrastate and prohibited wildlife species \n        possessed and distributed interstate.\n            (7) Federal control of the intrastate private ownership and \n        breeding of prohibited wildlife species is essential to the \n        effective control of the interstate incidents of traffic in \n        such species.\n            (8) The United States is a party to the Convention on \n        International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and \n        Flora, which was designed to protect species of wild fauna and \n        flora against over-exploitation through international trade.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Section 2 of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. 3371) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(l) Breed.--The term `breed' means to facilitate the reproduction \nof a prohibited wildlife species for commercial use.''.\n\nSEC. 4. PROHIBITIONS.\n\n    Section 3(a) of such Act (16 U.S.C. 3372(a)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (2)--\n                    (A) by adding ``or'' after the semicolon at the end \n                of subparagraph (A); and\n                    (B) by striking subparagraph (C);\n            (2) by striking ``or'' after the semicolon at the end of \n        paragraph (3), by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (5), \n        and by inserting after paragraph (3) the following:\n            ``(4) subject to subsection (e), to import, export, \n        transport, sell, receive, acquire, purchase, breed, possess, or \n        own any prohibited wildlife species; or''; and\n            (3) in paragraph (5), as so redesignated, by striking ``(1) \n        through (3)'' and inserting ``(1) through (4)''.\n\nSEC. 5.
