    "content": "SECTION 1. MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS WILDERNESS AND ERNEST F. COE \n              VISITOR CENTER, EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Marjory Stoneman Douglas, through her book, ``The \n        Everglades: River of Grass'' (1947), defined the Everglades for \n        the American people and for the world. Her book was the first \n        to stimulate widespread understanding of the Everglades \n        ecosystem and ultimately served to awaken the desire to restore \n        its health.\n            (2) In her 107th year, Mrs. Douglas is the sole surviving \n        member of the original group of people who devoted decades of \n        selfless effort to establish Everglades National Park.\n            (3) When the water supply and ecology of the Everglades, \n        both within and outside the park, became threatened by drainage \n        and development, Mrs. Douglas dedicated the balance of her life \n        to the defense of the Everglades through extraordinary personal \n        effort and by inspiring countless other people to take action.\n            (4) For these and many other accomplishments, the President \n        awarded Mrs. Douglas the Medal of Freedom on Earth Day, 1994.\n            (5) Ernest F. Coe (1886-1951) was a leader in the creation \n        of Everglades National Park. He organized the Tropic Everglades \n        National Park Association in 1928 and was widely regarded as \n        the ``Father of Everglades National Park''.\n            (6) As a landscape architect, Mr. Coe's vision for the park \n        recognized the need to protect south Florida's diverse wildlife \n        and their habitats for future generations. His original park \n        proposal included lands and waters subsequently protected \n        within Everglades National Park, the Big Cypress National \n        Preserve, and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.\n            (7) Mr. Coe's leadership, selfless devotion, and commitment \n        to achieving this vision culminated in the authorization of \n        Everglades National Park by Congress in 1934. Afterwards, Mr. \n        Coe fought tirelessly and lobbied strenuously for establishment \n        of the park, finally realizing his dream in 1947. He \n        accomplished much of this work at his own expense, which \n        dramatically demonstrated his commitment to establishment of \n        the park.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to commemorate the \nvision, leadership, and enduring contributions of Marjory Stoneman \nDouglas and Ernest F. Coe in the protection of the Everglades and the \nestablishment of Everglades National Park.\n    (c) Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness.--\n            (1) Redesignation.--Section 401(3) of the National Parks \n        and Recreation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-625; 92 Stat. 3490; \n        16 U.S.C. 1132 note) is amended by striking out ``to be known \n        as the Everglades Wilderness'' and inserting ``to be known as \n        the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness to commemorate the \n        vision and leadership shown by Mrs. Douglas in the protection \n        of the Everglades and the establishment of Everglades National \n        Park''.\n            (2) Notice of redesignation.--As part of the redesignation \n        of the ``Everglades Wilderness'' as the ``Marjory Stoneman \n        Douglas Wilderness'' under paragraph (1), the Secretary of the \n        Interior shall provide such notification of the redesignation \n        by signs, materials, maps, markers, interpretive programs, and \n        other means (including changes in existing signs, materials, \n        maps, and markers) as will adequately inform the public of the \n        redesignation of the wilderness area and the reasons therefor.\n            (3) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation, \n        document, record, map, or other paper of the United States to \n        the ``Everglades Wilderness'' shall be considered to be a \n        reference to ``Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness''.\n    (d) Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center.--\n            (1) Designation.--Section 103 of the Everglades National \n        Park Protection and Expansion Act of 1989 (16 U.S.C. 410r-7) is \n        amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(f) Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center.--Upon completion of \nconstruction of the main visitor center facility at the headquarters of \nEverglades National Park, the Secretary of the Interior shall designate \nthe visitor center facility as `The Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center' to \ncommemorate the vision and leadership shown by Mr. Coe in the \nestablishment and protection of Everglades National Park.''.\n            (2) Conforming amendment.--Subsection (e) of such section \n        is amended by striking ``Visitor Center'' and inserting \n        ``Marjory Stoneman Douglas Visitor Center''.\n            (3) Technical correction.--Subsection (c)(2) of such \n        section is amended by striking ``personnally-owned'' and \n        inserting ``personally-owned''."
