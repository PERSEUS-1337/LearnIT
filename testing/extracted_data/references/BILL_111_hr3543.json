PRODUCT CARBON DISCLOSURE PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) EPA Study.--The Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency shall conduct a study to determine the feasibility of \nestablishing a national program for measuring, reporting, publicly \ndisclosing, and labeling products or materials sold in the United \nStates for their carbon content, and shall, not later than 18 months \nafter the date of enactment of this Act, transmit a report to Congress \nwhich shall include the following:\n            (1) A determination of whether a national product carbon \n        disclosure program and labeling program would be effective in \n        achieving the intended goals of achieving greenhouse gas \n        reductions and an examination of existing programs globally and \n        their strengths and weaknesses.\n            (2) Criteria for identifying and prioritizing sectors and \n        products and processes that should be covered in such program \n        or programs.\n            (3) An identification of products, processes, or sectors \n        whose inclusion could have a substantial carbon impact \n        (prioritizing industrial products such as iron and steel, \n        aluminum, cement, chemicals, and paper products, and also \n        including food, beverage, hygiene, cleaning, household \n        cleaners, construction, metals, clothing, semiconductor, and \n        consumer electronics).\n            (4) Suggested methodology and protocols for measuring the \n        carbon content of the products across the entire carbon \n        lifecycle of such products for use in a carbon disclosure \n        program and labeling program.\n            (5) A review of existing greenhouse gas product accounting \n        standards, methodologies, and practices including the \n        Greenhouse Gas Protocol, ISO 14040/44, ISO 14067, and \n        Publically Available Specification 2050, and including a review \n        of the strengths and weaknesses of each.\n            (6) A survey of secondary databases including the \n        Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey and evaluate the \n        quality of data for use in a product carbon disclosure program \n        and product carbon labeling program and an identification of \n        gaps in the data relative to the potential purposes of a \n        national product carbon disclosure program and product carbon \n        labeling program and development of recommendations for \n        addressing these data gaps.\n            (7) An assessment of the utility of comparing products and \n        the appropriateness of product carbon standards.\n            (8) An evaluation of the information needed on a label for \n        clear and accurate communication, including what pieces of \n        quantitative and qualitative information needs to be disclosed.\n            (9) An evaluation of the appropriate boundaries of the \n        carbon lifecycle analysis for different sectors and products.\n            (10) An analysis of whether default values should be \n        developed for products whose producer does not participate in \n        the program or does not have data to support a disclosure or \n        label and determine best ways to develop such default values.\n            (11) A recommendation of certification and verification \n        options necessary to assure the quality of the information and \n        avoid greenwashing or the use of insubstantial or meaningless \n        environmental claims to promote a product.\n            (12) An assessment of options for educating consumers about \n        product carbon content and the product carbon disclosure \n        program and product carbon labeling program.\n            (13) An analysis of the costs and timelines associated with \n        establishing a national product carbon disclosure program and \n        product carbon labeling program, including options for a phased \n        approach. Costs should include those for businesses associated \n        with the measurement of carbon footprints and those associated \n        with creating a product carbon label and managing and operating \n        a product carbon labeling program, and options for minimizing \n        these costs.\n            (14) An evaluation of incentives (such as financial \n        incentives, brand reputation, and brand loyalty) to determine \n        whether reductions in emissions can be accelerated through \n        encouraging more efficient manufacturing or by encouraging \n        preferences for lower-emissions products to substitute for \n        higher-emissions products whose level of performance is no \n        better.\n    (b) Development of National Carbon Disclosure Program.--Upon \nconclusion of the study, and not more than 36 months after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Administrator shall establish a national \nproduct carbon disclosure program, participation in which shall be \nvoluntary, and which may involve a product carbon label with broad \napplicability to the wholesale and consumer markets to enable and \nencourage knowledge about carbon content by producers and consumers and \nto inform efforts to reduce energy consumption (carbon dioxide \nequivalent emissions) nationwide. In developing such a program, the \nAdministrator shall--\n            (1) consider the results of the study conducted under \n        subsection (a);\n            (2) consider existing and planned programs and proposals \n        and measurement standards (including the Publicly Available \n        Specification 2050, standards to be developed by the World \n        Resource Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable \n        Development, the International Standards Organization, and the \n        bill AB19 pending in the California legislature);\n            (3) consider the compatibility of a national product carbon \n        disclosure program with existing programs;\n            (4) utilize incentives and other means to spur the adoption \n        of product carbon disclosure and product carbon labeling;\n            (5) develop protocols and parameters for a product carbon \n        disclosure program, including a methodology and formula for \n        assessing, verifying, and potentially labeling a product's \n        greenhouse gas content, and for data quality requirements to \n        allow for product comparison;\n            (6) create a means to--\n                    (A) document best practices;\n                    (B) ensure clarity and consistency;\n                    (C) work with suppliers, manufacturers, and \n                retailers to encourage participation;\n                    (D) ensure that protocols are consistent and \n                comparable across like products; and\n                    (E) evaluate the effectiveness of the program;\n            (7) make publicly available information on product carbon \n        content to ensure transparency;\n            (8) provide for public outreach, including a consumer \n        education program to increase awareness;\n            (9) develop training and education programs to help \n        businesses learn how to measure and communicate their carbon \n        footprint and easy tools and templates for businesses to use to \n        reduce cost and time to measure their products' carbon \n        lifecycle;\n            (10) consult with the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of \n        Commerce, the Federal Trade Commission, and other Federal \n        agencies, as necessary;\n            (11) gather input from stakeholders through consultations, \n        public workshops or hearings with representatives of consumer \n        product manufacturers, consumer groups, and environmental \n        groups;\n            (12) utilize systems for verification and product \n        certification that will ensure that claims manufacturers make \n        about their products are valid;\n            (13) create a process for reviewing the accuracy of product \n        carbon label information and protecting the product carbon \n        label in the case of a change in the product's energy source, \n        supply chain, ingredients, or other factors, and specify the \n        frequency to which data should be updated; and\n            (14) develop a standardized, easily understandable carbon \n        label, if appropriate, and create a process for responding to \n        inaccuracies and misuses of such a label.\n    (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 5 years after the program \nis established pursuant to subsection (b), the Administrator shall \nreport to Congress on the effectiveness and impact of the program, the \nlevel of voluntary participation, and any recommendations for \nadditional measures.\n    (d) Definitions.--As used in this Act--\n            (1) the term ``carbon content'' means the amount of \n        greenhouse gas emissions and their warming impact on the \n        atmosphere expressed in carbon dioxide equivalent associated \n        with a product's value chain;\n            (2) the term ``carbon footprint'' means the level of \n        greenhouse gas emissions produced by a particular activity, \n        service, or entity; and\n            (3) the term ``carbon lifecycle'' means the greenhouse gas \n        emissions that are released as part of the processes of \n        creating, producing, processing or manufacturing, modifying, \n        transporting, distributing, storing, using, recycling, or \n        disposing of goods and services.\n    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated to the Administrator $5,000,000 for the study required by \nsubsection (a) and $25,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2010 through \n2025 for the program required under subsection (b)."
