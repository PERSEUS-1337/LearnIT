    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``End Excessive Oil Speculation Now \nAct of 2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF EXCESSIVE OIL SPECULATION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the national average retail price for a gallon of \n        gasoline was $3.75 on June 8, 2011;\n            (2) increased gasoline prices are causing severe economic \n        pain to the American people;\n            (3) Congress has a responsibility--\n                    (A) to ensure that gasoline prices at the pump \n                reflect the fundamentals of supply and demand; and\n                    (B) to bring needed relief to consumers and \n                businesses of the United States at the gas pump;\n            (4) there is mounting evidence that the spike in gasoline \n        prices has--\n                    (A) little to do with the fundamentals of supply \n                and demand; and\n                    (B) more to do with Wall Street speculators \n                increasing oil and gas prices in the energy futures and \n                swaps markets;\n            (5) as of May 27, 2011--\n                    (A) the supply of gasoline in the United States was \n                higher than it was 2 years ago; and\n                    (B) the demand for gasoline was lower than it was 2 \n                years ago when the national average for a gallon of \n                regular unleaded gasoline was $2.44 a gallon;\n            (6) on May 12, 2011, Exxon Mobil Chairman and Chief \n        Executive Officer, Rex Tillerson, told the Committee on Finance \n        of the Senate that oil should cost between $60 and $70 per \n        barrel, if the price of oil was based on supply and demand \n        fundamentals;\n            (7) on March 21, 2011, Goldman Sachs warned clients that \n        speculators were boosting crude oil prices by as much as $27 a \n        barrel;\n            (8) on March 25, 2011, Delta Airlines General Counsel, Ben \n        Hirst, said that the marginal cost of oil production is between \n        $60 to $70 a barrel;\n            (9) in the summer of 2008, when gas prices rose to over $4 \n        a gallon, Saudi Arabian government officials told the Federal \n        Government that speculators were responsible for increasing oil \n        prices by about $40 a barrel;\n            (10) the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has the \n        authority to ensure that the price discovery for oil and \n        gasoline is based on the fundamentals of supply and demand, \n        rather than excessive speculation;\n            (11) title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \n        Consumer Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.) (and \n        amendments made by that Act) requires the Commission to \n        establish position limits ``to diminish, eliminate, or prevent \n        excessive speculation'' for trading in crude oil, gasoline, \n        heating oil and other physical commodity derivatives;\n            (12) as of the date of introduction of this Act, the \n        Commission has failed to impose position limits to diminish, \n        eliminate, or prevent excessive oil and gasoline speculation as \n        required by law; and\n            (13) the proposed position limits for derivatives that the \n        Commission included in the notice of proposed rulemaking \n        entitled ``Position Limits for Derivatives'' (76 Fed. Reg. 4752 \n        (January 26, 2011)) are not scheduled to go into effect until \n        the first quarter of 2012, which would--\n                    (A) occur on a date that is later than the \n                statutory deadline for the regulations; and\n                    (B) fail to diminish, eliminate, or prevent \n                excessive speculation as required by the Dodd-Frank \n                Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public \n                Law 111-203; 124 Stat. 1376).\n    (b) Elimination of Excessive Oil Speculation.--\n            (1) Definitions.--In this Act:\n                    (A) Bona-fide hedge trading; bona-fide hedge \n                transaction.--The terms ``bona-fide hedge trading'' and \n                ``bona-fide hedge transaction'' means a transaction or \n                position that--\n                            (i)(I) represents a substitute for a \n                        transaction made or to be made, or a position \n                        taken or to be taken, at a later time in a \n                        physical marketing channel;\n                            (II) is economically appropriate for the \n                        reduction of risks in the conduct and \n                        management of a commercial enterprise; and\n                            (III) arises from the potential change in \n                        the value of--\n                                    (aa) assets that a person owns, \n                                produces, manufactures, processes, or \n                                merchandises or anticipates owning, \n                                producing, manufacturing, processing, \n                                or merchandising;\n                                    (bb) liabilities that a person has \n                                incurred or anticipates incurring; or\n                                    (cc) services that a person \n                                provides, purchases, or anticipates \n                                providing or purchasing; or\n                            (ii) reduces risks attendant to a position \n                        resulting from a swap that--\n                                    (I) was executed opposite a \n                                counterparty for which the transaction \n                                would qualify as a bona-fide hedging \n                                transaction;
