FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The American Public Transportation Association \n        estimates that since January 1, 2009, 84 percent of transit \n        systems have raised fares, cut service or are considering one \n        of those actions.\n            (2) Many low-income workers, older Americans, and people \n        with disabilities depend on transit service to get to jobs and \n        health care. Reduced service and higher fares can have a \n        devastating effect on their quality of life.\n            (3) Millions of Americans use transit every day. Reduced \n        transit service makes it harder for workers to access jobs and \n        puts more cars on the road, worsening already bad traffic \n        congestion in many metropolitan areas.\n\nSEC. 3.
