FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The consumption of narcotics in the United States is a \n        serious problem that is ravaging the United States, especially \n        America's youth.\n            (2) Despite the dedicated and persistent efforts of the \n        United States and other nations, international narcotics \n        trafficking and consumption remains a serious problem.\n            (3) The total eradication of international narcotics \n        trafficking requires a long-term strategy that necessitates \n        close international cooperation.\n            (4) The annual certification process relating to \n        international narcotics control under section 490 of the \n        Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291j) is flawed \n        because--\n                    (A) the process fails to enhance international \n                cooperation;\n                    (B) the process reviews narcotics control efforts \n                only on an annual basis and fails to enumerate long-\n                term goals and objectives;\n                    (C) the process is not a comprehensive review of \n                all countries that contribute to international \n                narcotics trafficking; and\n                    (D) the process fails to account for the divergent \n                economic, political, and social circumstances of \n                countries under review which can influence the decision \n                by the United States to decertify a foreign nation, \n                thereby leading to unpredictability, non-transparency, \n                and lack of international credibility in the process.\n            (5) The problem of international narcotics trafficking is \n        not being effectively addressed by the annual certification \n        process under section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n        (22 U.S.C. 2291j).\n\nSEC. 3.
