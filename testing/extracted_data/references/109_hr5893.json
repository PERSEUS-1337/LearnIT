    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Private Security Officer Employment \nEnhancement Act of 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) One of the legacies of the horrific attacks of \n        September 11, 2001, is the need for enhanced security of the \n        United States. Meeting this need has imposed serious stresses \n        on government agencies at all levels and entities whose primary \n        task is the protection of the key assets of the United States \n        and the life, health, and property of its populace.\n            (2) President Bush stated, in a February 2003 report \n        titled, ``The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of \n        Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets'', that there is an \n        increased need to assess the Nation's vulnerabilities and to \n        provide additional security for its key assets. Providing such \n        security will require increased cooperation between the Federal \n        Government and the private sector.\n            (3) Such Report recognized that terrorists, in the pursuit \n        of their long-term, strategic objectives, will likely continue \n        to attack critical infrastructures and key assets of the United \n        States, the vast majority of which are owned and operated by \n        the private sector.\n            (4) Because of enhanced security needs, the use of private \n        security companies in guarding the key assets of the United \n        States and the life, health, and property of its populace has \n        increased significantly since September 11, 2001, and will \n        continue to do so.\n            (5) Because of enhanced security needs, businesses have \n        increased their security efforts and the number of internal \n        employees dedicated to securing their facilities.\n            (6) As reliance on private security companies to guard the \n        key assets of the United States and to protect the life, \n        health, and property of its populace continues to grow, the \n        hiring and placement decisions of such companies (which employ \n        more than 500,000 private security officers nationwide) have \n        become critical. Such decisions determine who will protect the \n        United States and have access to its key assets. Similarly, \n        businesses providing their own internal security services have \n        experienced a heightened need to improve their internal \n        security measures and to obtain more information about the \n        individuals who provide their internal security. It has, \n        therefore, become imperative that companies employing or hiring \n        security personnel have access to a criminal background \n        checking system that is efficient, inclusive, nationwide in \n        scope, dependable, and technologically advanced, in order to \n        minimize the occurrence of dangerous and disastrous placement \n        and hiring decisions.\n            (7) Companies cannot properly and effectively evaluate \n        their prospective and current internal security employees \n        without access to the criminal history records available \n        through the National Crime Information Center (NCIC). Access to \n        the NCIC for the purpose of reviewing the background of current \n        and prospective employees is currently enjoyed by the banking \n        industry, the nuclear power industry, public housing \n        authorities, and others, and should be made available to \n        private security companies and to businesses providing their \n        own security so that such companies and businesses can safely \n        and effectively partner with Federal, State, and local \n        governments in the effort to protect the United States.\n            (8) Given its critical role in the security of the United \n        States, the Department of Homeland Security, working in \n        conjunction with the Department of Justice, is best suited to \n        act as the clearinghouse for obtaining and disseminating NCIC \n        criminal history records for the purposes set forth in this \n        section.\n\nSEC. 3. IMPROVED CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORDS SEARCH FOR PURPOSES OF \n              EMPLOYMENT OF COVERED PRIVATE SECURITY OFFICERS.\n\n    Section 6402 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention \nAct of 2004 (118 Stat. 3755, 28 U.S.C. 534 note) is amended by striking \nsubsection (c) and all that follows through the end and inserting the \nfollowing new subsections:\n    ``(c) Requirement To Provide NCIC Information Upon Request.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall, upon receipt of a \n        request by a covered employer with respect to a covered \n        employee, provide for an NCIC criminal history records check \n        with respect to the covered employee and provide the results of \n        the check to the covered employer, in accordance with this \n        section.\n            ``(2) Fingerprints.--A request under paragraph (1) shall \n        include the fingerprints of the covered employee, which shall \n        be submitted electronically to the Secretary.
