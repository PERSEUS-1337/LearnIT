CONSTRUCTION OF A CENTER FOR PERFORMING ARTS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) The United States has an enriched legacy of Hispanic \n    influence in politics, government, economic development, and \n    cultural expression.\n        (2) The Hispanic culture in what is now the United States can \n    be traced to 1528 when a Spanish expedition from Cuba to Florida \n    was shipwrecked on the Texas coast.\n        (3) The Hispanic culture in New Mexico can be traced to 1539 \n    when a Spanish Franciscan Friar, Marcos de Niza, and his guide, \n    Estevanico, traveled into present day New Mexico in search of the \n    fabled city of Cibola and made contact with the people of Zuni.\n        (4) The Hispanic influence in New Mexico is particularly \n    dominant and a part of daily living for all the citizens of New \n    Mexico, who are a diverse composite of racial, ethnic, and cultural \n    peoples. Don Juan de Onate and the first New Mexican families \n    established the first capital in the United States, San Juan de los \n    Caballeros, in July of 1598.\n        (5) Based on the 1990 census, there are approximately 650,000 \n    Hispanics in New Mexico, the majority having roots reaching back \n    ten or more generations.\n        (6) There are an additional 200,000 Hispanics living outside of \n    New Mexico with roots in New Mexico.\n        (7) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center is a living tribute \n    to the Hispanic experience and will provide all citizens of New \n    Mexico, the Southwestern United States, the entire United States, \n    and around the world, an opportunity to learn about, partake in, \n    and enjoy the unique Hispanic culture, and the New Mexico Hispanic \n    Cultural Center will assure that this 400-year old culture is \n    preserved.\n        (8) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will teach, \n    showcase, and share all facets of Hispanic culture, including \n    literature, performing arts, visual arts, culinary arts, and \n    language arts.\n        (9) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will promote a \n    better cross-cultural understanding of the Hispanic culture and the \n    contributions of individuals to the society in which we all live.\n        (10) In 1993, the legislature and Governor of New Mexico \n    created the Hispanic Cultural Division as a division within the \n    Office of Cultural Affairs. One of the principal responsibilities \n    of the Hispanic Cultural Division is to oversee the planning, \n    construction, and operation of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural \n    Center.\n        (11) The mission of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center is \n    to create a greater appreciation and understanding of Hispanic \n    culture.\n        (12) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will serve as a \n    local, regional, national, and international site for the study and \n    advancement of Hispanic culture, expressing both the rich history \n    and the forward-looking aspirations of Hispanics throughout the \n    world.\n        (13) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will be a Hispanic \n    arts and humanities showcase to display the works of national and \n    international artists, and to provide a venue for educators, \n    scholars, artists, children, elders, and the general public.\n        (14) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will provide a \n    venue for presenting the historic and contemporary representations \n    and achievements of the Hispanic culture.\n        (15) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will sponsor arts \n    and humanities programs, including programs related to visual arts \n    of all forms (including drama, dance, and traditional and \n    contemporary music), research, literary arts, genealogy, oral \n    history, publications, and special events such as, fiestas, \n    culinary arts demonstrations, film video productions, storytelling \n    presentations and education programs.\n        (16) Phase I of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center complex \n    is scheduled to be completed by August of 1998 and is planned to \n    consist of an art gallery with exhibition space and a museum, \n    administrative offices, a restaurant, a ballroom, a gift shop, an \n    amphitheater, a research and literary arts center, and other \n    components.\n        (17) Phase II of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center \n    complex is planned to include a performing arts center (containing \n    a 700-seat theater, a stage house, and a 300-seat film/video \n    theater), a 150-seat black box theater, an art studio building, a \n    culinary arts building, and a research and literary arts building.\n        (18) It is appropriate for the Federal Government to share in \n    the cost of constructing the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center \n    because Congress recognizes that the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural \n    Center has the potential to be a premier facility for performing \n    arts and a national repository for Hispanic arts and culture.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n        (1) Center.--The term ``Center'' means the Center for \n    Performing Arts, within the complex known as the New Mexico \n    Hispanic Cultural Center, which Center for the Performing Arts is a \n    central facility in Phase II of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural \n    Center complex.\n        (2) Hispanic cultural division.--The term ``Hispanic Cultural \n    Division'' means the Hispanic Cultural Division of the Office of \n    Cultural Affairs of the State of New Mexico.\n        (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n    the Interior.\n    (c) Construction of Center.--The Secretary shall award a grant to \nNew Mexico to pay for the Federal share of the costs of the design, \nconstruction, furnishing, and equipping of the Center for Performing \nArts that will be located at a site to be determined by the Hispanic \nCultural Division, within the complex known as the New Mexico Hispanic \nCultural Center.\n    (d) Grant Requirements.--\n        (1) In general.--In order to receive a grant awarded under \n    subsection (c), New Mexico, acting through the Director of the \n    Hispanic Cultural Division--\n            (A) shall submit to the Secretary, within 30 days of the \n        date of enactment of this section, a copy of the New Mexico \n        Hispanic Cultural Center Program document dated January 1996;
