FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The State of California and much of the West are \n        experiencing one of the driest years on record, exacerbating \n        water supply problems caused by a lack of surface water storage \n        infrastructure. The drought conditions have caused reductions \n        in water supplies to almost all water users in the State.\n            (2) The Sites Project has been identified by the State of \n        California and the Federal Government as an important component \n        to integrated water management in the Sacramento Valley that \n        would advance the co-equal objectives of improving water \n        management and restoring ecological health for beneficial uses \n        of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and the Sacramento River \n        watershed.\n            (3) Among other things, the Sites Project would--\n                    (A) increase surface water storage to enhance water \n                management flexibility in the Sacramento Valley;\n                    (B) provide flood control benefits;\n                    (C) improve conditions for fish, waterfowl, and \n                wildlife in the Sacramento Valley, including anadromous \n                fish in the Sacramento River; and\n                    (D) improve the operation of the State's water \n                system to provide improvements in ecosystem and water \n                quality conditions in the Bay-Delta while providing a \n                more reliable water supply for the State of California.\n            (4) The Sites Project has been shown to provide \n        approximately 1,300,000 of additional yield when the Sites \n        Project is integrated into the operations of other State and \n        Federal reservoirs upstream of the Bay-Delta.\n            (5) Healthy wetlands are of vital importance to wildlife in \n        California and require a reliable supply of water, and \n        additional surface water storage can help meet water supply \n        goals under the Central Valley Project Improvement Act.\n            (6) It is in the interests of the United States for the \n        Federal Government to work with the Sites Project Authority, \n        which has been established under laws of the State of \n        California as an independent joint powers authority to, among \n        other things, study, promote, develop, design, finance, \n        acquire, construct, manage, and operate Sites Reservoir and \n        related facilities, in order to advance the Sites Project in \n        the most expeditious and cost-effective manner possible.\n\nSEC. 3.
