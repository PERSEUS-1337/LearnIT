    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Tsunami Orphans and Unaccompanied \nChildren Act of 2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Over 160,000 people were killed in the Indian Ocean \n        region as a result of the earthquake and tsunamis that occurred \n        on December 26, 2004.\n            (2) Experts estimate that a higher than expected number of \n        those killed were children.\n            (3) According to the United Nations, 3 to 5 million people \n        were affected by the disaster. Approximately 1.5 million of \n        those individuals affected are children.\n            (4) Experts estimate that the total number of children \n        affected in the tsunamis could reach up to 50 percent. Experts \n        estimate that a significant number of children have been \n        separated from their parents or orphaned.\n            (5) Orphaned and unaccompanied children are particularly \n        vulnerable to disease, hunger, and exploitation.\n            (6) In the chaotic environment following a disaster when \n        protection mechanisms may not be in place, unaccompanied \n        children are more vulnerable to traffickers and forcible \n        recruitment into militias.\n            (7) After a disaster, under-resourced governments, \n        communities, and villages may not be able to independently \n        provide sufficient care and services for orphans and \n        unaccompanied children.\n            (8) Unaccompanied children and orphans need immediate care \n        and security in the short-term, as well as a long-term \n        investment in their education, health, and protection.\n            (9) Congress recognizes that a number of organizations \n        including UNICEF, Save the Children, World Vision, and the \n        International Committee of the Red Cross are leading the effort \n        to reunify children with their families, provide protection \n        against traffickers, and provide food, shelter, education, \n        counseling, and many other vital services.\n    (b) Declaration of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United \nStates to take prompt and appropriate actions to assist children who \nare orphaned or currently unaccompanied as a result of the tsunamis \nthat occurred on December 26, 2004, in the Indian Ocean as an important \nexpression of humanitarian concern and the traditions of the United \nStates and, in particular, to assist such orphans and unaccompanied \nchildren by--\n            (1) providing assistance for the purpose of identifying and \n        reunifying unaccompanied children with their families;\n            (2) providing assistance for the immediate care of \n        unaccompanied children and orphans, including health care, \n        food, shelter, education, psychological counseling, and \n        protection from traffickers; and\n            (3) providing for the long-term needs of children not \n        reunified with immediate or extended family members, including \n        long-term placement consistent with international standards and \n        local customs and structures and also providing support for \n        education, healthcare, food, job-training, and psychological \n        counseling.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1961.\n\n    Chapter 2 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \nU.S.C. 2166 et seq.) is amended by inserting after title VI the \nfollowing new title:\n\n ``TITLE VII--ASSISTANCE FOR TSUNAMI ORPHANS AND UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN\n\n``SEC. 261.
