FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Consumer confidence and spending is critical to a \n        healthy United States economy.\n            (2) In order to prevent a further decline in consumer \n        spending, which fell 1.8 percent in September 2001, and \n        consumer confidence, which is at its lowest level since \n        February 1994, the Federal Government needs to provide an \n        immediate and targeted tax incentive to encourage consumer \n        spending.\n            (3) The most immediate and targeted incentive for \n        consumption would be to reduce the price of goods to consumers, \n        which can be done most effectively by providing a tax incentive \n        to individuals to make retail purchases.\n            (4) A 10-day consumer travel tax credit holiday, prior to \n        the 2001 holiday season, would encourage Americans to make \n        immediate purchases and help to counteract the decline in \n        consumer confidence Americans have experienced since September \n        11, 2001. The direct boost to consumption resulting from such \n        tax incentive would enhance the benefits of individual tax cuts \n        provided by any Federal tax stimulus legislation.\n            (5) Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon \n        currently do not impose a State sales tax. These States have \n        worked hard to establish a State tax structure that does not \n        include a sales tax. Any economic stimulus proposals relating \n        to sales tax must include proportional relief to these five \n        States, which have chosen not to impose a sales tax. These five \n        sales-tax-free States should not be penalized for choosing the \n        tax structure best for their State by being excluded from sales \n        tax holiday relief. A tax credit for travel for the purpose of \n        making retail purchases in those States would provide a benefit \n        to consumers similar to a sales tax holiday in other States.\n\nSEC. 3. CREDIT FOR TRAVEL FOR PURPOSES OF RETAIL PURCHASES IN STATES \n              NOT IMPOSING SALES TAX.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 \nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to nonrefundable \npersonal credits) is amended by inserting after section 25B the \nfollowing new section:\n\n``SEC. 25C.
