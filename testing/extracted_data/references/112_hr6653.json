FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Independent contractors play a vital role in our \n        economy.\n            (2) Independent contractors embrace the entrepreneurial \n        spirit of our country and are free to seek economic \n        opportunities that best fit their needs.\n            (3) Many small businesses start as an independent \n        contractor and grow creating jobs for other individuals.\n            (4) The proper classification of individuals as employees \n        and independent contractors is a significant responsibility for \n        businesses.\n            (5) The rules and guidelines for determining whether an \n        individual is an independent contractor or an employee lack \n        clarity and consistency.\n            (6) It is in the best interests of taxpayers, the Federal \n        Government and the business community to have fair and \n        objective rules for determining who is an independent \n        contractor and who is an employee.\n\nSEC. 3.
