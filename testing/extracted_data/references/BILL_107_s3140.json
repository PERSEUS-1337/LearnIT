FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) An improved registration system for sex offenders and \n        others who commit predatory acts against children will provide \n        law enforcement agencies with additional information critical \n        to preventing and promptly resolving such crimes.\n            (2) Federal, State, and local law enforcement were called \n        upon to investigate over 12,000 non-family abductions in the \n        United States in 1999.\n            (3) The National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database, \n        which links more than 16,000 Federal, State, and local law \n        enforcement agencies, is a critical means of cooperation among \n        law enforcement agencies.\n            (4) Delays in entering missing children reports into the \n        NCIC database leads to investigative delays when time is \n        critical to ensuring the safe return of missing children, as \n        evidenced by the fact that in 74 percent of abduction homicide \n        cases the child is dead within the first 3 hours and 91 percent \n        are killed within 24 hours.\n\nSEC. 3. MISSING CHILD REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 3702 of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (42 \nU.S.C. 5780) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (2) and (3) as paragraphs \n        (3) and (4), respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:\n            ``(2) ensure that no law enforcement agency within the \n        State establishes or maintains any policy that requires the \n        removal of a missing person entry from its State law \n        enforcement system or the National Crime Information Center \n        computer network based solely on the age of the person;''; and\n            (3) in paragraph (3), as redesignated, by striking \n        ``immediately'' and inserting ``within 2 hours of receipt''.\n\nSEC. 4. STANDARDS FOR SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 170101 of the Violent Crime Control and \nLaw Enforcement Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14071) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (b)--\n                    (A) in paragraph (1)(A)--\n                            (i) by striking clause (i), and inserting \n                        the following:\n                            ``(i) inform the person of the duty to \n                        register and obtain the information required \n                        for such registration, including the person's \n                        name, current address, anticipated future \n                        residence, employer name and address, license \n                        plate number and other identifying information \n                        about each vehicle that the person owns, and \n                        student enrollment information;'';\n                            (ii) by striking clause (iv) and inserting \n                        the following:\n                            ``(iv) obtain fingerprints, a photograph, \n                        and a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sample, \n                        unless they were obtained within the previous 3 \n                        months;'';\n                            (iii) in clause (v), by striking the period \n                        at the end and inserting the following: ``; \n                        and''; and\n                            (iv) by adding at the end the following:\n                            ``(vi) for persons who are incarcerated, \n                        perform each of the duties under clauses (i) \n                        through (v) prior to the release of that person \n                        from incarceration.'';\n                    (B) in paragraph (2)(A), in the second sentence, by \n                inserting ``registration information for persons \n                intending to move to another State is promptly made \n                available to the registering agency of that State, and \n                that'' after ``State procedures shall also ensure \n                that'';\n                    (C) by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the \n                following:\n            ``(3) Verification.--For all persons required to register \n        under this section, State procedures shall provide for \n        verification of registry information not less than every 90 \n        days.'';\n                    (D) by striking paragraph (4) and inserting the \n                following:\n            ``(4) Notification of local law enforcement agencies of \n        changes in registry information.--State procedures shall \n        provide that all persons required to register under this \n        section shall report a change of name, address, employer name \n        and address, vehicle information, and student enrollment \n        information to a law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction \n        where the person will reside, not later than 10 days after such \n        change takes effect.''; and\n                    (E) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(8) Current photograph.--State procedures shall provide \n        for local law enforcement to obtain a photograph for all \n        persons required to register under this section--\n                    ``(A) at the initial registration of the person; \n                and\n                    ``(B) not less than annually at the time of \n                verification of the registry information of that \n                person, throughout the term of registration.\n            ``(9) Driver's license or identification card.--State \n        procedures shall require that all persons required to register \n        under this section obtain, at the time of initial registration, \n        a driver's license or identification card from the State \n        Department of Motor Vehicles in the State in which that person \n        resides.''; and\n            (2) in subsection (d)--\n                    (A) by striking ``A'' and inserting the following:\n            ``(1) In general.--A''; and\n                    (B) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(2) Felony.--States shall designate a failure to comply \n        with the registration and verification requirements of this \n        section as a felony and permit such failure to be grounds for \n        the immediate issuance of an arrest warrant.\n            ``(3) Considerations.--States shall consider a failure to \n        comply with the registration and verification requirements of \n        this section as an ongoing offense for the purpose of statutes \n        of limitation, and shall consider a failure to register each \n        item of changed registry information as a separate offense.''."
