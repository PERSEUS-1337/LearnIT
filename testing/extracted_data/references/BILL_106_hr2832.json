FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States has a long tradition of heroic \n        efforts to rescue those in peril on the sea.\n            (2) Legislation providing appropriations to the Secretary \n        of the Treasury for ``surf boats, rockets, carronades, and \n        other necessary apparatus for the better preservation of life \n        and property from shipwrecks on the coast of New Jersey, \n        between Sandy Hook and Little Egg Harbor'' was approved August \n        14, 1848 (9 Stat. 322), and was subsequently extended to \n        support volunteer lifesaving efforts on the coast of New Jersey \n        between Little Egg Harbor and Cape May, and in other States and \n        territories.\n            (3) Legislation providing appropriations to the Secretary \n        of the Treasury ``for the purpose of more effectively securing \n        life and property on the coast of New Jersey and Long Island... \n        and to employ crews of experienced surfmen at such stations'' \n        was approved April 20, 1871 (17 Stat. 12).\n            (4) The Life-Saving Service was reorganized by the Congress \n        by enactment of the Act entitled ``An Act to organize the Life-\n        Saving-Service'', approved June 18, 1878 (chapter 265; 20 Stat. \n        163).\n            (5) America's lifesaving stations and boats were staffed by \n        brave volunteer and professional lifesavers, who risked life \n        and limb to rescue shipwrecked passengers and crews.\n            (6) Many surviving Life-Saving Service stations are of rare \n        architectural significance, yet these historic stations are \n        threatened by harsh coastal environments, rapid economic \n        development in the coastal zone, neglect, and lack of resources \n        for their preservation.\n            (7) The heroic actions of Life-Saving Service personnel \n        deserve greater recognition, and their contributions to \n        America's maritime and architectural history should be \n        celebrated through a comprehensive preservation program and \n        greater opportunities for the public's education about the \n        heritage of the Life-Saving Service and related private and \n        public organizations.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize the Secretary \nof the Interior to establish a program to inventory, evaluate, \ndocument, and assist in efforts to restore and preserve surviving \nlifesaving stations and other structures and artifacts dedicated to our \nforefathers' lifesaving efforts.\n\nSEC. 3.
