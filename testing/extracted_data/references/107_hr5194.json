    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Water Authority Restoration \nAct of 2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Water is a unique and precious resource that is \n        necessary to sustain human life and the life of animals and \n        plants.\n            (2) Water is used not only for human, animal, and plant \n        consumption, but is also important for agriculture, \n        transportation, flood control, energy production, recreation, \n        fishing and shellfishing, and municipal and commercial uses.\n            (3) Water has significant historic and cultural value in \n        our society.\n            (4) In enacting the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n        U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) in 1972 and through subsequent amendment, \n        including the Clean Water Act of 1977 (91 Stat. 1566) and the \n        Water Quality Act of 1987 (101 Stat. 7), Congress established \n        the national objective of restoring and maintaining the \n        chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the waters of \n        the United States and recognized that achieving this objective \n        requires restoration and maintenance of the natural structures \n        and functions of the aquatic ecosystems of the United States.\n            (5) Water is transported through interconnected hydrologic \n        cycles, and the pollution, impairment, or destruction of part \n        of an aquatic system may affect the chemical, physical, and \n        biological integrity of other interconnected parts of the \n        aquatic system.\n            (6) Protection of intrastate waters, including waters that \n        appear to be isolated, along with other waters of the United \n        States, is necessary to restore and maintain the chemical, \n        physical, and biological integrity of all waters in the United \n        States.\n            (7) The regulation of discharges of pollutants into \n        isolated and intrastate waters is an integral part of the \n        comprehensive clean water regulatory program of the United \n        States.\n            (8) The term ``waters of the United States'' means all \n        waters of the United States subject to the powers of the \n        Federal Government under the Constitution, including wetlands \n        adjacent to bodies of water and other wetlands and waters often \n        referred to as isolated.\n            (9) Regardless of whether a wetland or other water is \n        referred to as isolated, wetlands, lakes, ponds, and other \n        types of water in the United States are an integral part of the \n        aquatic environment that contribute to the chemical, physical, \n        and biological integrity of the aquatic system.\n            (10) The waters of the United States, including intrastate \n        and isolated waters, filter pollutants from surface run-off and \n        remove pollutants before the water is released to groundwater \n        or surface water or taken up by plants and animals and widely \n        dispersed throughout the food chain.\n            (11) The waters of the United States, including intrastate \n        and isolated waters, also provide crucial habitat for flora and \n        fauna that contribute to the biological integrity of the \n        aquatic environment, including unique aquatic vegetation, \n        amphibians, reptiles, fish, shorebirds, raptors, waterfowl, and \n        other migratory birds.\n            (12) More than one-half of the duck population of the \n        United States breeds in intrastate and isolated waters, as do \n        approximately one-half of all amphibian species in the United \n        States.\n            (13) Small and periodically-flowing streams comprise the \n        majority of all stream channels in the United States and serve \n        critical biological and hydrological functions that affect \n        entire watersheds, especially the life cycles of aquatic \n        organisms and the movement of higher order streams during \n        floods.\n            (14) Destroying, polluting, or altering small stream \n        channels often results in an accumulation of negative effects \nthroughout a watershed, including the introduction of pollutants to \nlarger-order streams and rivers.\n            (15) The pollution or other degradation of waters of the \n        United States, including isolated and intrastate waters, \n        individually and in the aggregate, has a substantial relation \n        to and affect on interstate commerce.\n            (16) Protection of the waters of the United States, \n        including intrastate and isolated waters, is necessary to \n        prevent significant harm to interstate commerce and sustain a \n        robust system of interstate commerce in the future.\n            (17) The navigation system of the United States directly \n        benefits from maintaining the variety of water types that \n        collect, store, and filter run-off because that collection, \n        storage, and filtration greatly reduces the quantity of \n        sediment deposits and navigation disruption in the waters of \n        the United States, and without the direct benefits of isolated \n        and intrastate waters, the United States would spend millions \n        of additional dollars on navigational dredging projects.\n            (18) Thousands of businesses and communities depend on \n        wetlands and intrastate and isolated waters for protection from \n        flooding.\n            (19) Draining or filling isolated wetlands and channelizing \n        or filling streams, including intrastate streams, causes or \n        exacerbates flooding.\n            (20) Floods and the risk of floods are a significant burden \n        on interstate commerce because floods damage and destroy public \n        infrastructure, private homes, and businesses.\n            (21) Millions of people in the United States depend on \n        intrastate and isolated wetlands to filter water and recharge \n        surface and subsurface drinking water supplies.\n            (22) Polluted drinking water and depleted drinking water \n        supplies are significant burdens on interstate commerce because \n        the lack of a safe and ample water supply significantly limits \n        economic growth and adversely affects human health.\n            (23) Agriculture depends on intrastate and isolated waters \n        for irrigation, watering stock, and maintenance of water supply \n        to wells.\n            (24) Millions of people in the United States enjoy \n        recreational activities that depend on intrastate and isolated \n        waters, such as waterfowl hunting, bird watching, fishing, and \n        photography and other graphic arts, and those activities and \n        associated travel generate billions of dollars of income each \n        year for the travel, tourism, recreation, and sporting sectors \n        of the economy of the United States.\n            (25) Discharges of dredged and fill material and other \n        pollutants into waters of the United States, including \n        intrastate and isolated waters, are almost always associated \n        with activities that are commercial or economic in nature.\n            (26) Wetlands, including intrastate and isolated wetlands, \n        are routinely filled to construct roads, parking lots, \n        residential subdivisions, commercial buildings, solid waste \n        landfills, and recreational and institutional facilities, all \n        of which have a substantial relation to and effect on \n        interstate commerce.\n            (27) Activities that result in the discharge of pollutants \n        into waters of the United States are commercial or economic in \n        nature, including industrial production, transportation and \n        infrastructure development, residential and commercial \n        construction and site development, navigation, agriculture and \n        silviculture, and resource extraction.\n            (28) In enacting the Federal Water Pollution Control Act \n        and its amendments, Congress recognized that--\n                    (A) inconsistent State water pollution control laws \n                are insufficient to protect the aquatic ecosystems of \n                the United States; and\n                    (B) uniform, minimum national water quality and \n                aquatic ecosystem protection standards are essential to \n                prevent incentives to lower environmental standards and \n                allow businesses in States with less protective \n                environmental standards to achieve greater profits, not \n                only at the expense of the downstream public but also \n                at the expense of businesses in States that impose more \n                protective environmental standards.\n            (29) States have the responsibility and right to prevent, \n        reduce, and eliminate pollution of waters, and the Federal \n        Water Pollution Control Act respects the rights and \n        responsibilities of States by preserving for States the ability \n        to manage permitting, grant, and research programs to prevent, \n        reduce, and eliminate pollution, and to establish standards and \n        programs more protective of a State's waters than is provided \n        under Federal standards and programs.\n            (30) Protecting the quality of and regulating activities \n        affecting the waters of the United States is a necessary and \n        proper means of implementing treaties to which the United \n        States is a party, including treaties protecting species of \n        fish, birds, and wildlife, such as--\n                    (A) the Convention for the Protection of Migratory \n                Birds in the United States and Canada, signed at \n                Washington on August 16, 1916 (39 Stat. 1702);\n                    (B) the Convention for the Protection of Migratory \n                Birds and Game Mammals, signed at Mexico City on \n                February 7, 1936 (50 Stat. 1311); and\n                    (C) the Convention on Nature Protection and \n                Wildlife Preservation in the Western Hemisphere, with \n                an annex, opened for signature at the Pan American \n                Union at Washington on October 12, 1940 (56 Stat. \n                1354).\n            (31) Protecting the quality of and regulating activities \n        affecting the waters of the United States is a necessary and \n        proper means of protecting Federal land, including hundreds of \n        millions of acres of parkland, refuge land, and other land \n        under Federal ownership and the wide array of waters \n        encompassed by that land.\n            (32) Protecting the quality of and regulating activities \n        affecting the waters of the United States is necessary to \n        protect Federal land and waters from discharges of pollutants \n        and other forms of degradation.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To provide protection to waters of the United States to \n        the fullest extent of the legislative authority of Congress \n        under the Constitution, including the Commerce Clause, the \n        Property Clause, the Treaty Clause, and the Necessary and \n        Proper Clause of Articles I and IV of the Constitution.\n            (2) To regulate activities affecting the waters of the \n        United States, including intrastate and isolated waters.\n            (3) To restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and \n        biological integrity of the waters of the United States.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITION OF WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. \n1362) is amended--\n            (1) by striking paragraph (7);\n            (2) by redesignating paragraphs (8) through (23) as \n        paragraphs (7) through (22), respectively; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(23) Waters of the united states.--The term `waters of \n        the United States' means all waters subject to the ebb and flow \n        of the tide, the territorial seas, and all interstate and \n        intrastate waters and their tributaries, including lakes, \n        rivers, streams (including intermittent streams), mudflats, \n        sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, \n        playa lakes, natural ponds, and all impoundments of the \n        foregoing, to the fullest extent that these waters, or \n        activities affecting these waters, are subject to the \n        legislative power of Congress under the Constitution.''.\n\nSEC. 5. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.\n\n    The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) is \namended--\n            (1) by striking ``navigable waters of the United States'' \n        each place it appears and inserting ``waters of the United \n        States'';\n            (2) in section 304(l)(1) by striking ``navigable waters'' \n        in the heading and inserting ``waters of the united states''; \n        and\n            (3) by striking ``navigable waters'' each place it appears \n        and inserting ``waters of the United States''."
