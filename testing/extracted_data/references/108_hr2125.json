FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The teenage years are a pivotal time of life, when \n        young people are making choices that will affect them for the \n        rest of their lives.\n            (2) The ways in which young people spend their time during \n        their teenage years may set them on a course of active \n        citizenship and engaged learning, or down a path of risky \n        behavior with the likelihood of failure.\n            (3) Research suggests that when young people see that they \n        are able to improve the lives of others they feel that they are \n        able to control and improve their own lives.\n            (4) If properly trained, organized, and supervised, \n        teenagers are a resource that can make a significant \n        contribution to their communities.\n            (5) Opportunities for volunteer service during the teenage \n        years could become a rite of passage for future generations.\n            (6) The National Academy of Sciences Report on Youth \n        Development concluded that ``the future well-being of the \n        country depends on raising generations of skilled, competent, \n        and responsible adults''.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) create a national network of service programs for \n        middle school students to serve in their communities after \n        school and during the summer;\n            (2) provide students with opportunities to serve in their \n        communities and participate in other programs such as workshops \n        in leadership development, public speaking, conflict \n        resolution, team-building, and other character-building \n        programs;\n            (3) provide young people an experience that reinforces \n        their connection to the community, enriches their education, \n        and strengthens their personal and civic values; and\n            (4) instill an ethic of service in young people which will \n        stay with them throughout their lifetimes.\n\nSEC. 3.
