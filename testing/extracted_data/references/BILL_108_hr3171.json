FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Benjamin Franklin stated: ``Those who would give up \n        essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, \n        deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.''.\n            (2) The First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth \n        Amendments to the United States Constitution were established \n        to protect the civil rights and liberties of all Americans in \n        perpetuity.\n            (3) Federal policies adopted since September 11, 2001, \n        including provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act (Public Law 107-56) \n        and related executive orders, regulations, and actions threaten \n        fundamental rights and liberties, including the First, Fourth, \n        Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the \n        Constitution by--\n                    (A) authorizing the indefinite incarceration of \n                noncitizens based on mere suspicion, and the indefinite \n                incarceration of citizens designated by the President \n                as ``enemy combatants'' without access to counsel or \n                meaningful recourse to the Federal courts;\n                    (B) limiting the traditional authority of Federal \n                courts to curb law enforcement abuse of electronic \n                surveillance in antiterrorism investigations and \n                ordinary criminal investigations;\n                    (C) expanding the authority of Federal agents to \n                conduct so-called ``sneak and peek'' or ``black bag'' \n                searches, in which the subject of the search warrant is \n                unaware that his or her property has been searched;\n                    (D) granting law enforcement and intelligence \n                agencies broad access to personal medical, financial, \n                library, and education records with little if any \n                judicial oversight;\n                    (E) chilling constitutionally protected speech \n                through overbroad definitions of ``terrorism'';\n                    (F) creating divisions between immigrant \n                communities and the police that protect them by \n                encouraging involvement of State and local police in \n                enforcement of Federal immigration law; and the police \n                that protect them;\n                    (G) permitting the FBI to conduct surveillance of \n                religious services, internet chatrooms, political \n                demonstrations, and other public meetings of any kind \n                without having any evidence that a crime has been or \n                may be committed; and\n                    (H) mandating the closure of certain immigration \n                removal hearings, including denying judges the \n                authority to reject stays of release where bond has \n                been ordered and denying noncitizens the right to a \n                bond hearing.\n            (4) Future legislation, such as legislation drafted \n        entitled the Domestic Security Enhancement Act (DSEA) or \n        PATRIOT II, contains a multitude of new and sweeping law \n        enforcement and intelligence gathering powers many of which are \n        not related to terrorism, and would severely dilute and \n        undermine many basic constitutional rights as well as disturb \n        our unique system of checks and balances by--\n                    (A) diminishing personal privacy by removing \n                important checks on government surveillance authority;\n                    (B) reducing the accountability of government to \n                the public by increasing government secrecy;\n                    (C) expanding the definition of ``terrorism'' in a \n                manner that threatens the constitutionally protected \n                rights of Americans; and\n                    (D) seriously eroding the right of all persons to \n                due process of law.\n            (5) The above new and unprecedented powers pose threats to \n        all Americans and particularly to the civil rights and \n        liberties of the residents of our Nation who are Arab, Muslim, \n        or of South Asian descent.\n\nSEC. 3.
