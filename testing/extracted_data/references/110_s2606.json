    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n    This subtitle may be cited as the ``United States Fire \nAdministration Reauthorization Act of 2008''.\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) The number of lives lost each year because of fire has \n    dropped significantly over the last 25 years in the United States. \n    However, the United States still has one of the highest fire death \n    rates in the industrialized world. In 2006, the National Fire \n    Protection Association reported 3,245 civilian fire deaths, 16,400 \n    civilian fire injuries, and $11,307,000,000 in direct losses due to \n    fire.\n        (2) Every year, more than 100 firefighters die in the line of \n    duty. The United States Fire Administration should continue its \n    leadership to help local fire agencies dramatically reduce these \n    fatalities.\n        (3) The Federal Government should continue to work with State \n    and local governments and the fire service community to further the \n    promotion of national voluntary consensus standards that increase \n    firefighter safety.\n        (4) The United States Fire Administration provides crucial \n    support to the 30,300 fire departments of the United States through \n    training, emergency incident data collection, fire awareness and \n    education, and support of research and development activities for \n    fire prevention, control, and suppression technologies.\n        (5) The collection of data on fire and other emergency \n    incidents is a vital tool both for policy makers and emergency \n    responders to identify and develop responses to emerging hazards. \n    Improving the data collection capabilities of the United States \n    Fire Administration is essential for accurately tracking and \n    responding to the magnitude and nature of the fire problems of the \n    United States.\n        (6) The research and development performed by the National \n    Institute of Standards and Technology, the United States Fire \n    Administration, other government agencies, and nongovernmental \n    organizations on fire technologies, techniques, and tools advance \n    the capabilities of the fire service of the United States to \n    suppress and prevent fires.\n        (7) Because of the essential role of the United States Fire \n    Administration and the fire service community in preparing for and \n    responding to national and man-made disasters, the United States \n    Fire Administration should have a prominent place within the \n    Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland \n    Security.\nSEC. 3.
