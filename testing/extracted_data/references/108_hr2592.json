    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be referred to as the ``Healthy America Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States faces a continuing challenge in \n        improving the quality of the Nation's diet as the economic \n        costs of poor nutrition, which contributes to coronary heart \n        disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes, 4 of the 10 leading \n        causes of death, are significant.\n            (2) Consumption of a healthy diet including nutritionally \n        rich fruit and vegetables is essential for normal growth and \n        development, and critical to promoting health and preventing an \n        array of chronic diseases, as an estimated \\1/3\\ of cancer \n        deaths could be prevented by healthy diets.\n            (3) Most children and adults do not meet the recommended \n        guidelines of 5 servings a day of fruit and vegetables, with \n        only 15 percent of elementary students consuming the \n        recommended requirement, and \\1/4\\ of adults.\n            (4) Among needy students, school nutrition programs often \n        provide the primary opportunity for consumption of \n        nutritionally valuable foods.\n            (5) Breakfast is a critical meal for children and provides \n        the nutrition necessary to optimize their learning capacities.\n            (6) The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, \n        Infants, and Children (WIC), designed to safeguard the health \n        of needy women, infants, and children has changed little in \n        nearly 3 decades and does not reflect many current nutritional \n        practices. To enhance the nutritional benefits for this at-risk \n        population, fruits and vegetables should be available under the \n        WIC program.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are:\n            (1) To promote improved nutrition for needy Americans, \n        including women, infants, children, and students, by revising \n        and enhancing Federal nutrition programs to incorporate a \n        greater role for fruits, vegetables, and 100 percent juice \n        products.\n            (2) To extend, expand, and enhance Federal nutrition \n        policies that recognize and directly encourage consumption of \n        fruits, vegetables, and juices as critical to promoting health \n        and preventing an array of chronic diseases.\n            (3) To develop nutrition policies that increase awareness \n        and understanding of the benefits provided by fruits and \n        vegetables with respect to disease prevention and health \n        promotion, as fruit and vegetable consumption is an important \n        component of a balanced diet.\n            (4) To elevate the Federal government's investment in \n        nutrition program priorities to better address the significant \n        role fruit and vegetables play in health promotion and disease \n        prevention for the neediest Americans.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act--\n            (1) the term ``fruit and vegetables'' means fruits and \n        vegetables that meet the guidelines developed by the National \n        Cancer Institute and Produce for Better Health Foundation for \n        the 5 A Day for Better Health program; and nuts\n            (2) the term ``juice'' means 100 percent juice or juice \n        concentrate, without added fat or sugar.\n\nSEC. 4. SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Availability of Fruits and Juices.--Section 4(e) of the Child \nNutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1773(e)) is amended by adding at the \nend of paragraph (1)(A) the following: ``The Secretary shall require \nthat schools participating in the school breakfast program under this \nsection shall make available fruits and 100 percent juices, regardless \nof menu planning options.''.\n    (b) Commodities Purchase Program for Breakfasts.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 6(c) of the Richard B.
