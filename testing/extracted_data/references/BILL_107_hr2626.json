FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) reliable, affordable, increasingly clean electricity \n        will continue to power the growing United States economy;\n            (2) an increasing use of electrotechnologies, the desire \n        for continuous environmental improvement, a more competitive \n        electricity market, and concerns about rising energy prices add \n        importance to the need for reliable, affordable, increasingly \n        clean electricity;\n            (3) coal, which, as of the date of enactment of this Act, \n        accounts for more than \\1/2\\ of all electricity generated in \n        the United States, is the most abundant fossil energy resource \n        of the United States;\n            (4) coal comprises more than 85 percent of all fossil \n        resources in the United States and exists in quantities \n        sufficient to supply the United States for 250 years at current \n        usage rates;\n            (5) investments in electricity generating facility \n        emissions control technology over the past 30 years have \n        reduced the aggregate emissions of pollutants from coal-based \n        generating facilities by 21 percent, even as coal use for \n        electricity generation has nearly tripled; and\n            (6) continued environmental improvement in coal-based \n        generation through continued research, development, \n        demonstration, and commercial application toward an ultimate \n        goal of near-zero emissions is important and desirable.\n\nSEC. 3. CLEAN COAL POWER INITIATIVE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy (in this Act referred to \nas the ``Secretary'') shall carry out a program of research on and \ndevelopment, demonstration, and commercial application of clean coal \ntechnologies under--\n            (1) this Act;\n            (2) the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development \n        Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5901 et seq.);\n            (3) the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5801 \n        et seq.); and\n            (4) title XIII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. \n        13331 et seq.).\n    (b) Conditions.--The research, development, demonstration, and \ncommercial application program described in subsection (a) shall be \ndesigned to achieve cost and performance-based goals established by the \nSecretary under section 4.\n\nSEC. 4. COST AND PERFORMANCE-BASED GOALS.\n\n    (a) Review and Assessment.--The Secretary shall perform an \nassessment that establishes measurable cost and performance-based goals \nfor 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 for the programs authorized by this Act. \nSuch assessment shall be based on the latest scientific and technical \nknowledge, and shall also take into consideration, as appropriate, the \ncomparative environmental impacts (including emissions of greenhouse \ngases) of the energy saved or produced by specific programs.\n    (b) Consultation.--In establishing the measurable cost and \nperformance-based goals under subsection (a), the Secretary shall \nconsult with the private sector, institutions of higher learning, \nnational laboratories, environmental organizations, professional and \ntechnical societies, and any other persons as the Secretary considers \nappropriate.\n    (c) Schedule.--The Secretary shall--\n            (1) issue and publish in the Federal Register a set of \n        draft measurable cost and performance-based goals for the \n        programs authorized by this Act for public comment--\n                    (A) in the case of a program established before the \n                date of the enactment of this Act, not later than 120 \n                days after the date of the enactment of this Act; and\n                    (B) in the case of a program not established before \n                the date of the enactment of this Act, not later than \n                120 days after the date of establishment of the \n                program;\n            (2) not later than 60 days after the date of publication \n        under paragraph (1), after taking into consideration any public \n        comments received, transmit to the Congress and publish in the \n        Federal Register the final measurable cost and performance-\n        based goals; and\n            (3) update all such cost and performance-based goals on a \n        biennial basis.\n\nSEC. 5.

PROJECT CRITERIA.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall not provide funding for any \nresearch, development, demonstration, or commercial application of coal \nand related technologies that do not advance efficiency, environmental \nperformance, and cost competitiveness well beyond the level of \ntechnologies that are in operation or have been demonstrated as of the \ndate of the enactment of this Act.\n    (b) Technical Criteria for Clean Coal Power Initiative.--\n            (1) Sequestration and gasification.--(A) In allocating the \n        funds authorized under section 5(a), the Secretary shall ensure \n        that at least 80 percent of the funds are used only for \n        projects on carbon sequestration, or coal-based gasification \n        technologies, including gasification combined cycle, \n        gasification fuel cells, gasification coproduction and hybrid \n        gasification/combustion.\n            (B) The Secretary shall set technical milestones specifying \n        emissions levels that coal gasification projects must be \n        designed to and reasonably expected to achieve. The milestones \n        shall get more restrictive through the life of the program. The \n        milestones shall be designed to achieve by 2020 coal \n        gasification projects able--\n                    (i) to remove 99 percent of sulfur dioxide;\n                    (ii) to emit no more than .05 lbs of NOx per \n                million BTU;\n                    (iii) to remove 95 percent of mercury; and\n                    (iv) to achieve a thermal efficiency of 60 percent \n                (higher heating value).\n            (2) Other projects.--For projects not described in \n        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall set technical milestones \n        specifying emissions levels that the projects must be designed \n        to and reasonably expected to achieve. The milestones shall get \n        more restrictive through the life of the program. The \n        milestones shall be designed to achieve by 2010 projects able--\n                    (A) to remove 97 percent of sulfur dioxide;\n                    (B) to emit no more than .08 lbs of NOx per million \n                BTU;\n                    (C) to remove 90 percent of mercury; and\n                    (D) to achieve a thermal efficiency of 45 percent \n                (higher heating value).\n    (c) Financial Criteria.--The Secretary shall not provide a funding \naward for any research, development, demonstration, or commercial \napplication of coal and related technologies unless the recipient of \nthe award has documented to the satisfaction of the Secretary that--\n            (1) the award recipient is financially viable without the \n        receipt of additional Federal funding;\n            (2) the recipient will provide sufficient information to \n        the Secretary for the Secretary to ensure that the award funds \n        are spent efficiently and effectively; and\n            (3) a market exists for the technology being demonstrated \n        or applied, as evidenced by statements of interest in writing \n        from potential purchasers of the technology.\n    (d) Federal Share.--The Federal share of the cost of a coal or \nrelated technology project funded by the Secretary shall not exceed 50 \npercent."
