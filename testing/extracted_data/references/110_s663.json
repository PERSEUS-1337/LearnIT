    "content": "SECTION 1. MODIFICATION OF SCHEME FOR PAYMENT OF DEATH GRATUITY PAYABLE \n              WITH RESPECT TO MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The death gratuity authorized under sections 1475 to \n        1480 of title 10, United States Code, was intended, when \n        originally enacted to provide an immediate cash payment to \n        assist survivors of deceased members of the Armed Forces to \n        meet their financial needs during the period immediately \n        following a member's death and before other survivor benefits \n        become available.\n            (2) The death gratuity, when first implemented in 1908, \n        amounted to six months of a service member's pay and, until \n        1991, could not exceed $3,000.\n            (3) However, following the attacks of September 11, 2001, \n        and the initiation of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation \n        Iraqi Freedom, Congress determined that the death benefits \n        available to survivors of members of the Armed Forces should be \n        substantially increased.\n            (4) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n        2006, which was enacted on January 6, 2006, as Public Law 109-\n        163, increased the amount of the death gratuity to $100,000, \n        effective retroactively to October 7, 2001.\n            (5) Under section 1477 of title 10, United States Code, the \n        law authorizing the death gratuity, those living relatives of \n        deceased members of the Armed Forces who shall receive the \n        death gratuity are specifically designated. Service members are \n        not provided with the opportunity to make an election choosing \n        a beneficiary other than those set forth in section 1477 of \n        title 10, United States Code.\n            (6) The increased death gratuity, in combination with \n        benefits available under the Servicemembers' Group Life \n        Insurance program, the Survivor Benefit Plan, and Dependency \n        and Indemnity Compensation provide significant support and \n        compensation to the next of kin of deceased members of the \n        Armed Forces. Individual members are best qualified to \n        determine who the beneficiaries for death benefits should be \n        and should be afforded the opportunity to make these selections \n        at appropriate times throughout military service and \n        particularly prior to mobilization or deployment to a combat \n        zone.\n            (7) Under the current system, many members of the Armed \n        Forces have designated individuals as beneficiaries for the \n        death gratuity in a manner not provided for by law. In these \n        cases, the wishes of these members regarding the disposition of \n        the death gratuity has in many cases not been implemented, to \n        the detriment of their children and other loved ones.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that all \nmembers of the Armed Forces should be given the opportunity to \naffirmatively select who shall receive the death gratuity and that the \nSecretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the military departments \nshould take prompt action to afford members the opportunity to make an \nelection in writing about the disposition of the death gratuity \nproceeds and to provide appropriate and timely counseling about the \nmanner in which the proceeds of the death gratuity and other forms of \ninsurance will be administered.\n    (c) Modification.--\n            (1) In general.--Subsection (a) of section 1477 of title \n        10, United States Code, is amended by striking all that follows \n        ``on the following list:'' and inserting the following:\n            ``(1) To any individual designated by the person in \n        writing.\n            ``(2) If there is no person so designated, to the surviving \n        spouse of the person.\n            ``(3) If there is none of the above, to the children (as \n        prescribed by subsection (b)) of the person and the descendants \n        of any deceased children by representation.\n            ``(4) If there is none of the above, to the parents (as \n        prescribed by subsection (c)) of the person or the survivor of \n        them.\n            ``(5) If there is none of the above, to the duly appointed \n        executor or administrator of the estate of the person.\n            ``(6) If there is none of the above, to other next of kin \n        of the person entitled under the laws of domicile of the person \n        at the time of the person's death.''.\n            (2) Conforming amendments.--Such section is further \n        amended--\n                    (A) in subsection (b), by striking ``Subsection \n                (a)(2)'' in the matter preceding paragraph (1) and \n                inserting ``Subsection (a)(3)'';\n                    (B) by striking (c) and inserting the following new \n                subsection (c):\n    ``(c) For purposes of subsection (a)(4), parents include fathers \nand mothers through adoption. However, only one father and one mother \nmay be recognized in any case, and preference shall be given to those \nwho exercised a parental relationship on the date, or most nearly \nbefore the date, on which the decedent entered a status described in \nsection 1475 or 1476 of this title.''; and\n                    (C) by striking subsection (d).\n            (3) Effective date.--The amendments made by this subsection \n        shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n            (4) Applicability.--Notwithstanding paragraph (3), the \n        provisions of section 1477 of title 10, United States Code, as \n        in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this \n        Act, shall continue to apply to each member of the Armed Forces \n        covered by such section until the earlier of the following--\n                    (A) the date on which such member makes the \n                designation contemplated by paragraph (1) of section \n                1477(a) of such title (as amended by paragraph (1) of \n                this subsection); or\n                    (B) January 1, 2008.\n    (d) Regulations.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than April 1, 2007, the \n        Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to implement \n        the amendments to section 1477 of title 10, United States Code, \n        made by subsection (c).\n            (2) Elements.--The regulations required by paragraph (1) \n        shall include forms for the making of the designation \n        contemplated by paragraph (1) of section 1477(a) of title 10, \n        United States Code (as amended by subsection (c)), and \n        instructions for members of the Armed Forces in the filling out \n        of such forms."
