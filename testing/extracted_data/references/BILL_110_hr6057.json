FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Americans cherish healthy oceans and wildlife that \n        marine ecosystems support, and feel a strong moral \n        responsibility to protect these resources for the benefit of \n        current and future generations.\n            (2) The marine ecosystems and coastal habitats of the \n        Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, along Alaska's northern and \n        northwestern shores, provide habitat for a large array of \n        wildlife, including endangered bowhead whales, beluga whales, \n        polar bears, threatened spectacled eiders, threatened Steller's \n        eiders, walrus, seals, and fish.\n            (3) These ecosystems and wildlife they support are vital to \n        the survival of the subsistence cultures of the Alaska Native \n        peoples of the North Slope and have been for thousands upon \n        thousands of years.\n            (4) There is a wide consensus among scientists that the \n        Arctic is undergoing dramatic changes due to climate change, \n        and that these changes are affecting vital sea ice habitat for \n        a number of species, including polar bears, walrus, and seals.\n            (5) In January 2007, the United States Fish and Wildlife \n        Service proposed listing the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) as a \n        threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. \n        The polar bear depends on sea ice as a platform to hunt seals, \n        its primary food, and projected loss of sea ice due to global \n        warming was believed to jeopardize polar bears throughout their \n        range.\n            (6) On January 9, 2008, the Department of the Interior \n        missed the legal deadline to make a final rule on whether to \n        provide Endangered Species Act of 1973 protections to the polar \n        bear.\n            (7) On February 6, 2008, the Department of the Interior \n        moved forward with oil and gas leasing in the Chukchi Sea Lease \n        Sale 193 area, which contains about 29.4 million acres offshore \n        Alaska from north of Point Barrow to northwest of Cape \n        Lisburne, which is polar bear habitat.\n            (8) On April 19, 2008, a United States District Court Judge \n        ruled that the Department of the Interior must make a decision \n        on whether to list the polar bear under the Endangered Species \n        Act of 1973 by May 15, 2008.\n            (9) In September 2007, the United States Geological Survey \n        issued a series of reports that projected changes in future sea \n        ice conditions, if realized, will result in loss of \n        approximately \\2/3\\ of the world's current polar bear \n        population by the middle of the 21st century and extirpation of \n        polar bears in Alaska. The agency also concluded that because \n        the observed trajectory of Arctic sea ice decline appears to be \n        underestimated by currently available models, this assessment \n        of future polar bear status may be conservative.\n            (10) While the major threat to polar bears is global \n        warming, resulting from continuing emissions of green house \n        gases, potential oil and gas development in the Beaufort and \n        Chukchi Seas poses additional risks to polar bears and other \n        marine life in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas.\n            (11) There is currently no effective means to recover \n        spilled oil in the harsh environment of the Beaufort and \n        Chukchi Seas, especially during periods of solid and broken \n        ice.\n            (12) The Minerals Management Service's 2007-2012 OCS \n        leasing plan anticipates offering 40 million acres of the \n        Chukchi Sea for lease and expanding leasing in the Beaufort Sea \n        to 33 million acres. All of this area overlaps with vital polar \n        bear habitat.\n            (13) In the environmental impact statement for the first of \n        five lease sales planned for the current 5-year OCS leasing \n        plan in the Arctic Ocean, Lease Sale 193 in the Chukchi Sea, \n        the Minerals Management Service concludes that the effects of a \n        large oil spill, particularly during the broken-ice period, \n        could pose significant risks to the polar bear population, and \n        that a large oil spill could have significant impacts on other \n        marine mammals including whales and walruses. In the same \n        document the agency states that there was a lack of information \n        on marine mammal ecology, and habitat use.\n            (14) In addition, onshore industrial development activities \n        necessary to support offshore oil and gas development can \n        damage important habitat and cause harmful disturbance of \n        denning polar bears, and other wildlife.\n            (15) Because of the threats oil and gas development poses \n        to subsistence resources, public health, and survival of their \n        culture, tribal governments, including the Native Village of \n        Point Hope, the Native Village of Barrow, the Inupiat Community \n        of the Arctic Slope, and the Alaska Intertribal Council, have \n        expressed opposition to offshore oil and gas development in the \n        Beaufort and Chukchi Seas.\n\nSEC. 3.
