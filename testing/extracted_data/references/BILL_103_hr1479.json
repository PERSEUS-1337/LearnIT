FINDINGS, PURPOSE, DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) fossil fuels, the main energy source of the present, \n        have provided this country with tremendous supply, but are \n        limited and polluting, and their production and utilization \n        technologies are mature;\n            (2) the basic scientific fundamentals are needed for \n        private sector investment in and commercialization of new and \n        better energy sources and enabling technologies;\n            (3) hydrogen holds tremendous promise as a new and better \n        energy source as it secures an infinite supply from water and \n        combusts purely to water;\n            (4) under current technological capability, the energy \n        required to produce hydrogen is greater than the potential \n        energy of the hydrogen produced;\n            (5) the hydrogen production efficiency dilemma is the major \n        technical barrier to society collectively benefiting from one \n        of the great energy sources of the future;\n            (6) an aggressive, results-oriented multiyear research \n        initiative on efficient hydrogen fuel production and use is in \n        order;\n            (7) the current $4,500,000 per year Federal effort is \n        wholly inadequate to the technically daunting task at hand;\n            (8) an annual $100,000,000 multiyear authorization offset \n        by a reallocation of resources from more mature fossil \n        technologies is justified; and\n            (9) the national interest demands the acceleration of \n        research, development, and demonstration efforts that will make \n        possible the near-term commercial introduction of hydrogen into \n        the current energy consumption system in order to increase \n        supply to support economic growth, decrease airborne emissions \n        from mobile and stationary sources, improve fuel efficiency, \n        and invigorate industries that can develop hydrogen enabling \n        technologies that will lead to new markets and jobs, and that \n        will provide stimulus for the transfer of information and \n        relevant technology from the space and aerospace industries to \n        the broader energy and transportation market.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the Act is to provide the fundamental \nscientific basis to support the development of commercial, economically \nfeasible technologies for the production and use of hydrogen as a zero- \nor low-emission power source on a national scale by the year 1998.\n    (c) Definitions.--As used in this Act--\n            (1) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Energy;\n            (2) the term ``United States'' means the several States, \n        the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the \n        United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the \n        Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and any other \n        territory or possession of the United States; and\n            (3) the term ``United States company'' means a business \n        entity that is incorporated in the United States and that \n        conducts business operations in the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
