FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) \n        2017 National Drug Threat Assessment, transnational criminal \n        organizations are increasingly using virtual currencies.\n            (2) The Treasury Department has recognized that: ``The \n        development of virtual currencies is an attempt to meet a \n        legitimate market demand. According to a Federal Reserve Bank \n        of Chicago economist, United States consumers want payment \n        options that are versatile and that provide immediate finality. \n        No United States payment method meets that description, \n        although cash may come closest. Virtual currencies can mimic \n        cash's immediate finality and anonymity and are more versatile \n        than cash for online and cross-border transactions, making \n        virtual currencies vulnerable for illicit transactions.''.\n            (3) Virtual currencies have become a prominent method to \n        pay for goods and services associated with illegal sex \n        trafficking and drug trafficking, which are two of the most \n        detrimental and troubling illegal activities facilitated by \n        online marketplaces.\n            (4) Online marketplaces, including the dark web, have \n        become a prominent platform to buy, sell, and advertise for \n        illicit goods and services associated with sex trafficking and \n        drug trafficking.\n            (5) According to the International Labour Organization, in \n        2016, 4.8 million people in the world were victims of forced \n        sexual exploitation, and in 2014, the global profit from \n        commercial sexual exploitation was $99 billion.\n            (6) In 2016, within the United States, the Center for \n        Disease Control estimated that there were 64,000 deaths related \n        to drug overdose, and the most severe increase in drug \n        overdoses were those associated with fentanyl and fentanyl \n        analogs (synthetic opioids), which amounted to over 20,000 \n        overdose deaths.\n            (7) According to the United States Department of the \n        Treasury 2015 National Money Laundering Risk Assessment, an \n        estimated $64 billion is generated annually from United States \n        drug trafficking sales.\n            (8) Illegal fentanyl in the United States originates \n        primarily from China, and it is readily available to purchase \n        through online marketplaces.\n\nSEC. 3. GAO STUDY.\n\n    (a) Study Required.--The Comptroller General of the United States \nshall conduct a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces \nare used to facilitate sex and drug trafficking. The study shall \nconsider--\n            (1) how online marketplaces, including the dark web, are \n        being used as platforms to buy, sell, or facilitate the \n        financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking \n        or drug trafficking (specifically, opioids and synthetic \n        opioids, including fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and any \n        precursor chemicals associated with manufacturing fentanyl or \n        fentanyl analogs) destined for, originating from, or within the \n        United States;\n            (2) how financial payment methods, including virtual \n        currencies and peer-to-peer mobile payment services, are being \n        utilized by online marketplaces to facilitate the buying, \n        selling, or financing of goods and services associated with sex \n        or drug trafficking destined for, originating from, or within \n        the United States;\n            (3) how virtual currencies are being used to facilitate the \n        buying, selling, or financing of goods and services associated \n        with sex or drug trafficking, destined for, originating from, \n        or within the United States, when an online platform is not \n        otherwise involved;\n            (4) how illicit funds that have been transmitted online and \n        through virtual currencies are repatriated into the formal \n        banking system of the United States through money laundering or \n        other means;\n            (5) the participants (state and non-state actors) \n        throughout the entire supply chain that participate in or \n        benefit from the buying, selling, or financing of goods and \n        services associated with sex or drug trafficking (either \n        through online marketplaces or virtual currencies) destined \n        for, originating from, or within the United States;\n            (6) Federal and State agency efforts to impede the buying, \n        selling, or financing of goods and services associated with sex \n        or drug trafficking destined for, originating from, or within \n        the United States, including efforts to prevent the proceeds \n        from sex or drug trafficking from entering the United States \n        banking system;\n            (7) how virtual currencies and their underlying \n        technologies can be used to detect and deter these illicit \n        activities; and\n            (8) to what extent can the immutable and traceable nature \n        of virtual currencies contribute to the tracking and \n        prosecution of illicit funding.\n    (b) Scope.--For the purposes of the study required under subsection \n(a), the term ``sex trafficking'' means the recruitment, harboring, \ntransportation, provision, obtaining, patronizing, or soliciting of a \nperson for the purpose of a commercial sex act that is induced by \nforce, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform \nsuch act has not attained 18 years of age.\n    (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States \nshall submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of \nthe Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of \nRepresentatives a report summarizing the results of the study required \nunder subsection (a), together with any recommendations for legislative \nor regulatory action that would improve the efforts of Federal agencies \nto impede the use of virtual currencies and online marketplaces in \nfacilitating sex and drug trafficking."
