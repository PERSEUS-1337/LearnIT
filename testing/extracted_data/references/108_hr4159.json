FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) driving under the influence of, or after having used, \n        illegal drugs has become a significant problem worldwide;\n            (2) in 2002, over 35,000,000 persons in the United States \n        aged 12 or older had used illegal drugs in the past year and \n        almost 11,000,000 of these persons (5 percent of the total \n        population of the United States aged 12 or older and 31 percent \n        of past year illicit drug users) had driven under the influence \n        of, or after having used, illegal drugs in the past year;\n            (3) research has established that abuse of a number of \n        drugs can impair driving performance;\n            (4) according to the National Highway Traffic Safety \n        Administration, illegal drugs (often in combination with \n        alcohol) are used by approximately 10 to 22 percent of drivers \n        involved in all motor vehicles crashes;\n            (5) drug impaired drivers are less frequently detected, \n        prosecuted, or referred to treatment than drunk drivers;\n            (6) there is a lack of uniformity or consistency in the way \n        the 50 States approach drug impaired drivers;\n            (7) too few police officers have been trained to detect \n        drug impaired drivers, and too few prosecutors have been \n        trained to prove drug impaired driving cases beyond a \n        reasonable doubt;\n            (8) per se drug impaired driving laws, like those used for \n        driving under the influence of alcohol, are feasible and \n        represent a sound strategy for dealing with drug impaired \n        drivers and can assist in the prosecution of drug impaired \n        driving offenders; and\n            (9) while it is illegal in all States to drive a motor \n        vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, drugs other than \n        alcohol, or a combination of alcohol and other drugs, there is \n        no consistent method across States for identifying drug \n        impairment and the presence of drugs in the body.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to provide a model for States to implement and enforce \n        a drug impaired driving statute;\n            (2) to ensure drivers in need of drug education or \n        treatment are identified and provided with the appropriate \n        assistance;\n            (3) to advance research and development of testing \n        mechanisms and knowledge about drugged driving and its impact \n        on traffic safety; and\n            (4) to enhance the training of traffic safety officers and \n        prosecutors to detect, enforce, and prosecute drug impaired \n        driving laws.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act, the following definitions apply:\n            (1) Controlled substance.--The term ``controlled \n        substance'' includes substances listed in schedules I through V \n        of section 112(e) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n        812(e)).\n            (2) Inhalant.--The term ``inhalant'' means a household or \n        commercial product that can be used by inhaling for \n        intoxicating effect.\n            (3) Drug recognition expert.--The term ``drug recognition \n        expert'' means an individual trained in a specific evaluation \n        procedure that enables the person to determine whether an \n        individual is under the influence of drugs and then to \n        determine the type of drug causing the observable impairment.\n\nSEC. 5.
