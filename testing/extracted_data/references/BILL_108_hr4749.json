Any such waiver shall \n        be limited to the requirements that are impossible or \n        impracticable to implement because of the emergency or \n        exceptional situation. In any case in which the head of an \n        agency waives a requirement under this section with respect to \n        a contract, the agency head shall submit to Congress a report, \n        within 30 days after the date of award of the contract, that \n        describes the contract, the waiver, the emergency or \n        exceptional situation that justified the waiver, and a plan for \n        bringing the contract into compliance with the waived \n        requirements as soon as possible or an explanation of why the \n        waiver needs to be permanent.\n            (6) FAR revisions.--Not later than 120 days after the date \n        of the enactment of this Act, the Federal Acquisition \n        Regulation shall be revised to implement the provisions of this \n        subsection.\n    (b) Requirements of the Secretary of Defense Relating to Contracts \nWith Private Security Contractors.--\n            (1) Hiring standards relating to private security \n        contractors.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \n        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall prescribe \n        in regulations minimum standards for the persons that private \n        security contractors may hire for the performance of any \n        covered contract. The standards may vary based on the duties of \n        personnel, but must address past criminal activity, security \n        clearance requirements, and other issues the Secretary \n        determines may lead to security or performance concerns.\n            (2) Comparative analysis.--Before a Federal agency enters \n        into a covered contract, the Secretary of Defense shall perform \n        a cost and effectiveness analysis for every category of \n        potential activity that may be carried out by the private \n        security contractor under the contract, comparing the cost and \n        effectiveness that would be associated with the same activities \n        being carried out by civilian employees of the Department of \n        Defense or members of the Armed Forces. The Secretary shall \n        ensure, as part of the analysis, that the overall military \n        mission would not be significantly affected if the contractor \n        personnel refused to perform work as required under the \n        contract.\n    (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Covered contracts.--The term ``covered contract'' means \n        a contract entered into by the Federal Government with a \n        private security contractor, except that, in the case of a task \n        or delivery order contract entered into by the Federal \n        Government with a private security contractor, the term means a \n        task order issued under the contract.\n            (2) Private security contractor.--The term ``private \n        security contractor'' means any entity under contract with the \n        Federal Government--\n                    (A) whose personnel are allowed to carry weapons as \n                part of their contract; or\n                    (B) that uses persons who perform one or more of \n                the following duties:\n                            (i) Military logistics and maintenance.\n                            (ii) Interrogation of prisoners.\n                            (iii) Convoy security.\n                            (iv) Guarding vital facilities and \n                        personnel.\n                            (v) Intelligence gathering and analysis.\n                            (vi) Tactical security work.\n                            (vii) Local force training.\n    (d) Effective Date.--This section shall apply to covered contracts \nentered into on or after the date occurring 60 days after the date of \nthe enactment of this Act."
