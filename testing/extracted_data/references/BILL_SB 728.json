    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 399.15 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:\n399.15.\n(a) In order to fulfill unmet long-term resource needs, the commission shall establish a renewables portfolio standard requiring all retail sellers to procure a minimum quantity of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources as a specified percentage of total kilowatthours sold to their retail end-use customers each compliance period to achieve the targets established under this article. For any retail seller procuring at least 14 percent of retail sales from eligible renewable energy resources in 2010, the deficits associated with any previous renewables portfolio standard shall not be added to any procurement requirement pursuant to this article.\n(b) The commission shall implement renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements only as follows:\n(1) Each retail seller shall procure a minimum quantity of eligible renewable energy resources for each of the following compliance periods:\n(A) January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013, inclusive.\n(B) January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016, inclusive.\n(C) January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2020, inclusive.\n(2) (A) No later than January 1, 2012, the commission shall establish the quantity of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources to be procured by the retail seller for each compliance period. These quantities shall be established in the same manner for all retail sellers and result in the same percentages used to establish compliance period quantities for all retail sellers.\n(B) In establishing quantities for the compliance period from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013, inclusive, the commission shall require procurement for each retail seller equal to an average of 20 percent of retail sales. For the following compliance periods, the quantities shall reflect reasonable progress in each of the intervening years sufficient to ensure that the procurement of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources achieves 25 percent of retail sales by December 31, 2016, and 33 percent of retail sales by December 31, 2020. The commission shall require retail sellers to procure not less than 33 percent of retail sales of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources in all subsequent years.\n(C) Retail sellers shall be obligated to procure no less than the quantities associated with all intervening years by the end of each compliance period. Retail sellers shall not be required to demonstrate a specific quantity of procurement for any individual intervening year.\n(3) The commission may require the procurement of eligible renewable energy resources in excess of the quantities specified in paragraph (2). The commission shall evaluate the\neconomic impacts\nbenefits and costs to the California economy, including\nupon low- and middle-income individuals and families\nand disadvantaged communities,\nbefore exercise of its authority pursuant to this paragraph to increase the procurement of eligible renewable energy resources. In performing its evaluation, the commission shall conduct duly noticed public workshops throughout the state to allow for public comment and consideration of the economic findings. These workshops shall be completed not less than 60 days prior to consideration by the commission of a rule that would require procurement of eligible renewable energy resources in excess of the quantities specified in paragraph (2).\n(4) Only for purposes of establishing the renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements of paragraph (1) and determining the quantities pursuant to paragraph (2), the commission shall include all electricity sold to retail customers by the Department of Water Resources pursuant to Division 27 (commencing with Section 80000) of the Water Code in the calculation of retail sales by an electrical corporation.\n(5) The commission shall waive enforcement of this section if it finds that the retail seller has demonstrated any of the following conditions are beyond the control of the retail seller and will prevent compliance:\n(A) There is inadequate transmission capacity to allow for sufficient electricity to be delivered from proposed eligible renewable energy resource projects using the current operational protocols of the Independent System Operator. In making its findings relative to the existence of this condition with respect to a retail seller that owns transmission lines, the commission shall consider both of the following:\n(i) Whether the retail seller has undertaken, in a timely fashion, reasonable measures under its control and consistent with its obligations under local, state, and federal laws and regulations, to develop and construct new transmission lines or upgrades to existing lines intended to transmit electricity generated by eligible renewable energy resources. In determining the reasonableness of a retail seller\u2019s actions, the commission shall consider the retail seller\u2019s expectations for full-cost recovery for these transmission lines and upgrades.\n(ii) Whether the retail seller has taken all reasonable operational measures to maximize cost-effective deliveries of electricity from eligible renewable energy resources in advance of transmission availability.\n(B) Permitting, interconnection, or other circumstances that delay procured eligible renewable energy resource projects, or there is an insufficient supply of eligible renewable energy resources available to the retail seller. In making a finding that this condition prevents timely compliance, the commission shall consider whether the retail seller has done all of the following:\n(i) Prudently managed portfolio risks, including relying on a sufficient number of viable projects.\n(ii) Sought to develop one of the following: its own eligible renewable energy resources, transmission to interconnect to eligible renewable energy resources, or energy storage used to integrate eligible renewable energy resources. This clause shall not require an electrical corporation to pursue development of eligible renewable energy resources pursuant to Section 399.14.\n(iii) Procured an appropriate minimum margin of procurement above the minimum procurement level necessary to comply with the renewables portfolio standard to compensate for foreseeable delays or insufficient supply.\n(iv) Taken reasonable measures, under the control of the retail seller, to procure cost-effective distributed generation and allowable unbundled renewable energy credits.\n(C) Unanticipated curtailment of eligible renewable energy resources necessary to address the needs of a balancing authority.\n(6) If the commission waives the compliance requirements of this section, the commission shall establish additional reporting requirements on the retail seller to demonstrate that all reasonable actions under the control of the retail seller are taken in each of the intervening years sufficient to satisfy future procurement requirements.\n(7) The commission shall not waive enforcement pursuant to this section, unless the retail seller demonstrates that it has taken all reasonable actions under its control, as set forth in paragraph (5), to achieve full compliance.\n(8) If a retail seller fails to procure sufficient eligible renewable energy resources to comply with a procurement requirement pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) and fails to obtain an order from the commission waiving enforcement pursuant to paragraph (5), the commission shall exercise its authority pursuant to Section 2113.\n(9) Deficits associated with the compliance period shall not be added to a future compliance period.\n(c) The commission shall establish a limitation for each electrical corporation on the procurement expenditures for all eligible renewable energy resources used to comply with the renewables portfolio standard. In establishing this limitation, the commission shall rely on the following:\n(1) The most recent renewable energy procurement plan.\n(2) Procurement expenditures that approximate the expected cost of building, owning, and operating eligible renewable energy resources.\n(3) The potential that some planned resource additions may be delayed or canceled.\n(d) In developing the limitation pursuant to subdivision (c), the commission shall ensure all of the following:\n(1) The limitation is set at a level that prevents disproportionate rate impacts.\n(2) The costs of all procurement credited toward achieving the renewables portfolio standard are counted towards the limitation.\n(3) Procurement expenditures do not include any indirect expenses, including imbalance energy charges, sale of excess energy, decreased generation from existing resources, transmission upgrades, or the costs associated with relicensing any utility-owned hydroelectric facilities.\n(e) (1) No later than January 1, 2016, the commission shall prepare a report to the Legislature assessing whether each electrical corporation can achieve a 33-percent renewables portfolio standard by December 31, 2020, and maintain that level thereafter, within the adopted cost limitations. If the commission determines that it is necessary to change the limitation for procurement costs incurred by any electrical corporation after that date, it may propose a revised cap consistent with the criteria in subdivisions (c) and (d). The proposed modifications shall take effect no earlier than January 1, 2017.\n(2) Notwithstanding Section 10231.5 of the Government Code, the requirement for submitting a report imposed under paragraph (1) is inoperative on January 1, 2021.\n(3) A report to be submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.\n(f) If the cost limitation for an electrical corporation is insufficient to support the projected costs of meeting the renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements, the electrical corporation may refrain from entering into new contracts or constructing facilities beyond the quantity that can be procured within the limitation, unless eligible renewable energy resources can be procured without exceeding a de minimis increase in rates, consistent with the long-term procurement plan established for the electrical corporation pursuant to Section 454.5.\n(g) (1) The commission shall monitor the status of the cost limitation for each electrical corporation in order to ensure compliance with this article.\n(2) If the commission determines that an electrical corporation may exceed its cost limitation prior to achieving the renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements, the commission shall do both of the following within 60 days of making that determination:\n(A) Investigate and identify the reasons why the electrical corporation may exceed its annual cost limitation.\n(B) Notify the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature that the electrical corporation may exceed its cost limitation, and include the reasons why the electrical corporation may exceed its cost limitation.\n(h) The establishment of a renewables portfolio standard shall not constitute implementation by the commission of the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-617)."
