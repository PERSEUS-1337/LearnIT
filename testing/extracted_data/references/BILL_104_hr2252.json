CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the President has set several ambitious national goals \n        to improve education in the United States as part of the \n        America 2000 program;\n            (2) the length of the academic year at most elementary and \n        secondary schools in the United States consists of \n        approximately 175 to 180 academic days while the length of the \n        academic year at elementary and secondary schools in a majority \n        of the other industrialized countries consists of approximately \n        190 to 240 academic days;\n            (3) an international testing organization has found in \n        various studies of 15 developed and less developed countries \n        that secondary students from the United States scored at or \n        near the bottom in geometry, advanced algebra, and calculus;\n            (4) various studies indicate that extending the length of \n        the academic year at elementary and secondary schools results \n        in a significant increase in actual student learning time, even \n        when much of the time in the extended portion of the academic \n        year is used for increased teacher training and increased \n        parent-teacher interaction;\n            (5) extending the length of the academic year at elementary \n        and secondary schools will lessen the need for review at the \n        beginning of an academic year of course material covered in the \n        previous academic year;\n            (6) in 1988 the report entitled ``A Nation At Risk'' \n        recommended that school districts extend the length of the \n        academic year at elementary and secondary schools to 220 \n        academic days and increase the academic day from 6 to 7 hours; \n        and\n            (7) elementary and secondary schools in the United States \n        have increased the number and types of courses they offer \n        students, including health education courses and driver \n        education courses, without increasing the overall amount of \n        time spent for course instruction.\n\nSEC. 2.

and\n            (2) except as provided in subsection (c), such school will \n        provide funds from non-Federal sources, in an amount equal to \n        20 percent of the Federal funds provided in the grant, for the \n        purpose of extending the length of its academic year.\n    (c) Good-Faith Exception.--A secondary school shall be considered \nto have satisfied the requirement of subsection (b)(2) if such school \nmakes a good-faith attempt to satisfy such requirement, as determined \nby the Secretary.\n    (d) Selection Requirements.--The Secretary shall select secondary \nschools to receive grants under subsection (a) which--\n            (1) have submitted an application in accordance with \n        subsection (b);\n            (2) currently have academic years consisting of fewer than \n        200 academic days;\n            (3) to the extent practicable, consist of a high percentage \n        of students from single-parent homes or homes where both \n        parents work; and\n            (4) to the extent practicable, are located in economically \n        depressed communities which have a high percentage of \n        individuals--\n                    (A) with alcohol abuse and other drug abuse \n                problems; and\n                    (B) involved in gang-related activities.\n    (e) Geographic Diversity Requirement.--To the extent practicable, \nthe Secretary shall ensure that grants received by secondary schools \nunder this Act are equitably distributed among the various regions of \nthe United States and among rural and urban areas within such regions.\n    (f) Selection of Replacement Schools.--If any secondary school \nwhich receives a grant under subsection (a) fails to comply with any of \nthe requirements of the demonstration grant program, then the Secretary \nmay select another secondary school which complies with such \nrequirements to replace such school for the remaining number of years \nin such grant.\n    (g) Notification Requirement.--The Secretary shall notify each \nState and local educational agency of a secondary school which receives \na grant under subsection (a) that such school is participating in the \ndemonstration grant program.\n    (h) Study.--The Secretary shall conduct a study which shall--\n            (1) include a test of the students at each secondary school \n        which receives a grant under subsection (a) by measuring the \n        extent to which the extended academic year increased the \n        learning retention of such students;\n            (2) examine the effects of the extended academic year on \n        the learning process of such students in general, including the \n        extent to which the demonstration grant program has--\n                    (A) increased the daily attendance rate and \n                decreased the drop-out rate of such students;\n                    (B) increased the parental involvement at each such \n                school;\n                    (C) increased the number of such students attending \n                post-secondary educational institutions;\n                    (D) positively influenced the behavioral and social \n                skills of such students;
