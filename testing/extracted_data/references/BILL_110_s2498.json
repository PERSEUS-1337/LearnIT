FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Santa Fe, New Mexico, the site of native occupation \n        centuries before European incursions, was officially elevated \n        from a plaza established in 1608 to a villa and capital city in \n        1610. Santa Fe has been the meeting place and home of many \n        cultures.\n            (2) The Palace of the Governors, built in the early 17th \n        century served as the governor's quarters and the seat of \n        government under 3 flags. It is the oldest continuously used \n        public building in the United States.\n            (3) La Fiesta de Santa Fe, a cultural, religious, and \n        social celebration, commemorating the resettlement of Santa Fe \n        by General Don Diego de Vargas in 1692 continues today as an \n        attraction for tourists and locals alike.\n            (4) At the nexus of 3 historically important trails, Santa \n        Fe brought people and goods together over the Santa Fe Trail to \n        and from Missouri, California, and Mexico City.\n            (5) Commerce on the Santa Fe Trail brought a much needed \n        boost to the economy of the American West during the recession \n        of the early 19th century. Santa Fe was the rendezvous place \n        for traders, mountain men and forty-niners on route to \n        California, and is today home to a multicultural citizenry and \n        world class art market.\n            (6) The Santa Fe area is a center of market activity for \n        arts and culture year round, culminating in the world renowned \n        Indian Market, Spanish Colonial Art Market, and International \n        Folk Art Market.\n            (7) New Mexico is the home to the oldest and continuously \n        inhabited indigenous communities in North America. Native \n        communities now residing in New Mexico include--\n                    (A) Acoma Pueblo;\n                    (B) Alamo Navajo Chapter;\n                    (C) Canoncito Navajo Chapter;\n                    (D) Cochiti Pueblo;\n                    (E) Isleta Pueblo;\n                    (F) Jemez Pueblo;\n                    (G) Jicarilla Apache Tribe;\n                    (H) Laguna Pueblo;\n                    (I) Mescalero Apache Tribe;\n                    (J) Nambe Pueblo;\n                    (K) Picuris Pueblo;\n                    (L) Pojoaque Pueblo;\n                    (M) Ramah Navaho Chapter;\n                    (N) San Felipe Pueblo;\n                    (O) San Ildefonso Pueblo;\n                    (P) San Juan Pueblo;\n                    (Q) Sandia Pueblo;\n                    (R) Santa Ana Pueblo;\n                    (S) Santa Clara Pueblo;\n                    (T) Santo Domingo Pueblo;\n                    (U) Taos Pueblo;\n                    (V) Tesuque Pueblo;\n                    (W) Zia Pueblo;\n                    (X) Zuni Pueblo; and\n                    (Y) many others that disappeared or were moved \n                after European contact.\n            (8) The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 is known to be one of the \n        first ``American Revolutions'' when the Pueblo people ousted \n        Spanish colonists from New Mexico.\n            (9) The Santa Fe area has long attracted tourists, artists, \n        and writers. The classic novel Ben Hur was written, in part, by \n        then Governor Lew Wallace, in the Palace of the Governors.\n            (10) A commemorative coin will help to foster an \n        understanding and appreciation of New Mexico, its history and \n        culture and the importance of Santa Fe and New Mexico to the \n        history of the United States and the world.\n\nSEC. 3.
