SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds that--\n            (1) the Commodity Futures Trading Commission should further \n        examine whether speculators are manipulating futures market \n        prices to cause artificial prices that do not reflect the \n        legitimate forces of supply and demand;\n            (2) the public is concerned that trades executed on foreign \n        boards of trade when linked to the prices of contracts traded \n        on U.S. registered entities may need additional oversight;\n            (3) the exclusive Federal regulator of commodity futures \n        markets, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has staffing \n        levels that have dropped to the lowest levels in the 33-year \n        history of the Commission; and\n            (4) the acting Chairman of the Commission has said publicly \n        that an additional 100 employees are needed in light of the \n        inflow of trading volume.\n    (b) Sense of the House.--It is the sense of the House of \nRepresentatives that the President should immediately send to Congress \na request for additional appropriations for fiscal year 2008 for the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission in an amount that is sufficient--\n            (1) to help restore public confidence in commodity futures \n        markets and Federal oversight of those markets;\n            (2) to allow the Commission to reduce the potential threat \n        of market manipulation or congestion by potential imposition of \n        position limitations for speculators should the Commission \n        determine the absence of position limitations for speculators \n        is causing an increase in the price of oil, gasoline, diesel, \n        and other energy commodities;\n            (3) to significantly improve the information technology \n        capabilities of the Commission to help the Commission \n        effectively regulate the commodity futures markets; and\n            (4) to fund at least 100 new full-time positions at the \n        Commission to regulate commodity futures market transactions \n        and to enforce the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 3.
