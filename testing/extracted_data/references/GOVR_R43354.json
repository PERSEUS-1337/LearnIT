    "content": "The Buy American Act is the earliest and arguably the best known of the major domestic content restrictions. On its face, the Buy American Act appears to prohibit federal agencies from acquiring \"foreign\" goods by providing that \"[o]nly unmanufactured articles, materials, and supplies that have been mined or produced in the United States, and only manufactured articles, materials, and supplies that have been manufactured in the United States substantially all from articles, materials, or supplies mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States, shall be purchased for public use.\" As implemented, however, the act is better understood as generally establishing a price preference for domestic end products and construction materials. Specifically, the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) implementing the Buy American Act require that, when a domestic offer (i.e., an offer of a domestic end product) is not the low offer, the procuring agency must add a certain percentage of the low offer's price (inclusive of duty) to that offer before determining which offer is the lowest priced, or provides \"best value\" for the government. This percentage typically ranges from 6%, in cases where the lowest domestic offer is from a large business; to 12%, when the lowest domestic offer is from a small business; to 50%, for Department of Defense procurements, although agencies may adopt higher percentages by regulation. If the domestic offer is the lowest, or tied for lowest, after the application of this price preference, the agency must generally award the contract to the domestic offeror. However, if the foreign offer still has the lowest price, the agency may generally award the contract to the foreign offeror pursuant to provisions of the Buy American Act permitting the purchase of foreign end products, and the use of foreign construction materials, when the costs of domestic ones are \"unreasonable.\" The Buy American Act makes separate provisions for federal agencies' purchase of supplies and their construction of \"public works,\" as discussed below. It also incorporates several exceptions that permit the use of foreign end products and construction materials even if the cost of domestic ones is not \"unreasonable.\" In addition, the application of the Buy American Act has been waived in certain procurements pursuant to the Trade Agreements Act (TAA).  As implemented by the FAR, the Buy American Act generally requires that federal agencies acquiring supplies for use in the United States under a contract valued in excess of the micro-purchase threshold (typically $3,500) purchase \"domestic end products.\" Whether an end product (i.e., an article, material, or supply to be acquired for public use) is \"domestic\" depends, in part, upon whether it is unmanufactured or manufactured. Unmanufactured end products must be mined or produced in the United States in order to qualify as \"domestic\" for purposes of the Buy American Act. Manufactured end products, in contrast, qualify as domestic if they are manufactured in the United States, and either (1) the cost of the components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50% of the cost of all components, or (2) the end product is a commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item. The meaning of \"manufacture\" is not defined by the Buy American Act, executive orders implementing the act, or the FAR, and determining whether particular activities constitute \"manufacturing\"\u2014such that a product can be said to be manufactured in the United States\u2014can be complicated. In answering this question, judicial and other tribunals have, at various times, considered whether there were \"substantial changes in physical character\"; whether separate manufacturing stages were involved, or whether there was one continuous process; and whether the article is completed in the form required by the government. Operations performed after the item has been completed (e.g., packaging, testing) generally are not viewed as manufacturing.  The cost of components, in turn, is generally determined based upon certain costs incurred by the contractor in purchasing or manufacturing the components. Specifically,  for components purchased by the contractor, the cost of components includes the acquisition costs (including transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the end product), and any applicable duty (regardless of whether a duty-free certificate of entry is issued); and for components manufactured by the contractor, the cost of components includes all costs associated with the manufacture of the component (including transportation costs), and allocable overhead costs, but excludes profits and any costs associated with the manufacture of the end product.  Specific components generally need not be manufactured in the United States, so long as at least 50% of the costs of all components are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States, or the end product is a COTS item. In general, anything that is not itself acquired as an end product is seen as a component, even if the agency could theoretically have purchased it as an end product. The Buy American Act also generally requires that domestic materials be used in federal agencies' construction projects by prohibiting them from \"allow[ing] the contractor to acquire foreign construction materials.\" Construction material generally includes any \"article, material, or supply brought to the construction site by a contractor or subcontractor for incorporation into [a] building or work,\" including items brought to the site preassembled from articles, materials, or supplies. However, materials purchased directly by the government are treated as supplies, not construction materials. Domestic construction material includes unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United States, as well as construction material manufactured in the United States, provided that (1) the cost of the components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50% of the cost of all components, or (2) the material is a COTS item. Manufacture is determined in the same way as for end products, and the costs of construction materials are also generally calculated in the same way as the costs of end products. The FAR lists five \"exceptions\" to the Buy American Act, or five circumstances in which an agency may purchase foreign end products, or permit the use of foreign construction materials, without violating the act. These exceptions apply when 1. the procurement of domestic goods or the use of domestic construction materials would be \"impracticable\" or \"inconsistent with the public interest\"; 2. domestic end products or construction materials are unavailable \"in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality\"; 3. the contracting officer determines that the cost of domestic end products or construction materials would be \"unreasonable\"; 4. the goods are acquired specifically for commissary resale; or 5. the agency procures information technology that is a commercial item. However, some commentators also treat procurements whose value is at or below the micro-purchase threshold (generally $3,500), and procurements for use outside the United States, as exceptions to the act. The procuring agency may determine, on its own initiative, whether one of these exceptions applies. Alternatively, particularly in the case of construction contracts, vendors may request that the contracting officer make a determination regarding the applicability of an exception prior to or after contract award.  In practice, the applicability of the Buy American Act is significantly limited by its waiver pursuant to the Trade Agreements Act, as discussed below. Its requirements generally only apply when (1) the anticipated value of the procurement is below the relevant monetary thresholds prescribed by U.S. trade agreements; (2) the acquisition involves agencies, supplies, or services excluded from the coverage of particular trade agreements; or (3) the circumstances of the acquisition are otherwise such that the acquisition is exempt from the TAA's waiver of the Buy American Act (e.g., acquisitions set aside for small businesses). The Trade Agreements Act (TAA) allows the President to waive \"the application of any law, regulation, procedure, or practice regarding Government procurement\" that would discriminate against eligible products or suppliers from \"designated countries\" so that the United States may comply with its obligations under various international trade agreements and accomplish certain other goals. Laws subject to waiver include the Buy American Act and similar domestic content restrictions. Under the TAA and its implementation in the FAR, offers of \"eligible products\" from certain countries with which the United States has trade agreements, or which it otherwise treats as designated countries, are generally entitled to \"receive equal consideration with domestic offers\" whenever the value of the acquisition exceeds certain monetary thresholds.  The TAA also prohibits procurement of products of nondesignated countries, with certain exceptions and waivers, in acquisitions covered by the World Trade Organization (WTO) Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) whose value exceeds the relevant monetary thresholds, in order to encourage additional countries to join this agreement and provide reciprocal competitive government procurement opportunities to U.S. products and suppliers. The FAR implements this prohibition by requiring federal agencies to acquire only \"U.S.-made or designated country end products or U.S. or designated country services\" in acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA, subject to certain exceptions.  A \"substantial transformation\" test is used to determine whether an end product originates in a particular country for purposes of the TAA when the product consists at least in part of materials from another country. Congress passed the TAA in part to implement the Government Procurement Code resulting from the Tokyo Round of international trade negotiations. The code contained nondiscrimination obligations with respect to government procurement similar to those now contained in the plurilateral WTO GPA.  Currently, the WTO GPA generally requires that, whenever the value of an acquisition exceeds certain monetary thresholds, the United States grant a party's covered products, services, and suppliers national treatment\u2014that is, treat them no less favorably than domestic goods, services, and suppliers\u2014with respect to all laws, regulations, procedures, and practices regarding government procurement covered by the agreement. The WTO GPA also contains a most-favored-nation (MFN) treatment provision that requires the United States to treat a party's covered products, services, and suppliers no less favorably than the products, services, and suppliers of any other party to the agreement with respect to all laws, regulations, procedures, and practices covered by the agreement. Most U.S. free trade agreements also contain some form of nondiscrimination obligation pertaining to government procurement. Annexes to these free trade agreements include monetary thresholds that determine when the obligations in the agreements apply to an acquisition of covered products or services by a covered entity. If a WTO Member or country party to a U.S. free trade agreement considered a U.S. government procurement measure to violate the agreement, it could potentially challenge the measure in a dispute settlement proceeding. If an adverse decision were ultimately rendered, the United States would be expected to remove the offending measure or face the possibility of paying compensation to the complaining foreign country or being subject to trade retaliation. Such sanctions might include the suspension by the retaliating foreign country of nondiscriminatory treatment accorded to U.S. products, services, and suppliers in that country's procurements. So that the United States may comply with its obligations under these trade agreements, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has waived the Buy American Act for eligible products from designated countries, making these products in a sense \"subject to\" the TAA rather than the Buy American Act. Part 25 of the FAR contains a list of countries designated by the USTR. This list includes (1) parties to the WTO GPA; (2) parties to most U.S. free trade agreements; (3) certain least developed countries; and (4) certain Caribbean Basin countries. Not all products and services from particular designated countries are eligible products for purposes of the TAA, however. Rather, only products and services covered for procurement by specified agencies of the United States under certain trade agreements are eligible. Annexes to the WTO GPA and U.S. free trade agreements indicate which products and services of a particular country are covered for procurement by the United States, often by including certain products and services within the coverage of the agreement or excluding them from coverage under the agreement. In addition, the international obligations contained in these agreements extend only to procurements by particular entities, such as certain federal agencies, that are listed in a country's annexes. Thus, it appears that products and services acquired by entities not listed in the relevant annexes to free trade agreements would not be eligible products under the TAA. An acquisition is subject to a TAA waiver or purchase restriction only when its value equals or exceeds certain monetary thresholds. These thresholds are initially established in annexes to particular trade agreements. However, the USTR revises the thresholds every two years and has currently set the threshold for supply contracts under the WTO GPA at $191,000 ($7.36 million for construction contracts). The FAR lists the monetary thresholds for each relevant trade agreement. It also contains instructions for calculating the estimated acquisition value. These instructions correspond to the rules for valuation of contracts contained in the WTO GPA. The TAA sets forth the test for determining whether an article originates in a particular country. Under this test, An article is a product of a country or instrumentality only if (i) it is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of that country or instrumentality, or (ii) in the case of an article which consists in whole or in part of materials from another country or instrumentality, it has been substantially transformed into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the article or articles from which it was so transformed. Thus, for a product made at least in part from materials manufactured in another country to undergo \"substantial transformation,\" it must acquire a new name, character, or use. To encourage additional countries to join the WTO GPA and to provide reciprocal competitive government procurement opportunities to U.S. products and suppliers, the TAA requires the President, with regard to acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA, to prohibit procurement of the products of nondesignated countries, subject to certain exceptions and waivers. When the value of the acquisition exceeds the relevant monetary threshold in the WTO GPA, the TAA's purchasing restriction applies. The purchasing restriction, as implemented in the FAR, requires federal agencies to acquire only \"U.S.-made or designated country end products or U.S. or designated country services\" in acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA, \"unless offers for such end products or services are either not received or are insufficient to fulfill the requirements.\" Generally, a U.S.-made end product is a product \"that is mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States or that is substantially transformed in the United States into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the article or articles from which it was transformed.\" Essentially, designated country end products are products grown, produced, manufactured, or substantially transformed in a country that is party to the WTO GPA; party to a U.S. free trade agreement that contains procurement obligations; one of certain least developed countries; or one of certain Caribbean Basin countries.  Pursuant to Subpart 25.4 of the FAR, the TAA does not apply to certain acquisitions, including 1. acquisitions set aside for small businesses; 2. acquisitions of arms, ammunition, or war materials, or purchases indispensable for national security or national defense purposes; 3. acquisition of end products for resale; 4. acquisitions from Federal Prison Industries, Inc., under Subpart 8.6 of the FAR, or from nonprofit agencies employing persons who are \"blind or severely disabled\" (commonly known as AbilityOne), under Subpart 8.7 of the FAR; or 5. other acquisitions not using full and open competition, authorized under Subparts 6.2 or 6.3 of the FAR, when the limitation of competition would preclude the use of the procedures of Subpart 25.4; or sole-source acquisitions justified in accordance with Subpart 13.501.  When an acquisition is not subject to the TAA due to one of these exceptions, the Buy American Act or another domestic preference law may apply.  The Berry Amendment has existed since the beginning of World War II and, historically, was included in yearly defense appropriations acts. However, it became permanent law in 1993, and was ultimately codified at 10 U.S.C. \u00a72533a in 2002. Over the years, the scope of the amendment has changed, though its core purposes have remained constant: safeguarding the United States' national security interests and protecting the U.S. industrial base to enable it to meet defense requirements during times of need.  Pursuant to the Berry Amendment, DOD cannot use appropriated or otherwise available funds to purchase a covered item unless that item is entirely grown, reprocessed, reused, or produced within the United States. In other words, the Berry Amendment requires a higher level of domestic content than is required under the Buy American Act, which permits manufactured items to qualify as \"domestic\" so long they are manufactured in the United States, and (1) the cost of components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50% of the cost of all components, or (2) the items are COTS items. For purposes of the Berry Amendment, covered items include food, clothing, tents, certain textile fabrics and fibers, and hand or measuring tools. Until 2006, the Berry Amendment also included provisions addressing specialty metals, but this language has since been codified in 10 U.S.C. \u00a72533b, discussed below. There are a number of exceptions within the Berry Amendment, permitting DOD to acquire covered items that are not entirely grown, reprocessed, reused, or produced within the United States when 1. the Secretary of Defense, or the secretary of a military department, determines that items of satisfactory quality or sufficient quantity cannot be acquired \"as and when needed at United States market prices\"; 2. the value of the purchase is below the simplified acquisition threshold (generally $150,000); 3. procuring items outside the United States in support of combat operations; or procuring food, or hand or measuring tools, outside the United States in support of contingency operations; 4. procuring food or hand or measuring tools in circumstances in which the unusual and compelling urgency of the need does not permit the use of competitive procedures; 5. vessels procure items in foreign waters; 6. conducting \"emergency procurements,\" or establishments located outside the United States procure perishable foods for the personnel attached to that establishment; 7. acquiring items for commissary resale; 8. procuring food products (other than fish, shellfish, or seafood) processed or manufactured in the United States; 9. acquiring waste and byproducts of cotton and wool fiber for use in the production of propellants and explosives; or 10. procuring \"chemical warfare protective clothing\" produced outside the United States is necessary to comply with certain U.S. agreements with foreign governments. Even if an acquisition is exempt from the requirements of the Berry Amendment, it is potentially subject to the Buy American Act. However, if the Berry Amendment applies to an acquisition, the Buy American Act does not.  Neither the Berry Amendment nor the specialty metals restriction, discussed below, have been waived pursuant to the TAA, and certain trade agreements of the United States expressly provide that they do not apply to procurements involving textiles, clothing, food, and \"specialty metals.\" The specialty metals restriction first appeared in 1972, when it was added to the Berry Amendment during the Vietnam War. It remained part of the Berry Amendment until 2006, when the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2007 took effect, and moved the specialty metals restriction from the codification of the Berry Amendment in 10 U.S.C. \u00a72533a to a separate section of the U.S. Code , 10 U.S.C. \u00a72533b. Pursuant to the specialty metals restriction, DOD cannot buy any aircraft, missile and space system, ship, tank and automotive item, weapon system, ammunition, or any components thereof, containing a specialty metal that was not melted or produced in the United States. Further, DOD is prohibited from purchasing, either directly or through a contractor, any specialty metal not melted or produced in the United States.  Specialty metals include certain types of steel; certain metal alloys made of nickel, iron-nickel, and cobalt; titanium and titanium alloys; and zirconium and zirconium alloys. The specialty metals restriction contains a number of exceptions identical to those that apply to the Berry Amendment, including for purchases below the simplified acquisition threshold; items deemed to be \"non-available\"; acquisitions conducted outside of the United States in support of combat or contingency operations; acquisitions made on a noncompetitive basis due to compelling urgency; and items purchased for commissary resale. However, there are also certain exceptions that are unique to the specialty metals restriction, and permit DOD to purchase specialty metals, or specified items containing (or whose components contain) such metals, that were not melted or produced in the United States. These exceptions apply when 1. acceptance of an end item containing noncompliant materials is \"necessary\" to the national security interests of the United States; 2. acquiring electronic components (unless the Secretary of Defense determines, based on the recommendation of the Strategic Materials Protection Board, that domestic availability of a particular electronic component is critical to national security); 3. acquiring certain COTS items, or fasteners that are commercial items purchased under a contract or subcontract with a manufacturer of such items, provided certain conditions are met; 4. purchasing items wherein the total weight of noncompliant specialty metals is less than 2% of the total weight of the item's specialty metals; 5. the acquisition is necessary to comply with or further certain agreements with foreign governments; 6. the Secretary of Defense, or the secretary of a military department, determines that items acquired under a prime contract are \"commercial derivative military articles,\" and the contractor certifies that it and its subcontractors have entered into agreements for the purchase of specified amounts of domestically melted specialty metal; and 7. acquiring items produced, manufactured, or assembled in the United States prior to October 17, 2006, that contain noncompliant specialty metals, provided that (a) the contractor or subcontractor plans to comply with the specialty metals restriction in the future, (b) removing the noncompliant specialty metals would be impractical, and (c) the noncompliance was inadvertent. As with the Berry Amendment, acquisitions that are exempt from the specialty metals restrictions could potentially be subject to the Buy American Act; and the Buy American Act does not apply if the specialty metals restriction applies. The Buy America Act is the popular name for a group of domestic content restrictions that have been attached to specific funds administered by the Department of Transportation (DOT) and certain other federal agencies. These funds are used to make grants to states, localities, and other nonfederal government entities for various purposes, including transportation projects or for water-related infrastructure systems. The Buy American Act does not apply to these funds because, while the source of the money is federal, purchases are not made directly by the federal government. In other words, these purchases are not federal procurements for purposes of the Buy American Act. The various Buy America requirements have not been waived pursuant to the TAA, and certain U.S. trade agreements expressly exclude \"non-contractual agreements or ... any form of [government] assistance,\" such as grants, from their coverage. Many domestic content restrictions related to the use of grant funds are placed on projects administered through agencies in DOT. This section describes some of these Buy America requirements, which differ among agencies. Section 313 of Title 23 of the U.S. Code prohibits the obligation of funds appropriated under Title 23 and administered by the DOT for a project \"unless the steel, iron, and manufactured products used in such project are produced in the United States.\" Section 313's restriction on the use of foreign manufactured products only applies to manufactured products that consist predominantly of steel or iron, not all manufactured products. Raw materials used in the manufacturing processes may be imported.  States expending Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) funds can satisfy the Buy America requirements by using only steel or iron produced in the United States, or including standard contract provisions that require domestic materials. Otherwise, the state may use alternate bid provisions, requiring each bidder to submit bids based on domestic materials and stating that the contract will be awarded to the bidder with the lowest total bid on domestic materials unless that bid exceeds the lowest total bid on foreign materials by more than 25%. Additionally, if the project includes steel and iron materials, the Buy America requirements do not prevent the minimal use of foreign steel and iron materials, not exceeding .1% of the total contract cost, or $2,500, whichever is greater. The FHWA is prohibited from creating funding restrictions that would prevent a state from imposing stricter Buy America requirements on projects carried out with Title 23 funds. The FHWA has issued nationwide waivers to the Buy America requirements for manufactured products other than steel or iron manufactured products; certain steel and iron materials used in ferryboat construction; and pig iron and processed, pelletized, and reduced iron ore. States may also be granted project- or material-specific waivers if the FHWA determines that applying the Buy America requirements is against public interest, or that the steel and iron materials and products needed are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities of satisfactory quality. However, the FHWA is prohibited from issuing waivers for foreign products that come from a country that has an agreement with the United States, under which the Buy America requirements have been waived, if that country has violated the agreement in specified ways. Section 50101 of Title 49 of the U.S. Code prohibits the obligation of funds appropriated under certain provisions administered by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for a project unless the \"steel and manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States.\" This requirement may be waived if the FAA finds that applying the restriction is against the public interest; the necessary materials are not produced domestically in sufficient and reasonably available amounts or are not of satisfactory quality; or the use of domestic materials increases the overall project cost by more than 25%. Additionally, a waiver may be granted if funds available under certain provisions are used to procure a facility or equipment where the cost of components and subcomponents produced in the United States is more than 60% of the cost of all components, and the final assembly of the facility or equipment occurs in the United States. The FAA has issued nationwide waivers for certain commonly used products from specific manufacturers that often qualify for a waiver under the 60% domestic content provision. These nationwide waivers allow a product to be used in projects \"without having to receive separate project waivers.\" Section 50101 does not include a prohibition on the issuance of waivers for foreign products from a country that has violated a trade agreement with the United States, as stated in other transportation-related Buy America provisions. Funding under Chapter 53 of Title 49 of the U.S. Code , administered by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) for public transportation projects, may be obligated for a grantee project only if the \"steel, iron, and manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States.\" This requirement applies to all construction materials made primarily of steel or iron and used in infrastructure projects, but does not apply to steel or iron used as components or subcomponents of other manufactured products or rolling stock. The FTA has not specifically defined \"made primarily of steel or iron.\" In order for a manufactured product to satisfy the \"produced in the United States\" requirement, all of the manufacturing processes must take place in the United States. Additionally, all of the product's components must be of American origin, meaning that they must be manufactured in the United States; the origin of the component's subcomponents does not matter. The FTA may not impose any funding limitations that restrict a state from imposing \"more stringent\" Buy America requirements.  The Buy America requirements may be waived for any Chapter 53 spending if the FTA finds that applying the restriction is inconsistent with the public interest; the materials needed are not produced domestically in sufficient and reasonably available amounts or are not of satisfactory quality; or using domestic materials will increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25%. Additionally, a waiver may be granted when funds are used to procure rolling stock if the cost of the components and subcomponents produced domestically represents a certain percentage of the cost of all components and subcomponents of the rolling stock, and final assembly of the rolling stock occurs in the United States. In 2015, Congress increased the threshold cost requirement for future fiscal years. For FY2016 and FY2017 funds, the cost of domestically produced components must be more than 60% of the cost of all components. In FY2018 and FY2019, the requirement increases to 65%, and in FY2020 and beyond the requirement increases to 70% . However, the FTA is prohibited from issuing waivers for foreign goods if the foreign country has a trade agreement with the United States that waives Buy America requirements and has violated that agreement in specified ways. Projects funded through spending authorized under the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (PRIIA) are subject to Buy America requirements stated in 49 U.S.C. \u00a724405(a) if project costs exceed $100,000. The statute states that funds may be obligated from appropriations enacted to carry out Chapter 244 \"only if the steel, iron, and manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States.\" Manufactured goods are considered \"produced in the United States\" when the manufacturing processes for the end product take place in the United States, and all of the end product's components are of domestic origin. The origin of a component's subcomponents is not relevant to this determination. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) may not create any funding limitations that restrict a state from imposing \"more stringent\" Buy America requirements on projects funded under PRIIA.  A waiver of the Buy America requirements may be granted if applying the restrictions is inconsistent with the public interest; domestically produced steel, iron, and manufactured goods are not produced in sufficient and reasonably available amounts or are not of satisfactory quality; domestic rolling stock or power train equipment cannot be purchased and delivered within a reasonable time; or the use of domestic materials increases the cost of the overall project by more than 25%. The FRA is prohibited from issuing waivers for goods produced in a foreign country if that country has an agreement with the United States, under which the Buy America requirements have been waived, and has violated that agreement in specified ways. In addition to the Buy America restrictions attached to funds administered by DOT, certain grant funding used for water-related infrastructure projects is subject to domestic content restrictions. Projects that receive funding through state water pollution control revolving funds, commonly known as the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF), are also subject to domestic content restrictions that require the use in the project of U.S.-produced iron and steel products. The CWSRF and DWSRF provide low-interest financing for water quality and public water system interest projects through loan programs administered by the states. At the federal level, these revolving funds are administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Financing made available through the CWSRF or DWSRF may not be used for a project for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of \"treatment works\" unless \"all of the iron and steel products used in the project are produced in the United States.\" For projects funded through the DWSRF, this restriction also applies to financing for the construction, alteration, maintenance or repair of a \"public water system.\"  To be considered \"produced in the United States,\" all manufacturing processes, with the exception of metallurgical processes involving refinement of steel additives, must take place in the United States. \"[I]ron and steel products\" are defined as the following items: lined or unlined pipes and fittings; manhole covers and other municipal castings; hydrants; tanks; flanges; pipe clamps and restraints; valves; structural steel; reinforced precast concrete; and construction materials\u2014provided that these products are \"made primarily of iron or steel[.]\" Under EPA guidance, a product is made \"primarily\" of iron or steel if the cost of iron and steel constitutes more than 50% of the materials cost for the product.  EPA may waive the domestic content restrictions if applying the restrictions would be inconsistent with the public interest; iron and steel products are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality; or inclusion of domestic iron and steel products would increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25%. The domestic content restrictions for CWSRF and DWSRF projects originated in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014, which placed restrictions on the use of appropriated funds through the end of FY2014. For CWSRF projects, the restriction was made permanent through the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014, and is now codified in the U.S. Code . The restriction has not been made permanent for DWSRF projects, but it was extended in FY2015 and FY2016 through appropriations legislation.  Table 1 , below, summarizes key aspects of the four major domestic content regimes in federal law, in order to better highlight the similarities and differences among them. In addition to the four major domestic preference regimes previously discussed, there are also numerous other domestic content restrictions that apply in specific contexts and are intended to address perceived \"gaps\" left by the Buy American Act, in particular. In some cases, as with the Berry Amendment, these provisions require a higher level of domestic content than is required under the Buy American Act, which permits manufactured items to qualify as \"domestic\" so long as they are manufactured in the United States, and (1) the cost of components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50% of the cost of all components, or (2) the items are COTS items. In other cases, as with the Buy America Act, these provisions apply to federal grants or other funds that are spent by entities that are not federal agencies, and thus not subject to the Buy American Act and other federal procurement laws. In yet other cases, the provision seeks to \"encourage\" procurement of domestic content by federal agencies or other entities without strictly mandating it. Listed below are the domestic content restrictions that have been codified, including in notes, in the U.S. Code . This listing is intended to be comprehensive. However, it is important to note that un-codified provisions\u2014such as might appear in annual appropriations measures\u2014are not included. Provisions are given in numerical order by the Title of the U.S. Code in which they appear.  3 U.S.C. \u00a7110: Directs that all furniture purchased for the use of the Executive Residence at the White House be, \"as far as practicable,\" of domestic manufacture. 6 U.S.C. \u00a7453b: Prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from using funds appropriated or otherwise available to it to procure covered items unless the item was grown, reprocessed, reused, or produced in the United States, with certain exceptions.
