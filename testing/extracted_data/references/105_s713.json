FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) children are the future of the Nation and the \n        preservation and improvement of child health is in the national \n        interest;\n            (2) the preservation and improvement of child health may \n        require the use of pharmaceutical products;\n            (3) children may metabolize drugs differently from adults \n        and may require smaller doses or different forms of \n        administration of the drugs;\n            (4) the testing of drugs for safety and pharmacokinetics is \n        necessary to ensure that the drugs are safe and effective for \n        use by children;\n            (5) it is estimated that 4 out of 5 drugs on the market in \n        the United States have not been approved for use by children;\n            (6) many other drugs are not manufactured in a form that \n        permits young children to use such drugs and consequently \n        untested and unapproved forms are often employed;\n            (7) many of these drugs are nonetheless widely used by \n        children or hold promise for use by children, despite the lack \n        of approval, dosage, labeling, or formulation;\n            (8) this Act is intended to encourage manufacturers to \n        perform such research, to develop information about the safe \n        and appropriate use of such drugs, and to label and formulate \n        such drugs for use by children;\n            (9) the National Institutes of Health, acting through the \n        Pediatric Pharmacology Research Unit (PPRU) Network, has \n        initiated research on appropriate pediatric indications for \n        drugs that have not been approved for use by children;\n            (10) the PPRU Network has performed such research with both \n        public funding and private contracts with industry;\n            (11) the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, if \n        enacted, will provide a range of private contractual \n        opportunities for the PPRU Network to work with industry on \n        research involving drugs that are protected by some form of \n        patent or exclusivity and that are candidates for protection \n        under this Act;\n            (12) there will, nonetheless, remain a number of drugs that \n        are in widespread use and that have not been approved for use \n        by children, but that are not protected by some form of patent \n        or exclusivity, and thus are not candidates for protection \n        under this Act;\n            (13) if this Act is enacted, the PPRU Network will continue \n        to be well suited to continue to use public funds and such \n        private funds as may be available to conduct research on such \n        drugs for pediatric use; and\n            (14) if this Act is enacted, the safety and effectiveness \n        of the use of pharmaceuticals by children will be improved and \n        the health of the children of this Nation health will benefit.\n\nSEC. 3.
