FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States Government is increasingly relying on \n        armed private security contractors to perform mission-critical \n        and emergency essential functions that historically have been \n        performed by United States military or Government personnel.\n            (2) As of March 2011, the Department of Defense had \n        approximately 155,000 contract employees operating in Iraq and \n        Afghanistan, as compared to 145,000 members of the United \n        States Armed Forces operating in these two theaters of war.\n            (3) As of March 2011, the Department of Defense had \n        deployed 9,207 armed private security contractors in Iraq and \n        18,971 in Afghanistan, a change from 10,743 and 4,111, \n        respectively, in March 2009.\n            (4) As of April 1, 2011, the Department of State had over \n        2,500 security contractors in Iraq and 1,272 in Afghanistan, \n        under the Worldwide Personal Protective Services (WPPS) \n        contract.\n            (5) In September 2009, photos were published showing \n        employees of ArmorGroup North America (AGNA), hired by the \n        Department of State to provide security at the United States \n        Embassy in Kabul, engaging in lewd sexual hazing and \n        harassment.\n            (6) Before the September 2009 incident, the Department of \n        State had issued multiple deficiency notices, a cure notice, \n        and a show-cause notice expressing grave concerns about the \n        company's performance on the contract; one State Department \n        official even wrote that the company's deficiencies ``endanger \n        performance of the contract to such a degree that the security \n        of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul is in jeopardy''.\n            (7) On July 7, 2011, the Department of Justice announced \n        that Armor Group North America paid a $7.5 million settlement \n        to resolve charges that the company submitted false claims for \n        payment on a State Department contract; the settlement resolves \n        claims that AGNA guards violated the Trafficking Victims \n        Protection Act by visiting brothels in Kabul with the knowledge \n        of AGNA's management, as well as allegations that AGNA \n        misrepresented the prior work experience of 38 third country \n        nationals hired to guard the embassy.\n            (8) A 2010 Senate Armed Services Committee investigation \n        found that EOD Technology, the company hired to take over \n        protection of the Kabul Embassy from AGNA, was suspected of \n        hiring local warlords with possible Taliban ties, and in March \n        2011 the EODT contract was terminated for default.\n            (9) In May 2009, four men employed as military trainers for \n        Paravant LLC, a Blackwater affiliate, fired on a civilian \n        vehicle in Kabul, killing one Afghan and wounding two others; \n        two of the guards were convicted of involuntary manslaughter in \n        March 2011.\n            (10) On September 16, 2007, individuals hired by the \n        company then known as Blackwater USA opened fire on Baghdad's \n        Nisour Square, killing 17 Iraqis and wounding at least 20 \n        others.\n            (11) In August 2010, XE Services, LLC, the company formerly \n        known as Blackwater, entered into a civil settlement with the \n        State Department, under which the company agreed to pay a \n        penalty of $42 million for 288 alleged violations of the Arms \n        Export Control Act (AECA) and the International Traffic in Arms \n        Regulations (ITAR).\n            (12) In July 2010, The Washington Post quoted Secretary of \n        Defense Robert Gates as saying ``This is a terrible confession \n        . . . I can't get a number on how many contractors work for the \n        Office of the Secretary of Defense.''.\n            (13) On October 18, 2007, Secretary Gates stated that the \n        work of many contractors in Iraq is ``at cross-purposes to our \n        larger mission in Iraq,'' and that ``right now those missions \n        are in conflict''.\n            (14) In 2007, the Committee on Oversight and Government \n        Reform of the House of Representatives investigated \n        Blackwater's employment practices and found that the company's \n        classification of its security guards may have allowed the firm \n        to avoid paying Social Security, Medicare, and Federal income \n        and employment taxes.\n            (15) On Christmas Eve 2006, Blackwater contractor Andrew \n        Moonen, while drunk, shot and killed a guard to Iraqi Vice \n        President Adil Abd-al-Mahdi in the Green Zone, and though Mr. \n        Moonen lost his job with Blackwater as a result of this \n        incident, he was promptly hired by Combat Support Associates, \n        another Department of Defense contractor, and sent to work in \n        Kuwait.\n            (16) In the wake of the 2004 killing of four Blackwater \n        contractors in Fallujah, the families of the men killed filed a \n        civil suit against the company, alleging that Blackwater failed \n        to properly equip and man its armored vehicles; after nearly \n        seven years in court, the case was thrown out when the families \n        could reportedly no longer pay the court costs.\n            (17) XE Services, LLC, the company formerly known as \n        Blackwater, has also faced allegations of weapons smuggling and \n        improperly licensing firearms; in April 2010, five former \n        Blackwater employees, including former president Gary Jackson, \n        were indicted on charges including conspiring to violate \n        Federal firearm laws, possession of unregistered firearms, and \n        obstruction of justice.\n            (18) In response to a request from the Committee on \n        Oversight and Government Reform of the House of \n        Representatives, the Inspector General of the Small Business \n        Administration investigated Blackwater in 2008 and found that \n        the company may have misrepresented its small business status, \n        enabling it to qualify for $110,000,000 in government contracts \n        set aside specifically for small businesses.\n            (19) Signed affidavits were filed in a civil lawsuit \n        against Blackwater that company founder Erik Prince views \n        himself ``as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating \n        Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe'', that he \n        knowingly deployed ``demonstrably unfit men'' to Iraq, and that \n        he used illegal ammunition, including a bullet designed to \n        explode after entering the human body, among other charges.\n            (20) In November 2007, a contractor employed by DynCorp \n        International, LLC, reportedly shot and killed an unarmed taxi \n        driver who, according to witnesses, posed no threat to the \n        DynCorp convoy.\n            (21) A January 2007 report by the Special Inspector General \n        for Iraq Reconstruction stated that DynCorp billed the United \n        States for millions of dollars of work that was never \n        authorized.\n            (22) In October 2007, an audit report issued by the Special \n        Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction stated that the \n        Department of State ``does not know specifically what it \n        received for most of the $1,200,000,000 in expenditures under \n        its DynCorp Contract for the Iraqi Police Training Program''.\n            (23) Congress does not have complete access to information \n        about all security contracts, the number of armed private \n        security contractors working in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other \n        combat zones, the number of contractors who have died, and any \n        disciplinary actions taken against contract personnel or \n        companies.\n\nSEC. 3.
