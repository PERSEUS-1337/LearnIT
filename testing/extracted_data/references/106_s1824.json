    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Private Wireless Spectrum Use Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Competent management of the electromagnetic radio \n        spectrum includes continued availability of spectrum for \n        private wireless entities because of such entitiesD23/' unique \n        ability to achieve substantial efficiencies in their use of \n        this important and finite public resource. A private wireless \n        system licensee or entity is able to customize communications \n        systems to meet the individual needs of that licensee or end \n        user while using engineering solutions and other cooperative \n        arrangements to share spectrum with other private system \n        licensees and entities without causing harmful interference or \n        other degradation of quality or reliability to such other \n        licensees or entities. Accordingly, spectrum allocations for \n        the shared use of private wireless systems achieve a high level \n        of spectrum use efficiency and contribute to the economic and \n        social welfare of the United States.\n            (2) Wireless communication systems dedicated to the \n        internal communication needs of America's industrial, land \n        transportation, energy (including utilities and pipelines), and \n        other business enterprises are critical to the competitiveness \n        of American industry and business in international commerce; \n        increase corporate productivity; enhance the safety and welfare \n        of employees; and improve the delivery of products and services \n        to consumers in the United States and abroad.\n            (3) During the past decade, the Federal Communications \n        Commission allocation and licensing policies have led to \n        dramatic increases in spectrum available for commercial mobile \n        radio services while the spectrum available for private mobile \n        radio systems has decreased, even though the Commission \n        recognizes the spectrum use efficiencies and other public \n        benefits of such private systems and the substantial increases \n        in the use of such systems.\n            (4) Spectrum auctions are designed to select among \n        competing applications for spectrum licenses when engineering \n        solutions, negotiation, threshold qualifications, service \n        regulations, and other cooperative means employed by the \n        Commission are not able to prevent mutual exclusivity among \n        such applications. Private wireless systems, on the other hand, \n        avoid mutual exclusivity through cooperative, multiple uses \n        generally achieved by the Commission, the users, or the \n        frequency advisory committees. Accordingly, the requirements of \n        such private wireless systems are accommodated within the \n        spectrum bands allocated for private uses. Since there is no \n        mutual exclusivity among private wireless system applications, \n        there is no need for the Commission to employ a mechanism, such \n        as auctions, to select among applications. Auction valuation \n        principles also do not apply to the private wireless licensing \n        process because the private wireless spectrum is not used on a \n        commercial, interconnected basis. Rather, such private \n        allocations are used for internal communications applications \n        to enhance safety, efficiency and productivity. Nonetheless, \n        there should be some payment associated with the assignment of \n        new private wireless spectrum, and the Commission can and \n        should develop a payment mechanism for this purpose.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Section 3 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 153) is \namended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (33) through (52) as \n        paragraph (35) through (54); and\n            (2) by inserting after paragraph (32) the following:\n            ``(33) Private Wireless System.--The term `private wireless \n        system' means an infrastructure of telecommunications equipment \n        and customer premises equipment that is owned by, and operated \n        solely to meet the internal wireless communication needs of, an \n        industrial, business, transportation, education, or energy \n        (including utilities and pipelines) entity, or other licensee.\n            ``(34) Private Wireless Provider.--The term `private \n        wireless provider' means an entity that owns, operates, or \n        manages an infrastructure of telecommunications equipment and \n        customer premises equipment that is--\n                    ``(A) used solely for the purpose of meeting the \n                internal communications needs of another entity that is \n                an industrial, business, transportation, education, or \n                energy (including utilities and pipelines) entity, or \n                similar end-user;\n                    ``(B) neither a commercial mobile service (as \n                defined in section 332(d)(1)) nor used to provide \n                public safety services (as defined in section \n                337(f)(1)); and\n                    ``(C) not interconnected with the public switched \n                network.''.\n\nSEC. 4.

ALLOCATION AND ASSIGNMENT OF SPECTRUM FOR PRIVATE WIRELESS \n              USES.\n\n    ``(a) Rulemaking Required.--Within 120 days after the date of \nenactment of the Private Wireless Spectrum Use Act, the Commission \nshall initiate a rulemaking designed to identify and allocate at least \n12 megahertz of electromagnetic spectrum located between 150 and 2,000 \nmegahertz for use by private wireless licensees on a shared-use basis. \nThe new spectrum proposed to be reallocated shall be available and \nappropriate for use by private wireless communications systems and \nshall accommodate the need for paired allocations and for proximity to \nexisting private wireless spectrum allocations. In accommodating the \nvarious private wireless system needs in this rulemaking, the \nCommission shall reserve at least 50 percent of the reallocated \nspectrum for the use of private wireless systems. The remaining \nreallocated spectrum shall be available for use by private wireless \nproviders solely for the purpose described in section 3(34)(A).\n    ``(b) Order Required.--Within 180 days after the Commission \ninitiates the rulemaking required by subsection (a), the Commission, in \nconsultation with its frequency advisory committees, shall--\n            ``(1) issue an order reallocating spectrum in accordance \n        with subsection (a); and\n            ``(2) issue licenses for the reallocated spectrum in a \n        timely manner.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
