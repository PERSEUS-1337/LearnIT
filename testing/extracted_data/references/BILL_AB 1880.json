The council or committee may not take any action on any item of business unless that item appeared on the posted agenda or unless the council or committee members present, by unanimous vote, find that there is a need to take immediate action and that the need for action came to the attention of the council or committee subsequent to the posting of the agenda.\n(2)Questions or brief statements made at a meeting by members of the council, committee, or public that do not have a significant effect on pupils or employees in the school or school district, or that can be resolved solely by the provision of information, need not be described on an agenda as items of business. If a council or committee violates the procedural meeting requirements of this section, and upon the demand of any person, the council or committee shall reconsider the item at its next meeting, after allowing for public input on the item.\n(d)Any materials provided to a schoolsite council shall be made available to any member of the public who requests the materials pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code)."
