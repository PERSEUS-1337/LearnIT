FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports \n        that between the periods 1988 to 1994 and between 1994 and \n        2004, tooth decay increased 15 percent among toddlers and \n        preschoolers 2 to 5 years old.\n            (2) During the period 1999 to 2004, 28 percent of young \n        children experienced cavities.\n            (3) Among 2 year olds in the United States, 1-in-10 already \n        have cavities, and by age 5 that figure jumps to 2-in-5 \n        children.\n            (4) Tooth decay is the single most common childhood chronic \n        disease, and it disproportionately affects poor and minority \n        children.\n            (5) Eighty percent of dental decay occurs in just 25 \n        percent of children.\n            (6) Parents are 3 times more likely to report that their \n        children's dental needs are unmet, when compared with general \n        medical care needs.\n            (7) While 9,000,000 of the children in this Nation do not \n        have medical insurance, more than twice that number--\n        23,000,000--do not have dental insurance.\n            (8) One out of 20 middle-aged adults in the United States \n        are missing all their teeth.\n            (9) More than 40 percent of low income adults have at least \n        1 untreated decayed tooth compared to 16 percent of non-poor \n        adults.\n            (10) Employed adults lose more than 164,000,000 hours of \n        work each year due to oral health problems or dental visits.\n            (11) For every adult 19 years or older without medical \n        insurance, there are 3 without dental insurance.\n            (12) About 25 percent of adults 60 years old and older no \n        longer have any natural teeth. Having missing teeth can affect \n        nutrition, since people without teeth often prefer soft, easily \n        chewed foods.\n\nSEC. 3.
