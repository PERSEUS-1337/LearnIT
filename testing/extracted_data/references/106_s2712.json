FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n        (1) existing law imposes numerous financial and performance \n    management reporting requirements on agencies;\n        (2) these separate requirements can cause duplication of effort \n    on the part of agencies and result in uncoordinated reports \n    containing information in a form that is not completely useful to \n    Congress; and\n        (3) pilot projects conducted by agencies under the direction of \n    the Office of Management and Budget demonstrate that single \n    consolidated reports providing an analysis of verifiable financial \n    and performance management information produce more useful reports \n    with greater efficiency.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n        (1) to authorize and encourage the consolidation of financial \n    and performance management reports;\n        (2) to provide financial and performance management information \n    in a more meaningful and useful format for Congress, the President, \n    and the public;\n        (3) to improve the quality of agency financial and performance \n    management information; and\n        (4) to enhance coordination and efficiency on the part of \n    agencies in reporting financial and performance management \n    information.\n\nSEC. 3.
