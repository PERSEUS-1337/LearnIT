SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Mapping a New and Innovative Focus \non Our Exploration Strategy for Human Spaceflight Act of 2016'' or the \n``MANIFEST for Human Spaceflight Act of 2016''.\n\nSEC. 2. REAFFIRMATION OF POLICY AND FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Reaffirmation of Policy.--Congress reaffirms that the long-term \ngoal of the human space flight and exploration efforts of the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration shall be to expand permanent human \npresence beyond low-Earth orbit and to do so, where practical, in a \nmanner involving international partners, as stated in section 202(a) of \nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of \n2010 (42 U.S.C. 18312(a)).\n    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In accordance with section 204 of the National \n        Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 \n        (Public Law 111-267; 124 Stat. 2813), the National Academy of \n        Sciences, through its Committee on Human Spaceflight, conducted \n        a review of the goals, core capabilities, and direction of \n        human space flight, and published the findings and \n        recommendations in a 2014 report entitled ``Pathways to \n        Exploration: Rationales and Approaches for a U.S. Program of \n        Human Space Exploration''.\n            (2) The Committee on Human Spaceflight included leaders \n        from the aerospace, scientific, security, and policy \n        communities. With input from the public, the Committee on Human \n        Spaceflight concluded that many practical and aspirational \n        rationales together constitute a compelling case for human \n        space exploration. These rationales include economic benefits, \n        national security, national prestige, inspiring students and \n        other citizens, scientific discovery, human survival, and a \n        sense of shared destiny.\n            (3) The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed that Mars \n        is the appropriate long-term goal for the human space flight \n        program.\n            (4) The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended that the \n        National Aeronautics and Space Administration define a series \n        of sustainable steps and conduct mission planning and \n        technology development as needed to achieve the long-term goal \n        of placing humans on the surface of Mars.\n\nSEC. 3. HUMAN EXPLORATION STRATEGY.\n\n    (a) Human Exploration of Mars.--Section 202(b) of the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 \nU.S.C. 18312(b)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (3), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n            (2) in paragraph (4), by striking the period at the end and \n        inserting ``; and''; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(5) to achieve human exploration of Mars, including the \n        establishment of a capability to extend human presence to the \n        surface of Mars.''.\n    (b) Exploration Strategy.--\n            (1) In general.--In accordance with this subsection, the \n        Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space \n        Administration shall submit an interim report and final report \n        setting forth a strategy to achieve the objective in paragraph \n        (5) of section 202(b) of the National Aeronautics and Space \n        Administration Authorization Act of 2010, as amended by \n        subsection (a) of this section, through a series of successive, \n        sustainable, free-standing, but complementary missions making \n        robust utilization of cis-lunar space and employing the Space \n        Launch System, Orion crew capsule, and other capabilities \n        provided under titles III, IV, V, and IX of that Act (42 U.S.C. \n        18301 et seq.).\n            (2) Strategy requirements.--In developing the strategy \n        under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall include--\n                    (A) the utility of an expanded human presence in \n                cis-lunar space toward enabling missions to various \n                lunar orbits, the lunar surface, asteroids, Mars, the \n                moons of Mars, and other destinations of interest for \n                future human exploration and development;\n                    (B) the utility of an expanded human presence in \n                cis-lunar space for economic, scientific, and \n                technological advances;\n                    (C) the opportunities for collaboration with--\n                            (i) international partners;\n                            (ii) private industry;
