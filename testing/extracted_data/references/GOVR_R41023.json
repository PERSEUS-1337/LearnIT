    "content": "A major global donors' conference was held March 31, 2010, in New York. Donors pledged over $5 billion for the first 18 months of Haiti's reconstruction. The United States pledged $1.2 billion. The Haitian government presented an action plan for reconstruction and development, and a Post Disaster Needs Assessment that estimated the total value of recovery and reconstruction needs to be $11.5 billion. The Obama Administration requested $2.8 billion in FY2010 supplemental funding for relief and reconstruction support for Haiti. Extra-constitutional rule will begin after May 10, when most parliamentarians' terms expire; President Pr\u00e9val will probably rule by decree after that. Haiti passed a State of Emergency Law on April 20 giving the President broad powers. The international community is urging Haiti to hold legislative and presidential elections in November 2010. Humanitarian assistance is focused on providing waterproof emergency shelter, improving sanitation and meeting the basic needs of the displaced and other vulnerable Haitians. The relief effort is expected to last for many months. Most U.S. military forces will withdraw from Haiti by about June 1, 2010. The largest earthquake ever recorded in Haiti devastated parts of the country, including the capital, on January 12, 2010. The quake, centered about 15 miles southwest of Port-au-Prince, had a magnitude of 7.0. A series of strong aftershocks have followed. The damage was severe and catastrophic. Thousands of buildings collapsed, leaving unknown numbers of people trapped, and hundreds of thousands of people homeless in the streets. Estimates of casualties are constantly being updated. According to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, \"[o]f Haiti's 9 million people, initial reports suggest roughly a third may be affected by the disaster.\"  The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) issued a study on February 11 estimating the damage caused by the earthquake to be at least $8 billion, and as high as $14 billion. One of the report's authors, economist Andrew Powell, said that, \"This disaster, given the size of Haiti ... is the most devastating catastrophe that a country has experienced possibly ever.\" The report compared the damage to other catastrophes, finding, for example, that the earthquake's damage amounted to 117% of Haiti's annual economic output, while the 2004 tsunami damage amounted to 2% of Indonesia's annual economic output. The Haiti Post Disaster Needs Assessment, conducted by Haiti and international institutions, reported similar findings, estimating the total value of recovery and reconstruction needs to be $11.5 billion.  All of this damage was sustained in a country that the United Nations had already designated as one of the 50 \"least developed countries\" in the world, facing a higher risk than other countries of failing to come out of poverty, and therefore needing the highest degree of attention from the international community. Recovery efforts have been made extremely difficult by the loss of personnel and infrastructure that would be part of a recovery effort. Among the missing and dead were Haitian government officials and international aid personnel, including many U.N. personnel. Housing, hospitals, schools, and many government buildings collapsed. Basic services such as electricity and water were almost completely disrupted. Major transportation routes were damaged and/or blocked. The Port-au-Prince airport control tower was destroyed; the airport continued to function, and air traffic control authority was quickly transferred to U.S. personnel with portable radar. On February 18, commercial air traffic in and out of Port-au-Prince resumed. As of early March, relief flights into Haiti had dropped from a peak of 160 flights per day to an average of 75. The main port suffered heavy damage; U.S. troops are repairing the port facilities. The port is expected to handle 1,500 containers of relief supplies once it is fully repaired. The use of airfields and ports in the Dominican Republic, with humanitarian corridors over land, have also eased the burden on Haitian facilities.  Haitian government officials continue to function in makeshift conditions. The roof of the Presidential Palace collapsed and the President's private residence was also destroyed. President Pr\u00e9val was initially unable to communicate with his Cabinet and has been working out of a small room in a police headquarters. The Parliament building collapsed, with some Members trapped inside and others killed. The Parliament has convened in the National Police Academy. Twenty-eight of 29 Ministry buildings were destroyed. The United Nations, which already had a strong presence in Haiti, is at the forefront of on-the-ground response for security and humanitarian assistance, and suffered heavy losses as well. Its headquarters collapsed, and 101 U.N. personnel are confirmed dead and 6 others remain unaccounted for. The head of the U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), Special Representative Hedi Annabi, and his deputy, Luiz Carlos da Costa, were among the dead. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon sent Assistant Secretary General Edmond Mulet to Haiti on January 13 to direct the U.N.'s immediate response efforts; Mulet is a former Special Representative of the Secretary General for MINUSTAH. Prior to the earthquake, the international community was providing extensive development and humanitarian assistance to Haiti. With that assistance, the Haitian government had made significant progress in recent years in many areas of its development strategy, including security; judicial reform; macroeconomic management; procurement processes and fiscal transparency; increased voter registration; and jobs creation. It had also made progress in providing broader access to clean water and other services. Parliamentary elections scheduled for February 2010 have been delayed. There is tentative agreement that Haiti will hold joint parliamentary and presidential elections in November 2010. President Pr\u00e9val's term will end in February 2011, and he is not eligible to run for reelection. The destruction of Haiti's nascent infrastructure and other extensive damage caused by January's earthquake will set back Haiti's development significantly. U.N. Special Envoy and former President Bill Clinton said that Haiti's long-term development plans \"will need to be amended ... but they cannot be abandoned.\" Soon after the earthquake, the government of Haiti and the international donor community held meetings and conferences to begin planning a long-term strategy for Haitian recovery.  A major global donors' conference was held March 31, 2010, in New York at which 48 countries, multilateral institutions, and a coalition of non-governmental organizations pledged $5.3 billion for the first 18 months of Haiti's reconstruction, part of nearly $10 billion pledged toward long-term reconstruction efforts. The IDB damage assessment stated that donor coordination will be key in any reconstruction effort. The report further noted that there are different models for coordination, but that however it is coordinated, \"[a] single executing agency with appropriate powers, transparency and accountability to the Haitian Government and donors would be helpful\" in achieving the needed coordination on the ground. To that end, Haiti and the international donor community have established a Multi-Donor Trust Fund to monitor, coordinate, and distribute funds. The Obama Administration is requesting $2.8 billion in FY2010 supplemental funding to cover costs associated with relief and reconstruction support for Haiti. The U.S. pledge of $1.2 billion made at the donors conference is included in that request. It is estimated that 3 million people, approximately one-third of the overall population, have been affected by the earthquake. The government of Haiti is reporting an estimated 230,000 deaths (2% of the population), 300,600 injured and 383 missing. Earlier reports indicated there were 1.2 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), which included 700,000 people displaced in the Port-au-Prince area, many without shelter, and more than 597,000 people who left Port-au-Prince for rural areas. More recent numbers indicate a higher number of IDPs with a possible total of over 2 million displaced in Haiti. This number includes 1.69 million displaced in settlements in Port-au-Prince and more than 300,000 in areas outside the city. Much smaller numbers of Haitians have left for the Dominican Republic, nearby islands, and the United States. According to the State Department, a total of 16,000 Americans in Haiti have been accounted for, and 16,704 U.S. citizens have been evacuated. There are 103 reported deaths of U.S. citizens due to the earthquake. Now that commercial airlines are operating out of Port-au-Prince, the U.S. embassy is no longer assisting with citizen evacuations.  In the immediate wake of the earthquake, President Pr\u00e9val described conditions in his country as \"unimaginable,\" and appealed for international assistance. The country's top priority was to conduct search and rescue operations for survivors. Other material priorities included an offshore vessel medical unit and electricity generation capability. The government also requested communications equipment so that government officials could better function and coordinate response efforts. As those immediate needs are met and the humanitarian relief operation continues, the government is struggling to restore the institutions needed for it to function and to address long-term reconstruction and development planning. \"The first thing is political stability,\" said Pr\u00e9val. \"Secondly, we hope the international community will help us in the short-term, mid-term, and long-term.\"  Prior to this disaster, the World Bank and others were working with the Haitian government to incorporate disaster risk management into Haiti's overall development strategy and to develop its capacity for disaster response. The capacity was still in its early stages, however, and the focus of much of its risk management efforts was not geared toward earthquakes, but toward hurricanes, which are the most common cause of natural disasters on the island. The last major earthquake in Haiti was 150 years ago, in 1860. Some Haitians complain that they have seen or heard little of President Pr\u00e9val since the earthquake. The perception that the Haitian government was not doing enough contributed to calls by some Haitians, both in Haiti and the United States, for the United States to take control of Haiti in place of the current government in the days following the disaster. The destruction of buildings, equipment, and loss of skilled personnel has drastically reduced the ability of the government to respond rapidly. According to the Haitian Chamber of Commerce, the earthquake destroyed approximately 25,000 public and commercial buildings. Twenty-one out of 22 Ministry buildings were destroyed. Along with the buildings, government records were destroyed; re-establishing and expanding transparency in government spending will be particularly challenging. These losses, plus the difficulty of delivering and transporting material supplies, will hinder delivery of services. The already significant need for services is now vastly expanded. Haitian ministries are addressing issues such as long-term housing for those left homeless by the earthquake as they operate out of makeshift offices. Haitian authorities and international relief agencies are delivering food and water to hundreds of makeshift camps in Port-au-Prince. The government provided free transportation to evacuate people from the capital to cities not damaged by the earthquake. Interior Minister Paul Antoine Bien-Aime indicated that as many as 482,000 people may be relocated outside Port-au-Prince. The Haitian government is sending officials to small cities to help officials in those communities establish priorities. Other elements of the government are working along with international actors. The Haitian National Police are contributing to maintaining security, for example, and Haitian air traffic controllers are working along with U.S. controllers at the Port-au-Prince airport. The Haitian government, the United Nations, and donor representatives met in Haiti on January 14 to coordinate their efforts, and have continued to do so at various conferences. Eighteen Haitian senators elected two commissions on January 28 to monitor aid and manage agreements with aid organizations.  President Pr\u00e9val and Prime Minister Bellerive went to the March 31 international donors'conference with a 10-year recovery action plan. According to the Haiti Post Disaster Needs Assessment conducted by Haiti and international institutions, the total value of recovery and reconstruction needs is $11.5 billion. At the conference The Pr\u00e9val Administration sought a minimum of $3.9 billion for the first 18 months of Haiti's reconstruction. The priorities the Haitian government established in the \"Action Plan for the Reconstruction and National Development of Haiti\" are: ensuring preparedness for the 2010 rainy and hurricane seasons, especially for displaced populations; providing assistance to the population affected by the earthquake while hastening recovery efforts with an eye to reducing dependence on foreign aid; including environmental factors and risk and disaster management in all recovery and reconstruction activities; actively providing employment and vocational training; strengthening governmental authority while also decentralizing basic services, creating a social safety net for the poorest population; and creating growth poles to support and encourage settlement of displaced populations around the country and to make Port-au-Prince less congested. Haitian government officials see the earthquake's devastation in Port-au-Prince as an opportunity to establish a more sustainable distribution of population elsewhere in the country. Bellerive has asked international donors to aid in a massive revival of agriculture, in order to provide jobs and keep relocated Haitians in the provinces. Some observers have questioned whether historical and current allegations of various levels of corruption in the Haitian government may impair short- and long-term recovery efforts. The government of Haiti made major progress in recent years in reducing corruption, increasing transparency, and improving fiscal management. These improvements qualified Haiti for Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) debt relief last year. In its new Action Plan, the government said the momentum of those programs must continue, and proposed the Interim Commission for the Reconstruction of Haiti, a Development Agency, and the Multi-Donor Trust Fund to improve development planning, coordination, and accountability. New concerns about transparency and oversight may also arise as the legislature ceases to function as a whole because elections have not been held. Normally, the legislature must approve federal procurement contracts, and authorize spending. Under a State of Emergency law passed by the legislature in April, the executive branch will have those powers for the next 18 months. Haiti passed a State of Emergency Law on April 20 giving the President broad powers. The terms of all of the Chamber of Deputies, and of one-third of the Senate, will expire on May 10. How the government will function after that is not entirely clear. President Pr\u00e9val will probably rule by decree. The remaining 19 Senators may continue to meet, however, and the Senate has the power to dismiss the Prime Minister and censure government programs. As a result, political tensions are likely to increase. The international community is urging Haiti to hold legislative and presidential elections in November 2010. Pr\u00e9val has promised to step down when his term expires on February 7, 2011. The U.N. Security Council created the U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) on April 30, 2004, having determined that the situation in Haiti continued to be a threat to international peace and security in the region and acting under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter. As a U.N.-conducted peacekeeping operation, MINUSTAH was given a mandate under three broad areas: a secure and stable environment, the political process, and human rights. On October 13, 2009, the Council extended its mandate until October 15, 2010, \"with the intention of further renewal.\" The Council monitors the activities of MINUSTAH through semiannual reports made by the U.N. Secretary-General and his special representative, and also not later than 45 days before expiration of its mandate.  On January 19, 2010, the U.N. Security Council increased the overall force levels of MINUSTAH \"to support the immediate recovery, reconstruction and stability efforts.\" The Council decided that \"MINUSTAH will consist of a military component of up to 8,940 troops of all ranks and of a police component of up to 3,711 police and that it will keep the new levels of troops and police in MINUSTAH under review as necessary.\" The limits had been set at 6,940 for the military component and 2,211 for the police component. As of April 13, 2010, the military component of MINUSTAH totaled 8,306 troops, including four engineering companies, and 2,178 police officers.  On April 28, 2010, the U.N. Security Council met to consider the situation in Haiti, especially the April 2010 report of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on MINUSTAH. This was his first report since September 1, 2009 and covered up to April 15, 2010, with a focus on events since the earthquake. Ban noted, in his report,  that his Special Representative will continue to oversee the activities of the whole United Nations system and, within means and capabilities, ensure the full support of the MINUSTAH military, police and logistics components to humanitarian and recovery efforts.  Ban proposed that MINUSTAH \"assume the lead role in coordinating international electoral assistance in order to ensure its efficiency and avoid the duplication of efforts.\" Ban observed that a \"major focus of effort will be timely preparations for the 2010 presidential, legislative and municipal elections.\" In addition, he stated that MINUSTAH \"will reconfigure the military component within the existing troop ceiling to provide additional military engineers on a surge basis.\" Ban also recommended that the Council increase the MINUSTAH police component, adding 680 police personnel to the force levels already authorized by the Council in January 2010. As of May 3, 2010, the Council has not acted in response to the report of the Secretary-General.  The headquarters of the U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) was demolished in the earthquake, with 101 U.N. staff confirmed dead. These included the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of MINUSTAH Hedi Annabi and his Deputy, Luiz Carlos da Costa. On March 31, 2010, Secretary-General Ban announced the appointment of Edmond Mulet, as his Special Representative (SRSG) for Haiti and Head of MINUSTAH. Since January 14, 2010, Mr. Mulet had been acting SRSG and Head of MINUSTAH. On April 29, 2010, Ban announced the appointment of Kevin Kennedy (United States) as Deputy Special Representative for Haiti and Deputy Head of MINUSTAH, succeeding Mr. da Costa, and Nigel Fisher (Canada) as Deputy Special Representative, Ad Interim, for Haiti, succeeding Kim Bolduc (Canada).  On March 24, 2010, President Obama, in a supplemental budget request to Congress on Haiti, requested in the State Department's Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA) account a total of $96.5 million for U.S. assessed contributions to MINUSTAH. This was to fund the increase in assessments resulting from the Security Council's increase in force levels on January 19, 2010. The March 24 supplemental request also included, under Foreign Operations, in the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement Affairs (INCLE) account, $45,000,000 to support U.S. personnel to MINUSTAH: the \"secondment of 50 police advisers, five corrections advisers, and one drug specialist.\" These funds would increase the U.S. police and corrections officer contribution to MINUSTAH from 50 and 5 to 80 and 10, respectively. Experts break relief operations into several phases: search and rescue; treatment and survival; relocation and rehabilitation; early recovery; and long-term reconstruction. As with any significant natural disaster that has many moving parts, it can take days to get a relief effort underway. Delays in transportation and congestion, lack of transportation infrastructure, bureaucratic problems, and lack of access all can cause bottlenecks at key points in the system. While timing is critical to save lives, to enable a network of this size to function efficiently requires the coordination of assessments and appropriate responses with the government, local communities, and the international community.  The sheer scale of the relief effort in Haiti has brought together tremendous capacity and willingness to help, but an ongoing effort and strategic planning is required at each phase to work out coordination and logistics issues. The massive humanitarian relief operation underway was hampered by a number of significant challenges, including a general lack of transportation, extremely limited communications systems, and damaged infrastructure. In many parts of Port-au-Prince, roads were ruptured or blocked by collapsed buildings, debris, bodies, and people seeking open space. Working conditions remain hugely challenging for aid personnel. Humanitarian supplies are coming in to Haiti via Port-au-Prince and Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The airport in the Dominican Republic is also being used as a humanitarian staging area to help with the coordination effort and allow for relief teams and supplies to get to Haiti by land.  Challenges consistent with a response to a disaster of this scope continue. In the first two weeks following the earthquake, priorities were focused on (1) search and rescue assistance, including teams with heavy-lift equipment and medical assistance and supplies; (2) addressing a critical need for food, clean water and sanitation, medical assistance, and emergency shelter; and (3) setting up key infrastructure and logistics operations. Three months after the disaster, the relief effort remains an immediate and critical priority amid plans under discussion for early recovery and reconstruction. There are concerns about security and potential for looting and violence, but according to the United Nations, the overall situation remains calm and stable, with some incidences of looting and criminality. However, 5,000 or so prison inmates escaped the National Penitentiary and other jails in Port-au-Prince during the earthquake (with some re-apprehended) and the whereabouts of the others is unknown, although it is suspected that a significant number may have retreated to Cite Soleil. Reports of rape cases in camps, roadblocks and fake tolls along roads, and other possible gang activity related to drugs and other crimes point to involvement by some of these criminals. U.N. and government officials are urging Haitians to turn in escaped criminals while also focusing on specific security interventions focused on their recapture. More in-depth assessments, necessary to obtain a better understanding of the situation on the ground, continue. The Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) a joint effort among representatives from the Government of Haiti, World Bank, United Nations and other actors, was completed in time for the March 31 conference in New York. The information is critical for determining whether personnel are in place with adequate resources, planning recovery and reconstruction initiatives, developing strategies for the use of funding, and paving the way for donor pledges and long-term support. The PDNA and donors conference are discussed later in the report. At the outset of the disaster, the United Nations established Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) and U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) teams. The UNDAC team coordinated the Onsite Operations and Coordination Center (OSOCC). Two sub-OSOCCs were established in Jacmel and Leogane to assist local authorities. The UNDAC team concluded its work in Haiti in February. In the weeks following the earthquake, OCHA helped to coordinate the search and rescue teams and continues to coordinate the assistance effort while focusing on other humanitarian priorities. In addition to working closely with the government of Haiti, OCHA is the lead agency working with actors on the ground, coordinating with the military, and enlisting donor support. The Humanitarian Country Team convened on February 1 and meets twice a week, with at least one of those meetings co-chaired by a representative from the government of Haiti. In consultation with MINUSTAH and international military forces, OCHA has developed a Joint Operations Tasking Centre (JOTC) which began operating on January 26 and focuses on civil-military coordination and logistics. The OCHA Civil-Military Coordination (CMCoord) team first convened on January 31 and brings together civil-military points of contact from humanitarian organizations, MINUSTAH, and international military forces. A Debris Management Planning Task Force was assembled on February 23. Humanitarian relief sectors are typically established during humanitarian crises to enable the United Nations to coordinate partners, prioritize resources, and facilitate planning. In Haiti, relief sectors have been organized into twelve clusters led by various agencies. The clusters include  Agriculture (Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO); Camp Coordination and Camp Management (International Organization for Migration, IOM); Early Recovery (U.N. Development Program, UNDP); Education (U.N. Children's Fund, UNICEF); Emergency Shelter and Non-Food Items (International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, IFRC); Emergency Telecommunications (World Food Program, WFP); Food (World Food Program, WFP); Health (World Health Organization, WHO, and Pan American Health Organization, PAHO). Logistics (WFP); Nutrition (UNICEF); Protection (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, OHCHR), with Child Protection (UNICEF); Gender Based Violence (U.N. Population Fund, UNFPA); Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (UNICEF). Initially, there were criticisms of the slow initial response by the humanitarian aid community to the crisis. In recent press conferences, the United Nations has stated the cluster system appears to be working well, but others suggest that some clusters appear to be doing better than others. Cluster arrangements have also been established in Leogane, Jacmel, and Gonaives. The cluster set up in the Dominican Republic was dissolved on April 13. Emergency Shelter: After the earthquake struck, people began gathering spontaneously in open spaces in Port-au-Prince. It was estimated that there were 500 or more makeshift camp sites with a combined total of more than 700,000 people. Aid workers are delivering basic necessities to areas with population concentrations. Emergency shelter was in very short supply. Reports indicate that 97,000 houses were destroyed and 188,000 sustained damage. It is estimated that 1.9 million lost their homes. Approximately 597,000 people were initially reported to have relocated in departments outside the city, with the highest number concentrated in Artibonite Department. Reports indicated that a number of areas saw increases of 15%-20% in the population. Ninety percent of the new arrivals were staying with host families. Reportedly, prices of basic commodities increased. See the maps in Appendix B and Appendix C . In early April, the estimated number of displaced was adjusted, with an increase in the number of IDPs in Port-au-Prince to 1.69 million and IDPs displaced in areas outside the city appearing to decrease to 300,000. The adjustment may in part reflect more accurate numbers as a result of IDP registrations. It may also reflect a \"pull factor\" where those who left Port-au-Prince initially are now returning to the capitol as services improve and recovery gets underway. The United Nations reports that 86% of the known caseload of IDPs have been reached with emergency shelter materials. As the rainy season begins, there remain concerns about whether there is sufficient waterproof emergency shelter, the need to move people from unsafe settlements, and ongoing challenges to improve sanitation. In addition, houses and buildings weakened by the earthquake could collapse or slide in wet conditions, adding to the 65 million tons of rubble needing to be removed. Finding space to shelter the displaced remains an issue. For those living in unsafe areas, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has identified several options: (1) return to the permanent home if the structure is considered safe; (2) return to home area to a temporary shelter or proximity site; (3) seek accommodation with host communities\u2014usually relatives or friends; (4) relocate to a new site. The first phase of humanitarian relocations for vulnerable families living in high-risk displacement sites was completed at the end of April, with more than 1,750 families moving to two temporary relocation sites at the edge of Port-au-Prince. Another plot in Corail Cesselesse (Port-au-Prince) has received over 3,000 people. IOM also reported that an estimated 49% of IDPs in the Port-au-Prince area were renters prior to the earthquake and 37% owned their own homes (14% did not identify their status.) Providing sustainable, long-term shelter to renters may be more problematic as renters do not own land for shelter installation and landowners may decide not to rebuild rental homes. In addition, owners of private schools have forced the eviction of those inhabiting their property as they seek to reopen their schools. Where to build on a more permanent basis will be a major decision\u2014many of the poorest people were squatters on land subject to landslides and floods. The type of structures to be built will also have to be determined as there will be a need for inexpensive housing that is both earthquake- and hurricane-resistant. Food: Food and water are reaching people every day, but the needs remain constant. It is estimated that 2 million people in Haiti need regular food aid. Some areas outside Port-au-Prince that were previously considered food secure are facing difficulties as prices increase. Supplementary food programs have been launched for children under 5 and pregnant women in the Port-au-Prince area. WFP has provided emergency food rations to 3.5 million people since the earthquake struck. The heads of three U.N. agencies \u2013 WFP, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) formed a new Task Force for Food Security in Haiti. The task force aims to assist the Haitian government with the implementation of a coordinated and targeted immediate and long term food security strategy. It will also work with the relevant U.N. humanitarian clusters. The WFP is now transitioning to a focus on long-term food security and investments in human capital programs. As part of this initiative, it is also rolling out food- and cash-for-work initiatives. Health: Acute respiratory illness is the most commonly reported illness, and in recent weeks, there have been some possible cases of malaria identified, but disease remains at baseline rates with none at epidemic levels. The health cluster is coordinating closely with other clusters on food assistance, shelter, sanitation, and education to assist the Haitian population. The need for sanitation and medical assistance remains. Limited follow-up, post-operative care is available and amputees are among those requiring longer-term assistance. The government of Haiti has shifted away from emergency services to focus on primary health care, health centers, and hospitals. The focus of the health cluster is also on basic primary health care services, such as maternal child health, rehabilitation services, and chronic diseases including diabetes, heart disease, HIV, and tuberculosis. Vaccination programs are being implemented and a targeted immunization program for populations in temporary settlements began on February 2. The provision of mental health care and psychosocial support to help survivors deal with trauma is also a recognized priority and organizations are mobilizing to address this issue. The identification and collection of mortal remains continues. Logistics: In both Haiti and the Dominican Republic, WFP is heading the in-country Food aid, Logistics and Emergency Telecommunications clusters. UNHAS is running a twice daily flight from Santa Domingo to Port-au-Prince. The WFP is prepositioning food and non-food items as well as equipment throughout Haiti in preparation for the hurricane season. Protection: The sub-cluster is focused on child protection activities in settlements, orphanages, and hospitals to determine the needs of children and to provide care to separated and unaccompanied children. Another main priority is protection of children during the relocation process. With so many people displaced and in need of protection, general security against crime is a critical concern. In addition, protection activities are focused on Haitian children displaced in the Dominican Republic. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH): A water supply strategy is being planned to phase out water trucking and to develop more sustainable options. Limited water network capacity remains a challenge. Access to safe drinking water has improved. Latrine usage and sanitation remain problems at spontaneous settlements. Increasing sanitation support is a main priority. This is seen as an important public health issue to avoid spread of disease, particularly during the rainy season. Plans are underway to increase the provision of water and sanitation services in communities. Education: Schools in areas unaffected by the earthquake reopened on February 1. Schools continue to open progressively, although the official reopening of schools was on April 5. Approximately 700 schools have now reopened in Port-au-Prince. The United Nations reports that 4,000 students were killed in the earthquake. It is estimated that 1,300 schools were destroyed and between 2,000 to 4,600 schools were damaged by the earthquake. Temporary schools are being provided with shelters, safe water, sanitation facilities, and educational materials for the rainy/hurricane season. Fourteen percent of the population of Haiti is under 14 years of age. Early Recovery: More than 95,700 people have been employed under UNDP's cash-for-work program. Activities include clearance of drainage canals and the removal of rubble. A number of natural disasters have struck Haiti in the last decade (mostly in the form of hurricanes), prompting the need for international assistance through the United Nations and other actors. In addition to miscellaneous humanitarian funding provided for general emergency conditions, specific natural disasters include: Floods\u2014May 2002 Tropical Storm Jeanne/Floods\u2014September 2004 Floods\u2014November 2006 Hurricane Dean\u2014August 2007 Hurricane Felix\u2014September 2007 Tropical Storm Noel\u2014October 2007 Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, and Tropical Storms Fay and Hanna\u2014September 2008 Haiti Earthquake\u2014January 2010 Disaster risks in Haiti are significant. Experts recognize that finding ways to overcome the cycle of disaster and develop a disaster response capacity are critical not only to minimize humanitarian consequences but to sustain reconstruction efforts in the future. The international community has provided significant humanitarian assistance in response to these disasters and their ongoing impact. The United Nations, along with other partners, including the United States, has had a strong presence in Haiti, and remains at the forefront of the current on-the-ground response for humanitarian assistance. Many international actors are providing humanitarian relief to Haiti, either through financial contributions to the government of Haiti or aid organizations or by directly providing relief supplies and emergency personnel. International recovery efforts are typically complex because they require coordination among numerous different actors and international entities. In the current crisis, apart from U.N. agencies, those responding to humanitarian crises include international organizations, NGOs, Private Voluntary Agencies (PVOs), and bilateral and multilateral donors.  The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is working with the Haitian Red Cross Society (HRCS) and other national red cross societies, including the American Red Cross, to provide assistance to earthquake survivors. The IFRC is coordinating efforts with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which is focused on medical assistance, tracing the missing and helping to restore family links. The ICRC is also helping with the identification and collection of mortal remains. In recent weeks, ICRC delegates have also visited 700 or so detainees in detention facilities in Port-au-Prince and Cap Haitien. Representatives of more than 20 national societies gathered in Montreal, Canada in mid February for a two-day meeting to develop a comprehensive approach with the red cross movement to Haiti's needs. Various international NGOs that were already operating in Haiti before the earthquake mobilized to respond to the crisis. According to the United Nations, there are reportedly more than 900 NGOs focused on humanitarian relief operating in Haiti. Hundreds of local staff are assisting with the relief effort.  Prior to the January earthquake, and in response to other natural disasters, the United States was already providing humanitarian assistance to Haiti (see Table 1 below.) Following the earthquake, on January 13, 2010, U.S. Ambassador to Haiti Kenneth H. Merten issued a disaster declaration, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), through the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), authorized $50,000 for the initial implementation of an emergency response program. (See Appendix E for further information about the U.S. Government humanitarian response mechanism.) The embassy also facilitated the evacuation of U.S. citizens and issued a travel warning. The U.S. government immediately set up an interagency task force to coordinate and facilitate the humanitarian response to the earthquake in Haiti through the Washington, DC-based Response Management Team (RMT) headed by U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), through the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA). In the first three months following the earthquake, the overall focus of the U.S. government's response has included search and rescue, logistics and infrastructure support, provision of assistance, and conducting needs assessments.  On January 14, 2010, President Obama announced $100 million in humanitarian assistance (in addition to pre-existing funding appropriated for Haiti) to meet the immediate needs on the ground. As of April 30, 2010, USAID reported that the United States has provided more than $1 billion in humanitarian funding for Haiti as follows:  The Administration is requesting a total of $1.5 billion in relief and disaster assistance funding for Haiti, which would reimburse U.S. government agencies for services provided and for funds already obligated for ongoing relief activities. The humanitarian relief funding request also covers other relief-related assistance. The $1.5 billion request includes $350.7 million for USAID International Disaster Assistance (IDA); $150 million for Agriculture Department emergency food assistance; $96.5 million for State Department: Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities; $655 million for Department of Defense and $45 million for U.S. Coast Guard relief activities; $220 million for Department of Health and Human Services to provide grants to States to cover services to Haitian evacuees; and $15 million for Department of Homeland Security immigration fees. The activities of two of the key agencies\u2014USAID and DOD\u2014are described briefly below. Within 24 hours of the earthquake, the United States began deploying search and rescue teams along with support staff, and including search and rescue canines and rescue equipment, from Fairfax, VA, Los Angeles, and Miami. USAID/OFDA also deployed a 32-member Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART). The RMT (mentioned above) supported the USAID/DART, which focused on assessing humanitarian needs, positioning emergency relief supplies, and coordinating assistance with the U.S. Embassy in Haiti, the government of Haiti, and the international community. USAID personnel have been active in the following U.N. clusters: Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene; Emergency Food Assistance and Food Security Planning; Logistics; Health; and Shelter, and Protection. USAID/OFDA issues regular situation reports assessing the progress of relief operations. See map in Appendix D . On April 25, the USAID/DART transitioned to the USAID/OFDA Program Office. In response to the crisis in Haiti, the Department of Defense (DOD) deployed a broad range of military assets in Operation Unified Response to support U.S. and international assistance efforts. On February 1, 2010, Admiral Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated that \"We will remain in Haiti just as long as we are needed. At the request of the Haitian government and in partnership with the U.N. and international community, we will continue to do all that is required to alleviate suffering there.\" (See Appendix F for further information on the military units participating in Operation Unified Response.) At the peak of operations, DOD had deployed over 22,000 personnel, 15 Navy and Coast Guard vessels, and 58 aircraft to Haiti, including 7,000 ground troops. Currently, 1,000 soldiers remain ashore in Haiti and will remain through May, when they will be replaced with 500 Louisiana National Guard troops dedicated to reconstruction efforts. The USS Iwo Jima, an amphibious assault ship, will remain in the region through the upcoming hurricane season.  U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), located in Miami, oversaw the Department's response efforts, and U.S. Northern Command detailed over 100 disaster recovery specialists to Operation Unified Response. SOUTHCOM is well-experienced in this type of operation, having supported 14 relief missions in the Latin American and Caribbean area since 2005. SOUTHCOM's initial assessment team, consisting of military engineers, operational planners, and command and control communication specialists, deployed to Haiti within 24 hours of the earthquake. U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command personnel dispatched to the Port au Prince International Airport restored air traffic control capability and rapidly enabled round-the-clock airfield operations. The airport can now handle up to 120 flights a day, up from the 20 daily flights it handled prior to the earthquake. According to SOUTHCOM, over 14,000 U.S. citizens were evacuated safely.  U.S. military forces have delivered over 2.6 million bottled waters, 2.3 million food rations, 15 million lbs of bulk food, more than 125,000 lbs of medical supplies, and more than 844,000 lbs of bulk fuel. Additional tasks undertaken by DOD personnel included casualty treatment both ashore and afloat, aerial reconnaissance to assist rescue/supply efforts, the distribution of 73,000 hand-crank commercial radios, and the provision of radio broadcast capacity for emergency services information. The U.S. Air Force's Air Mobility Command (AMC) provided a range of transport aircraft, including C-17 Globemaster IIIs and C-130 Hercules. Air National Guard units from Ohio and Puerto Rico also provided transport aircraft. The Navy Expeditionary Combat Command deployed units that can provide explosive ordnance disposal, maritime and riverine security, diving/salvage experts, and naval construction personnel. U.S. Navy surveillance and Air Force unmanned aircraft performed aerial surveys of the earthquake damage to assist remediation efforts. Of particular importance to improving rescue/recovery supply operations, a U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Transportation Recovery Unit coordinated efforts to restore the Port au Prince harbor facilities, and the U.S. Navy deployed a variety of specialized ships (salvage, heavy-crane, and oceanographic survey) to assist in these efforts. To date, eight Haitian ports are fully operational, and Port-au-Prince facilities are operating at partial capacity.  The 22 nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (2,000 personnel) and a brigade combat team from the 82 nd Airborne Division (3,400 personnel) have conducted security/humanitarian operations. Though there have been incidents of violence and looting, military commanders noted these have been concentrated primarily in areas known for violence prior to the earthquake, and the commanders are optimistic that violence will not spread to the general population, provided that the distribution of basic humanitarian supplies continues to improve. Fewer than 1% of the U.S. military personnel in Haiti have been required to conduct security operations. A U.S. Marine Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Team has provided protection for U.S. Embassy facilities. Civil Affairs units from the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps deployed to stricken areas to facilitate interaction between the population, the Haitian government, and organizations undertaking relief and recovery operations. The U.S. Coast Guard has undertaken the air-medical evacuation of injured U.S. civilian personnel to the Guantanamo Naval Station, supplied two C-130 transport aircraft, and deployed six cutters. The Department of Defense has requested a supplemental appropriation of $655 million for its humanitarian relief efforts in Haiti. This request comprises $133.3 million each for both the Army and Navy Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Accounts, $133.4 million for the Air Force Operations and Maintenance, and $255 million for the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid Account (OHDACA). The requested funds for the Services will back-fill the $400 million in O&M funds that were initially reprogrammed to the OHDACA account, the account used by DOD to conduct humanitarian relief efforts. The $255 million requested for OHDACA fulfills the remainder of the $655 million requirement for Operation Unified Response. This supplemental request covers expenses already incurred, in addition to permitting continued operations through June 15, 2010. Specifically, the funding will provide for soldier subsistence; personal, operational, transportation support; humanitarian relief supplies; and a number of humanitarian relief projects. There is no central database that tracks activities and funding of national or international NGOs. It is therefore not possible to provide comprehensive and accurate information on their programs and funding, either for this crisis or for activities over the past decade. The United States Institute of Peace estimates that prior to the earthquake, the number of NGOs operating in Haiti ranged from 3,000 to 10,000.  U.S.-based NGOs are playing an active role in the relief and recovery effort in Haiti, several of them with U.S. government funding. A list of U.S. NGOs working in Haiti can be obtained from a variety of sources. A NGO Coordination Unit has been established to ensure better coordination among NGOs, the United Nations, and the military.  In the FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-117 ) Congress provided \"not less than $295,530,000\" for assistance for Haiti, about $2.7 million more than the Administration had requested. Congress also included Haiti in the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, to provide equipment and training to combat drug trafficking and related violence and organized crime, and for judicial reform, institution building, education, anti-corruption, rule of law activities, and maritime security. (See \" Legislation in the 111 th Congress \" section below.) The estimated FY2010 assistance for Haiti is $363 million, including $23 million and $121 million for Global Health and Child Survival under USAID and State Department, respectively; $161 million in Economic Support Funds; $35.5 million in P.L. 480 food aid; $21 million for International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement; $0.22 million for International Military Education and Training, and $1.6 million in Foreign Military Financing.  The Administration had requested $359 million in FY2011 assistance for Haiti, including $35 million and $121 million for Global Health and Child Survival under USAID and State Department, respectively; $146 million in Economic Support Funds; $35.5 million in P.L. 480 food aid; $19 million for International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement; $0.22 million for International Military Education and Training, and $1.6 million in Foreign Military Financing. The Obama Administration is requesting $2.8 billion in FY2010 supplemental funding to cover costs associated with relief and reconstruction support for Haiti following the earthquake.  The Administration has requested that all of the proposed funds be considered as emergency requirements, in response to urgent and essential needs in Haiti. Some of the funds are available until September 30, 2012, others until expended. The supplemental request covers both reimbursement of obligations already incurred and new activities by various U.S. agencies . CRS estimates that 55% of the total Haiti supplemental request is for reimbursement of relief activities related to the earthquake disaster, 40% for new recovery and reconstruction activities, and 6% for diplomatic operations administration. A great many international actors are also providing relief to Haiti, either through financial contributions to the government of Haiti or aid organizations or by directly providing relief supplies and emergency personnel. The earthquake disaster in Haiti has received worldwide attention and focus. Under the U.N. Consolidated Appeals Process, on January 15, 2010, the U.N. Humanitarian Country Team in Haiti issued a Flash Appeal for emergency financial assistance in the amount of $575 million to support emergency food aid, health, water, sanitation, emergency education, and other key needs and early recovery efforts (typically the initial six months after a disaster). As of February 15, commitments of $619 million had been received (107 % of the Flash Appeal) and a further $29 million in uncommitted pledges. On February 19, 2010, the United Nations announced that it had revised its humanitarian aid appeal for Haiti to $1.44B \u2013 a record high. The Revised Humanitarian Appeal includes the original six-month Flash Appeal amount and it extends the humanitarian operation through 2010. As of April 29, 2010, commitments of $831 million (55.4% of the Revised Appeal) had been received and a further $27 million in uncommitted pledges. Additional pledges and contributions have also been made outside the Flash Appeal. Many countries, including the U.S. government, are providing assistance in the form of direct contributions of items such as food and tents, or through the operation of relief flights and logistics support. In addition to bilateral assistance, funding has also been provided to NGOs operating outside of the U.N. appeal.  The Emergency Relief Response Fund for Haiti has more than $76 million in pledges, of which $63 million has been received. These funds have been allocated by cluster to U.N. and NGO organizations. The U.N.'s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) initially made available $10 million which later increased to $37.9 million.  So far, through governments and the private sector, the international community has pledged millions of dollars in aid, materials, and technical support. Appendix G highlights donor contributions and in-kind pledges. At least 116 countries from around the world have contributed to the relief effort. Obtaining an exact up-to-date record of all international contributions is not possible\u2014in part because some assistance is not reported to governments or coordinating agencies\u2014and in part because of the delay in their recording. As the recovery effort gets underway, the Haitian government is considering a geographical distribution of tasks or tasks that are theme based as a way of engaging donor interest. For example, one country might \"adopt\" a province or city or target a specific need in the Haitian government. Private sector assistance has already been substantial and is expected to continue to grow. Some reports indicate that as of April 2010, private companies and individuals had contributed more than $1 billion to support relief efforts in Haiti. Initiatives in the United States include the campaign by the American Red Cross to raise funds through text messages ($31 million), the Hollywood star-studded telethon that featured performances by a broad range of musicians and was broadcast on major U.S. television networks ($66 million), and numerous local fund raising activities.  On January 16, 2010, President Obama announced that former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, who is also serving as the U.N. Special Envoy to Haiti, would lead a fundraising effort and work with the U.S. private sector in support of Haiti. The initiative is called the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. Cash donations are being encouraged. To date, the fund has received more than $200,000 in contributions. On March 22, Presidents Bush and Clinton visited Haiti to assess relief and recovery efforts. President Pr\u00e9val has asked the international community to focus not just on immediate humanitarian relief efforts, but also on long-term development needs.  Discussions among the government of Haiti and the international donor community regarding a long-term strategy for Haiti began almost immediately. To that end, at a preliminary meeting among some international donors held in the Dominican Republic the week following the earthquake, Dominican President Leonel Fernandez proposed a $10 billion five-year assistance program for Haiti.  Representatives from Haiti, the \"Friends of Haiti\" nations, other countries, and U.N. officials held a high-level Ministerial Conference in Montreal, Canada, on January 25, 2010, to discuss reconstruction plans for Haiti. Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive thanked the donor community for its help so far, but said that an international commitment of 5 to 10 years was needed to support Haitian development. Conferees agreed to study recent examples of multilateral recovery efforts in order to develop an optimal aid-delivery mechanism that ensures effectiveness and accountability, and creates the conditions for sustainable development.  The World Economic Forum launched a global initiative to integrate business into Haiti's reconstruction at its meeting January 27-31. The global donor conference in New York on March 31 secured commitments for substantial funds for Haiti's recovery. Donors pledged nearly $10 billion toward long-term reconstruction efforts, $5.3 billion of that for the first 18 months. These pledges are in addition to commitments made to the U.N. flash appeal for Haiti. The Obama Administration, other international donors, the Haitian government, and others actors have all stated the need for improved accountability of all donor assistance to Haiti, to improve aid effectiveness and reduce the potential for corruption. Several entities have been established to improve development planning, coordination, and accountability. Although some Haitians think foreign donors are exerting too much control through these mechanisms, Haitian President Rene Pr\u00e9val and Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive have acknowledged that Haitian capacities were already limited, and were considerably diminished by the earthquake, and proposed such entities in their action plan. The National Assembly approved the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission. Multi Donor Trust Fund. The World Bank will receive international funding and act as the fiscal agent for the funds. The Haitian government will lead a Steering Committee that will decide which agencies will receive the funds. The Bank will ensure that the Haitian government is meeting legal requirements before funds are transferred to it for budget support.  Haiti Reconstruction Platform . To ensure further transparency, the U.S. Agency for International Development has helped Haiti establish an internet-based system to track donor pledges, and monitor the implementation and spending of assistance. Interim Haiti Recovery Commission. Before the conference, the Pr\u00e9val Administration announced the formation of this Commission to guide long term development. It is to be co-chaired by former President Clinton and Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive. Other members are to include two Haitian legislators, local authorities, union and business representatives, a Caribbean Community (Caricom) delegate, and one representative of each of Haiti's largest donors. Those donors include the United States, Canada, Brazil, France, Venezuela and the European Union, as well as the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, and the United Nations. It is designed to give Haitian officials the opportunity to exert leadership regarding their priorities, while working with international experts to hone their ability to design and execute development programs and process foreign assistance. According to Secretary of State Clinton's chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, the goal is to turn the process over to Haitian authorities in 18 months, at which time it would become the Haitian Development Authority .  The United Nations, in association with other U.N. system agencies and programs, conducted the initial needs assessments necessary for planning Haiti's long-term and comprehensive recovery. Among the major actors involved were the World Bank, the U.N. Development Program, the multitude of U.N. specialized agencies (such as the World Health Organization, the U.N. Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization), as well as regional organizations, including the European Union (EU), the Organization for American States (OAS), the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Caribbean Community (Caricom). Many of these organizations worked together previously in Haiti in response to the 2008 hurricanes and are responding to the international humanitarian needs in the aftermath of the earthquake. The Human Rights Council held a special session on Haiti on January 27-28, 2010, and in its resolution, it stressed the importance of protecting human rights during the recovery effort. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has sent a human rights monitoring team to Haiti. The OHCHR along with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) continue to press all countries to suspend involuntary returns to Haiti due to the humanitarian crisis. The multilateral development banks (MDBs) have been active in Haiti for several years, providing debt relief, loans, and grants to both the Haitian government and the private sector. Following the earthquake, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced new financial support for the country.  After the earthquake, the World Bank announced $100 million in emergency grant funding to support recovery and reconstruction, in addition to its existing $308 million portfolio of grants projects in Haiti. The existing projects are in areas including disaster risk management, infrastructure, community-driven development, education, and economic governance. At the March Donor's conference, the World Bank announced an additional $250 million in new funding for Haiti. This includes $151 million in grants, a $39 million write-off from cancelling Haiti's remaining debt to the Bank and $60 million in investments from the Bank's private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC). On January 12, 2010, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) President Luis Alberto Moreno announced a $200,000 emergency grant for immediate relief aid. The IDB is Haiti's largest multilateral donor, with a portfolio of programs worth over $700 million as of the end of 2009. These programs include both grants and concessional loans. Of this amount, $330 million is undisbursed, of which $90 million could be quickly redirected to high-priority civil works and reconstruction projects. IDB management also announced that it anticipates the approval of up to $128 million in already-planned grants, potentially providing more resources for reconstruction. In March 2010, IDB donor governments committed to providing necessary resources so that the IDB can provide at least $2 billion in grants to Haiti over the next ten years.  Haiti receives concessional loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as well as from the multilateral development banks. In response to the earthquake, the IMF approved $102 million in new assistance. Including the new lending, total Haiti debt to the IMF is now $271 million.  Haiti completed the multilateral Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in June 2009, making it eligible to receive debt relief from the multilateral and some bilateral creditors.  Under the terms of Haiti's participation in the Enhanced HIPC program, the World Bank provided Haiti debt relief for debts incurred through December 2003. According to the World Bank, debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative amounts to $140.3 million. Inter-American Development Bank The IDB, in September 2009, provided $511 million in debt relief. Debts eligible for cancellation were those incurred through 2004 (compared to 2003 in the case of IDA). According to the IDB, Haiti currently owes $429 million (principal-only) to the IDB. This includes $305 million from loans made in 2005 and 2006, after the debt cancellation cut-off date of December 31, 2004, and $124 million from undisbursed balances of loans made before the cut-off date. Beginning in 2009, Haiti's payments on its debt to the IDB have been made by a U.S.-supported trust fund that currently amounts to $20 million.  Haiti has also received debt relief from its bilateral creditors. Haiti's completion of the HIPC program triggered debt relief of $62.7 million by the Paris Club group of official creditors. Haiti's Paris Club creditors agreed to go beyond the requirements of the HIPC program, however, and provide $152 million in additional debt cancellation, thus completely cancelling Haiti's external Paris Club debt of $214 million. That said, Paris Club debt relief is not automatic. Creditor nations collectively sign bilateral agreements with the debtor nation, giving effect to the multilateral debt relief agreement. By mid-January, for example, France had only cancelled \u20ac4 million ($5.75 million) of \u20ac58 million ($83.36 million) owed to them by Haiti. On September 18, 2009, the United States cancelled $12.6 million (100%) of Haiti's outstanding debt to the United States. The United States has not extended new loans to Haiti since September 2009. Haiti does not currently have any outstanding debt obligations to the United States. Agreement has been reached by several donor nations to finance the cost of additional Haiti debt relief for three institutions: the IDB, the World Bank, and the International Fund for Agriculture and Development (IFAD).  Haiti's remaining debt\u00a0from the IDB totals $447 million. An estimated $186 million\u00a0of\u00a0additional loans\u00a0have been approved but have not\u00a0yet been\u00a0disbursed. Once these are provided, they will add to the debt stock. There is also a\u00a0$28 million balance that represents Haiti's local currency conversion obligation to the IDB's low-income lending arm, the Fund for Special Operations (FSO). At the IDB's March 2010 annual meetings, member states agreed to fund 100% cancellation of Haiti's remaining debts owed to the IDB, although all details have not been finalized.  Haiti's remaining debt to the International Development Association, the World Bank's low-income lending facility, is $39 million. On March 31, 2010, the World Bank announced that 14 donor countries, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States, have pledged to provide a total of $39 million to cancel Haiti's remaining IDA debt. Haiti's remaining debts to IFAD are around $79 million. In April 2010, member nations agreed to cancel these debts. Under the agreement, IFAD - an international financial institution and a specialized United Nations agency dedicated to eradicating poverty and hunger in rural areas of developing countries - will contribute up to 30 per cent of the debt relief requirement, with member states needing to contribute the remaining 70%. Since the earthquake, other countries have stepped forward to provide debt relief to Haiti. At the end of January 2010, Venezuela announced it would forgive Haiti's debt, totaling $295 million. In mid-February 2010, French President Nicolas Sarkozy visited Haiti and announced a new French aid package for Haiti that reportedly included the cancelling of all the debt owed by Haiti to France, totally \u20ac56 million (approximately $77 million). Taiwan, another major bilateral creditor to Haiti with $90 million of outstanding debt to Haiti, has discussed canceling Haiti's debt but nothing has materialized to date. To date, there has been no international agreement on forgiveness of Haiti's debts to the IMF of $271 million. The interest rate on Haiti's IMF loans is zero until 2012, however, with no payments due until 2013. On February 24, 2010, the IMF issued a press release on its role in helping revive Haiti's financial sector. Officials from the IMF and Haiti's Central Bank discussed a proposal prepared by Haiti's authorities to maintain financial stability and restart private sector credit. The IMF's press release states that \"this proposal will be critical to allowing the private sector to fully play its role in rebuilding the economy and providing jobs, in the context of the broader reconstruction and economic recovery.\" The IMF also announced that it will help Haiti's authorities design a partial credit guarantee fund. To help Haiti in its recovery from the earthquake, the Administration is proposing U.S. contributions of $252 million to help cancel Haiti's debts of $781 million to three international organizations: the Inter-American Development Bank, World Bank, and International Fund for Agriculture and Development. Through FY2010 supplemental funding, the Administration requests reallocating up to $40 million from the Treasury Department's Debt Restructuring Account appropriated for the multilateral Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Trust Fund from this or subsequent fiscal years to Haiti. The Administration also seeks new contributions of $212 million for multilateral debt relief. Congressional authorization is required for the $40 million reallocation, and both authorization and appropriations are required for the additional $212 million. Latin American countries have responded to Haiti's crisis with immediate provision of emergency supplies and personnel and pledges of financial and other assistance for its long-term recovery. Members of the Organization of American States (OAS) pledged humanitarian, financial and other support to Haiti. The OAS Group of Friends of Haiti met on January 14 to coordinate search and rescue efforts, prompt donations, and discuss ways to promote recovery. The 15-member Caribbean Community (CARICOM), of which Haiti is also a member, was working in Haiti prior to the earthquake. Afterwards, it mobilized its disaster emergency response system to assist Haiti, and several members have sent emergency supplies or promised financial assistance. The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency assembled a response team to assess conditions in Haiti as well.  Many countries in the region already have peacekeeping troops in Haiti serving with MINUSTAH. Brazil leads the U.N. peacekeeping mission, and had 1,284 uniformed personnel already serving there as of December 2009. Many countries in the region have made bilateral cash or in-kind contributions as well. (See \"Regional Donors to Haiti Relief Effort,\" in Appendix F .)The Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti but did not suffer heavy damage from the earthquake, responded swiftly and generously. The two countries have a long history of hostility toward one another, but Presidents Pr\u00e9val and Fernandez have worked in recent years toward having a more cooperative relationship, and this has been reflected in the Dominican response. Haiti's neighbor was the first country to send relief supplies and personnel, and has facilitated aid delivery through use of its airports, roads, and port. It has stopped repatriation of undocumented Haitians, and opened its border to injured Haitians, thousands of whom have been treated in both public and private hospitals. Fernandez organized a preparatory meeting for donors to discuss future aid to Haiti the week after the earthquake, and the Dominican Republic hosted a technical meeting prior to the March 31 donor conference.  Long before the earthquake struck, Haiti was a country socially and ecologically at risk. It has some of the lowest socioeconomic indicators in the world . Haiti was already in an acute environmental crisis. Only 2% of its forest cover remains intact. Following the hurricanes of 2008, the President of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), Luis Moreno, called Haiti the most fragile of IDB's member countries, saying that no other nation in Latin America and the Caribbean is as vulnerable to economic shocks and natural disasters as is Haiti.  Haiti had been making progress, however. The U.N. Secretary-General commissioned a report, published in January 2009, that recommended a strategy to move Haiti beyond recovery to economic security. Indeed, the U.N. Security Council conducted a fact-finding visit to Haiti in March 2009, and concluded that there was \"a window of opportunity to enable the consolidation of stability and the undertaking of a process of sustainable development.\"  President Pr\u00e9val is in his second (non-consecutive) five-year term as President of Haiti. During the first three years of this term, Pr\u00e9val established relative internal political stability. He outlined two main missions for his government: (1) to build institutions, and (2) to establish favorable conditions for private investment in order to create jobs. In November 2007, his Administration published its National Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction, a key step in meeting IMF requirements for debt relief, which it met in June 2009. With the support of MINUSTAH, which arrived in Haiti in 2004, security conditions improved, as did the capacity of the country's police force. Both the former and current U.S. Administrations praised Pr\u00e9val for his efforts to improve economic conditions and establish the rule of law in Haiti. Pr\u00e9val pledged to cooperate with U.S. counternarcotics efforts. Both President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with President Pr\u00e9val early in 2009, and since the earthquake have provided humanitarian assistance and pledged long-term support for development in Haiti. The Haitian government is functioning under extremely difficult conditions, with 28 of 29 government Ministry buildings destroyed, and 17% of the country's civil service killed. U.S. and U.N. officials both say they are coordinating relief and recovery efforts with the Pr\u00e9val administration. To provide the Haitian government some operating space, the U.S. Department of State agreed on January 16 to lease the old U.S. Embassy building in downtown Port-au-Prince to the Haitian government for $1 a year. That building had been put up for sale in June 2008 after the new U.S. Embassy opened near the Port-au-Prince airport. On February 16, 2010, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper while in Haiti announced that Canada would provide $12 million to build temporary facilities to house several Haitian government ministries.  Though greatly improved, Haiti's political stability remains fragile. Pr\u00e9val's inauguration in 1996 was the first transition between two democratically elected presidents in Haitian history. The government has its third prime minister since April 2008. Parliament dismissed Prime Minister Michele Pierre-Louis in October 2009, barely a year after her appointment. Nonetheless, the transition was smooth as President Pr\u00e9val swiftly appointed, and the Parliament confirmed, Jean-Max Bellerive to take her place. As Minister of Planning and External Cooperation from 2006 to 2009, Bellerive helped to prepare Haiti's National Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction.  After the earthquake, former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide announced he would like to return to Haiti, although he has since given no explicit plans to do so. Aristide has lived in exile in South Africa since his government collapsed in 2004. Once\u2014and possibly still\u2014extremely popular among some Haitians, he is nonetheless a divisive figure. Aristide would face charges of corruption and would likely contribute to political instability if he were to return. Haiti's parliament, the National Assembly, also faces enormous challenges in trying to reestablish itself: some of its members were killed in the earthquake; the parliament buildings were destroyed, as was the electoral council's building. The U.S. House of Representatives' Democracy Partnership and others are working with the Parliament to help it function again. The National Assembly has been meeting since shortly after the earthquake in makeshift offices. The Senate elected two commissions on January 28 to monitor international aid and manage agreements with aid organizations.  Political tensions were mounting ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for February 28 and March 3, 2010. In late 2009, President Pr\u00e9val cut ties to the Lespwa movement that elected him in 2006, and formed a new movement, Unity. Opposition groups accused the presidentially appointed electoral council of bias in favor of the President's new movement. The electoral council disqualified, without explanation about 15 rival political groups, which included members of Lespwa who did not join Pr\u00e9val's new party. Opposition groups expressed concern that if Unity won a legislative majority, it would push through constitutional amendments, possibly including one allowing Pr\u00e9val to run for another term in 2011. The constitution allows only two non-consecutive terms for a President, and Pr\u00e9val is completing his second term. Pr\u00e9val has promised to step down when his term expires on February 7, 2011, and said he would not run again. There is no clear candidate to succeed him. In February 2010, the electoral council postponed the elections indefinitely. The elections were to determine all 99 seats in the House and one-third of the seats in the Senate. Tensions are likely to increase when those legislative terms expire on May 10, 2010 without replacements having been elected. As mentioned earlier, it is not entirely clear how the government will function after that date. But Haiti passed a State of Emergency Law on April 20 giving the President broad powers and President Pr\u00e9val will probably rule by decree. After May 10 the remaining 19 Senators may continue to meet, however, and the Senate has the power to dismiss the Prime Minister and censure government programs. The international community is urging Haiti to hold legislative and presidential elections in November 2010.  Plagued by chronic political instability and frequent natural disasters, Haiti remains the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Haiti's poverty is massive and deep. Over half the population (54%) of 9.8 million people live in extreme poverty, living on less than $1 a day; 78% live on $2 or less a day, according to the World Bank. Poverty among the rural population is even more widespread: 69% of rural dwellers live on less than $1 a day, and 86% live on less than $2 a day. Hunger is also widespread: 81% of the national population and 87% of the rural population do not get the minimum daily ration of food defined by the World Health Organization. In remote parts of Haiti, children have died from malnutrition. In order to reach its Millennium Development Goal of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger by 2015, Haiti's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would have to grow 3.5% per year, a goal the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says Haiti is not considered likely to achieve. Over the past 40 years, Haiti's per capita real GDP has declined by 30%. Therefore, economic growth, even if it is greater than population growth, is not expected to be enough to reduce poverty. Haiti has experienced some economic growth since 2004. Economic growth for FY2007 was 3.2%, the highest rate since the 1990s. Before the earthquake, the forecasted growth for FY2009-20010 was 2.5%, reflecting the impact of recent storms and the global economic crisis, and up to 3.5% for 2010-2011. The global economic crisis also had led to a drop of about 10% in remittances from Haitians abroad, which in 2008 amounted to about $1.65 billion, more than a fourth of Haiti's annual income.  The likelihood that economic growth will contribute to the reduction of poverty in Haiti is further reduced by its significant income distribution gap. Haiti has the second largest income disparity in the world. Over 68% of the total national income accrues to the wealthiest 20% of the population, while less than 1.5% of Haiti's national income is accumulated by the poorest 20% of the population. When the level of inequality is as high as Haiti's, according to the World Bank, the capacity of economic growth to reduce poverty \"approaches zero.\"  Haiti already had a National Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction in place for 2007-2010, supported by the international donor community. As Minister of Planning and External Cooperation from 2006 to 2009, current Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive helped to prepare that Strategy. The poverty reduction strategy focuses on three \"priority pillars.\" The first is areas for growth, focusing on agriculture and rural development; tourism; infrastructure modernization; and science, technology and innovation. The second pillar is human development, concentrating on education and training; health; water and sanitation; persons with disabilities; childhood poverty; young people; HIV/AIDS; and gender equity. The third pillar calls for investment in democratic governance, focusing on the establishment of an equitable justice system; creation of a climate of security; modernization of the state; and political and economic decentralization.  After a series of devastating hurricanes in 2008, the government of Haiti revised its strategy incorporating the findings of a Post-Disaster Needs Assessment and the U.N.'s \"Haiti: From Natural Catastrophe to Economic Security\" report, at a donors conference held April 21, 2009, in Washington, DC. The Haitian government outlined the priorities of its new two-year plan, \"Haiti: a New Paradigm,\" which include investing in strategic infrastructure, improving economic governance and the business environment, improving the provision of basic services, and ensuring environmental sustainability. The government was making strides toward meeting goals of its growth and poverty reduction strategy, and some analysts were viewing its potential for sustainable development with optimism. Investors were returning to Haiti and the country was promoting its economic development. The earthquake has reversed years of progress. Haiti's strategy will therefore need to be reviewed, revised, and built upon to incorporate new conditions and needs. Haiti's National Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction remains relevant, and the government says its pillars will remain the basic pillars of its strategy. The Pr\u00e9val Administration will present a revised vision statement at the March 31 donors conference, and more fully revise its strategy after the completion of the post-disaster needs assessment. The U.S. Department of State was about to announce a new strategy toward Haiti, on which it had been collaborating with the Pr\u00e9val Administration for almost a year. That, too, will need to be revised. The assessment concluded that a new strategy needed: (1) a comprehensive integrated approach to achieve sustainable long-term stability and economic growth; (2) investment in plans led by the Haitian government to ensure sustainability; (3) better coordination to maximize the effectiveness of U.S. and other donor assistance; (4) expanded reach of U.S. programs by using partnerships with other international actors; and (5) improved accountability and measurement of results.  The State Department's assessment and plan focused on four areas: agriculture, energy, health, and security. All of these areas, plus others such as governance and education, will need to be addressed in the short term, while simultaneously developing plans to rebuild in the long term. At the March donors conference in April, the donor countries agreed to the following principles: Ownership: Donors will align their assistance with priorities established by the Haitian government and will involve the Haitian people in the development and implementation of projects. Coordination and Effectiveness: Participants will strengthen coordination through consultation and \"unprecedented\" transparency, and concentration on priority sectors for each donor, and will adhere to the principles of aid effectiveness and build on lessons learned. Inclusiveness: The conference emphasized the importance of consulting with key communities, such as the Haitian people, civil society, non-governmental organizations, local governments, the private sector, the Haitian diaspora, MINUSTAH stakeholders, and regional partners. Accountability and Transparency: The government of Haiti and donors agreed to increased accountability and transparency in both pledges and use of assistance, and established a monitoring and transparency unit within the Interim Haitian Reconstruction Commission/Haitian development authority accountable to the Haitian and international public. Sustainability: The international community pledged a long-term commitment to Haiti's reconstruction. The priorities of the Haitian government's Action Plan for the Reconstruction and National Development of Haiti are outlined in \"The Government's New Action Plan\" earlier in the report. Analysts and donors are stressing that Haiti cannot be merely re-built, but must be re-built better. In this crisis, many people see the opportunity to address some of the underlying problems contributing to the country's endemic poverty and underdevelopment. The Action Plan addresses these issues, and is the basis for donor contributions and activity.  Rebuilding Haiti's agricultural capacity is a key element of the country's reconstruction strategy and is seen as a way of broadening Haiti's economy, and reducing its reliance on food imports. Yet Haiti's environment was in a state of crisis before the earthquake struck. Obstacles to agricultural development include massive deforestation, erosion of topsoil, lack of investment in agricultural technology for decades, and unclear land titles. A relatively new infrastructure is in place to help with the process of incorporating post-earthquake needs into Haiti's overall environmental rehabilitation plan. Following the destructive hurricane season of 2008, efforts to revive Haiti's ecology had been renewed when a coalition of U.N. agencies, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and technical institutes launched a Haiti Regeneration Initiative. A core goal of the revised Haitian development strategy, supported by the donors conference, is to catalyze economic growth and provide services and opportunities outside of Port-au-Prince. According to U.N. and U.S. officials, decentralization is the focus of the second phase of delivery assistance as well, and food, shelter, jobs programs, and other services are being delivered to communities around the country to help them cope with the influx of people from the capital. Haiti was once a predominantly rural population, with only about 20% of its population living in cities. By the time of the 2010 earthquake, the vast majority of Haitians lived in cities, primarily Port-au-Prince. Parts of the Haitian government and private sector have concentrated resources, services, and job opportunities in Port-au-Prince for decades. Prime Minister Bellerive and analysts who follow Haiti suggest that the current crisis provides an opportunity to correct what had become an unsustainable urban-rural distribution of people and resources in the country. Some have suggested not rebuilding Port-au-Prince because it lies on a fault line and remains susceptible to further earthquakes. Property rights are not clearly established throughout Haiti, and are of concern as the Haitian government and donors try to set up relocation settlements, reforestation and agricultural programs, and encourage investors to build outside of the capital. U.S. programs will help develop infrastructure in support of decentralization and help seek resolutions to property rights issues.  Canada and France are the countries designated to focus on helping Haiti develop education in the reconstruction phase. Haiti's schools were woefully inadequate prior to the earthquake, and many were destroyed by the earthquake. Most schools are privately run. Education is crucial to raising Haitians out of a cycle of poverty, by providing the knowledge and skills individuals need to take advantage of job opportunities. Experts note that job creation must be accompanied by education programs.  Energy is one of the United States' areas of focus in the development strategy. By virtually all accounts, Haiti's current energy sources are inefficient and inadequate. They are often destructive as well: Haitians' reliance on charcoal for fuel has contributed to the deforestation of all but 2% of its forest cover. Some observers have suggested that clean energy technology could help Haiti \"avoid some of the poverty traps of the old system.\" According to at least one analysis, developing small-scale, alternative energy sources at the local level rather than trying to rebuild the previously ineffectual Haitian electricity service would increase the quality of life of many Haitians and have a positive impact on economic growth.  Because the United States is already a leading provider of health care in Haiti, it is one of the areas on which it will focus in the reconstruction phase. In much of the country the government did not provide basic services prior to the earthquake. The lack of medicines or medical treatment and adequate sanitation in Haiti has been exacerbated by the earthquake. In the long-term, health care is crucial to raising Haitians out of a cycle of poverty, by providing the good health that enables children to develop and adults to function fully, whether as students, family providers or employees.  Job creation in both the short- and long-term are important parts of the recovery strategy. UNDP has already launched cash-for-work programs both to stimulate the local economy and ease the delivery of humanitarian assistance. The program will quickly expand to earthquake-damaged areas in and outside of Port-au-Prince, and employ 220,000 people, indirectly benefiting about one million Haitians, according to UNDP. The current jobs are for clearing streets of building rubble and disposing of debris. Donors are also creating job programs outside Port-au-Prince to benefit communities receiving an influx of people from the capital. Public works such as building roads, housing, and infrastructure are to generate jobs in the reconstruction phase. Plans for economic growth include restoring and continuing to expand industrial exports. Many analysts emphasize, however, that economic plans must be comprehensive, to avoid over-reliance on any one area, such as the apparel assembly industry, which could leave the Haitian economy overly vulnerable. Within the Haiti supplemental proposal, the request for Recovery and Reconstruction funding is $1.1 billion. This is primarily for new activities, in support of the Haitian government's Action Plan. U.S. programs to be funded through the supplemental request focus on urgent infrastructure repairs, especially in the energy and agricultural sectors; critical health care; governance; and security.  Many Members have already expressed a strong desire to support Haiti and provide it with substantial assistance. The 111 th Congress gave bipartisan support to assist the Pr\u00e9val government during its first session, and has continued to respond in that spirit to the crisis generated by the January earthquake. Committees in the Senate and House have held hearings on Haiti. Both Members and witnesses stressed the need for a massive, coordinated international effort not only for immediate humanitarian needs, but also for long-term development. Moving forward, they said, strategies must consider new approaches, aim to create a more sustainable Haiti, and increase Haitian capacity to utilize foreign aid effectively and to provide services and direct its own economy. Regarding the Obama Administration's total request for $2.8 billion in FY2010 supplemental funding for costs related to Haitian relief and recovery activities, key concerns include: Choosing Priorities . To coordinate aid programs better, donors have agreed to focus on certain areas of assistance. Some observers have expressed concern that U.S. assistance is neglecting areas crucial to Haitian recovery, such as improving the educational system, which is to be the focus of Canada and France. While advocates say this approach avoids duplication among donors, critics question the priorities, or the limited approach to aid.  Some experts suggest developing small-scale, alternative or clean energy sources at the local level rather than trying to rebuild the previously ineffectual Haitian electricity service would increase the quality of life of many Haitians and have a positive impact on economic growth. Some Members have expressed concern that insufficient funding is being focused on the needs of children, or on psychological support for the traumatized population. There is no additional funding for Global Health and Child Survival in the supplemental request. Some long-term care for psychological support is included in the health activities proposed in the supplemental. Decentralization and Economic Growth: Will they lead to Poverty Reduction? A key element of the revised Haitian development strategy, supported by the supplemental request, is to catalyze economic growth and provide services and opportunities outside of Port-au-Prince. The Haitian government and donors agree that the current crisis provides an opportunity to correct what had become an unsustainable urban-rural imbalance in the country, with the rest of the country suffering neglect while people, resources, and services were concentrated in the capital. Funds in the supplemental request would address both short- and long-term elements involved in this decentralization strategy \u2013 meeting the immediate needs of newly displaced populations that have migrated to less developed areas of the country, and strengthening local governance, infrastructure, and agriculture to develop new \"growth poles\" outside of Port-au-Prince. Scientists are helping Haitian authorities to select areas for development that are less vulnerable to natural disasters. While there is general support of this strategy, officials also note that developing areas long-neglected will be costly. Some also warn that populations should not be forcibly relocated in executing these plans. Experts also warn that economic growth is not sufficient to reduce poverty in Haiti, and that programs specifically targeted at poverty reduction are needed. As mentioned earlier, the World Bank says that when the level of economic inequality is as high as Haiti's, the ability of economic growth to reduce poverty approaches zero. Effective Capacity Building? Most observers agree that one goal of aid to Haiti should be to build the capacity of Haitians so they can eventually assume responsibility for the project at hand. Yet there is a tension between the standard definition of effectiveness and efficiency, and the time and money required for capacity building. Aid organizations are pressed to have measureable outcomes and usually operate on short-term contracts. If thorough training and coordinating with Haitian ministries is to be an element of all foreign aid programs, which many experts advocate, there will have to be a recognition that those programs may require more time, funding, and personnel, and measureable results may take longer to achieve. Humanitarian assistance generally receives strong bipartisan congressional support and the United States is typically a leader and major contributor to relief efforts in humanitarian disasters. When disasters require immediate emergency relief, the Administration may fund pledges by depleting its disaster accounts intended for worldwide use throughout a fiscal year. President Obama announced the United States would provide $100 million in immediate aid for Haiti. That aid is drawn from existing funds. The international community is also making substantial donations toward meeting immediate needs. Amid efforts to tackle rising budget deficits by, among other measures, slowing or reducing discretionary spending or finding the resources to sustain U.S. aid pledges may be difficult. After the 2004 tsunami disaster, some Members of Congress publicly expressed concern that funding for tsunami relief and reconstruction, which depleted most worldwide disaster contingency accounts, could jeopardize resources for subsequent international disasters or for other aid priorities from which tsunami emergency aid had been transferred. These accounts were fully restored through supplemental appropriations. At the time, others noted the substantial size of American private donations for tsunami victims and argued that because of other budget pressures, the United States government did not need to transfer additional aid beyond what was already pledged. In Haiti, the full extent and cost of the disaster is not yet known. Disaster accounts are being drawn down to provide relief to Haiti. The State Department reports that in order to respond to future humanitarian crises, these resources would need to be replenished by June 1, 2010. If not replenished, U.S. capacity to respond to other emergencies could be impacted. The relief funding in the current FY2010 supplemental request would provide reimbursement for funding already provided or obligated.  Congress may reevaluate and revise priorities and approaches of U.S. assistance to Haiti in light of the changed conditions there. Issues that have previously concerned Congress have included democracy building, development assistance and poverty reduction, security enhancement and stability, counternarcotics efforts, police and judicial reform, and disaster recovery and prevention. The earthquake disaster in Haiti has received worldwide attention and focus. The government of Haiti, the United States, the United Nations and many others have asked for and encouraged governments to provide assistance. It is not always evident whether figures listing donor amounts represent pledges of support or more specific obligations. Pledges made by governments do not necessarily result in actual contributions. It also cannot be assumed that the funds committed to relief actually represent new contributions, since the money may previously have been allocated elsewhere. It will take time for a more complete picture to reveal how the actual costs of the Haiti disaster will be shared among international donors. Comparing USG and international aid is also difficult because of the often dramatically different forms the assistance takes (in-kind contributions vs. cash, for instance). As the situation in Haiti stabilizes, and early recovery and reconstruction gets underway, sustaining donor interest in Haiti (and commitment to honor existing pledges) could be a challenge. Moreover, this challenge is compounded by the need to maintain funding priorities and secure funds needed for other disaster areas worldwide. Some have criticized the response by the international community in the actual delivery of humanitarian assistance as far too slow. For example, in the days following the earthquake some press reports commented on what they perceived to be a critical lack of food and water, insufficient medical care for the wounded, the slow pace of search and rescue, and the non-existent presence of law and order. Others have argued that there has been a great deal of unfair criticism of the slowness of the international aid effort. The weakened capacity of the Haitian government, critically damaged infrastructure, and logistical challenges posed by the influx of massive aid into a city largely destroyed by the earthquake all contributed to delay and difficulties on the ground.  Still others have been concerned about bureaucratic red tape, lack of civil-military cooperation, control by the U.S. military of flight priorities at the Port-au-Prince airport, and overall coordination issues. Evaluations of the relief response in Haiti will likely continue to be conducted and debated as the humanitarian effort moves ahead. A disaster of this scope is almost certain to run into many obstacles because the challenges on the ground are so daunting. While managing expectations of what is possible under these circumstances is important, so too, are the observations and lessons learned that with time and hindsight may benefit the actions and plans of those responding to future disasters. A U.N. Inter-Agency Real Time Evaluation (RTE) Mission was launched in April and will be conducted in several phases, the results of which will also be incorporated into the implementation of the Revised Humanitarian Appeal. Another issue of concern to Congress is likely to involve arrangements regarding elections. The Haitian Electoral Council is responsible for carrying out elections, and MINUSTAH provides technical and logistical support. The United Nations is encouraging the Haitian government to get back on an election schedule as soon as possible, to avoid the possible politically destabilizing effect extended delays and rule by decree might create. The United States is encouraging Haiti to hold presidential elections when they are due to be held, in fall 2011, and to combine them with legislative elections.  There are currently enormous obstacles to conducting elections before year's end. During the earthquake, election experts were killed, and the U.N.'s offices were destroyed, along with records and equipment. Throughout the country, many buildings in which elections are usually held were destroyed. In addition, many Haitian citizens lost their identity cards, and many more have been displaced and will need to register at their new locales. Some elections experts say it is possible to carry the elections out this year if the preparations are begun immediately. The devastation caused by the January 12, 2010, earthquake in Haiti led Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Janet Napolitano to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Haitians in the United States at the time of the earthquake. As soon as the earthquake hit, some Members of Congress had called for the Obama Administration to do so. On January 13, 2010, DHS had announced that it was temporarily halting the deportation of Haitians. On January 15, 2010, DHS Secretary Napolitano granted TPS to Haitian nationals for 18 months.  Haitian children who were legally confirmed as orphans eligible for intercountry adoption by the government of Haiti and who were in the process of being adopted by U.S. residents prior to the earthquake have been given humanitarian parole to come to the United States. Other Haitian orphans potentially eligible for humanitarian parole include children who were identified by an adoption service provider or facilitator as eligible for intercountry adoption and who were matched to prospective American adoptive parents prior to January 12, 2010. The parole program stopped taking new applications on April 14, 2010. DHS anticipates that approximately 1,200 orphans will ultimately receive parole under this program. The Haitian government says its first priority regarding displaced children is to try to reunite them with relatives. On January 29, 2010, 10 U.S. citizens, most from an Idaho Baptist group, were arrested in Haiti and charged with child kidnapping and criminal association. The U.S. citizens were trying to cross the Haitian border with the Dominican Republic with a busload of 33 children who they said were orphaned by the January 12, 2010, earthquake. The U.S. citizens did not have authorization to remove the children from Haiti, and it appears that many of the children were not orphans. On February 11, Haitian Judge Bernard Sainvil ordered the release of the U.S. citizens on their own recognizance \"because there had been no evidence demonstrating 'criminal intentions' on their part to support charges of child kidnapping and criminal association leveled against them.\" The charges have been dropped against all 9 of the U.S. citizens, while the remaining U.S. citizen will be tried in Haiti on the charge of arranging \"irregular travel.\" Those Haitians who are given humanitarian parole to come to the United States are deemed Cuban-Haitian Entrants and, thus, are among the subset of foreign nationals who are eligible for federal benefits and cash assistance much like refugees. Those Haitians who are newly arriving legal permanent residents, however, are barred from the major federal benefits and cash assistance for the first five years after entry. The President has included funding to cover additional costs for federal benefits and cash assistance resulting from Haitians evacuees, among other activities in his FY2010 supplemental request. Specifically, the President has requested $220.0 million for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to fund four types of activities, of which two are directly related to Haitians brought to the United States after the earthquake. These two are: the state share of Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) costs for eligible Haitians; and cash, medical, and repatriation assistance for eligible Haitians. The supplemental request also includes $15 million for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to use for fee waivers for eligible Haitians granted TPS, those given humanitarian parole to bring medical evacuees and certain categories of Haitians into the United States, and to cover costs associated with processing the adoption of Haitian orphans.  According to the Department of State, there are 54,716 Haitians who have approved petitions to immigrate to the United States and who are waiting for visas to become available. Advocates for Haitians are asking Secretary Napolitano to give humanitarian parole to those Haitians with approved petitions for visas. Proponents of expediting the admission of Haitians with family in the United States maintain that it would relieve at least some of the humanitarian burden in Haiti and would increase the remittances sent back to Haiti to provide critical help as the nation tries to rebuild. Those opposed to expediting the admission of Haitians assert that it would not be in the national interest, nor would it be fair to others foreign nationals waiting to reunite with their families. There are growing concerns that the crisis conditions in Haiti may result in mass migration from the country. The phenomenon of Haitians coming to the United States by boat without proper travel documents dates back at least to the 1970s. The Reagan Administration reached an agreement in 1981 with the Haitian government to interdict (i.e., stop and search certain vessels suspected of transporting undocumented Haitians), and this policy, with some modifications, has continued. During the first two weeks of February, the U.S. Coast Guard returned almost 90 Haitians found at sea to northern Haiti, although U.S. officials say there is no sign of a mass exodus from Haiti by sea. If mass migration were to occur, Congress may weigh in on the balancing of immigration control responsibilities with humanitarian concerns in the midst of Haiti's humanitarian disaster. In the initial weeks after the earthquake, U.S. military airlifts brought non-U.S.-citizen Haitians to Florida for medical care that was unavailable in Haiti. These patients, who often had very serious injuries, were admitted to a number of non-federal hospitals, principally in south Florida. On January 27, 2010, Florida Governor Charlie Crist wrote to Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), saying that the state's health care system was reaching saturation, and asking Sebelius to activate the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) to coordinate the distribution of medical evacuees to other states, and to compensate states for the costs of their care. On February 1, 2010, HHS announced that it was activating the NDMS hospital component. Federal medical evacuations resumed at that point, but are no longer underway as of early March, 2010, as the most critical needs have abated or can now be addressed in Haiti. HHS administers the NDMS, which consists of three components for the response to mass casualty incidents. First, teams of medical providers deploy rapidly to provide critical medical care in disaster conditions when local health care capacity has been destroyed or overwhelmed. Second, NDMS provides medical evacuation, the coordinated movement of seriously ill or injured victims to sites where they can receive definitive care. Typically, U.S. military assets such as cargo planes and attending medical personnel are used for this purpose. Third, participating U.S. hospitals agree to provide medical care to NDMS evacuees on a voluntary basis, and receive federal reimbursement at 110% of the Medicare rate. The first NDMS component is used frequently. Teams are deployed many times each year in response to domestic disasters (for which deployment costs are typically paid by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund ) and international humanitarian relief efforts (for which deployment costs are often paid by USAID). NDMS teams were deployed to Haiti shortly after the earthquake. In contrast, the second (medical evacuation) and third (U.S. participating hospital) NDMS components have rarely been activated. Although U.S. military flights had initially brought Haitian medical evacuees to Florida during January, the NDMS hospital component had not yet been activated, and it was not clear at that time if the federal government would assume the costs of care for those patients.  The HHS Secretary has considerable discretion with respect to the activation of NDMS. No specific legal triggers or other requirements must be met. However, the Secretary does not have a dedicated funding mechanism to support extensive NDMS deployments. Under HHS policy for this incident, NDMS will reimburse hospitals for the costs of care, for 30 days, for any individual who was medically evacuated from Haiti by NMDS, regardless of citizenship or nationality. NDMS does not pay costs beyond 30 days, costs for services provided by non-hospital facilities (such as rehabilitation facilities), or costs for the care of individuals who were not evacuated through the NDMS system. President Obama has requested emergency supplemental funding to support the Haiti earthquake response. The request includes $220 million for HHS, which would be used, among other things, to reimburse NDMS hospitals that cared for medical evacuees.  In a bipartisan effort, Congress passed a bill designed to increase charitable donations to Haiti. The Haiti Assistance Income Tax Incentive (HAITI) Act (signed into law January 22, 2010, P.L. 111-126 ) accelerates income tax benefits for charitable cash contributions for the relief of earthquake victims. It allows taxpayers to deduct donations made in early 2010 on their income tax returns for 2009. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the HAITI Act would lead to U.S. revenue losses of about $2 million. Information on how to make charitable donations is in Appendix I .  One long-standing targeted policy that the U.S. Congress has taken to support economic development in Caribbean countries is to provide tariff preferences for their exports. Haiti is eligible for such benefits under the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA\u2014 P.L. 106-200 ) and the Haiti Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act, as amended ( P.L. 110-246 ). In particular, flexible and generous tariff preferences are provided to Haiti's apparel assembly business, which has been established for decades, with admittedly mixed success over time, and viewed by many as one pillar of economic growth in an economy with limited opportunities in the short-run. The U.S. Congress continued to support this approach with the Haiti Economic Lift Program (HELP) Act ( S. 3275 ), introduced on April 28, 2010. The bill, which had bicameral and bipartisan support, extends the CBTPA and the Haiti HOPE Act through FY2020. It focuses on expanding preferences for apparel exports, benefits some have argued might also be extended to other industries to help promote economic diversification. Currently, however, such opportunities are very limited, and Congress appears to have opted to review the HOPE Act carefully and enhance those trade preferences rules that have had the most demonstrable effect in stimulating increased apparel production and exports for the U.S. market, and by extension, job creation in Haiti. Apparel accounts for 93% of Haitian exports to the United States and reflects a comparative advantage based on low-cost labor and proximity to the U.S. market. Earthquake damage to apparel firms created new hardships for this industry, and there is need for a considerable increase in both domestic and foreign investment for the apparel industry to survive and expand. Of the 23 plants operating in late 2009, the earthquake completely destroyed one, killing some 500 people, and seriously damaged four others. Currently 19 are fully operational, two are being relocated, and two are closed. Employment attendance rates have returned to levels seen prior to the earthquake, but with fewer factories operating, total employment has fallen from 26,500 to 23,300. Monthly apparel exports have declined from $58.2 million in February 2009 to $33.1 million in February 2010. Focusing trade assistance on this sector attempts to respond to Haiti's level of development and play into the best prospects for creating employment in the near term. The strategy does have its critics, who argue that it has had limited effects in the past and should be employed within a broader development plan that seeks to diversify growth of output and exports over the longer term. In addition, critics contend that more needs to be done to provide better job opportunities as the country faces wholesale reconstruction. Congress recognizes these problems and has responded with broader development assistance and within the parameters of the HOPE Act with the detailed labor provisions. For example, the HOPE Act has put in place a system that requires Haitian firms that wish to avail themselves of the tariff preferences to conform to internationally recognized labor standards, and submit to an independent factory monitoring system operated by the United Nations.  Lawmakers are also helping constituents find persons missing in Haiti. Information on how to help them do so is in Appendix H . Members were also helping citizens in Haiti leave Haiti. Now that commercial air traffic has been resumed, there are no more emergency evacuations being carried out.  Lawmakers may also seek to find ways for the Haitian and U.S. governments to speed pending and potential adoptions of Haitian orphans. Links for further information on adoptions and orphans are in Appendix H . Many constituents want to know how to contribute to relief efforts. Information on how to do so is in Appendix I .

Emergency Shelter Gap: April 19, 2010 Appendix D. U.S. Earthquake Assistance to Haiti Appendix E. The U.S. Government Emergency Response Mechanism for International Disasters  The United States is generally a leader and major contributor to relief efforts in response to humanitarian disasters. The President has broad authority to provide emergency assistance for foreign disasters and the U.S. government provides disaster assistance through several U.S. agencies. The very nature of humanitarian disasters\u2014the need to respond quickly in order to save lives and provide relief\u2014has resulted in a rather unrestricted definition of what this type of assistance consists of at both a policy and an operational level. While humanitarian assistance is assumed to provide for urgent food, shelter, and medical needs, the agencies within the U.S. government providing this support typically expand or contract the definition in response to circumstances. Funds may be used for U.S. agencies to deliver services or to provide grants to international organizations (IOs), international governmental and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private or religious voluntary organizations (PVOs). The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is the U.S. government agency charged with coordinating U.S. government and private sector assistance. It also coordinates with international organizations, the governments of countries suffering disasters, and other governments. The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) in USAID's Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) provides immediate relief materials and personnel, many of whom are already abroad on mission. It is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance and can quickly assemble Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) to assess conditions. OFDA has wide authority to borrow funds, equipment, and personnel from other parts of USAID and other federal agencies. USAID has two other offices that administer U.S. humanitarian aid: Food For Peace (FFP) and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI). USAID administers emergency food aid under FFP (Title II of P.L. 480) and provides relief and development food aid that does not have to be repaid. OTI provides post-disaster transition assistance, which includes mainly short-term peace and democratization projects with some attention to humanitarian elements but not emergency relief. The Department of Defense (DOD) Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid (OHDACA) funds three Dodd humanitarian programs: the Humanitarian Assistance Program (HAP), Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) Program, and Foreign Disaster Relief and Emergency Response (FDR/ER). OHDACA provides humanitarian support to stabilize emergency situations and deals with a range of tasks including providing food, shelter and supplies, and medical evacuations. In addition the President has the authority to draw down defense equipment and direct military personnel to respond to disasters. The President may also use the Denton program to provide space-available transportation on military aircraft and ships to private donors who wish to transport humanitarian goods and equipment in response to a disaster. Generally, OFDA provides emergency assistance for 30 to 90 days after a disaster. The same is true for Department of Defense humanitarian assistance. After the initial emergency is over, assistance is provided through other channels, such as the regular country development programs of USAID. The State Department also administers programs for humanitarian relief with a focus on refugees and the displaced. The Emergency Refugee and Migration Account (ERMA) is a contingency fund that provides wide latitude to the President in responding to refugee emergencies. Assistance to address emergencies lasting more than a year comes out of the regular Migration and Refugee Account (MRA) through the Population, Migration and Refugees (PRM) bureau. PRM assists refugees worldwide, conflict victims, and populations of concern to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), often extended to include internally displaced people (IDPs). Humanitarian assistance includes a range of services from basic needs to community services. Appendix F.

Appendix I. How to Contribute to Relief Efforts How to Make Donations According to Inter Action and other relief agencies, the best way to help is to donate financially to organizations responding to a disaster. Cash allows relief professionals to procure exactly what is needed in a disaster situation and ensure that donations are culturally, dietetically, and environmentally appropriate. Cash donations do not use up other scarce resources, such as transportation, staff time or warehouse space. As needed, cash can also be transferred quickly to where it is needed, helping bolster the economy of the disaster-stricken region. The White House suggests that those wishing to make a donation to relief efforts may contribute online through http:// ClintonBushHaitiFund.org ; text \"QUAKE\" to 20222 to charge a $10 donation to the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund (the donation will be added to your cell phone bill); or text \"HAITI\" to 90999, and $10 will be given automatically to the Red Cross, charged to your cell phone bill. Those wishing to donate may also visit InterAction, at http://www.interaction.org , to contribute to other non-governmental organizations. The Department of State suggests that those who have significant in-kind contributions to make, such as a plane, a cargo ship, a team of doctors, portable generators, or large-scale water purification equipment, go to http://www.usaid.gov/helphaiti/ .  USAID, through the non-profit organization, Aidmatrix Foundation, Inc., at http://www.aidmatrixnetwork.org/fema/PublicPortal/ListOfNeeds.aspx?PortalID=133 , provides a searchable database to connect donors with needs. The lists of needs may be filtered by category, NGO, or item description.  A second option allows the donor to submit details of in-kind donations, and Aidmatrix will use the information to confirm the need with an NGO. Those who have significant in-kind contributions to make, such as a plane, a cargo ship, portable generators, or large-scale water purification equipment, may also access Aidmatrix at http://www.aidmatrixnetwork.org/fema/PublicPortal/NewDonation.aspx?PortalID=133 .
