    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Truth in Tuna Labeling Act of \n2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that:\n            (1) Consumers have the right to know whether the tuna that \n        they purchase was caught using technologies that kill, harass, \n        adversely impact, or endanger dolphins, porpoises, and whales.\n            (2) The provisions of the Dolphin Protection Consumer \n        Information Act that require ``dolphin safe'' labeling have \n        served as an incentive to reduce dolphin mortalities.\n            (3) According to the Annual Report of the Marine Mammal \n        Commission and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, \n        dolphin mortality has decreased from more than 100,000 dolphin \n        kills each year to fewer than 2,000 kills each year since the \n        passage of the ``dolphin safe'' label requirements in 1990.\n            (4) In 1997, Congress began to erode the ``dolphin safe'' \n        label, creating exceptions that permit purse seine netting in \n        the Eastern Tropical Pacific and other destructive fishing \n        practices to be used during tuna fishing. On December 31, 2002, \n        the Secretary of Commerce decided to permit tuna caught using \n        these destructive practices to be labeled ``dolphin safe'', a \n        decision that will blatantly mislead the American public. The \n        Secretary's decision will result in an estimated 20,000 to \n        40,000 dolphin deaths each year.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE DOLPHIN PROTECTION CONSUMER INFORMATION ACT.\n\n    The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act (16 U.S.C. 1385) is \namended--\n            (1) by striking subsections (d) through (h); and\n            (2) by inserting the following:\n    ``(d) Labeling Standard.--It is a violation of section 5 of the \nFederal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) for any producer, importer, \nexporter, distributor, or seller of any tuna product that is exported \nfrom or offered for sale in the United States to include on the label \nof that product the term `Dolphin Safe' or any other term or symbol \nthat claims or suggests that the tuna contained in the product was \nharvested using a method of fishing that is not harmful to dolphins if \nthe tuna product contains tuna harvested--\n            ``(1) on the high seas by a vessel engaged in driftnet \n        fishing;\n            ``(2) outside the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean by a \n        vessel using purse seine nets--\n                    ``(A) in a fishery in which the Secretary has \n                determined that a regular and significant association \n                occurs between dolphins and tuna (similar to the \n                association between dolphins and tuna in the eastern \n                tropical Pacific Ocean), unless such product is \n                accompanied by a written statement, executed by the \n                captain of the vessel and an observer participating in \n                a national or international program acceptable to the \n                Secretary, certifying that no purse seine net was \n                intentionally deployed on dolphins or used to encircle \n                dolphins and that no dolphins were intentionally chased \n                or harassed during the particular voyage on which the \n                tuna were caught and no dolphins were killed or \n                seriously injured in the sets in which the tuna were \n                caught;
