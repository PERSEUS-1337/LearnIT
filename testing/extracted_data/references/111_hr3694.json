    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Removing Excess Litigation Involving \nEnergy on Federal Lands Act'' or the ``RELIEF Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States spends over $1 billion per day to \n        import crude oil from foreign countries;\n            (2) such expenditure represents the largest wealth transfer \n        in history;\n            (3) the United States has at least 86 billion barrels of \n        oil and 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the outer \n        Continental Shelf;\n            (4) environmental groups have legally challenged every \n        lease in the Alaskan Outer Continental Shelf in the Chukchi and \n        Beaufort Seas;\n            (5) environmental groups have legally challenged the entire \n        2007-2012 5-year national outer Continental Shelf leasing \n        program;\n            (6) such legal challenges significantly delay or ultimately \n        prevent energy resources from reaching the American public;\n            (7) these legal challenges come at a high cost to the \n        American public and the American economy; and\n            (8) Congress finds that expedited judicial review is \n        necessary to prevent this gross abuse of the United States \n        judicial system.\n\nSEC. 3. EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER CAUSES AND CLAIMS RELATING TO \n              COVERED ENERGY PROJECTS.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the United States \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia shall have exclusive \njurisdiction to hear all causes and claims under this Act or any other \nAct that arise from any covered energy project.\n\nSEC. 4. TIME FOR FILING COMPLAINT.\n\n    All causes and claims referred to in section 3 must be filed not \nlater than the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date of the \naction or decision by a Federal official that constitutes the covered \nenergy project concerned. Any cause or claim not filed within that time \nperiod shall be barred.\n\nSEC. 5. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA DEADLINE.\n\n    (a) In General.--All proceedings that are subject to section 3--\n            (1) shall be resolved as expeditiously as possible, and in \n        any event not more than 180 days after such cause or claim is \n        filed; and\n            (2) shall take precedence over all other pending matters \n        before the district court.\n    (b) Failure To Comply With Deadline.--If an interlocutory or final \njudgment, decree, or order has not been issued by the district court by \nthe deadline described under this section, the cause or claim shall be \ndismissed with prejudice and all rights relating to such cause or claim \nshall be terminated.\n\nSEC. 6. ABILITY TO SEEK APPELLATE REVIEW.\n\n    An interlocutory or final judgment, decree, or order of the \ndistrict court may be reviewed by no other court except the Supreme \nCourt.\n\nSEC. 7. DEADLINE FOR APPEAL TO THE SUPREME COURT.\n\n    If a writ of certiorari has been granted by the Supreme Court \npursuant to section 6, then--\n            (1) the interlocutory or final judgment, decree, or order \n        of the district court shall be resolved as expeditiously as \n        possible and in any event not more than 180 days after such \n        interlocutory or final judgment, decree, order of the district \n        court is issued; and\n            (2) all such proceedings shall take precedence over all \n        other matters then before the Supreme Court.\n\nSEC. 8. LIMITATION ON SCOPE OF REVIEW AND RELIEF.\n\n    (a) Administrative Findings and Conclusions.--In any judicial \nreview of any Federal action under this Act, any administrative \nfindings and conclusions relating to the challenged Federal action \nshall be presumed to be correct unless shown otherwise by clear and \nconvincing evidence contained in the administrative record.\n    (b) Limitation on Prospective Relief.--In any judicial review of \nany action, or failure to act, under this Act, the Court shall not \ngrant or approve any prospective relief unless the Court finds that \nsuch relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to \ncorrect the violation of a Federal law requirement, and is the least \nintrusive means necessary to correct the violation concerned.\n\nSEC. 9. LEGAL FEES.\n\n    Any person filing a petition seeking judicial review of any action, \nor failure to act, under this Act who is not a prevailing party shall \npay to the prevailing parties (including intervening parties), other \nthan the United States, fees and other expenses incurred by that party \nin connection with the judicial review, unless the Court finds that the \nposition of the person was substantially justified or that special \ncircumstances make an award unjust.\n\nSEC. 10. EXCLUSION.\n\n    This Act shall not apply with respect to disputes between the \nparties to a lease issued pursuant to an authorizing leasing statute \nregarding the obligations of such lease or the alleged breach thereof.\n\nSEC. 11. COVERED ENERGY PROJECT DEFINED.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``covered energy project'' means any action \nor decision by a Federal official regarding--\n            (1) the leasing of Federal lands (including submerged \n        lands) for the exploration, development, production, \n        processing, or transmission of oil, natural gas, or any other \n        source or form of energy, including actions and decisions \n        regarding the selection or offering of Federal lands for such \n        leasing; or\n            (2) any action under such a lease."
