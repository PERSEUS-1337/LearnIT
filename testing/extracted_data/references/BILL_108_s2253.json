FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the natural fire regimes of forested public land have \n        been altered by intensive fire suppression;\n            (2) fire suppression has led to increased risk of \n        unnaturally severe wildfires that in recent years have \n        destroyed thousands of homes, devastated agricultural crops and \n        livestock, reduced biodiversity, and scorched thousands of \n        areas of soil and natural resources;\n            (3) catastrophic wildfires pose a particular threat to \n        communities and wildlife living close to forested wildland, \n        known as the ``wildland-urban interface'';\n            (4) each year millions of public dollars are spent to fight \n        severe wildfires and protect communities where municipal water \n        supplies, human lives, and property are threatened;\n            (5) cooperative agreements between public agencies empower \n        communities and are cost-effective tools that provide positive \n        social and environmental benefits;\n            (6) cooperative agreements should be encouraged to prevent \n        unnaturally severe fires, rehabilitate public land affected or \n        altered by fires, and enhance and maintain environmentally \n        important land and water; and\n            (7) joint collaborations between the public agencies and \n        service and conservation corps are particularly beneficial, as \n        the collaborations provide--\n                    (A) young adults the opportunity to prepare for \n                productive lives while engaged in meaningful and \n                educational public service opportunities; and\n                    (B) the public with cost-saving human resources to \n                assist in conserving, maintaining, and protecting \n                public land.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n     The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to allow service and conservation corps to contract \n        directly with public land management agencies to perform \n        rehabilitation and enhancement projects to prevent fire, \n        rehabilitate public land affected or altered by fires, and \n        suppress fires, and provide disaster relief;\n            (2) to offer young adults, ages 16 through 25, particularly \n        those who are at-risk or economically disadvantaged, the \n        opportunity to gain productive employment;\n            (3) to provide those young adults the opportunity to serve \n        their communities and their country; and\n            (4) to expand educational opportunities by rewarding \n        individuals who participate in the Healthy Forest Youth \n        Conservation Corps with an increased ability to pursue higher \n        education or employment.\n\nSEC. 4.
