    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Commonsense Consumption Act of \n2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the food and beverage industries are a significant part \n        of our national economy;\n            (2) the activities of manufacturers and sellers of foods \n        and beverages substantially affect interstate and foreign \n        commerce;\n            (3) a person's weight gain, obesity, or a health condition \n        associated with a person's weight gain or obesity is based on a \n        multitude of factors, including genetic factors and the \n        lifestyle and physical fitness decisions of individuals, such \n        that a person's weight gain, obesity, or a health condition \n        associated with a person's weight gain or obesity cannot be \n        attributed solely to the consumption of any specific food or \n        beverage; and\n            (4) because fostering a culture of acceptance of personal \n        responsibility is one of the most important ways to promote a \n        healthier society, lawsuits seeking to blame individual food \n        and beverage providers for a person's weight gain, obesity, or \n        a health condition associated with a person's weight gain or \n        obesity are not only legally frivolous and economically \n        damaging, but also harmful to a healthy America.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to allow Congress, State \nlegislatures, and regulatory agencies to determine appropriate laws, \nrules, and regulations to address the problems of weight gain, obesity, \nand health conditions associated with weight gain or obesity.\n\nSEC. 3. PRESERVATION OF SEPARATION OF POWERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--A qualified civil liability action may not be \nbrought in any Federal or State court.\n    (b) Dismissal of Pending Actions.--A qualified civil liability \naction that is pending on the date of the enactment of this Act shall \nbe dismissed immediately by the court in which the action was brought \nor is currently pending.\n    (c) Discovery.--\n            (1) Stay.--In any action that is allegedly of the type \n        described in section 4(5)(B) seeking to impose liability of any \n        kind based on accumulative acts of consumption of a qualified \n        product, the obligation of any party or non-party to make \n        disclosures of any kind under any applicable rule or order, or \n        to respond to discovery requests of any kind, as well as all \n        proceedings unrelated to a motion to dismiss, shall be stayed \n        prior to the time for filing a motion to dismiss and during the \n        pendency of any such motion, unless the court finds upon motion \n        of any party that a response to a particularized discovery \n        request is necessary to preserve evidence or to prevent undue \n        prejudice to that party.\n            (2) Responsibility of parties.--During the pendency of any \n        stay of discovery under paragraph (1), the responsibilities of \n        the parties with regard to the treatment of all documents, data \n        compilations (including electronically recorded or stored \n        data), and tangible objects shall be governed by applicable \n        Federal or State rules of civil procedure. A party aggrieved by \n        the failure of an opposing party to comply with this paragraph \n        shall have the applicable remedies made available by such \n        applicable rules, provided that no remedy shall be afforded \n        that conflicts with the terms of paragraph (1).\n    (d) Pleadings.--In any action that is allegedly of the type \ndescribed in section 4(5)(B) seeking to impose liability of any kind \nbased on accumulative acts of consumption of a qualified product, the \ncomplaint initiating such action shall state with particularity--\n            (1) each element of the cause of action;\n            (2) the Federal and State statutes or other laws that were \n        allegedly violated;\n            (3) the specific facts alleged to constitute the claimed \n        violation of law; and\n            (4) the specific facts alleged to have caused the claimed \n        injury.\n    (e) Rule of Construction.--No provision of this Act shall be \nconstrued to create a public or private cause of action or remedy.\n\nSEC. 4.
