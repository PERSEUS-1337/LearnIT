FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Nearly one-third of the 800 bird species in the United \n        States are endangered, threatened, or in significant decline.\n            (2) In the United States alone, an estimated 1 billion \n        birds die annually from striking buildings, bridges, and other \n        manmade structures, with glass being one of the primary causes \n        of the deaths.\n            (3) Birds have a significant impact on the United States \n        economy, as evidenced by United States Fish and Wildlife \n        Service estimates that the 47 million birdwatchers in the \n        United States contribute $40 billion annually to the Nation's \n        economy.\n            (4) The General Services Administration is obligated, under \n        Executive Order 13186, to ``support the conservation intent of \n        the migratory bird conventions by integrating bird conservation \n        principles, measures, and practices into agency activities and \n        by avoiding or minimizing, to the extent practicable, adverse \n        impacts on migratory bird resources when conducting agency \n        actions''.\n\nSEC. 3.
