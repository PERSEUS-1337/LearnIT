FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Kissimmee River has undergone, over the course of \n        two decades, the largest river restoration effort in the world.\n            (2) Extending approximately 105 miles from Orlando to Lake \n        Okeechobee, the Kissimmee River forms the headwaters of Lake \n        Okeechobee and the Everglades and serves as a vital component \n        of ecosystem restoration in South Florida as a whole.\n            (3) The Kissimmee River Restoration Project has \n        significantly improved approximately 63,000 acres of wetlands \n        within the Kissimmee River watershed and reestablished an \n        environment suitable for fish, wildlife, and the wetland plants \n        that existed prior to the Kissimmee River's channelization in \n        the 1960s.\n            (4) The Kissimmee River Restoration Project is expected to \n        be completed in 2020, at which point it is expected to \n        reestablish historic hydrologic conditions, recreate historic \n        river and floodplain connectivity, recreate the historic mosaic \n        of wetland plant communities, and restore historic biological \n        diversity and functionality.\n            (5) After decades of restoration efforts and the \n        expenditure of nearly a billion dollars, upon completion of the \n        Kissimmee River Restoration Project, a study should be \n        conducted to determine the eligibility of including the fully \n        restored Kissimmee River into the National Wild and Scenic \n        River program to preserve the fully restored free-flowing \n        condition and immediate environment of the river for the \n        benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations.\n            (6) Inclusion of the Kissimmee River into the National Wild \n        and Scenic River program would be a fitting tribute to the hard \n        work of the Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water \n        Management District's restoration work.\n\nSEC. 3. DESIGNATION FOR STUDY.\n\n    (a) Designation for Potential Addition.--Section 5(a) of the Wild \nand Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1276(a)) is amended by adding at the \nend the following:\n            ``(__) Kissimmee river, florida.--The segment from the \n        southern shore of Lake Kissimmee to its confluence with Lake \n        Okeechobee.''.\n    (b) Study.--Section 5(b) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 \nU.S.C. 1276(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(__) Kissimmee river, florida.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--Not later than 3 years after the \n                date on which funds are made available to carry out \n                this paragraph, the Secretary of the Interior shall \n                complete a study of the Kissimmee River, as described \n                in subsection (a)(__), and submit a report describing \n                the results of such study to the Committee on Natural \n                Resources of the House of Representatives and the \n                Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the \n                Senate.\n                    ``(B) Report requirements.--The report required \n                under subparagraph (A) shall--\n                            ``(i) include a discussion of the effect of \n                        the designation of the segment to be studied \n                        under subsection (a)(__) on--\n                                    ``(I) existing commercial and \n                                recreational activities, such as cattle \n                                ranching, dairy production, hunting, \n                                fishing, trapping, recreational \n                                shooting, motor boat use, or bridge \n                                construction;\n                                    ``(II) the authorization, \n                                construction, operation, maintenance, \n                                or improvement of energy production and \n                                transmission infrastructure;\n                                    ``(III) military operations; and\n                                    ``(IV) the authority of State and \n                                local governments to manage the \n                                activities described in subclauses (I) \n                                and (II); and\n                            ``(ii) identify--\n                                    ``(I) all authorities that will \n                                authorize or require the Secretary of \n                                the Interior to influence local land \n                                use decisions (such as zoning) or place \n                                restrictions on non-Federal land if the \n                                area studied under subsection (a)(__) \n                                is designated under the Wild and Scenic \n                                Rivers Act;\n                                    ``(II) all authorities that the \n                                Secretary of the Interior may use to \n                                condemn property if the area studied \n                                under subsection (a)(__) is designated \n                                under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act; \n                                and\n                                    ``(III) all private property \n                                located in the area to be studied under \n                                subsection (a)(__).\n                    ``(C) Noninterference.--This study shall not \n                interfere with the Kissimmee River Restoration Project \n                authorized under section 101(8) of the Water Resources \n                Development Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-580).''.\n    (c) No Negative Impact.--Nothing authorized by this Act may \nnegatively impact agricultural production in the Kissimmee River basin.\n    (d) No Effect on Management.--This Act and the amendments made by \nthis Act shall not interfere with the current management of the area of \nthe Kissimmee River described in section 5(a)(__) of the Wild and \nScenic Rivers Act, nor shall the fact that such area is listed for \nstudy under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1271 et seq.) be \nused as justification for more restrictive management, such as \nwilderness or as a category of wild \n\n\n              \n\nand scenic river, until Congress acts on the study recommendations.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives April 16, 2018.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                 KAREN L.
