HIGH QUALITY FULL-DAY PREKINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS.\n\n    Chapter 8 of subtitle A of title VI of the Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-35; 95 Stat. 357) is amended \nby inserting after subchapter C the following:\n\n     ``Subchapter D--High Quality Full-Day Prekindergarten Programs\n\n``SEC. 661. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            ``(1) Investments in children and early education should be \n        a national priority.\n            ``(2) The cost of high quality preschool is prohibitive for \n        poor families and is a significant financial strain for many \n        working- and middle-class families.\n            ``(3) State-funded preschool is the most rapidly expanding \n        segment of the United States educational system, but in many \n        States a lack of stable funding poses an enormous threat to the \n        provision or continuation of high quality preschool.\n            ``(4) The provision of high quality prekindergarten is a \n        cost-effective investment for children and for the Nation. \n        Research shows that for every $1 invested in high quality early \n        childhood programs, taxpayers save more than $17 in crime, \n        welfare, education, and other costs.\n            ``(5) Fewer than half the Nation's poor preschool-age \n        children attend preschool. The result is a significant \n        preparation gap between poor and middle-class children and \n        between minority and white children.\n            ``(6) High quality early education increases academic \n        success for schoolchildren who received that education by--\n                    ``(A) increasing high school graduation rates;\n                    ``(B) improving children's performance on \n                standardized tests;\n                    ``(C) reducing grade repetition; and\n                    ``(D) reducing the number of children placed in \n                special education.\n            ``(7) High quality early education promotes responsible \n        behavior by teens and adults who received that education by--\n                    ``(A) reducing crime, delinquency, and unhealthy \n                behaviors such as smoking and drug use;\n                    ``(B) lowering rates of teen pregnancy;\n                    ``(C) leading to greater employment and higher \n                wages for adults; and\n                    ``(D) contributing to more stable families.\n    ``(b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to assist States in--\n            ``(1) making voluntary high quality full-day \n        prekindergarten programs available and economically affordable \n        for the families of all children for at least 1 year preceding \n        kindergarten; and\n            ``(2) making the prekindergarten programs available to a \n        target population of children from families with incomes at or \n        below 200 percent of the poverty line, for whom the \n        prekindergarten programs will be free of charge.\n\n``SEC. 662.
