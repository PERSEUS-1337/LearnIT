    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Quality Child Care for America \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Young children's environment plays an enormous role in \n        brain development. Research states that most of the brain's \n        neural connections, or synapses, are produced in the first 3 \n        years of life. Experiences that promote healthy social and \n        emotional development during these years are critically \n        important in affecting behavior and learning into adulthood.\n            (2) More than 12,000,000 children age 5 and younger, and \n        not yet in kindergarten, are in child care every week. Of \n        those, approximately 6,000,000 children under age 3 spend some \n        or all of their day being cared for by someone other than \n        parents.\n            (3) About 3 out of 5 mothers (61 percent of mothers) with \n        children under age 3 are in the workforce.\n            (4) High quality, developmentally appropriate child care \n        increases children's chances of succeeding in school. A 4-State \n        study that compared children in high-quality child care with \n        children in low-quality care found that by second grade, \n        children who had received high-quality care demonstrated \n        greater mathematical ability, greater thinking and attention \n        skills, and fewer behavioral problems than the children who had \n        received low-quality care. At-risk children were particularly \n        affected by the quality of the care they received.\n            (5) While many child care providers (both in centers and in \n        homes) are providing high quality care, too many are not \n        receiving the support they need to improve the quality of care.\n            (6) Better compensation is associated with improvements in \n        child care quality, developmental outcomes, and school \n        readiness. However, the Department of Labor reports that child \n        care workers' average yearly wage in 2006 was $18,820 ($9.05 \n        per hour), well below the $20,614 poverty threshold for a \n        family of 4.\n            (7) Low wages are inextricably linked to the reimbursement \n        rates child care providers receive for children who qualify for \n        subsidies under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act \n        of 1990. In 2006, only 9 States reimbursed the providers at the \n        federally recommended level, compared with 22 States in 2001 \n        and 13 States in 2005. Inadequate reimbursement rates make it \n        much harder for child care centers to pay above-poverty wages, \n        and for family child care providers to receive payments \n        sufficient for them to escape poverty.\n            (8) Child care providers are much more likely than the \n        workforce as a whole to lack health insurance. Twenty-seven \n        percent of child care providers had no health insurance \n        coverage in 2005. This compares with an uninsurance rate of 16 \n        percent for all female workers. And, child care providers who \n        have health insurance often cannot afford the increased out-of-\n        pocket costs for premiums and co-payments for such insurance.\n            (9) High turnover is extremely problematic in the child \n        care field, where children's social, emotional, and \n        intellectual development depend on a positive, nurturing \n        attachment to primary caregivers. Thirty-five percent of \n        individuals employed as child care providers in 2005 were no \n        longer employed as child care providers 1 year later.\n            (10) Additional investments in the child care workforce are \n        necessary to attract and retain qualified child care providers. \n        In the small but highly successful Child Care WAGES project, \n        which provides education-based salary supplements to low-paid \n        preschool teachers, preschool directors, and family child care \n        providers in 4 States, turnover rates range from 12 percent to \n        17 percent, far lower than the national average.\n            (11) Research shows that quality child care is contingent \n        upon the special training child care providers receive in the \n        area of child development. Both increased formal education \n        levels and recent, specialized training in child development \n        have been found consistently to be associated with high-quality \n        interactions with children and children's development.\n            (12) Lack of affordable, reliable, high-quality child care \n        not only adversely affects children but is also an important \n        factor in determining whether workers with family \n        responsibilities have the capacity to maintain employment. \n        Especially for low-income working mothers, access to child care \n        is often a critical component in that determination.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    Section 658B of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of \n1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``There'' and inserting the following ``(a) \n        In General.--There'';\n            (2) by inserting ``(other than section 658H)'' after ``this \n        subchapter''; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b) Workforce Development Initiatives.--There are authorized to \nbe appropriated to carry out section 658H $200,000,000 for fiscal year \n2008 and each subsequent fiscal year.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
