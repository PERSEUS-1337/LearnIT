PREVENTING GUN TRAFFICKING BY RESTRICTING HANDGUN TRANSFERS TO \n              ONE PER MONTH.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 922 of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(z)(1) The Congress finds and declares that--\n            ``(A) crime, particularly crime involving drugs and guns, \n        is a pervasive, nationwide problem;\n            ``(B) crime at the local level is exacerbated by the \n        interstate movement of drugs, guns, and criminal gangs;\n            ``(C) firearms and ammunition move easily in interstate \n        commerce;\n            ``(D) the illegal movement of firearms, and handguns in \n        particular, across state lines is a widespread and pervasive \n        national problem;\n            ``(E) handguns (even when lawfully purchased) are \n        unlawfully transported across state lines by gun traffickers \n        and are illegally sold to prohibited persons;\n            ``(F) in fact, even before a firearm is illegally sold by a \n        trafficker, the gun, its component parts, ammunition, and the \n        raw materials from which it is made have moved in interstate \n        commerce;\n            ``(G) law-abiding persons may fear to travel interstate or \n        to or through certain parts of the country due to concern about \n        violent crime and gun violence;\n            ``(H) the illegal movement of handguns across state lines \n        substantially affects the national market for firearms, because \n        handguns sold in one State in which there are few restrictions \n        provide a convenient source for the acquisition of handguns by \n        gun traffickers who transport the handguns to jurisdictions \n        with stronger restrictions;\n            ``(I) the unlawful sale of firearms by traffickers provides \n        a method by which firearms can be bought and sold anonymously, \n        without background checks and without record-keeping \n        requirements to enable gun tracing;\n            ``(J) handguns sold by traffickers are often obtained by \n        criminals and other prohibited persons who frequently use guns \n        that cannot be traced to commit crimes;\n            ``(K) handgun violence is a pervasive, national problem \n        that is exacerbated by the availability of handguns through gun \n        traffickers;\n            ``(L) firearms from traffickers have been involved in \n        subsequent crimes including drug offenses, crimes of violence, \n        property crimes, and illegal possession by felons and other \n        prohibited persons;\n            ``(M) because gun trafficking is often an interstate \n        activity, individual States and localities are often severely \n        hampered in combating illegal handgun purchases--even States \n        and localities that have made strong efforts to prevent, \n        detect, and punish gun-related crime and illegal trafficking of \n        firearms--as a result of the failure or inability of other \n        States or localities to take strong measures; and\n            ``(N) the Congress has the power, under the interstate \n        commerce clause and other provisions of the Constitution, to \n        ensure, by enactment of this section, that criminals and other \n        prohibited persons do not obtain firearms through gun \n        traffickers.\n    ``(2) It shall be unlawful for any licensed importer, licensed \nmanufacturer, or licensed dealer--\n            ``(A) during any 30-day period, to sell, deliver or \n        transfer 2 or more handguns to any single person (other than a \n        licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer), \n        or\n            ``(B) to sell, deliver or transfer a handgun to any single \n        person (other than a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, \n        or licensed dealer), knowing or having reasonable cause to \n        believe that the transferee has already received one or more \n        handguns within the previous 30 days.\n    ``(3)(A) It shall be unlawful for any person (other than a licensed \nimporter, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer) to receive more \nthan one handgun within any 30-day period.\n    ``(B) Under such rules and regulations as the Secretary shall \nprescribe, subparagraph (A) shall not apply to the loan or rental of a \nsingle handgun solely for purposes of target shooting, provided that \nthe recipient possesses no more than one such loaned or rented handgun \nat any one time.\n    ``(4) Under such rules and regulations as the Secretary shall \nprescribe, paragraphs (2) and (3) shall not apply to--\n            ``(A) handguns transferred to or received by qualified \n        private security companies licensed to do business within the \n        State where the transfer occurs for use by the company in its \n        security operations, provided that any handgun transferred \n        under this subsection is transferred through a licensed dealer \n        located in the State where the security company is licensed to \n        do business;\n            ``(B) the disposition made of a handgun delivered to a \n        person licensed under section 923 for the sole purpose of \n        repair or customizing when such handgun or a replacement \n        handgun of the same kind and type is returned to the person \n        from whom it was received;\n            ``(C) the loan or rental of a single handgun from a person \n        licensed under section 923, provided that the recipient \n        possesses no more than one such loaned or rented handgun at any \n        one time;\n            ``(D) the redemption of pawned handguns from a person \n        licensed under section 923 by the person from whom the handguns \n        were received;\n            ``(E) the receipt of curio or relic handguns by a licensed \n        collector;\n            ``(F) the receipt of a single handgun from a person \n        licensed under section 923 to replace a lost or stolen handgun \n        of the same kind or type, where the transferee has submitted to \n        the licensee a copy of an official police report establishing \n        the loss or theft of a handgun or handguns;\n            ``(G) the transfer of handguns by bequest;\n            ``(H) the transfer of handguns to the transferor's spouse, \n        child, parent, stepparent, grandparent, grandchild, brother, or \n        sister; or\n            ``(I) the transfer of all or part of a personal firearms \n        collection (as that term is defined in regulations to be \n        prescribed by the Secretary) that includes handguns, provided \n        that the handguns in the collection are transferred through a \n        licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer located in the State \n        where the transferee resides.''.\n    (b) Penalties.--Section 924(a)(2) of such title is amended by \nstriking ``or (o)'' and inserting ``(o), or (z)''.\n    (c) Increased Penalties for Licensees Who Knowingly Make False \nStatements in Required Records.--\n            (1) Section 924(a)(3) of such title is amended--\n                    (A) by striking ``(A)'';\n                    (B) by striking ``or'' after ``chapter'';\n                    (C) by striking subsection (B); and\n                    (D) by striking ``one year'' and inserting ``5 \n                years''.\n            (2) Section 924(a) of such title is amended by adding at \n        the end the following:\n    ``(7) Any licensed dealer, licensed importer, licensed \nmanufacturer, or licensed collector who knowingly violates section \n922(m) shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 1 \nyear, or both.''.\n    (d) Conforming Changes to the Brady Law.--Section 922(t) of such \ntitle is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1)(B)(ii), by striking ``(g) or (n)'' and \n        inserting ``(g), (n), or (z)'';\n            (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``(g) or (n)'' and \n        inserting ``(g), (n), or (z)'';\n            (3) in paragraph (3), by striking subparagraph (A) and \n        redesignating subparagraphs (B) and (C) as subparagraphs (A) \n        and (B), respectively;\n            (4) in paragraph (4), by striking ``(g) or (n)'' and \n        inserting ``(g), (n), or (z)'';
