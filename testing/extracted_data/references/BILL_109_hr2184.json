FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Researchers in the field of public health have \n        identified the need for a national study to identify \n        constraints encountered by schools of nursing in graduating the \n        number of nurses sufficient to meet the health care needs of \n        the United States.\n            (2) The shortage of qualified registered nurses has \n        adversely affected the health care system of the United States.\n            (3) Individual States have had varying degrees of success \n        with programs designed to increase the recruitment and \n        retention of nurses.\n            (4) Schools of nursing have been unable to provide a \n        sufficient number of qualified graduates to meet the workforce \n        needs.\n            (5) Many nurses are approaching the age of retirement, and \n        the problem worsens each year.\n            (6) In 2004, an estimated 125,000 applications from \n        qualified applicants were rejected by schools of nursing, due \n        to a shortage of faculty and a lack of capacity for additional \n        students.\n\nSEC. 3.

and\n            (2) developing recommendations to alleviate the constraints \n        on a short-term and long-term basis.\n    (b) Certain Components.--The Secretary shall ensure that the \nagreement under subsection (a) provides that the study under such \nsubsection will include information on the following:\n            (1) The trends in applications for attendance at schools of \n        nursing that are relevant to the purpose described in such \n        subsection, including trends regarding applicants who are \n        accepted for enrollment and applicants who are not accepted, \n        particularly qualified applicants who are not accepted.\n            (2) The number and demographic characteristics of entry-\n        level and graduate students currently enrolled in schools of \n        nursing, the retention rates at the schools, and the number of \n        recent graduates from the schools, as compared to previous \n        years and to the projected need for registered nurses based on \n        two-year, five-year, and ten-year projections.\n            (3) The number and demographic characteristics of nurses \n        who pursue graduate education in nursing and non-nursing \n        programs but do not pursue faculty positions in schools of \n        nursing, the reasons therefor, including any regulatory \n        barriers to choosing to pursue such positions, and the effect \n        of such decisions on the ability of the schools to obtain \n        adequate numbers of faculty members.\n            (4) The extent to which entry-level graduates of the \n        schools are satisfied with their educational preparation, \n        including their participation in nurse externships, \n        internships, and residency programs, and to which they are able \n        to effectively transition into the nursing workforce.\n            (5) The satisfaction of nurse managers and administrators \n        with respect to the preparation and performance levels of \n        entry-level graduates from the schools after one-year, three-\n        year, and five-years of practice, respectively.\n            (6) The extent to which the current salary, benefit \n        structures, and characteristics of the workplace, including the \n        number of nurses who are presently serving in faculty \n        positions, influence the career path of nurses who have pursued \n        graduate education.\n            (7) The extent to which the use of innovative technologies \n        for didactic and clinical nursing education might provide for \n        an increase in the ability of schools of nursing to train \n        qualified nurses.\n    (c) Recommendations.--Recommendations under subsection (a)(2) may \ninclude recommendations for legislative or administrative changes at \nthe Federal or State level, and measures that can be taken in the \nprivate sector--\n            (1) to facilitate the recruitment of students into the \n        nursing profession;\n            (2) to facilitate the retention of nurses in the workplace; \n        and\n            (3) to improve the resources and ability of the education \n        and health care systems to prepare a sufficient number of \n        qualified registered nurses.\n    (d) Methodology of Study.--\n            (1) Scope.--The Secretary shall ensure that the agreement \n        under subsection (a) provides that the study under such \n        subsection will consider the perspectives of nurses and \n        physicians in each of the various types of inpatient, \n        outpatient, and residential facilities in the health care \n        delivery system;
