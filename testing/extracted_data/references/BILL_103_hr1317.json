FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Franchise business relationships represent a large and \n        growing segment of the Nation's retail and service businesses \n        and are replacing more traditional forms of small business \n        ownership in the American economy.\n            (2) Despite the growing importance of franchising in the \n        American marketplace, there is little objective or reliable \n        statistical information available to the public on the number, \n        ownership, and operation of franchise businesses; and broad-\n        based, objective data or investigations of franchise failures \n        are virtually non-existent.\n            (3) While there is a void of reliable statistics, a large \n        amount of statistical information is routinely provided in \n        articles and talks about franchising and in promotional \n        material for franchise opportunities that seek to represent \n        franchises as uniformly successful and virtually risk free.\n            (4) Inaccurate or misleading statistical information is \n        routinely attributed to Federal Government agencies and \n        reports, and data on franchise business compiled prior to 1987 \n        by the United States Department of Commerce continue to be \n        widely cited, misrepresented or misused.\n            (5) Franchisees may suffer substantial losses from \n        investment in a franchise business without accurate or reliable \n        information or with expectations based on false or misleading \n        statistical information regarding the operation and success of \n        franchise businesses.\n    (b) It is the purpose of this Act to provide the public with \ncomprehensive statistical information about franchising and the \nperformance of franchise systems, to enhance the reliability of \ninformation made available to the public regarding franchise practices, \nand to assure that prospective investors have the information necessary \nto make an informed decision on whether to invest in a franchise \nbusiness.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL FILING AND DATA COLLECTION.\n\n    (a) Filing of Franchise Disclosure Documents--\n            (1) All persons, partnerships or corporations engaged in \n        selling or offering for sale any franchise, or any relationship \n        which is represented either orally or in writing to be a \n        franchise, whether within a state or in interstate commerce, \n        shall file with the United States Department of Commerce \n        (hereafter, the ``Commerce Department'') a copy of the \n        franchise disclosure document or circular for such franchise; \n        and\n            (2) The disclosure document or circular to be filed under \n        this subsection shall be:\n                    (A) the most recent version of such document or \n                circular which incorporates information that is current \n                as of the close of the franchisor's most recent fiscal \n                year; and\n                    (B) the most restrictive version of such document \n                or circular, and of the franchise agreement, provided \n                by the franchisor to any prospective franchisee, in \n                terms of the requirements imposed on franchisees and \n                the limitations on the rights and remedies available to \n                franchisees in the franchise agreement;\n            (3) The disclosure document or circular described in \n        paragraph (2) shall be filed annually at a time and in a manner \n        set forth in regulation by the Commerce Department;\n            (4) The Commerce Department shall make available to the \n        Congress, the Federal Trade Commission and other Federal \n        agencies, as requested, copies of any disclosure documents \n        filed under this subsection, and shall establish procedures \n        under which such documents may be viewed by the public; and\n            (5) It shall be unlawful for a franchisor, subfranchisor or \n        franchise broker to make any statement or reference in \n        connection with any advertisement or disclosure document, or in \n        any oral or written statement or other representation to a \n        prospective franchisee, that a disclosure document has been \n        filed with the Commerce Department, or to make any statement or \n        representation that suggests or implies that the Commerce \n        Department or an other Federal agency has in any way reviewed \n        the content of the disclosure document, made any finding with \n        regard to the content of such document, or has in any way \n        passed upon the merits of, or given approval to, the franchise \n        opportunity.\n    (b) Data Collection and Publication--\n            (1) The Commerce Department shall, not later than two \n        hundred and forty days after the date of enactment of this \n        section, establish procedures for the compilation, analysis and \n        publication of statistical information on franchise ownership \n        and national franchising practices.
