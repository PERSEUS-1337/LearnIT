    "content": "The Military Personnel Records division of the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), a component of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) located in St. Louis, Missouri, holds most existing U.S. military personnel, health, and medical records of discharged and deceased veterans of all services from World War I to the present. Neither the NPRC nor the Department of Defense (DOD) intends to destroy the physical records of U.S. servicemembers. Some older records have been electronically scanned to reduce the handling of fragile records. See NARA's site \"Access to Military Service and Pension Records\" at https://www.archives.gov/research/order/order-vets-records.html .  Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) records may be requested online at https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records , by using the Standard Form 180 and submitting by mail (the appropriate address listed on the back of the form), or fax (314-801-9195).  Veterans and their next-of-kin (NOK) may request these records. According to the NPRC, for the Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, the NOK is defined as the unremarried widow or widower, son, daughter, father, mother, brother or sister; for the Army, the NOK is defined as the surviving spouse, eldest child, father or mother, eldest sibling or eldest grandchild.  If an individual does not meet the definition of a NOK, he or she is considered a member of the general public and may request military personnel records via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See \"Access to OMPFs for the General Public\" at https://www.archives.gov/st-louis/military-personnel/public/general-public.html . In 1973, a fire at NPRC destroyed approximately 16 million to 18 million Army and Air Force official military personnel files. In such cases where files were lost, NPRC uses alternate sources of information to respond to requests. More information about obtaining military personnel files can be found on the NPRC website, http://www.archives.gov/st-louis/military-personnel/ , or by contacting the center at National Personnel Records Center Military Personnel Records 1 Archives Drive St. Louis, MO 63138 Tel: [phone number scrubbed] congressional line Tel: [phone number scrubbed] public line Status Update Request Form: https://www.archives.gov/st-louis/forms Older military personnel records (generally prior to 1917) are located at  National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Textual Archives Division Washington, DC 20408 http://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records/pre-ww-1-records.html  For guidance on the review of discharges and military corrections boards, see NARA's \" Veterans' Service Records: Correcting Military Service Records \" . For i nformation on the military service review boards (Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, and Navy and Marine Corps) , see \" Boards for Correction of Military Records (BCMR) / Discharge Upgrades \" site. NARA's site also provides the following BCMR guidance:  \" Prior to submitting a request to a Board for Correction of Military Records, ALL administrative avenues must be used. Generally, that means a request to NPRC for a correction (minor corrections can be made by NPRC), then a request to the military service department (service departments can make more corrections than NPRC), and finally if both these fail, then submit DD Form 149, with supporting evidence as instructed on the form .\" The NPRC also provides information and guidance on how to request military awards and decorations online and by mail for veterans and their NOK; replacing certain military medals; and obtaining a Cold War Recognition Certificate. This is available for the records of a servicemember who separated before or during 1956. For records for individuals who separated after 1956, these records can be requested through FOIA. The general public may also purchase a copy of the veteran's OMPF to determine the awards due and obtain the medals from a commercial source. Individuals can request information on military service medals, decorations and awards online: https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/awards-and-decorations .  By military service (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force including Army Air Corps & Army Air Forces) via mail: National Personnel Records Center 1 Archives Drive St. Louis, MO 63138 For Coast Guard: Coast Guard Personnel Service Center 4200 Wilson Blvd., Suite 900 (PSC-PSD-MA) Stop 7200 Arlington, VA 20598-7200 The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 1998 ( P.L. 105-85 ) in Section 1084 required the Secretary of Defense to prepare a certificate recognizing the Cold War service of qualifying members of the Armed Forces and civilian personnel of DOD and other government agencies contributing to national security. This certificate, known as the \"Cold War Recognition Certificate,\" may be awarded upon individual request to all members of the Armed Forces and qualified federal government civilian personnel who served the United States during the Cold War era from September 2, 1945, to December 26, 1991.  The Modern Military Records office of NARA has custody of records relating to World War I, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. The records vary by conflict and branch of service; for example, the records for Army units active during the interwar periods (1920-1939 and 1945-1950) are incomplete. For more information, contact the Textual Records office at  Textual Records Office National Archives and Records Administration at College Park 8601 Adelphi Road College Park, MD 20740-6001 Tel: [phone number scrubbed] Email: [email address scrubbed]  If a military unit record is not publicly available, a FOIA request may be submitted to the agency where the record is held. For example, for special access records held at the National Archives at College Park, contact the Archives FOIA office at the following: Special Access and FOIA Division National Archives at College Park 8601 Adelphi Road College Park, MD 20740-6001 Tel: [phone number scrubbed] Email: [email address scrubbed] For more information on how to submit a FOIA request, visit https://www.foia.gov/how-to.html . Other types of auxiliary and organizational records, including Army morning reports, Army unit rosters, Army officer pay cards, Navy muster rolls, U.S. Army Surgeon General's office records and Veterans Administration index cards are maintained at the National Archives in St. Louis, Missouri. Further information regarding these records, as well as the timespan of available records for each category, are available at http://www.archives.gov/st-louis/archival-programs/other-records/index.html . Certain published unit histories can also be found in the collections of the military departments (see Table 1 ). To support disability claims of exposure to hazardous materials (Agent Orange, asbestos, etc.), numerous veterans are culling through Army morning reports, unit rosters, pay cards, Navy muster rolls, Captain logs/Navy Deck logs, etc. during their military service. For more information on military exposures, see the VA's Military Exposure site: https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/index.asp .  At this time, VA continues to study the long-term health issues of deployed veterans and their exposure to burn pits used at military waste sites in Iraq and Afghanistan. Currently, there is no compensation available for exposure to burn pits. For more information, see the VA's Public Health site on Burn Pits at https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/burnpits/ and related CRS products on VA health care and disability in the sources below.
