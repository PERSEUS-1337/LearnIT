    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Universal Right to Vote by Mail Act \nof 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) An inequity of voting rights exists in the United \n        States because voters in some States have the universal right \n        to vote by mail while voters in other States do not.\n            (2) Many voters often have work, family, or other \n        commitments that make getting to polls on the date of an \n        election difficult or impossible. Under current State laws, \n        many of these voters are not permitted to vote by mail.\n            (3) 28 States currently allow universal absentee voting \n        (also known as ``no-excuse'' absentee voting), which permits \n        any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a \n        reason for the request, and no State which has implemented no-\n        excuse absentee voting has switched back.\n            (4) Voting by mail gives voters more time to consider their \n        choices, which is especially important as many ballots contain \n        greater numbers of questions about complex issues than in the \n        past due to the expanded use of the initiative and referendum \n        process in many States.\n            (5) Allowing all voters the option to vote by mail can lead \n        to increased voter participation.\n            (6) Allowing all voters the option to vote by mail can \n        reduce waiting times for those voters who choose to vote at the \n        polls.\n            (7) Voting by mail is preferable to many voters as an \n        alternative to going to the polls. Voting by mail has become \n        increasingly popular with voters who want to be certain that \n        they are able to vote no matter what comes up on Election Day.\n            (8) No evidence exists suggesting the potential for fraud \n        in absentee balloting is greater than the potential for fraud \n        by any other method of voting.\n            (9) Many of the reasons which voters in many States are \n        required to provide in order to vote by mail require the \n        revelation of personal information about health, travel plans, \n        or religious activities, which violate voters' privacy while \n        doing nothing to prevent voter fraud.\n            (10) State laws which require voters to obtain a notary \n        signature to vote by mail only add cost and inconvenience to \n        voters without increasing security.\n\nSEC. 3. PROMOTING ABILITY OF VOTERS TO VOTE BY MAIL IN FEDERAL \n              ELECTIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subtitle A of title III of the Help America Vote \nAct of 2002 (42 U.S.C. 15481 et seq.) is amended by inserting after \nsection 303 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 303A. PROMOTING ABILITY OF VOTERS TO VOTE BY MAIL.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--If an individual in a State is eligible to cast \na vote in an election for Federal office, the State may not impose any \nadditional conditions or requirements on the eligibility of the \nindividual to cast the vote in such election by mail, except as \nrequired under subsection (b) and except to the extent that the State \nimposes a deadline for requesting the ballot and related voting \nmaterials from the appropriate State or local election official and for \nreturning the ballot to the appropriate State or local election \nofficial.\n    ``(b) Requiring Signature Verification.--\n            ``(1) Record of signature required for provision of \n        ballot.--A State may not provide an absentee ballot to an \n        individual for an election for Federal office unless the \n        individual's signature is included on the official list of \n        registered voters in the State or some other official record of \n        the State connected to such list.\n            ``(2) Verification required for acceptance and processing \n        of submitted ballot.--A State may not accept and process an \n        absentee ballot submitted by any individual for an election for \n        Federal office unless the State verifies the identification of \n        the individual by comparing the individual's signature on the \n        absentee ballot with the individual's signature on the official \n        list or other official record referred to in paragraph (1), in \n        accordance with such procedures as the State may adopt.\n    ``(c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to affect the authority of States to conduct elections for \nFederal office through the use of polling places at which individuals \ncast ballots on the date of the election.\n    ``(d) Effective Date.--A State shall be required to comply with the \nrequirements of this section with respect to elections for Federal \noffice held in years beginning with 2012.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment Relating to Enforcement.--Section 401 of \nsuch Act (42 U.S.C. 15511) is amended by striking ``and 303'' and \ninserting ``303, and 303A''.\n    (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents for such Act is \namended by inserting after the item relating to section 303 the \nfollowing new item:\n\n``Sec. 303A. Promoting ability of voters to vote by mail.''.\n                                                 "
