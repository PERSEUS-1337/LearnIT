FINDINGS; SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The workers who mine American coal have fueled nearly 2 \n        centuries of industrial development, and are crucial to the \n        Nation's economic well-being.\n            (2) The Federal Government has had a central role with \n        regard to both the coal industry and the health and welfare of \n        coal miners. Both the Congress and the executive branch have \n        frequently intervened in the coal industry to protect the \n        interests of both coal miners and the industry itself. For \n        example--\n                    (A) the Congress enacted legislation--\n                            (i) regulating the coal industry to protect \n                        the health and safety of coal miners; and\n                            (ii) guaranteeing health care for coal \n                        miners and their families, and providing \n                        benefits to victims of black lung disease; and\n                    (B) the Executive Branch has seized the Nation's \n                coal mines for the purpose of negotiating a collective \n                bargaining agreement on the mine owners' behalf, has \n                otherwise frequently intervened in collective \n                bargaining in the coal industry, and has created \n                numerous panels and commissions to study problems and \n                issues unique to coal mining communities and the coal \n                Industry.\n            (3) Because coal is an abundant domestic resource, a strong \n        coal industry serves to reduce American dependence upon foreign \n        oil and is vital both to commerce and to the defense of the \n        United States.\n            (4) As the result of the abuse of the provisions of \n        bankruptcy law, certain coal industry employers have been able \n        to gain unfair advantages over their competitors, primarily at \n        the expense of their employees.\n    (b) Sense of the Congress.-- It is the sense of the Congress that \nthe abuse of the provisions of bankruptcy law by certain coal industry \nemployers is damaging to the economic health of the United States, as \nwell as to the employees who are directly harmed by such legal abuses.\n\nSEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO TITLE 11 OF THE UNITED STATES CODE.\n\n    Title 11 of the United States Code is amended--\n            (1) in section 101 by inserting after paragraph (5) the \n        following:\n            ``(5A) Coal industry employer.--The term `coal industry \n        employer' means an employer in the coal industry, and all \n        members of the employer's controlled group of corporations and \n        all trades and businesses under common control (within the \n        meaning of sections 52(a) and 52(b) of the Internal Revenue \n        Code of 1986).\n            ``(5B) Covered facility of a coal industry employer.--The \n        term `covered facility of a coal industry employer' means any \n        facility owned or operated by a coal industry employer that is \n        involved in the production, processing, or transportation of \n        coal.'';\n            (2) in section 363 by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(p) Notwithstanding subsection (f), a covered facility of a \ndebtor that is coal industry employer that is sold by the trustee shall \nremain subject to the labor rights of the current and former employees \nof the debtor.

The \n        United States trustee shall appoint one of such individuals to \n        serve as trustee in the case.\n            ``(C) The court finds that the executive management of the \n        debtor has not received any wage increases or bonuses during \n        the period that the case is pending under this title, or within \n        the year preceding the filing of the petition, or that any such \n        wage increases or bonuses have been disgorged and refunded to \n        the debtor.\n            ``(D) The court finds that the proposal made pursuant to \n        subsection (b)(1)(A)--\n                    ``(i) does not purport to relieve the debtor, or \n                the purchaser of a covered facility of a coal industry \n                employer, from any obligations otherwise arising under \n                the National Labor Relations Act;\n                    ``(ii) provides that the purchaser of any facility \n                owned by the debtor is to be considered a `successor' \n                under the National Labor Relations Act;\n                    ``(iii) does not abridge labor rights, as defined \n                in section 363(p); and\n                    ``(iv) provides that existing employees retain all \n                noneconomic employment rights provided under the terms \n                of the collective bargaining agreement (including the \n                right to not be terminated without cause and any recall \n                rights following a layoff), both with regard to the \n                debtor and the purchaser of a covered facility of a \n                coal industry employer.\n    ``(2) Any obligations arising under the terms of a collective \nbargaining agreement prior to the entry of relief under this section \nshall be secured by a lien on all of the assets of the debtor.''; and\n            (4) in section 1114 by adding the following at the end:\n    ``(m) If the court enters an order approving an application for the \nmodification of retiree benefits owed by a coal industry employer \nrelating to a covered facility of such coal industry employer, all \nmembers of the debtor's controlled group of corporations and all trades \nand businesses under common control (within the meaning of sections \n52(a) and 52(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be jointly \nand severally liable for all damages arising as the result of the entry \nof such order, and all such claims shall be entitled to priority \npursuant to section 507(a)(1).''.\n\nSEC. 3.
