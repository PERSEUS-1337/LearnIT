FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United Nations Human Rights Council (in this \n        section referred to as the ``UNHRC'') has long targeted Israel \n        with systematic, politically motivated, assaults on its \n        legitimacy designed to stigmatize and isolate Israel \n        internationally.\n            (2) The UNHRC maintains a permanent agenda item known as \n        ``Item 7'' to ensure that Israel will be criticized at every \n        gathering of the UNHRC.\n            (3) At its 31st session on March 24, 2016, the UNHRC \n        targeted Israel with a commercial boycott, calling for the \n        establishment of a database, such as a ``blacklist'', of \n        companies that operate, or have business relations with \n        entities that operate, beyond Israel's 1949 Armistice lines, \n        including East Jerusalem.\n            (4) At its 32nd session in March 2017, the UNHRC is \n        considering a resolution pursuant to agenda item 7 to withhold \n        assistance from and prevent trade with ``territories occupied \n        since 1967'', including East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the \n        Golan Heights, stating that businesses that engage in economic \n        activity in those areas could face civil or criminal legal \n        action.\n            (5) For a half century, Congress has combated anti-Israel \n        boycotts and other discriminatory activity under the Export \n        Administration Act of 1979 (as continued in effect pursuant to \n        the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 \n        et seq.)), under part VI of title X of the Tax Reform Act of \n        1976 (Public Law 94-455; 90 Stat. 1649) (commonly referred to \n        as the ``Ribicoff Amendment''), in free trade agreements with \n        Bahrain and Oman, and in Saudi Arabia's accession negotiations \n        to the World Trade Organization.\n            (6) The recent action of the UNHRC is reminiscent of the \n        Arab League Boycott, which also called for the establishment of \n        a ``blacklist'' and promoted a primary, as well as a secondary \n        and tertiary, boycott against Israel, targeting United States \n        and other companies that trade or invest with or in Israel, \n        designed to harm Israel, any business operating in, or doing \n        business with, Israel, or companies that do business with \n        companies operating in Israel.\n            (7) Congress recently passed anti-boycott, divestment, and \n        sanctions measures in the Bipartisan Congressional Trade \n        Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (19 U.S.C. 4201 et \n        seq.) and section 909 of the Trade Facilitation and Trade \n        Enforcement Act of 2015 (19 U.S.C. 4452), which establish, \n        among other things--\n                    (A) the opposition of the United States to actions \n                to boycott, divest from, or sanction Israel;\n                    (B) requirements that the United States utilize \n                trade negotiations to combat state-led or international \n                governmental organization-led actions to boycott, \n                divest from, or sanction Israel; and\n                    (C) reporting requirements regarding the actions of \n                foreign countries or international organizations that \n                establish barriers to trade or investment for United \n                States companies in or with Israel.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    Congress--\n            (1) opposes the United Nations Human Rights Council \n        resolution of March 24, 2016, which urges countries to pressure \n        their own companies to divest from, or break contracts with, \n        Israel, and calls for the creation of a ``blacklist'' of \n        companies that either operate, or have business relations with \n        entities that operate, beyond Israel's 1949 Armistice lines, \n        including East Jerusalem;\n            (2) views such policies as actions to boycott, divest from, \n        or sanction Israel; and\n            (3) in order to counter the effects of actions to boycott, \n        divest from, or sanction Israel, encourages full implementation \n        of the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 \n        (Public Law 113-296; 128 Stat. 4075) through enhanced, \n        governmentwide, coordinated United States-Israel scientific and \n        technological cooperation in civilian areas such as with \n        respect to energy, water, agriculture, alternative fuel \n        technology, civilian space technology, and security.\n\nSEC. 4.
