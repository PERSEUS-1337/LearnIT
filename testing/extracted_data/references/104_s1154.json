FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) there is a need for a water supply system in rural \n        northeast Montana to provide a safe, reliable, and adequate \n        water supply within the area under the jurisdiction of the Fort \n        Peck Rural County Water District, Inc.;\n            (2) no public water supply system currently serves the \n        area;\n            (3) ground water sources in the area are not potable;\n            (4) the construction of a water supply system will allow \n        for economic enhancement in Valley County in northeastern \n        Montana; and\n            (5)(A) adverse impacts on Montana, including the flooding \n        of thousands of acres of productive crop land by the Fort Peck \n        Reservoir, were caused by the construction of the Fort Peck Dam \n        in 1939; and\n            (B) the impacts have never been mitigated, and the \n        predicted benefits of the construction of the dam have never \n        been realized.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to authorize the construction of a water treatment \n        facility and distribution system to provide clean and safe \n        water for domestic and limited livestock use to residents and \n        landowners within the area under the jurisdiction of the \n        District; and\n            (2) to allocate Federal funding for the construction of the \n        water supply system instead of funding for agricultural \n        irrigation systems, which has not been appropriated, as \n        intended and as authorized under the Pick-Sloan Missouri River \n        Basin Program (authorized by section 9 of the Act entitled ``An \n        Act authorizing the construction of certain public works on \n        rivers and harbors for flood control, and for other purposes'', \n        approved December 22, 1944 (commonly known as the ``Flood \n        Control Act of 1944'') (58 Stat. 891)).\n\nSEC. 3.
