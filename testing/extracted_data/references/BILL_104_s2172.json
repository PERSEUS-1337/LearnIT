FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (a) the State of Alaska received management authority and \n        responsibility for fish and game resources in the State at the \n        time of statehood;\n            (b) the Alaska constitution requires equal access for all \n        citizens of the state to these fish and game resources;\n            (c) the State of Alaska developed statutes to implement a \n        rural subsistence priority;\n            (d) in 1980 Congress passed the Alaska National Interest \n        Lands Conservation Act providing that the ``taking on public \n        lands of fish and wildlife for nonwasteful subsistence uses \n        shall be accorded priority over the taking on such lands of \n        fish and wildlife for other purposes'';\n            (e) in 1989 the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in McDowell v. \n        Alaska that the rural preference contained in the State's \n        subsistence statute violated the equal access provision of the \n        Alaska Constitution putting the State's subsistence program out \n        of compliance with title VIII of ANILCA resulting in the \n        Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior assuming \n        subsistence management on the public lands in Alaska;\n            (f) the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor of Alaska are \n        to be complimented on their several attempts to resolve the \n        issue and return management responsibilities of fish and game \n        back to the State; however, these efforts have not been \n        successful;\n            (g) there continues to remain an impasse that is creating a \n        divisive atmosphere in Alaska among sport hunters, sport \n        fishermen, commercial fishermen, Alaska Natives, as well as \n        urban and rural residents; and\n            (h) the Congress hereby declares that it is timely and \n        essential to conduct a review of Federal and State policies and \n        programs affecting subsistence in order to identify specific \n        actions that may be taken by the United States and the State of \n        Alaska to help assure that a fair subsistence priority is \n        provided to the citizens of Alaska and that management \n        authority over fish and game resources is maintained by the \n        State of Alaska.\n\nSEC. 2.
