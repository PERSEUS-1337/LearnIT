FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The highest regard should be given to the health and \n        safety of the Nation's military personnel.\n            (2) Among the characteristics of depleted uranium munitions \n        are that (A) they are pyrophoric, resulting in the munition \n        burning upon impact with a target, and (B) the impact of a \n        depleted uranium munition on a target creates aerosol \n        particles, which can be inhaled.\n            (3) Depleted uranium munitions were used by the United \n        States in 1991 during the Persian Gulf War in Southwest Asia \n        and during the conflicts in the former Federal Republic of \n        Yugoslavia (Bosnia, Kosovo, Serbia, and Montenegro) during the \n        1990s, with approximately 300 metric tons of depleted uranium \n        being used during the Gulf War, three metric tons being used in \n        Bosnia, and over nine metric tons being used in Kosovo, Serbia, \n        and Montenegro.\n            (4) The United States has provided or sold depleted uranium \n        and depleted uranium munitions to allied nations, and the \n        United Kingdom used depleted uranium munitions during the \n        Persian Gulf War.\n            (5) Depleted uranium munitions have been used at numerous \n        United States military installations, proving grounds, and \n        testing facilities.\n            (6) The Yugoslav and Iraqi Governments have claimed that \n        depleted uranium is affecting the health of their people, \n        although such claims have yet to be independently verified.\n            (7) No definitive cause has been established for the \n        various illnesses (commonly referred to as ``Gulf War \n        Syndrome'') that currently affect approximately 130,000 United \n        States servicemembers and veterans who served in Southwest Asia \n        during the Persian Gulf War.\n            (8) The British Royal Navy, Canadian Navy, and United \n        States Navy have all announced that they would phase out use of \n        depleted uranium munitions.\n            (9) It has been reported that depleted uranium munitions \n        use has proliferated to more than 20 nations.\n            (10) Crash investigators of the Federal Aviation \n        Administration are instructed, in FAA Advisory Circular 20-123, \n        dated December 20, 1984, to ``handle with caution'' any \n        depleted uranium that they encounter in crash investigations, \n        and are instructed that ``the main hazard associated with \n        depleted uranium is the harmful effect the material could have \n        if it enters the body,'' and that ``[i]f particles are inhaled \n        or digested, they can be chemically toxic and cause a \n        significant and long-lasting irradiation of internal \n        tissues,''.\n            (11) The 1949 Geneva Convention specifically outlines the \n        precautions warring nations must take to avoid harming civilian \n        populations, and it would be a violation of the 1977 Protocol \n        to that Convention to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary \n        suffering to civilians, as depleted uranium has the potential \n        to cause.\n            (12) The Department of Defense has acknowledged that stocks \n        of depleted uranium munitions have been contaminated with \n        transuranic elements, including plutonium.\n            (13) Plutonium is an extremely toxic, carcinogenic, and \n        radioactive material with a half-life of 4.5 billion years.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To eliminate health threats from depleted uranium \n        munitions to--\n                    (A) United States military personnel and United \n                States civilian employees;\n                    (B) military personnel and employees of member \n                nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; and\n                    (C) civilian populations in regions where such \n                munitions were used (whether in conflict, training, or \n                development) or produced.\n            (2) To provide for studies of--\n                    (A) the level and scope of contamination of \n                depleted uranium munitions by plutonium and other \n                transuranic elements;\n                    (B) the health effects resulting from exposure by \n                inhalation, ingestion, or injection to depleted uranium \n                munitions; and\n                    (C) environmental contamination caused by depleted \n                uranium at sites where depleted uranium was used in \n                conflict, development, testing, or training and at \n                sites where depleted uranium and depleted uranium \n                munitions were produced.\n            (3) To require the Administrator of the Environmental \n        Protection Agency to issue regulations and requirements, based \n        upon Environmental Protection Agency studies, concerning the \n        cleanup and mitigation of depleted uranium contamination at \n        sites of depleted uranium munition use and production in the \n        United States.\n\nSEC. 4.
