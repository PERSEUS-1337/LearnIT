FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There is significant potential for replacing petroleum-\n        based products with products made using farm-grown biomass.\n            (2) The biobased industry provides value-added \n        opportunities for farmers and environmentally friendly options \n        for consumers.\n            (3) The Federal Government can play an important role in \n        the promotion of the biobased industry through procurement of \n        biobased products.\n            (4) A labeling program for biobased products would provide \n        consumers with basic, reliable information about these products \n        and raise awareness of their environmental benefits.\n            (5) By developing the market for biobased products, the \n        Federal Government also encourages increased investment and \n        employment opportunities in rural America.\n            (6) By reducing the use of petroleum and increasing \n        reliance on farm-grown raw materials, the Nation will decrease \n        its needs for imported petroleum.\n\nSEC. 3.
