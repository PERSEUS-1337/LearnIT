FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States banking system's ability to extend \n        credit on a basis consistent with healthy economic activity is \n        restricted by a need or desire to conserve capital in the face \n        of anticipated losses.\n            (2) A shortage of banking capital may continue to exist \n        because private investors are generally unwilling to provide \n        such capital given their inability to accurately assess the \n        risk exposure of any individual institution while the Federal \n        Government's ability to function as a capital provider may be \n        constrained by concerns regarding Federal control of the \n        banking system as well its desire to use Federal funds in \n        numerous areas besides capitalization of the banking system.\n            (3) State and local public pension funds are long term \n        investors whose constituents benefit from a well-capitalized \n        banking system with the ability to extend credit broadly at all \n        levels of the economy.\n            (4) Certain State and local pension plans have broad \n        investment powers under State law which would include the \n        ability to form cooperative business endeavors solely owned by \n        them or in concert with public pension plans in other States.\n            (5) Certain of these public pension plans have indicated \n        their willingness and ability to rapidly form and fund a \n        vehicle to be mutually owned by them for the sole purpose of \n        investing in preferred stocks of United States banking \n        institutions subject to certain guaranties provided by the \n        Secretary of the Treasury or other appropriate Federal \n        Government officer or agency.\n\nSEC. 3.
