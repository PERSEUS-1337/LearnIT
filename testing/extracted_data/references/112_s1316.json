CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The fiscal crisis faced by the Federal Government \n        demands immediate action.\n            (2) The dramatic growth in spending and debt in recent \n        years threatens our economic and national security:\n                    (A) Federal spending has grown from 18 percent of \n                GDP in 2001 to 24 percent of GDP in 2010.\n                    (B) Total Federal debt exceeds $14 trillion and has \n                increased $4 trillion in the past three years alone.\n                    (C) Without action, the Federal Government will \n                continue to run massive deficits in the next decade and \n                total Federal debt will rise to $24 trillion by 2021.\n                    (D) Interest payments on this debt will soon rise \n                to the point where balancing the budget as a matter of \n                policy is beyond the reach of Congress.\n            (3) From 1980 to 2010, Federal revenues averaged 18 percent \n        of GDP and are projected to return to that level within the \n        next decade.\n            (4) Absent reform, the growth of Social Security, Medicare, \n        and Medicaid will overwhelm all other Federal programs and \n        consume all projected tax revenues.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to address the fiscal \ncrisis by--\n            (1) acting quickly to balance the Federal budget and \n        eliminate the parade of deficits and ballooning interest \n        payments;\n            (2) achieving balance by reducing spending one percent per \n        year until spending equals projected long-term revenues; and\n            (3) reforming entitlement programs to ensure long-term \n        fiscal stability and balance.\n\nSEC. 3.
