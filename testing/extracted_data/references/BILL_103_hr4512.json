SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) the lack of entry level jobs which lead to permanent \n        gainful employment is a significant impediment to the ability \n        of welfare recipients to enter the workforce;\n            (2) even the healthiest economy would be hard-pressed to \n        create the requisite number of entry level jobs necessary to \n        provide permanent employment to a significant percentage of \n        AFDC recipients;\n            (3) funds which are currently spent for AFDC payments would \n        have greater economic value if exchanged for work;\n            (4) ``make work'' government workfare programs to require \n        work to exchange for AFDC payments are no substitute for \n        experience in the private sector, which develops valuable \n        skills and can lead to permanent, gainful employment; and\n            (5) in order to break the cycle of welfare, maximize the \n        economic value of AFDC payments by exchanging them for work, \n        provide AFDC recipients with a pathway to permanent, gainful \n        employment, and support the efforts to business to hire AFDC \n        recipients, a one-year tax credit should be extended to \n        businesses for wages paid to employees whose employment results \n        in a termination of AFDC eligibility.\n\nSEC. 3.
