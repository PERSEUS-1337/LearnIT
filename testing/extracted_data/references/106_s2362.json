PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to establish more effective environmental standards to \n        continue to safeguard public health and the environment;\n            (2) to promote better resource allocation to ensure that \n        serious risks to air quality are addressed first;\n            (3) to improve the ability of the Administrator of the \n        Environmental Protection Agency to use scientific and economic \n        analysis in developing air quality standards;\n            (4) to yield increased public health and environmental \n        benefits and more effective protections while minimizing costs;\n            (5) to require that relevant qualitative and quantitative \n        information be considered in the process of evaluating the \n        costs and benefits of air quality standards;\n            (6) to promote the right of the public to know about the \n        costs and benefits of air standards, the risks addressed, the \n        risks reduced, and the quality of scientific and economic \n        analysis used to support decisions; and\n            (7) to require the Administrator of the Environmental \n        Protection Agency to conduct risk assessments and cost-benefit \n        analyses as part of the process of establishing a new or \n        revised air quality standard.\n\nSEC. 3.
