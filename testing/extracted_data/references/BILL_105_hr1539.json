FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) Since the creation of low-power television licenses by \n        the Federal Communications Commission, a small number of \n        license holders have operated their stations in a manner most \n        beneficial to the public good. Many of these stations have \n        provided broadcasting to their communities that would not \n        otherwise have been available.\n            (2) These low-power broadcasters have operated their \n        stations in a manner consistent with the programming objectives \n        and hours of operation of full-power broadcasters. These small \n        stations have provided these worthwhile services to their \n        respective communities while under severe license limitations \n        compared to their full-power counterparts.\n            (3) These license limitations, particularly the temporary \n        nature of the license, have blocked many of these broadcasters \n        from having access to capital, and have severely hampered their \n        ability to continue to provide quality broadcasting, \n        programming, or improvements.\n            (4) The passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 has \n        added to the uncertainty of the future status of these stations \n        by the lack of specific provisions regarding the permanency of \n        their licenses, or their treatment during the transition to \n        high definition, digital television.\n\nSEC. 3. PRESERVATION OF LOW-POWER COMMUNITY TELEVISION BROADCASTING.\n\n    (a) Amendment.--Section 336 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \nU.S.C. 334) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsections (f) and (g) as subsections \n        (g) and (h), respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after subsection (e) the following new \n        subsection:\n    ``(f) Preservation of Low-Power Community Television \nBroadcasting.--\n            ``(1) Creation of class a licenses.--Within 30 days after \n        the date of enactment of the Community Broadcasting Protection \n        Act of 1997, the Commission shall prescribe regulations to \n        establish a class A license for qualifying low-power television \n        stations. Such license shall be subject to the same license \n        term and renewal standards as the licenses for full-power \n        television stations, and shall be accorded primary status as \n        television broadcasters under the Commission's regulations. \n        Within 30 days after such date, the Commission shall send a \n        notice to the licensees of all low-power television licenses of \n        the terms of this section. The Commission shall, within 30 days \n        after receipt of an application that is acceptable for filing, \n        award such a class A television station license to any licensee \n        of a qualifying low-power television station who submits such \n        application within 90 days after receipt of such notice.\n            ``(2) Qualifying low-power television stations.--For \n        purposes of this subsection, a station is a qualifying low-\n        power television station if--\n                    ``(A) during the 90 days preceding the date of \n                enactment of the Community Broadcasting Protection Act \n                of 1997--\n                            ``(i) such station broadcast a minimum of \n                        18 hours per day;\n                            ``(ii) such station broadcast an average of \n                        at least 3 hours per week of programming that \n                        was produced within the community of license of \n                        such station; and\n                            ``(iii) such station was in compliance with \n                        the requirements applicable to low-power \n                        television stations; or\n                    ``(B) the Commission determines that the public \n                interest, convenience, and necessity would be served by \n                treating the station as a qualifying low-power \n                television station for purposes of this section.\n            ``(3) Issuance of licenses for advanced television services \n        to qualifying low-power television stations not required.--The \n        Commission is not required to issue any additional licenses for \n        advanced television services to the licensees of the class A \n        television stations. Such a licensee may, at the option of \n        licensee, elect to convert to the provision of advanced \n        television services, but shall not be required to provide such \n        services until the Commission requires the use of digital or \n        other advanced technologies by full-power television stations.\n            ``(4) Preservation of class a stations.--Except as \n        expressly permitted by this paragraph, no licensee of a class A \n        television station shall be required to cease operations, nor \n        shall the license of such a licensee be rescinded or otherwise \n        terminated, for the purposes of implementing any amendments to \n        the table of allotments adopted before the date of enactment of \n        the Community Broadcasting Protection Act of 1997 to provide \n        additional licenses for advanced television services. The \n        Commission may order such a cessation, rescission, or \n        termination only after compliance with the following \n        requirements:\n                    ``(A) The Commission shall revise such table of \n                allotments to preserve each class A station unless the \n                preservation of such station (i) would render \n                impossible the assignment of an additional license for \n                advanced television services to a full-power station, \n                or (ii) would require the Commission to revoke or \n                rescind a construction permit issued to such full-power \n                station.\n                    ``(B) If the Commission cannot revise the table of \n                allotments to preserve a class A station as required by \n                subparagraph (A), the Commission shall, to the maximum \n                extent possible, revise the table of allotments to \n                preserve the class A station in the same community of \n                license, using the same facilities, by assigning to \n                such station a different frequency.\n                    ``(C) If the Commission cannot revise the table of \n                allotments to preserve a class A station as required by \n                subparagraph (A) or (B), the Commission shall seek to \n                provide such licensee with a class A license in a \n                community of license that is adjacent to the station's \n                previous community of license.\n                    ``(D) If the Commission cannot preserve a class A \n                station as required by subparagraph (A), (B), or (C), \n                the Commission shall award such licensee the license \n                for another station in another community of license \n                acceptable to the licensee, to the extent that the \n                license for such other station is available. Such a \n                licensee shall be preferred in the award of such other \n                station license over any other applicant (other than \n                another licensee of a class A television station that \n                is required to relinquish its existing license).''."
