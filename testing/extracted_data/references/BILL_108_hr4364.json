FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The governments of low income oil-producing countries \n        often do not provide information to the people of such \n        countries regarding their oil revenues. Such opacity can hide \n        billions of dollars worth of financial impropriety.\n            (2) The governments of such countries have generally \n        refused to disclose information regarding their oil revenues \n        when pressed by international organizations and others, \n        proclaiming that such disclosure is an infringement on national \n        sovereignty.\n            (3) As a result, the people of such countries are left \n        without the necessary information to ensure proper management \n        and accountability regarding such oil revenues. Dispossessed, \n        the people of such countries are often left marginalized and at \n        the mercy of donor assistance. In Angola, for example, one in \n        every four oil dollars earned is unaccounted for. At the same \n        time, one in four Angolan children dies before the age of five \n        from preventable diseases.\n            (4) In some low income oil-producing countries, government-\n        imposed royalties and fees on the revenues of business \n        enterprises engaged in oil production are often misappropriated \n        and squandered. These businesses are then left vulnerable to \n        accusations of complicity with corruption.\n            (5) The governments of low income oil-producing countries \n        that mismanage oil revenues are often unstable and do not \n        survive, creating further instability that threatens the supply \n        of vital industrial commodities and forcing the international \n        community to respond with costly emergency assistance to those \n        countries.\n            (6) A key to promoting political, economic, and social \n        reform in low income oil-producing is transparency in public \n        finances.\n            (7) If the governments of such countries tell their people \n        how much oil revenue the government receives and how that \n        revenue is allocated and expended, the resulting transparency \n        will engender more realistic public expectations, more \n        plausible national development programs, and better means to \n        combat corruption and promote democracy, respect for human \n        rights, and the rule of law.\n            (8) Transparency by such foreign governments will benefit \n        United States business enterprises as well. Respect for the \n        rule of law, codified regulatory practices, and transparent \n        bidding and award practices deter corruption and encourage a \n        level playing field in such countries for United States \n        business enterprises.\n            (9) Export credit activities and other bilateral \n        concessional loan programs of the United States Government for \n        low income oil-producing countries should require that any \n        assistance under such activities and programs be conditional on \n        appropriate transparency by the governments of such countries \n        relating to oil revenues.\n            (10) International financial institutions such as the World \n        Bank should incorporate revenue transparency across their \n        lending and technical assistance portfolios by making full \n        transparency a condition of all their financial support and by \n        including it in their national poverty reduction strategy \n        consultations.\n            (11) One bold and promising model is the Chad/Cameroon \n        Pipeline Project, under which the Government of Chad, private \n        investors, and the World Bank Group have established an \n        accountability and oversight mechanism for the country's \n        revenues derived from oil production.\n            (12) Donald Norland, former United States Ambassador to \n        Chad, in testimony on April 18, 2002, before the Committee on \n        International Relations of the House of Representatives stated \n        that the Chad/Cameroon Pipeline Project ``has addressed these \n        extraordinarily challenging issues in ways that may well serve \n        as a model for developing natural resources in other \n        countries''.\n            (13) Ambassador Norland further testified that: ``Success \n        will require keeping the project in the spotlight of public \n        attention as well as under constant scrutiny and monitoring by \n        outside groups . . . Scrutiny is the key to transparency. \n        Transparency is, in turn, indispensable in guaranteeing that \n        oil resources go . . . to projects that reduce poverty while \n        preserving the environment and advancing human rights . . . to \n        make sure that revenues go to benefit the people of Chad and \n        not to private bank accounts.''.\n\nSEC. 3. LIMITATION ON UNITED STATES ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FOR LOW INCOME \n              OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRIES.\n\n    Chapter 1 of part III of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \nU.S.C. 2351 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating the second section 620G (as added by \n        section 149 of Public Law 104-164 (110 Stat. 1436)) as section \n        620J; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 620K.
