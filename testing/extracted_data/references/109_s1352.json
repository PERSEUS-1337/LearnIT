GRANTS TO STATES FOR IMPROVED WORKPLACE AND COMMUNITY \n              TRANSITION TRAINING FOR INCARCERATED YOUTH OFFENDERS.\n\n    Section 821 of the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 (20 U.S.C. \n1151) is amended to read as follows:\n\n``SEC. 821. GRANTS TO STATES FOR IMPROVED WORKPLACE AND COMMUNITY \n              TRANSITION TRAINING FOR INCARCERATED YOUTH OFFENDERS.\n\n    ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            ``(1) Almost 60 percent of the prison population in 2002 \n        was less than 35 years old.\n            ``(2) Less than 32 percent of State prison inmates have a \n        high school diploma or a higher level of education, compared to \n        82 percent of the general population.\n            ``(3) Approximately 38 percent of inmates who completed 11 \n        years or less of school were not working before entry into \n        prison.\n            ``(4) The percentage of State prisoners participating in \n        educational programs has decreased by more than 8 percent over \n        the period 1991-1997, despite growing evidence of how \n        educational programming while incarcerated reduces recidivism.\n            ``(5) Among inmates released from prison in 1999, the \n        average time served in prison for the current offense was 29 \n        months, compared with 22 months served by those released from \n        prison in 1990. Time spent in prison provides a unique \n        opportunity for education and training.\n            ``(6) At least 95 percent of all State prisoners will be \n        released from prison at some point.\n            ``(7) In 2001, 592,000 offenders were released from State \n        prison, a 46 percent increase over the 405,400 offenders that \n        were released in 1990.\n            ``(8) The average age of prisoners released to parole \n        increased from 31 years in 1990 to 34 years in 1999.\n            ``(9) Approximately 62 percent of State prisoners will be \n        rearrested within 3 years, with 41 percent returning to prison \n        or jail.\n            ``(10) The recidivism rate for those inmates that \n        participate in education programs while incarcerated is \n        approximately 10 percent lower than non-participants.\n            ``(11) Even with quality education and training provided \n        during incarceration, a period of intense supervision, support, \n        and counseling is needed upon release to ensure effective \n        reintegration of youth offenders into society.\n    ``(b) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term `youth \noffender' means a male or female offender under the age of 35, who is \nincarcerated in a State prison, including a prerelease facility.\n    ``(c) Grant Program.--The Secretary of Education (in this section \nreferred to as the `Secretary')--\n            ``(1) shall establish a program in accordance with this \n        section to provide grants to the State correctional education \n        agencies in the States, from allocations for the States under \n        subsection (i), to assist and encourage youth offenders to \n        acquire functional literacy, life, and job skills, through--\n                    ``(A) the pursuit of a postsecondary education \n                certificate, or an associate or bachelor's degree while \n                in prison;
