FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Green River bottoms area, Kentucky, was once part \n        of a large bottomland hardwood forest;\n            (2) most of the bottoms area has been converted to \n        agricultural use through--\n                    (A) draining of wetland;\n                    (B) altering of interior drainage systems; and\n                    (C) clearing of bottomland hardwood forest;\n            (3) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the bottoms \n        area is predominantly ridge and swale farmland, with river-scar \n        oxbows, several sloughs, wet depression areas, and a small \n        quantity of bottomland hardwood forest;\n            (4) approximately 1,200 acres of bottomland hardwood forest \n        remain, consisting mostly of cypress, willow, hackberry, silver \n        maple, ash, and buttonbush;\n            (5) many of the interior drainage systems on the land offer \n        excellent opportunities to restore, with minor modifications, \n        the historical hydrology, wetland, and bottomland hardwood \n        forest of the bottoms area to high-quality wildlife habitats;\n            (6) in the bottoms area, waterfowl occur in large numbers \n        when sufficient water levels occur, primarily when flood \n        conditions from the Ohio River and the Green River negate the \n        extensive drainages and alterations made by man;\n            (7) the wooded and shrub tracts of the bottoms area are \n        used by many species of nongame neotropical migratory birds;\n            (8) migratory shorebirds use the bottoms area during spring \n        migrations;\n            (9) wading birds such as snipe, great blue heron, green \n        heron, common egret, and great egret frequent the bottoms area;\n            (10) bald eagles and myriad other raptors frequent the \n        bottoms area;\n            (11) several species listed as endangered or threatened \n        species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n        1531 et seq.) have been found near the bottoms area, including \n        Indiana bat maternity colonies, fanshell, pink mucket pearly \n        mussel, and fat pocketbook;\n            (12) several species of mussel listed as endangered or \n        threatened species under that Act historically occurred near \n        the bottoms area, including purple cat's paw pearly mussel, \n        tubercled-blossom pearly mussel, ring pink, and white wartyback \n        pearly mussel;\n            (13) the copperbelly water snake, covered by the \n        Copperbelly Water Snake Conservation Plan, is found in the \n        wetland complex and buttonbush shrub in the Scuffletown area;\n            (14) significant populations of resident game species, \n        including white-tailed deer, swamp rabbit, cottontail rabbit, \n        gray squirrel, mink, muskrat, beaver, fox, and coyote, occur in \n        the bottoms area;\n            (15) the Ohio River and the Green River are important \n        habitat for big river species such as paddlefish, sturgeon, \n        catfish, carp, buffalo, and gar;\n            (16) conservation, enhancement, and ecological restoration \n        of the bottoms area through inclusion in the National Wildlife \n        Refuge System would help meet the habitat conservation goals \n        of--\n                    (A) the North American Waterfowl Management Plan;\n                    (B) the Lower Mississippi Joint Venture;\n                    (C) the Interior Low Plateaus Bird Conservation \n                Plan; and\n                    (D) the Copperbelly Water Snake Conservation Plan;\n            (17) the valuable complex of wetland habitats comprising \n        the bottoms area, with its many forms of wildlife, has \n        extremely high recreational value for hunters, anglers, \nbirdwatchers, nature photographers, and others; and\n            (18) the Green River bottoms area is deserving of inclusion \n        in the National Wildlife Refuge System.\n\nSEC. 3.
