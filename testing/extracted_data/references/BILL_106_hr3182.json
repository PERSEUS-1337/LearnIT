FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds and declares the following:\n            (1) Section 6(a) of the Alaska Statehood Act (48 U.S.C., \n        note preceding section 21) granted 400,000 acres of national \n        forest land to the State of Alaska for the purpose of \n        furthering development of and expansion of communities. In \n        1969, the State of Alaska selected 17,040 acres of this Federal \n        land grant at the request of the city of Craig, Alaska, but \n        this and other selections were not approved by the United \n        States Forest Service.\n            (2) On December 18, 1971, the Alaska Native Claims \n        Settlement Act (48 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) was enacted to settle \n        outstanding Native aboriginal claims to lands in the State of \n        Alaska. The settlement included the direction to convey certain \n        lands to Alaska Native village corporations located in \n        Southeast Alaska. These conveyances included all of the public \n        land in the vicinity of the city of Craig that was selected by \n        the State of Alaska in 1969.\n            (3) Pursuant to ANCSA, the Federal Government conveyed \n        3,960 acres of public land within the city of Craig, and all \n        public land surrounding the community, to 2 Native village \n        corporations. These adjoining conveyances occupy 93 percent of \n        the 4,258 acres within the city limits of the city of Craig. \n        Outside of the existing 200-acre Craig townsite, no other land \n        within 10 miles of the Craig city limits has been available for \n        selection under the Alaska Statehood Act.\n            (4) In the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act \n        (16 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.), the Congress exempted Native \n        corporations from municipal taxation of their underdeveloped \n        land, and enacted a tax recapture provision, in section \n        907(d)(5) of that Act (43 U.S.C. 1636(d)(5)), that acts as a \n        further disincentive to development of Native village \n        corporation land.\n            (5) Under the laws of the State of Alaska, incorporated \n        municipalities are entitled to a share of available State land \n        within their corporate limits. However, the enactment of ANCSA \n        and circumstances experienced by no other municipality in \n        Alaska, including Federal land conveyances to 2 adjoining \n        Native village corporations, has prevented the city of Craig \n        from acquiring a State land entitlement.\n            (6) Since 1971, the city of Craig has grown from a \n        population of 250 people to nearly 2,500 people and its \n        demographics have changed, making it difficult for Craig to \n        qualify for many programs enacted by the Congress to provide \n        assistance to villages with majority Alaska Native populations.\n            (7) Provisions of Federal tax laws and Federal land \n        conveyances have had the unintended effect of preventing the \n        city of Craig from exercising its governmental powers to tax 93 \n        percent of the land within the municipality, and to receive any \n        of the Federal land grant promised at the time of Alaska \n        statehood for community expansion and development.\n\nSEC. 3.
