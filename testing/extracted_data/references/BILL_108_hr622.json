FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n        (1) Certain private lands adjacent to the Montezuma Castle \n    National Monument in Yavapai County, Arizona, are desirable for \n    Federal acquisition to protect important riparian values along \n    Beaver Creek and the scenic backdrop for the National Monument.\n        (2) Certain other inholdings in the Coconino National Forest \n    are desirable for Federal acquisition to protect important public \n    values near Double Cabin Park.\n        (3) Approximately 108 acres of land within the Tonto National \n    Forest, northeast of Payson, Arizona, are currently occupied by 45 \n    residential cabins under special use permits from the Secretary of \n    Agriculture, and have been so occupied since the mid-1950s, \n    rendering such lands of limited use and enjoyment potential for the \n    general public. Such lands are, therefore, appropriate for transfer \n    to the cabin owners in exchange for lands that will have higher \n    public use values.\n        (4) In return for the privatization of such encumbered lands \n    the Secretary of Agriculture has been offered approximately 495 \n    acres of non-Federal land (known as the Q Ranch) within the Tonto \n    National Forest, east of Young, Arizona, in an area where the \n    Secretary has completed previous land exchanges to consolidate \n    public ownership of National Forest lands.\n        (5) The acquisition of the Q Ranch non-Federal lands by the \n    Secretary will greatly increase National Forest management \n    efficiency and promote public access, use, and enjoyment of the \n    area and surrounding National Forest System lands.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize, direct, \nfacilitate, and expedite the consummation of the land exchanges set \nforth herein in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Act.\n\nSEC. 2.
