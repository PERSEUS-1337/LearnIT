FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The economy of the United States cannot achieve strong, \n        sustained growth without adequate levels of savings to fuel \n        productive activity. Inadequate savings have been shown to lead \n        to lower productivity, stagnating wages and reduced standards \n        of living.\n            (2) Savings levels in the United States have steadily \n        declined over the past 25 years, and have lagged behind the \n        industrialized trading partners of the United States.\n            (3) These anemic savings levels have contributed to the \n        country's long-term downward trend in real economic growth, \n        which averaged close to 3.5 percent over the last 100 years but \n        has slowed to 2.4 percent over the past quarter century.\n            (4) Congress should work toward reforming the entire \n        Federal tax code to end its bias against savings by eliminating \n        the income tax and capital gains tax and replacing them with a \n        broad-based consumption tax. A broad-based retail consumption \n        tax is the most effective tax system because it encourages \n        savings, is fair, its simple to comply with and to administer, \n        and it fosters exports.\n            (5) Repealing the estate and gift tax would contribute to \n        the goals of expanding savings and investment, boosting \n        entrepreneurial activity, and expanding economic growth. The \n        estate tax is harmful to the economy because of its high \n        marginal rates and its multiple taxation of income.\n            (6) The repeal of the inheritance tax would increase the \n        growth of the small business sector, which creates a majority \n        of new jobs in our Nation. Estimates indicate that as many as \n        70 percent of small businesses do not make it to a second \n        generation and nearly 90 percent do not make it to a third.\n            (7) Eliminating the inheritance tax would lift the \n        compliance burden from farmers and family businesses. On \n        average, family-owned businesses spent over $33,000 on \n        accountants, lawyers, and financial experts in complying with \n        the estate tax laws over a 6.5-year period.\n            (8) Abolishing the inheritance tax would benefit the \n        preservation of family farms. Nearly 95 percent of farms and \n        ranches are owned by sole proprietors or family partnerships, \n        subjecting most of these estates to inheritance taxes upon the \n        death of the owner. Due to the capital intensive nature of \n        farming and its low return on investment, many farm estates do \n        not have the necessary liquidity to meet their estate tax \n        liability and are forced to sell their land.\n            (9) As the average age of farmers approaches 60 years, it \n        is estimated that a quarter of all farmers could confront the \n        inheritance tax over the next 20 years. The auctioning of these \n        productive assets to finance tax liabilities destroys jobs and \n        harms the economy.\n            (10) Abolishing the inheritance taxes would restore a \n        measure of fairness to our Federal tax system. Families should \n        be able to pass on the fruits of the labor to the next \n        generation without realizing a taxable event.\n            (11) Despite this heavy burden on entrepreneurs, farmers, \n        and our entire economy, estate and gift taxes collect only \n        about 1 percent of our Federal tax revenues. In fact, the \n        estate tax may not raise any revenue at all, because more \n        income tax is lost from individuals attempting to avoid estate \n        taxes than is ultimately collected at death.\n            (12) Repealing estate and gift taxes is supported by the \n        White House Conference on Small Business, the Kemp Commission \n        on Tax Reform, and 60 small business advocacy organizations.\n\nSEC. 3.
