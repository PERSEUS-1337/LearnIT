    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Disaster Relief Volunteer Protection \nAct of 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is in the national interest to encourage individuals \n        to volunteer to assist victims of national disasters.\n            (2) The exposure of potential volunteers, their employers, \n        and those who would use volunteers' services under existing law \n        to compensatory and punitive damages for negligent acts \n        discourages the provision of these services.\n            (3) The availability of damages in these circumstances for \n        actions that constitute gross negligence creates uncertainty \n        concerning the actual conduct that might cause liability to be \n        imposed on volunteers.\n            (4) Potential liability for acts of volunteers discourages \n        the employers or business partners of potential volunteers from \n        permitting those potential volunteers to provide disaster \n        relief services.\n            (5) Potential liability for acts of volunteers discourages \n        entities that might use the services provided by volunteers in \n        national disasters from doing so.\n            (6) Well-founded fear of liability under existing law for \n        providing goods discourages governmental and intergovernmental \n        entities from providing needed disaster relief goods.\n            (7) Well-founded fear of liability for punitive damages \n        under existing law discourages governmental and \n        intergovernmental entities from providing needed disaster \n        relief goods and discourages potential volunteers from \n        providing volunteer services to disaster victims.\n            (8) Fear of compensatory and punitive damages for providing \n        volunteer services deters potential volunteers from states \n        located outside the national disaster area from providing \n        volunteer services.\n            (9) Fear of compensatory and punitive damages for providing \n        volunteer services deters potential foreign volunteers from \n        providing disaster relief services.\n            (10) Any lessening of liability for volunteers providing \n        disaster relief services, their employers and business \n        partners, and entities utilizing their services should maintain \n        adequate incentives for each of these classes of persons or \n        entities to avoid causing harm.\n            (11) Unwillingness to provide volunteer services to \n        disaster victims in the face of uncertain liability \n        substantially affects, burdens, and deters interstate commerce \n        and travel.\n            (12) Unwillingness of employers and business partners to \n        allow their employees and business partners to provide disaster \n        relief services in the face of uncertain liability \n        substantially affects, burdens, and deters interstate commerce \n        and travel.\n            (13) Unwillingness of persons, entities, or organizations \n        to accept disaster relief services from volunteers in the face \n        of uncertain liability substantially affects, burdens, and \n        deters interstate commerce and travel.\n            (14) Unwillingness by foreigners to provide voluntary \n        disaster relief services in the face of uncertain liability \n        substantially affects, burdens, and deters foreign commerce and \n        travel.\n            (15) Unless Congress provides uniform standards to address \n        disasters that could occur in any State or combination of \n        states, potential volunteers and others will not be certain \n        which laws would govern their providing disaster relief \n        services, which would substantially affect, burden, and deter \n        interstate and foreign commerce and travel in the event of a \n        national disaster.\n\nSEC. 3. DISASTER RELIEF VOLUNTEERS.\n\n    (a) Liability of Disaster Relief Volunteers.--A disaster relief \nvolunteer shall not be liable for any injury (including personal \ninjury, property damage or loss, and death) caused by an act or \nomission of such volunteer in connection with such volunteer's \nproviding or facilitating the provision of disaster relief services \nif--\n            (1) the injury was not caused by willful, wanton, or \n        reckless misconduct by the volunteer; and\n            (2) the injury was not caused by the volunteer's operating \n        a motor vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or other vehicle for which \n        the state requires the operator or the owner of the vehicle, \n        craft, or vessel to--\n                    (A) possess an operator's license; or\n                    (B) maintain insurance.\n    (b) Liability of Employer or Partner of Disaster Relief \nVolunteer.--An employer or business partner of a disaster relief \nvolunteer shall not be liable for any act or omission of such volunteer \nin connection with such volunteer's providing or facilitating the \nprovision of disaster relief services.\n    (c) Liability of Host or Enabling Person, Entity, or \nOrganization.--A person or entity, including a governmental entity, \nthat works with, accepts services from, or makes its facilities \navailable to a disaster relief volunteer to enable such volunteer to \nprovide disaster relief services shall not be liable for any act or \nomission of such volunteer in connection with such volunteer's \nproviding such services.\n    (d) Liability of Nonprofit Organizations.--A nonprofit organization \nshall not be liable for any injury (including personal injury, property \ndamage or loss, and death) caused by an act or omission in connection \nwith such nonprofit organization's providing or facilitating the \nprovision of disaster relief services if the injury was not caused by \nwillful, wanton, or reckless misconduct by the nonprofit organization.\n    (e) Liability of Governmental and Intergovernmental Entities for \nDonations of Disaster Relief Goods.--A governmental or \nintergovernmental entity that donates to an agency or instrumentality \nof the United States disaster relief goods shall not be liable for any \ninjury (including personal injury, property damage or loss, and death) \ncaused by such donated goods if the injury was not caused by willful, \nwanton, or reckless misconduct by such governmental or \nintergovernmental entity.\n    (f) Limitation on Punitive and Noneconomic Damages Based on Actions \nof Disaster Relief Volunteers and Governmental Donors.--\n            (1) Punitive damages.--Unless the claimant establishes by \n        clear and convincing evidence that its damages were proximately \n        caused by willful, wanton, or reckless misconduct by either--\n                    (A) a disaster relief volunteer in any civil action \n                brought for injury caused by the volunteer's providing \n                or facilitating the provision of disaster relief \n                services; or\n                    (B) a governmental or intergovernmental entity in \n                any civil action brought for injury caused by disaster \n                relief goods donated by such governmental or \n                intergovernmental entity;\n        punitive damages may not be awarded in any civil action against \n        such a volunteer or governmental entity.\n            (2) Noneconomic damages.--\n                    (A) General rule.--In any civil action brought \n                against--\n                            (i) a disaster relief volunteer for injury \n                        caused by such volunteer's providing or \n                        facilitating the provision of disaster relief \n                        services; or\n                            (ii) a governmental or intergovernmental \n                        entity for injury caused by disaster relief \n                        goods donated by such governmental entity;\n                liability for noneconomic loss, if permitted under \n                subsection (a) or (e) of this section, shall be \n                determined in accordance with this subparagraph.\n                    (B) Amount of liability.--(i) The amount of \n                noneconomic loss allocated to the disaster relief \n                volunteer or governmental or intergovernmental entity \n                defendant shall be in direct proportion to the \n                percentage of responsibility of that defendant \n                (determined in accordance with clause (ii)) for the \n                harm to the claimant with respect to which that \n                defendant is liable.
