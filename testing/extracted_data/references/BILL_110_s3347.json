DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR ADDITIONAL SECONDARY SCHOOL \n              COUNSELORS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Part H of title I of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6551 et seq.) is amended by adding at \nthe end the following:\n\n  ``Subpart 3--Demonstration Project for Additional Secondary School \n                               Counselors\n\n``SEC. 1841. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) Nationally, only 70 percent of students graduate from \n        high school with a regular high school diploma.\n            ``(2) Every school day, 7,000 high school students in the \n        United States become dropouts.\n            ``(3) High school students living in low-income families \n        drop out of school at 6 times the rate of their peers from \n        high-income families.\n            ``(4) Only about 55 percent of African-American students \n        and 52 percent of Hispanic students graduate on time from high \n        school with a regular diploma, compared to 78 percent of white \n        students.\n            ``(5) The dropout rate for students with disabilities is \n        approximately twice that of general education students.\n            ``(6) High school is the final transition into adulthood \n        and the world of work as students begin separating from parents \n        and exploring and defining their independence. Students who are \n        deciding who they are and what they will do when they graduate \n        face many pressures, including high-stakes testing, the \n        challenges of college admissions, the scholarship and financial \n        aid application process, and entrance into a competitive job \n        market. They need guidance in these complex decisions, which \n        have serious and life changing consequences.\n            ``(7) School counseling programs are essential for students \n        to achieve optimal personal growth, acquire positive social \n        skills and values, set appropriate career goals, and realize \n        full academic potential to become productive, contributing \n        members of the world community.\n            ``(8) Professional secondary school counselors are highly \n        qualified educators with a mental health perspective who \n        understand and respond to the challenges presented by today's \n        diverse student population.\n            ``(9) The professional secondary school counselor holds a \n        master's degree or higher in school counseling (or the \n        substantial equivalent), and is certified or licensed by the \n        State in which the counselor works.\n            ``(10) Professional secondary school counselors are \n        integral to the total educational program. They provide \n        proactive leadership that engages all stakeholders in the \n        delivery of programs and services to help the student achieve \n        success in school. Professional secondary school counselors \n        align and work with the school's mission to support the \n        academic achievement of all students as they prepare for the \n        ever-changing world of the 21st century.\n            ``(11) Professional secondary school counselors' \n        opportunities to assist students are often hindered by \n        extraordinarily high student-to-counselor ratios. Currently, \n        the average student-to-counselor ratio in America's public \n        schools is 479 to 1. The American School Counselor Association, \n        the American Counseling Association, and the National \n        Association for College Admissions Counseling all recommend a \n        ratio of 1 school counselor to 250 students and a lower ratio \n        for counselors working primarily with students at risk.\n\n``SEC. 1842. DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--From amounts made available to carry out this \nsubpart, the Secretary shall carry out a demonstration project under \nwhich the Secretary makes grants on a competitive basis to secondary \nschools that receive funds under this title and have a 4-year adjusted \ncohort graduation rate of 60 percent or lower.\n    ``(b) Grants.--A grant under this section shall be for a period of \n4 years and may be used--\n            ``(1) to provide additional school counselors during that \n        period; and\n            ``(2) to provide additional resources (such as professional \n        development expenses or travel expenses for home visits, and \n        any services and materials referred to in subsection (d)) and \n        to pay overhead expenses.\n    ``(c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that a \nsecondary school that receives a grant under this section should aim to \nprovide, under subsection (b)(1), 1 additional counselor per 250 \nstudents at risk.\n    ``(d) Scope of Counseling.--The additional school counselors \nprovided with funds under this subpart shall identify students who are \nat risk of not graduating in 4 years and shall provide counseling \nprimarily to those students. The counselors may identify such students \nat any time, but shall strive to identify the students before the \nstudents enter grade 9. Services shall be provided as long as \nnecessary, including to the extent allowable and appropriate, after the \nstudent's cohort graduation date. The counseling provided--\n            ``(1) may include a full panoply of services, including an \n        individual graduation plan and other resources, such as \n        appropriate course placement and supplemental services (to \n        include not only supplemental educational services tutoring if \n        available at the school site, but also other tutoring as \n        necessary, along with supplemental books and materials); and\n            ``(2) shall include meetings with each student identified \n        under this subsection and with the teachers, tutors, \n        supplemental educational services providers, and parents of the \n        student, and may also include meetings with other relevant \n        individuals, such as a probation officer, mentor, coach, or \n        employer of the student.\n    ``(e) Supplement Not Supplant.--Funds provided under this subpart \nshall be used to supplement, and not supplant, funds from non-Federal \nsources available to carry out activities described in this section. \nThe additional school counselors provided through funds under this \nsubpart shall be in addition to any employees who work in the secondary \nschool guidance or counseling office, such as counselors, college \nadmissions specialists, career development specialists, guidance \ninformation specialists, or any other professional or paraprofessional.\n    ``(f) Additional Grant Periods.--\n            ``(1) In general.--A secondary school that receives a grant \n        under this section and demonstrates adequate improvement over \n        the period of the grant is eligible to receive a second grant \n        for a second period. If the secondary school again demonstrates \n        adequate improvement over that second period, the school is \n        eligible to receive a third grant for a third period. The third \n        grant shall provide amounts that decrease for each year of the \n        third period and require the school to provide corresponding \n        increases in non-Federal funds.\n            ``(2) Adequate improvement.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n        a school demonstrates adequate improvement over a grant period \n        if the 4-year adjusted cohort graduation rate increases (or is \n        projected to increase) by 10 percent or more over that period.\n    ``(g) Selection.--The Secretary shall carry out the demonstration \nproject under this section in not less than 10 schools. The first 5 \nschools selected to participate shall each be from a different State.\n\n``SEC. 1843.
