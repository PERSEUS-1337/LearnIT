FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) career and technical education provides education \n        pathways that help students explore interests and careers that \n        support the United States economy;\n            (2) the United States needs to develop renewable energy \n        options that conserve energy and provide energy efficiency and \n        new and yet unrecognized fields are developing as a result of \n        the attention and focus on renewable energy, and new workers \n        will be needed for professions in these fields;\n            (3) the Conference of Mayors reports that millions of U.S. \n        workers across a wide range of familiar occupations, States, \n        and income and skill levels will all benefit from the project \n        of defeating global warming and transforming the United States \n        into a green economy;\n            (4) a report commissioned by the American Solar Energy \n        Society attributed 8.5 million jobs in 2006 to renewable energy \n        or energy efficient industries and the Apollo Alliance predicts \n        that the Nation could generate 3 million to 5 million more \n        green jobs over the next 10 years;\n            (5) more than 40 percent of the fastest growing occupations \n        will require an associate's degree, a postsecondary vocational \n        certificate, or extensive job training, according to a Bureau \n        of Labor Statistics Report;\n            (6) more than 80 percent of respondents in the National \n        Association of Manufacturers 2005 skills gap report indicated \n        that they are experiencing a shortage of qualified workers \n        overall with 13 percent reporting severe shortages and 68 \n        percent indicating moderate shortages;\n            (7) career and technical education graduates are more \n        likely to be in the labor force and earn more than graduates \n        who have a high school degree; and\n            (8) career and technical education programs need support in \n        acquiring the latest technology and developing programs that \n        prepare students for the new and emerging renewable energy \n        field.\n\nSEC. 3.
