CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Final Report of the American Indian Policy Review \n        Committee, published in 1977, made a number of recommendations \n        regarding the United States administration of its trust \n        relationship with federally recognized Indian tribes and their \n        members, many of which have not been implemented.\n            (2) There has been no general, comprehensive review of the \n        United States trust relationship with federally recognized \n        Indian tribes since the publication of the Final Report of the \n        American Indian Policy Review Committee.\n            (3) The trust relationship has evolved over time and there \n        is a clear need to re-examine the administration of the United \n        States constitutional trust responsibility.\n            (4) The duties administered by Federal agencies charged \n        with protecting federally recognized Indian tribal trust \n        resources and providing services often conflict with other \n        duties discharged by the same or separate Federal agencies and \n        departments and it is the beneficiaries of the trust \n        relationship that suffer as a result.\n            (5) In carrying out its trust responsibilities to federally \n        recognized Indian tribes and their members, it is crucial that \n        Congress have the benefit of a review of the United States \n        trust relationship with federally recognized Indian tribes to \n        improve its ability to exercise oversight over the Executive \n        Branch, pursue policies to empower tribal self-determination, \n        and better administer the trust relationship.\n\nSEC. 3. DECLARATION.\n\n    Congress declares that it is timely and essential to conduct a \nreview of the current state of the United States unique trust \nrelationship with federally recognized Indian tribes and their members \nin order to better administer constitutional trust responsibilities and \nmake necessary revisions in relevant trust statutes, regulations, and \npolicies for the benefit of American Indian people.\n\nSEC. 4.
