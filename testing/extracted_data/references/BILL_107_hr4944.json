PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish the Cedar Creek and Belle \nGrove National Historical Park in order to--\n        (1) help preserve, protect, and interpret a nationally \n    significant Civil War landscape and antebellum plantation for the \n    education, inspiration, and benefit of present and future \n    generations;\n        (2) tell the rich story of Shenandoah Valley history from early \n    settlement through the Civil War and beyond, and the Battle of \n    Cedar Creek and its significance in the conduct of the war in the \n    Shenandoah Valley;\n        (3) preserve the significant historic, natural, cultural, \n    military, and scenic resources found in the Cedar Creek Battlefield \n    and Belle Grove Plantation areas through partnerships with local \n    landowners and the community; and\n        (4) serve as a focal point to recognize and interpret important \n    events and geographic locations within the Shenandoah Valley \n    Battlefields National Historic District representing key Civil War \n    battles in the Shenandoah Valley, including those battlefields \n    associated with the Thomas J. (Stonewall) Jackson campaign of 1862 \n    and the decisive campaigns of 1864.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) The Battle of Cedar Creek, also known as the battle of \n    Belle Grove, was a major event of the Civil War and the history of \n    this country. It represented the end of the Civil War's Shenandoah \n    Valley campaign of 1864 and contributed to the reelection of \n    President Abraham Lincoln and the eventual outcome of the war.\n        (2) 2,500 acres of the Cedar Creek Battlefield and Belle Grove \n    Plantation were designated a national historic landmark in 1969 \n    because of their ability to illustrate and interpret important eras \n    and events in the history of the United States. The Cedar Creek \n    Battlefield, Belle Grove Manor House, the Heater House, and Harmony \n    Hall (a National Historic Landmark) are also listed on the Virginia \n    Landmarks Register.\n        (3) The Secretary of the Interior has approved the Shenandoah \n    Valley Battlefields National Historic District Management Plan and \n    the National Park Service Special Resource Study, both of which \n    recognized Cedar Creek Battlefield as the most significant Civil \n    War resource within the historic district. The management plan, \n    which was developed with extensive public participation over a 3-\n    year period and is administered by the Shenandoah Valley \n    Battlefields Foundation, recommends that Cedar Creek Battlefield be \n    established as a new unit of the National Park System.\n        (4) The Cedar Creek Battlefield Foundation, organized in 1988 \n    to preserve and interpret the Cedar Creek Battlefield and the 1864 \n    Valley Campaign, has acquired 308 acres of land within the \n    boundaries of the National Historic Landmark. The foundation \n    annually hosts a major reenactment and living history event on the \n    Cedar Creek Battlefield.\n        (5) Belle Grove Plantation is a Historic Site of the National \n    Trust for Historic Preservation that occupies 383 acres within the \n    National Historic Landmark. The Belle Grove Manor House was built \n    by Isaac Hite, a Revolutionary War patriot married to the sister of \n    President James Madison, who was a frequent visitor at Belle Grove. \n    President Thomas Jefferson assisted with the design of the house. \n    During the Civil War Belle Grove was at the center of the decisive \n    battle of Cedar Creek. Belle Grove is managed locally by Belle \n    Grove, Incorporated, and has been open to the public since 1967. \n    The house has remained virtually unchanged since it was built in \n    1797, offering visitors an experience of the life and times of the \n    people who lived there in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n        (6) The panoramic views of the mountains, natural areas, and \n    waterways provide visitors with an inspiring setting of great \n    natural beauty. The historic, natural, cultural, military, and \n    scenic resources found in the Cedar Creek Battlefield and Belle \n    Grove Plantation areas are nationally and regionally significant.\n        (7) The existing, independent, not-for-profit organizations \n    dedicated to the protection and interpretation of the resources \n    described above provide the foundation for public-private \n    partnerships to further the success of protecting, preserving, and \n    interpreting these resources.\n        (8) None of these resources, sites, or stories of the \n    Shenandoah Valley are protected by or interpreted within the \n    National Park System.\n\nSEC. 4.
