    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Worker's Freedom of Choice Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Because of the statutory requirements that certain \n        workers must pay dues or fees to certain labor organizations \n        subject to the National Labor Relations Act, workers who pay \n        dues or fees to labor organizations should not, as a matter of \n        law, be required to support activities of labor organizations \n        that do not relate directly to the express purposes of the \n        National Labor Relations Act, to-wit, those purposes expressed \n        in the policies found in section 1 of such Act, (29 U.S.C. \n        151). In enacting the National Labor Relations Act, Congress \n        expressly recognized that a purpose of the Act was to protect \n        the freedom of association or actual liberty of contract of \n        employees. To strengthen the ability of labor organizations to \n        represent all employees with regard to the express purposes of \n        the National Labor Relations Act, it is statutorily provided \n        that labor organizations regulated by such Act may require \n        employees to pay dues or fees to a labor organization as a \n        condition of their employment.\n            (2) Some labor organizations use the general treasury funds \n        that consist of, or include, statutorily required dues and fees \n        paid by employees for purposes other than the express purposes \n        of the National Labor Relations Act. Some labor organizations \n        use such treasury funds to support political candidates, tax-\n        exempt organizations, issue advocacy and lobbying in support of \n        legislation or causes which individual workers may not \n        otherwise support and are not directly related to the express \n        statutory purposes for which those funds are collected from \n        workers by legislative mandate. Such uses of funds violate the \n        rights and freedoms of association of employees for which the \n        collective bargaining rights are statutorily protected under \n        the National Labor Relations Act.\n            (3) It is a fundamental tenet of this Nation that all men \n        and women have a right to make individual choices about the \n        political, social or charitable causes they support. It is also \n        a fundamental right that an individual may not be forced or \n        coerced by organizations, as a condition of employment, to \n        support causes of any type, especially those that may be \n        contrary to, or even inconsistent with, their individual \n        beliefs. Such forced or coerced support violates basic notions \n        of First Amendment rights of free speech and freedom of \n        association.\n\nSEC. 3. FREEDOM TO CHOOSE.\n\n    (a) In General.--\n            (1) Core purposes.--Notwithstanding the exception in \n        section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 157), \n        an employer or labor organization subject to a valid labor \n        agreement shall not receive, solicit, or accept from an \n        employee payment of any dues or fees not related to core \n        purposes and exclusive representation.\n            (2) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, the term \n        ``core purposes'' includes collective bargaining, contract \n        administration, and grievance adjustment.\n    (b) Discrepancy in Amount of Fees Collected.--\n            (1) Liability.--If an employee disputes the amount of fees \n        collected by the labor organization, such employee may bring a \n        civil action against the labor organization--\n                    (A) for total damages, for each employee, equal \n                to--\n                            (i) 10 times the amount of the dues or fees \n                        accepted in violation of this section;\n                            (ii) the interest on the amount described \n                        in clause (i) calculated at the prevailing \n                        rate;\n                            (iii) an additional amount as liquidated \n                        damages equal to the sum of the amount \n                        described in clause (i) and the interest \n                        described in clause (ii); and\n                            (iv) not more than $1,000 in punitive \n                        damages;\n                    (B) for such equitable relief as may be \n                appropriate; and\n                    (C) revocation of tax exempt status.\n            (2) Right of action.--An action to recover the damages or \n        equitable relief prescribed in paragraph (1) may be maintained \n        against any labor organization in any Federal court of \n        competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees for and in \n        behalf of--\n                    (A) the employees; or\n                    (B) the employees and other employees similarly \n                situated.\n            (3) Fees and costs.--The court in such action shall, in \n        addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff, allow a \n        reasonable attorney's fee, reasonable expert witness fees, and \n        other costs of the action to be paid by the defendant.\n            (4) Limitation.--An action may be brought under this \n        subsection not later than 5 years after the date the employee \nknew or should have known that dues or fees were accepted or spent by a \nlabor organization in violation of this Act, except that such period \nshall be extended to 3 years in the case of a willful violation by a \nlabor organization.\n\nSEC. 4.
