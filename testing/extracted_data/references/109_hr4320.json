FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the amount of the flood insurance claims resulting from \n        Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita will likely exceed the \n        aggregate amount of all claims previously paid in the history \n        of the national flood insurance program, and will require an \n        increase in the program's borrowing authority;\n            (2) flood insurance policyholders have a legitimate \n        expectation that they will receive fair and timely compensation \n        for losses covered under their policies;\n            (3) substantial flooding has occurred, and will likely \n        occur again, outside of the areas designated as the 100-year \n        floodplain;\n            (4) to adequately and correctly assess potential flood \n        damage and losses in all areas on the United States, the \n        national flood insurance program will need to update its flood \n        maps with the latest technology;\n            (5) the maximum coverage limits for flood insurance \n        policies should be increased to reflect inflation and the \n        increased cost of housing;\n            (6) significant reforms to the national flood insurance \n        program required in the Bunning-Bereuter-Blumenauer Flood \n        Insurance Reform Act of 2004 have yet to be implemented; and\n            (7) despite reforms required in the Bunning-Bereuter-\n        Blumenauer Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004, the national \n        flood insurance program requires a modernized and updated \n        administrative model to ensure that the people of the United \n        States have continued access to flood insurance.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to protect the integrity of the national flood \n        insurance program by fully funding existing legal obligations \n        expected by existing policyholders who have paid policy \n        premiums in return for flood insurance coverage;\n            (2) to increase incentives for homeowners and communities \n        to participate in the national flood insurance program and to \n        improve oversight to ensure full participation in the program \n        for owners of properties for which such participation is \n        mandatory;\n            (3) to increase awareness of homeowners of flood risks and \n        improve the quality of information regarding such risks \n        provided to homeowners; and\n            (4) to better mitigate future flood damage risks through a \n        combination of enhanced protective measures, property \n        elevation, and buyouts of flood-prone properties.\n\nSEC. 3. STUDY REGARDING MANDATORY PURCHASE REQUIREMENT FOR 500-YEAR \n              FLOODPLAIN AND REPORTS REGARDING FLOOD MAP MODERNIZATION.\n\n    (a) Study Regarding Mandatory Purchase Requirement for 500-Year \nFloodplain.--\n            (1) In general.--The Comptroller General of the United \n        States shall conduct a study regarding the impact, \n        effectiveness, and feasibility of amending the provisions of \n        the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 regarding the \n        properties that are subject to the mandatory flood insurance \n        coverage purchase requirements under such Act to extend such \n        requirements to all properties located in the 500-year \n        floodplain.\n            (2) Issues.--The study under this subsection shall assess--\n                    (A) the regulatory, financial and economic impacts \n                of extending such requirements on the costs of \n                homeownership, the actuarial soundness of the national \n                flood insurance program, the Federal Emergency \n                Management Agency, local communities, insurance \n                companies, and local land use;\n                    (B) the effectiveness of extending such \n                requirements in protecting homeowners from financial \n                loss and in protecting the financial soundness of the \n                national flood insurance program, and the effectiveness \n                of extending such requirements in comparison with \n                providing for more effective enforcement of existing \n                mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements;\n                    (C) the feasibility of extending such requirements \n                taking into consideration the need for identifying and \n                mapping the 500-year floodplain;\n                    (D) any liability on the part of lenders to comply \n                with or enforce such extended requirements;\n                    (E) any burdens on building officials and flood \n                plain managers to implement such requirements in the \n                expanded area;\n                    (F) any increased burden on the Federal Emergency \n                Management Agency to make determinations on exemptions \n                to the floodplain and approval of local decisions;\n                    (G) the effects of extending such requirements on \n                existing policy holders of flood insurance coverage for \n                properties located in the 100-year floodplain, \n                including the effects on continued compliance and \n                premium rates; and\n                    (H) the effects of extending such requirements on \n                the ability of homeowners to make renovations to their \n                homes.\n            (3) Report.--The Comptroller General shall submit a report \n        to the Congress regarding the results and conclusions of the \n        study under this subsection not later than the expiration of \n        the 6-month period beginning on the date of the enactment of \n        this Act.\n    (b) Annual Flood Map Modernization Reports and Certification of \nCompletion.--\n            (1) In general.--During the period that ends upon the \n        completion by the Director of the Federal Emergency Management \n        Agency of the updating and modernization of all floodplain \n        areas and flood-risk zones, the Director shall submit a report \n        annually to the Congress describing the extent to which such \n        updating and modernization has been completed.
