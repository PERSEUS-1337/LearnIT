    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Learning Opportunities With Creation \nof Open Source Textbooks (LOW COST) Act of 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The College Board reported that for the 2007 through \n        2008 academic years each student spent an estimated $805 to \n        $1,229 on college books and supplies depending on the type of \n        institution of higher education a student attended.\n            (2) The gross margin on new college textbooks is currently \n        22.7 percent according to the National Association of College \n        Stores.\n            (3) In a recent study, the Government Accountability Office \n        found that college textbook prices have risen at twice the rate \n        of annual inflation over the last two decades.\n            (4) An open source material project that would make high \n        quality educational materials freely available to the general \n        public would drop college textbook costs and increase \n        accessibility to such education materials.\n            (5) College-level open source course work materials in \n        math, physics, and chemistry represent a high-priority first \n        step in this area.\n            (6) The scientific and technical workforce at Federal \n        agencies, national laboratories, and federally supported \n        university-based research programs could make a valuable \n        contribution to this effort.\n            (7) A Federal oversight role in the creation and \n        maintenance of standard, publicly vetted textbooks is desirable \n        to ensure that intellectual property is respected and that \n        public standards for quality, educational effectiveness, and \n        scientific accuracy are maintained.\n\nSEC. 3. OPEN SOURCE MATERIAL REQUIREMENT FOR FEDERAL AGENCIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the head of each agency that expends more than \n$10,000,000 in a fiscal year on scientific education and outreach shall \nuse at least 2 percent of such funds for the collaboration on the \ndevelopment and implementation of open source materials as an \neducational outreach effort in accordance with subsection (b).\n    (b) Requirements.--The head of each agency described in subsection \n(a) shall, under the joint guidance of the Director of the National \nScience Foundation and the Secretary of Energy, collaborate with the \nheads of any of the agencies described in such subsection or any \nfederally supported laboratory or university-based research program to \ndevelop, implement, and establish procedures for checking the veracity, \naccuracy, and educational effectiveness of open source materials that--\n            (1) contain, at minimum, a comprehensive set of textbooks \n        or other educational materials covering topics in college-level \n        physics, chemistry, or math;\n            (2) are posted on the Federal Open Source Material Website;\n            (3) are updated prior to each academic year with the latest \n        research and information on the topics covered in the textbooks \n        or other educational materials available on the Federal Open \n        Source Material Website; and\n            (4) are free of copyright violations.\n\nSEC. 4. GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Grants Authorized.--From the amounts appropriated under \nsubsection (d), the Director and the Secretary shall jointly award \ngrants to eligible entities to produce open source materials in \naccordance with subsection (c).\n    (b) Application.--To receive a grant under this section, an \neligible entity shall submit an application to the Director and the \nSecretary at such time, in such manner, and containing such information \nas the Director and Secretary may require.\n    (c) Uses of Grant.--An eligible entity that receives a grant under \nthis section shall use such funds--\n            (1) to develop and implement open source materials that \n        contain educational materials covering topics in college-level \n        physics, chemistry, or math; and\n            (2) to evaluate the open sources materials produced with \n        the grant funds awarded under this section and to submit a \n        report containing such evaluation to the Director and \n        Secretary.\n    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated $15,000,000 to carry out this section for fiscal year 2010 \nand such sums as necessary for each succeeding fiscal year.\n\nSEC. 5.
