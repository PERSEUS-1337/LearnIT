    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) Penalty assessments have been used to fund an increasing number of programs that should properly be funded by broad-based financing mechanisms.\n(b) The ever-increasing reliance on penalty assessments to fund core state programs is a regressive financing mechanism, and is particularly harmful to individuals who can least afford these assessments. High fines and assessments can perpetuate a cycle of poverty and inequality, given that individuals with lower incomes are more likely to miss payments and suffer the consequences.\n(c) It is in the state\u2019s interest to ensure funding for emergency medical air transportation is sufficient to maintain access to these critical services for Medi-Cal beneficiaries and all individuals in California.\n(d) Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to identify alternative funding sources for emergency medical air transportation and cease reliance on penalty assessment revenue to fund these services.\n(e) Accordingly, it is the intent of the Legislature to cease the collection of penalty assessments on January 1, 2018, pursuant to the Emergency Medical Air Transportation Act.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 76000.10 of the Government Code is amended to read:\n76000.10.\n(a) This section shall be known, and may be cited, as the Emergency Medical Air Transportation Act.\n(b) For purposes of this section:\n(1) \u201cDepartment\u201d means the State Department of Health Care Services.\n(2) \u201cDirector\u201d means the Director of Health Care Services.\n(3) \u201cProvider\u201d means a provider of emergency medical air transportation services.\n(4) \u201cRotary wing\u201d means a type of aircraft, commonly referred to as a helicopter, that generates lift through the use of wings, known as rotor blades, that revolve around a mast.\n(5) \u201cFixed wing\u201d means a type of aircraft, commonly referred to as an airplane, that generates lift through the use of the forward motion of the aircraft and wings that do not revolve around a mast but are fixed in relation to the fuselage of the aircraft.\n(6) \u201cAir mileage rate\u201d means the per-mileage reimbursement rate paid for services rendered by rotary-wing and fixed-wing providers.\n(c) (1) For purposes of implementing this section, a penalty of four dollars ($4) shall be imposed upon every conviction for a violation of the Vehicle Code or a local ordinance adopted pursuant to the Vehicle Code, except parking offenses subject to Article 3 (commencing with Section 40200) of Chapter 1 of Division 17 of the Vehicle Code.\n(2) The penalty described in this subdivision shall be in addition to the state penalty assessed pursuant to Section 1464 of the Penal Code. However, this penalty shall not be included in the base fine used to calculate the state penalty assessment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1464 of the Penal Code, the state surcharge levied pursuant to Section 1465.7 of the Penal Code, and the state court construction penalty pursuant to Section 70372 of this code, and to calculate the other additional penalties levied pursuant to this chapter.\n(d) The county or the court that imposed the fine shall, in accordance with the procedures set out in Section 68101, transfer moneys collected pursuant to this section to the Treasurer for deposit into the Emergency Medical Air Transportation Act Fund, which is hereby established in the State Treasury. Notwithstanding Section 16305.7, the Emergency Medical Air Transportation Act Fund shall include interest and dividends earned on money in the fund.\n(e) (1) The Emergency Medical Air Transportation Act Fund shall be administered by the State Department of Health Care Services.
