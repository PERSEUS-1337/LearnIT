    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Save American Jobs Through L Visa \nReform Act of 2004''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Testimony given at a February 4, 2004, hearing of the \n        Committee on International Relations of the House of \n        Representatives indicated that there is widespread abuse by \n        companies subcontracting to other companies nonimmigrants who \n        obtained status under the Immigration and Nationality Act by \n        satisfying the requirements for intracompany transferees with \n        ``specialized knowledge''. Such testimony included that of two \n        United States citizens displaced from their jobs by such \n        nonimmigrants.\n            (2) Further evidence of abuse was indicated by such \n        citizens citing cases, including their own, where a citizen's \n        employment was terminated after the citizen trained such \n        intracompany transferees to perform the citizen's job.\n            (3) This testimony also indicated that significant numbers \n        of intracompany transferees admitted to the United States due \n        to claimed possession of ``specialized knowledge'' do not, in \n        fact, possess that prerequisite ``specialized knowledge'' at \n        the time of entry into the United States.\n            (4) Employers have used the intracompany transferee visa \n        program to fill thousands of positions in the United States. \n        57,245 such visas were issued in fiscal year 2003, at the same \n        time as United States unemployment in information technology \n        specialities increased. The admission of intracompany \n        transferees with ``specialized knowledge'' therefore flooded a \n        job market which had already become highly competitive due to \n        job losses.\n            (5) Consular officers overseas continue to document \n        pervasive fraud in intracompany transferee nonimmigrant visa \n        petitions filed in certain countries. In China, for example, \n        recent statistics provided by the United States Embassy in \n        Beijing to a visiting congressional staff delegation in \n        February 2004 reported an intracompany transferee nonimmigrant \n        visa fraud rate of about 40 percent, in petitions received \n        since fiscal year 2000, with similar fraud rates reported for \n        other areas of China as well.\n\nSEC. 3. ELIMINATION OF NONIMMIGRANT VISAS FOR INTRACOMPANY TRANSFEREES \n              WITH SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 101(a)(15)(L) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(L)) is amended by striking \n``managerial, executive, or involves specialized knowledge,'' and \ninserting ``managerial or executive,''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 214(c)(2) of the Immigration \nand Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(2)) is amended--\n            (1) by amending subparagraph (D) to read as follows:\n    ``(D) The period of authorized admission for a nonimmigrant \nadmitted under section 101(a)(15)(L) shall not exceed 7 years.''; and\n            (2) by striking subparagraph (B) and redesignating \n        subparagraphs (C) through (E) as subparagraphs (B) through (D), \n        respectively.\n\nSEC. 4. IMPOSITION OF ANNUAL NUMERICAL LIMITATION.\n\n    Section 214(c)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n1184(c)(2)), as amended by section 3 of this Act, is further amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n    ``(E) The total number of aliens who may be issued visas or \notherwise provided nonimmigrant status during any fiscal year \n(beginning with fiscal year 2005) under section 101(a)(15)(L) may not \nexceed 35,000. The numerical limitation in the preceding sentence shall \napply only to principal aliens and not to the spouses or children of \nsuch aliens. The provisions of subsection (g)(3) shall apply to visas \nsubject to this subparagraph in the same manner as such provisions \napply to visas subject to subsection (g)(1).''.\n\nSEC. 5. REMOVAL OF INTRACOMPANY TRANSFEREES FROM CLASSES OF ALIENS NOT \n              PRESUMED TO BE IMMIGRANTS.\n\n    Section 214(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n1184(b)) is amended by striking ``subparagraph (L) or (V) of section \n101(a)(15),'' and inserting ``section 101(a)(15)(V),''.\n\nSEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PAYMENT OF PREVAILING WAGE.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that employers of nonimmigrants \ndescribed in section 101(a)(15)(L) of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(L)) should pay such nonimmigrants wages that \nare at least the greater of--\n            (1) the actual wage level paid by the employer to all other \n        individuals with similar experience and qualifications for the \n        specific employment in question; or\n            (2) the prevailing wage level for the occupational \n        classification in the area of employment.\n\nSEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    The amendments made by this Act shall take effect on the date of \nthe enactment of this Act and shall apply to nonimmigrant visas issued, \nor nonimmigrant status provided, under section 101(a)(15)(L) of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(L)) on or after \nsuch date. Such amendment shall not be construed as--\n            (1) invalidating any visa issued under such section before \n        such date; or\n            (2) otherwise affecting any alien provided nonimmigrant \n        status under such section before such date."
