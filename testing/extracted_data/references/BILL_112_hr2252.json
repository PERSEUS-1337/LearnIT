FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Police cannot protect, and are not legally liable for \n        failing to protect, individual citizens, as evidenced by the \n        following:\n                    (A) The courts have consistently ruled that the \n                police do not have an obligation to protect \n                individuals, only the public in general. For example, \n                in Warren v. District of Columbia Metropolitan Police \n                Department, 444 A.2d 1 (D.C. App. 1981), the court \n                stated: ``[C]ourts have without exception concluded \n                that when a municipality or other governmental entity \n                undertakes to furnish police services, it assumes a \n                duty only to the public at large and not to individual \n                members of the community.''.\n                    (B) Former Florida Attorney General Jim Smith told \n                Florida legislators that police responded to only \n                200,000 of 700,000 calls for help to Dade County \n                authorities.\n                    (C) The United States Department of Justice found \n                that, in 1989, there were 168,881 crimes of violence \n                for which police had not responded within 1 hour.\n            (2) Citizens frequently must use firearms to defend \n        themselves, as evidenced by the following:\n                    (A) Every year, more than 2,400,000 people in the \n                United States use a gun to defend themselves against \n                criminals--or more than 6,500 people a day. This means \n                that, each year, firearms are used 60 times more often \n                to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take \n                lives.\n                    (B) Of the 2,400,000 self-defense cases, more than \n                192,000 are by women defending themselves against \n                sexual abuse.\n                    (C) Of the 2,400,000 times citizens use their guns \n                to defend themselves every year, 92 percent merely \n                brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off \n                their attackers. Less than 8 percent of the time, does \n                a citizen kill or wound his or her attacker.\n            (3) Law-abiding citizens, seeking only to provide for their \n        families' defense, are routinely prosecuted for brandishing or \n        using a firearm in self-defense. For example:\n                    (A) In 2001, a grand jury had to rule on the case \n                of 2 brothers that used firearms to protect their lives \n                and their livelihood for their involvement in a fatal \n                shooting in Reisterstown, Maryland. The grand jury \n                decided not to press criminal charges. The brothers, at \n                the time, had encountered several burglaries at their \n                concrete business. The brothers spent the night in \n                their warehouse armed with shotguns. One night at 1:00 \n                in the morning the burglars returned and the brothers \n                shot and killed 1 burglar and injured 2 of the others. \n                The 2 injured men were charged with burglary and 2 \n                others were charged with burglary in connection with \n                burglaries that had occurred in a previous month at the \n                brother's warehouse. Burglary is known to be a violent \n                crime and the brothers were particularly worried when \n                they realized a gun of theirs had been stolen in a \n                previous break-in.\n                    (B) In 2008, a Waukegan, Illinois, store clerk shot \n                and injured a robber. According to news reports, there \n                was potential the clerk could face criminal charges, \n                even though he acted in self-defense. The store clerk \n                did not have a firearm owner's identification card and \n                would be charged with a State firearms violation. \n                Additionally, Illinois law does not allow employees to \n                carry a gun in a place of business. Rather, the law \n                only allows individuals to carry a gun in a place of \n                business if that individual is the owner or has \n                proprietary interest.\n                    (C) In September 2009, a Lithonia homeowner from \n                Dekalb County, Georgia, was charged with aggravated \n                assault after he shot someone who was trying to knock \n                down the door of his home as an attempt to break into \n                the residence. According to the neighbors, there had \n                been trouble in the neighborhood before. A police \n                spokesperson said the homeowner was charged because the \n                robber was technically not inside the home. The \n                suspected robber was charged with attempted burglary.\n                    (D) In January 2004, Wilmette, Illinois, police \n                charged and convicted a homeowner with misdemeanors for \n                owning 2 handguns and violating the village handgun ban \n                ordinance. The homeowner was also faced with a \n                potential $750 fine for failing to renew his Illinois \n                firearm owner's identification card. These charges were \n                brought after he shot a home intruder. The resident \n                stated, ``My Plan A is to call 911 and keep the family \n                upstairs . . . But my Plan B is to have a loaded \n                firearm and put a bullet in the intruder.'' The \n                intruder entered the house 2 times, once through a dog \n                door and the second time with a stolen house key. The \n                homeowner had just put his children to bed when his \n                security system was set off. The homeowner went \n                downstairs and confronted and shot the intruder. The \n                intruder jumped through a window and stole the family's \n                car to go to the hospital. The intruder was charged \n                with 2 counts of residential burglary and 1 count of \n                possession of a stolen vehicle.\n            (4) The courts have granted immunity from prosecution to \n        police officers who use firearms in the line of duty. \n        Similarly, law-abiding citizens who use firearms to protect \n        themselves, their families, and their homes against violent \n        felons should not be subject to lawsuits by the violent felons \n        who sought to victimize them.\n\nSEC. 3.
