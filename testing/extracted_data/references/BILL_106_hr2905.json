FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Money laundering is a serious problem: between \n        $100,000,000,000 and $300,000,000,000 in United States currency \n        is ``laundered'' each year and the total dollar amount involved \n        in international money laundering likely exceeds \n        $500,000,000,000.\n            (2) Money laundering is critical to the survival of the \n        illicit drug trade, which has annual worldwide revenues of more \n        than $400,000,000,000, more than 8 percent of the total value \n        of international trade.\n            (3) Money laundering affords drug dealers, terrorists, arms \n        dealers, and other criminals the opportunity to erode the \n        integrity of our financial institutions.\n            (4) Through money laundering, criminals are able to hide \n        profits from narcotics sales, tax fraud, terrorism, and arms \n        smuggling.\n            (5) Money laundering by international criminal enterprises \n        challenges the legitimate authority of national governments, \n        corrupts government institutions, endangers the financial and \n        economic stability of nations, and routinely violates legal \n        norms, property rights, and human rights.\n            (6) United States financial institutions are a critical \n        link in our efforts to combat money laundering.\n            (7) The high profitability, intense competition, high level \n        of confidentiality, and close relationships of trust developed \n        between private bankers and their clients make private banking \n        vulnerable to money laundering, and it is estimated that \n        private banking services have banking assets ranging from \n        $200,000,000,000 to $300,000,000,000.\n            (8) As private banking grows, and competition for high net \n        worth individuals as customers increases, anti-money laundering \n        legislation should be extended to reach all financial \n        institutions, including such entities as securities brokers and \n        dealers.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To ensure that United States financial institutions \n        make combating money laundering the highest of priorities.\n            (2) To close the existing gaps in law that allow money \n        laundering to flourish in the private banking system.\n            (3) To designate foreign high-intensity money laundering \n        areas for the purpose of targeting areas of concentrated money \n        laundering activities.\n            (4) To establish a comprehensive report on the extent of \n        private banking by banks and other financial institutions \n        operating within the United States.\n            (5) To prevent the abuse of concentration, omnibus, or \n        suspense accounts by money launderers and drug traffickers.\n            (6) To enhance the ability of law enforcement officials to \n        reconstruct an audit trail in the course of a criminal \n        investigation by requiring United States financial institutions \n        to maintain documentation of offshore accounts.\n            (7) To subject securities brokers and dealers to the \n        suspicious activities reporting requirements to which \n        depository institutions are subject.\n\nSEC. 3.
