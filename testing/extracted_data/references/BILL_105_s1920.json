This Act may be referred to as the ``Federal Oil and Gas \nLease Management Improvement Act of 1998''.\n\n                         findings and purposes\n\n    Sec. 2. (a) Congress finds that--\n            (1) State governments have a long and successful history of \n        regulation of operations to explore for and produce oil and \n        gas. The special role of the States was recognized by Congress \n        in 1935 through its ratification under the Constitution of the \n        Interstate Compact to Conserve Oil and Gas.\n            (2) Under the guidance of the Interstate Oil and Gas \n        Compact Commission, States have established effective \n        regulation of the oil and natural gas industry and subject \n        their programs to periodic peer review through the Commission.\n            (3) It is significantly less expensive for State \n        governments than for the Federal Government, through its Bureau \n        of Land Management, to regulate oil and gas lease operations on \n        Federal lands.\n            (4) Significant cost savings could be achieved, with no \n        reduction in environmental protection or in the conservation of \n        oil and gas resources, by having the Federal Government defer \n        to State regulation of oil and gas lease operations on Federal \n        lands.\n            (5) State governments carry out regulatory oversight on \n        State, private, and Federal lands. Oil and gas companies \n        operating on federal lands are burdened with the additional \n        cost and time of duplicative oversight by both State and \n        Federal conservation authorities. Additional cost savings could \n        be achieved within the private sector by having the Bureau of \n        Land Management defer to State regulation.\n            (6) The Federal Government is presently cast in dual \n        opposing roles as a mineral owner and regulator. State \n        regulation of oil and gas operations on Federal lands would \n        eliminate this conflict of interest.\n            (7) It remains the responsibility of the Secretary of the \n        Interior to carry out the Federal policy set forth in the \n        Mining and Minerals Policy Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C. Sec. 21a) to \n        foster and encourage private sector enterprise in the \n        development of economically sound and stable domestic mineral \n        industries, and the orderly and economic development of \n        domestic mineral resources and reserves, including oil and gas \n        resources.\n            (8) Resource management analyses and surveys conducted \n        under the conservation laws of the United States benefit the \n        public at large and are an expense properly borne by the \n        Federal Government.\n    (b) The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to transfer from the Bureau of Land Management to each \n        State in which the Federal lands are present authority to \n        regulate oil and gas operations on leased tracts and related \n        operations as fully as if the operations were occurring on \n        privately owned land,\n            (2) to share the costs saved through more efficient State \n        enforcement among State governments and the Federal treasury,\n            (3) to prevent the imposition of unwarranted delays and \n        recoupments of Federal administrative costs on Federal oil and \n        gas lessees,\n            (4) to effect no change in the administration of Indian \n        lands, and\n            (5) to ensure that those funds deducted from the States' \n        net receipt share are directly tied to administrative costs \n        related to oil and gas on Federal lands.\n\n                              definitions\n\n    Sec. 3. For purposes of this Act--\n            (1) The term ``Federal lands'' means all lands and \n        interests in lands owned by the United States which are subject \n        to the mineral leasing laws, including mineral resources or \n        mineral estates reserved to the United States in the conveyance \n        of a surface or nonmineral estate. The term excludes ``Indian \n        lands'' as that term is defined in 30 U.S.C. Sec. 1702(3) and \n        submerged lands on the ``Outer Continental Shelf'' as that term \n        is defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. \n        Sec. Sec. 1331 et seq., other than submerged lands subject to \n        section 8(g) of that Act, 43 U.S.C. Sec. 1337(g).\n            (2) The term ``oil and gas conservation authority'' means \n        the agency or agencies in each State responsible for regulating \n        for conservation purposes operations to explore for and produce \n        oil and natural gas.\n\n                           application of act\n\n    Sec. 4. For the purposes of this Act, Federal lands subject to \nsection 8(g) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act are deemed to be \nwithin the state with which revenues from those lands are shared. \nHowever, nothing in this Act shall be construed to give a State a \nproperty right or interest in any Federal lease or land.\n\n TITLE I--DEFERRAL TO STATE REGULATION OF OIL AND GAS LEASE OPERATIONS \n                            ON FEDERAL LANDS\n\n    Sec. 101. (a) No sooner than 6 months from the date of enactment of \nthis Act, a State may notify the Secretary of the Interior of its \nintent to accept authority for regulation of operations, as described \nin paragraphs (1) through (11) of this subsection, under oil and gas \nleases on Federal lands within the State. Effective 6 months after the \nSecretary receives the state's notice, the authority is transferred \nfrom the Bureau of Land Management to the State. This authority \nincludes--\n            (1) processing and approving Applications for Permits to \n        Drill, subject to surface use agreements and other terms and \n        conditions determined by the Secretary;\n            (2) production operations;\n            (3) well testing;\n            (4) well completion;\n            (5) well spacing;\n            (6) communization;\n            (7) conversion of a producing well to a water well;\n            (8) well abandonment procedures;\n            (9) inspections;\n            (10) enforcement activities; and\n            (11) site security.\n    (b) Effective on the date of transfer, the Bureau of Land \nManagement shall no longer include the charges associated with \nperforming those authorities transferred in subsection (a) in costs \ncharged against the State under section 35(b) of the Mineral Leasing \nAct (30 U.S.C. Sec. 191(b)).\n    (c) The Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service shall \nretain authority over the issuance of leases and the approval of \nsurface use plans, and shall spend appropriated funds to assure that \nthe agency is making timely decisions respecting oil and gas leasing, \ntaking into consideration multiple uses of Federal lands, socioeconomic \nand environmental impacts, and the results of consultations with state \nand local government officials.\n    Sec. 102. (a) Following the transfer of authority, no Federal \nagency shall exercise the authority formerly held by the Bureau of Land \nManagement as to oil and gas lease operations and related operations on \nFederal lands.\n    (b) Following the transfer of authority, each State shall enforce \nits own laws, regulations, and requirements pertaining to oil and gas \nlease operations and related operations with due regard to the national \ninterest in the expedited, environmentally sound development of oil and \ngas resources in a manner consistent with oil and gas conservation \nprinciples.\n    (c) The Bureau of Land Management may continue to enforce any \npending actions respecting acts committed prior to the date authority \nis transferred to a State under section 101(a) until those proceedings \nare concluded.\n    (d) All applications respecting oil and gas lease operations and \nrelated operations on federal lands pending before the Bureau of Land \nManagement on the date authority is transferred shall be immediately \ntransferred to the oil and gas conservation authority of the State in \nwhich the given lease is located. The oil and gas conservation \nauthority shall act on the application in accordance with its own laws, \nregulations, and requirements.\n\n          TITLE II--USE OF COST SAVINGS FROM STATE REGULATION\n\n    Sec. 201. Subject to available appropriations, the Secretary of the \nInterior shall compensate any State for those costs incurred to carry \nout the authorities transferred under section 101(a). Payment shall be \nmade not less than every quarter during the fiscal year. Each State \nseeking compensation shall report to the Secretary a cost breakdown for \nthe authorities transferred. Compensation to a State may not exceed 50 \npercent of the Bureau of Land Management's allocated cost, under \nsection 35(b) of the Mineral Leasing Act, for that State for the fiscal \nyear ending September 30, 1997. The Secretary will adjust the maximum \nlevel of cost compensation at least once every two years to reflect any \nincreases in the Consumer Price Index (all items, United States city \naverage) as prepared by the Department of Labor, using 1997 as the \nbaseline year.\n    Sec. 202. Section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. \nSec. 191) is amended by adding at the end of subsection (b) the \nfollowing:\n            ``(6) The Secretary shall not include, for the purpose of \n        calculating the deduction under paragraph (1), costs of \n        preparing resource management planning documents and analyses \n        for areas in which oil and gas leasing is excluded or areas in \n        which the primary activity under review is not oil and gas \n        leasing and development.''.\n\n               TITLE III--STREAMLINING AND COST REDUCTION\n\n    Sec. 301. (a) Notwithstanding sections 304 and 504 of Public Law \n94-579 (43 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1734 and 1764) and section 9701 of title \n31, United States Code, the Department of the Interior may not recover \nits costs with respect to applications and other documents relating to \noil and gas leases.\n    (b) The Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service shall \ncomplete any resource management planning documents and analyses within \n90 days of the agency's receipt of any offer, application, or request \nfor which planning document or analysis must be prepared. If the agency \nis unable to complete the document or analysis within that time, it \nshall notify the applicant or lessee of the opportunity to prepare the \nrequired document or analysis for the agency's review and use in \ndecision making. The agency for which the document or analysis is \nprepared shall reimburse the applicant or lessee for costs directly \nassociated with the preparation of the document or analysis.\n    Sec. 302. (a) The Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service \nshall assure the timely issuance of Federal agency decisions respecting \noil and gas leasing and operations on federal lands.\n    (b) The Bureau of Land Management shall accept or reject an offer \nto lease within 90 days of the filing of the offer. If an offer is not \nacted upon within that time, the offer is deemed accepted.\n    (c) The Bureau of Land Management and a State that has accepted \ntransfer under section 101(a) shall approve or disapprove an \nApplication for Permit to Drill within 30 days of receipt of a complete \napplication. If the application is not acted upon within that time, the \napplication is deemed approved.\n    (d) The Bureau of Land Management or the Forest Service, as the \ncase may be, shall approve or disapprove a surface use plan within 30 \ndays of receipt of a complete plan.\n    (e) From the time that a Federal oil and gas lessee or operator \nfiles a notice of administrative appeal of a decision or order of an \nofficer or employee of the Department of the Interior or the Forest \nService respecting a Federal oil and gas Federal lease, the Department \nor Service shall have two years to issue a final decision in that \nappeal. If no final decision has been issued within that time, the \nappeal is deemed granted.\n    Sec. 303. (a) The Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service \nshall assure that unwarranted denials and stays of lease issuance and \nunwarranted restrictions on lease operations are eliminated from the \nadministration of oil and as leasing on Federal lands.\n    (b) Lands designated as available for multiple use under Bureau of \nLand Management resource management plans and Forest Service leasing \nanalyses shall be available for oil and gas leasing without lease \nstipulations more stringent than restrictions on surface use and \noperations imposed under the laws and regulations of the relevant State \noil and gas conservation authority unless the Bureau or Service \nincludes in its decision approving the management plan or leasing \nanalysis a written explanation of why more stringent stipulations are \nwarranted. Any decision to require a more stringent stipulation shall \nbe administratively appealable and, following a final agency decision, \njudicially reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n    (c) If the Bureau of Land Management or the Forest Service rejects \nan offer to lease on the ground that the land is unavailable for \nleasing, the respective agency shall provide a written, detailed \nexplanation of the reasons the land is unavailable for leasing. Where \nthe determination of unavailability is based on a previous resource \nmanagement decision, the explanation shall include a careful assessment \nof whether the reasons underlying the previous decision are still \npersuasive. The agency may not reject an offer to lease lands available \nfor leasing on the ground that the offer includes lands unavailable for \nleasing, and it must segregate lands available from those unavailable, \nupon the offeror's request following notice by the agency, before \nacting on the offer to lease.\n    (d) The Bureau of Land Management or the Forest Service shall \nprovide a written, detailed explanation of the reasons for disapproving \nor requiring modifications of any surface use plan or Application for \nPermit to Drill.\n    (e) A decision of the Bureau of Land Management or the Forest \nService respecting an oil and gas lease shall be effective pending \nadministrative appeal to the appropriate office within the Department \nof the Interior or the Department of Agriculture unless that office \ngrants a stay in response to a petition satisfying the criteria for a \nstay established by 43 CFR Sec. 4.21(b)(1) (1997).\n    Sec. 304. By March 31, 1999, the Secretary of the Interior and the \nSecretary of Agriculture will jointly submit a report to the President \nof the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives \nexplaining the most efficient means of eliminating overlapping \njurisdiction, duplication of effort, and inconsistent policymaking and \npolicy implementation as between the Bureau of Land Management and the \nForest Service. The report will include recommendations on changes in \nstatute needed to implement the report's conclusions.\n    Sec. 305. (a) By March 31, 1999, the Secretary of the Interior will \npublish, through notice in the Federal Register, a national inventory \nof the oil and gas reserves and potential resources underlying Federal \nlands (other than lands governed by section 8(g) of the Outer \nContinental Shelf Lands Act). The inventory will indicate what \npercentage of those reserves and resources is currently available for \nleasing and development. The inventory will further detail what \npercentage of the reserves and resources are on--\n            (1) lands now open for leasing but which have never been \n        leased;\n            (2) lands open for leasing or development subject to no \n        surface occupancy stipulations; and\n            (3) lands open for leasing or development subject to other \n        lease stipulations which have significantly impeded or \n        prevented, or are likely to significantly impede or prevent, \n        development.\n    (b) By September 30, 1999, public comments on the inventory will be \nfiled. The Secretary of the Interior shall specifically invite comments \non the effect of Bureau of Land Management resource management \ndecisions on past and future oil and gas development.\n    (c) By March 31, 2000, the Secretary of the Interior will file a \nreport with the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives to be comprised of his revised inventory and other \nresponses to the public comments. The report will specifically indicate \nwhat steps the Bureau of Land Management will take to increase the \npercentage of lands open for development of oil and gas resources."
