FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The illegal market for the production and distribution \n        of child abuse imagery is a growing threat to children in the \n        United States. International demand for this material creates a \n        powerful incentive for the rape, abuse, and torture of children \n        within the United States.\n            (2) The targeting of United States children by \n        international criminal networks is a threat to the homeland \n        security of the United States. This threat must be fought with \n        trained personnel and highly specialized counter-child-\n        exploitation strategies and technologies.\n            (3) The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n        of the Department of Homeland Security serves a critical \n        national security role in protecting the United States from the \n        growing international threat of child exploitation and human \n        trafficking.\n            (4) The Cyber Crimes Center of the United States \n        Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a vital national \n        resource in the effort to combat international child \n        exploitation, providing advanced expertise and assistance in \n        investigations, computer forensics, and victim identification.\n            (5) The returning military heroes of the United States \n        possess unique and valuable skills that can assist law \n        enforcement in combating global sexual and child exploitation, \n        and the Department of Homeland Security should use this \n        national resource to the maximum extent possible.\n            (6) Through the Human Exploitation Rescue Operative (HERO) \n        Child Rescue Corps program, the returning military heroes of \n        the United States are trained and hired to investigate crimes \n        of child exploitation in order to target predators and rescue \n        children from sexual abuse and slavery.\n\nSEC. 3.
