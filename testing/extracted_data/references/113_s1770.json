PROCEDURE.\n\n    (a) Pleadings.--\n            (1) Complaint.--A complaint filed in a civil action brought \n        under this Act shall include a sworn representation by the \n        plaintiff that the dispute involves conduct described in \n        section 3(a).\n            (2) Affirmative defense.--It shall be an affirmative \n        defense in a civil action brought under this Act that each \n        alleged covered trade secret in dispute was readily \n        ascertainable through proper means by other persons who did not \n        already know the covered trade secret at the time of any \n        alleged misappropriation, threat to misappropriate, or \n        conspiracy to misappropriate.\n    (b) Forum Non Conveniens.--In considering a motion to dismiss or \nstay on forum non conveniens grounds filed in a civil action brought \nunder this Act, a court shall--\n            (1) give great weight to the plaintiff's choice of forum; \n        and\n            (2) consider whether the plaintiff reasonably could receive \n        fair and impartial treatment in the courts of the jurisdiction \n        in which the defendant is domiciled.\n    (c) Anti-Suit Injunctions.--In a civil action brought under this \nAct, the court may enter an injunction enjoining a defendant over whom \nthe court has personal jurisdiction from pursuing subsequently filed \nlitigation in another jurisdiction if--\n            (1) the parties are the same in both matters;\n            (2) the resolution of the case before the enjoining court \n        will be dispositive of the action to be enjoined; and\n            (3) the action in the other jurisdiction threatens the \n        jurisdiction of the court or the purposes of this Act.\n    (d) Confidentiality.--In any proceeding relating to a civil action \nbrought under this Act, the court shall enter any order and take any \nother action that is necessary and appropriate to preserve the \nconfidentiality of trade secrets, consistent with the requirements of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence, \nand all other applicable laws.\n    (e) Statute of Limitations.--A civil action brought under this Act \nmay not be commenced later than 3 years after the date on which the \nconduct described in section 3(a) that forms the basis for the action \nwas discovered or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have \nbeen discovered.\n\nSEC. 6. SEIZURES.\n\n    (a) In General.--In a civil action brought under this Act, the \ncourt may, upon ex parte application and if the requirements under \nsubsection (b) are satisfied, issue an order (referred to in this \nsection as a ``seizure order'') providing for--\n            (1) the seizure of any property (including computers) used, \n        in any manner or part, to commit or facilitate the commission \n        of conduct described in section 3(a) that is alleged in the \n        civil action; and\n            (2) the preservation of evidence in the civil action.\n    (b) Requirements.--A court may issue a seizure order if--\n            (1) the applicant provides security in an amount that the \n        court determines is adequate to pay any damages a person may be \n        entitled to recover as a result of a wrongful seizure or \n        wrongful attempted seizure under this section; and\n            (2) the court finds that specific facts clearly show that--\n                    (A) any order other than an ex parte seizure order \n                is not adequate to effectively cause the cessation of \n                the conduct described in section 3(a) that forms the \n                basis of the action;\n                    (B) the applicant has not publicized the requested \n                seizure;\n                    (C) the applicant is likely to succeed in showing \n                that the person against whom seizure is sought \n                misappropriated, threatened to misappropriate, or \n                conspired to misappropriate a covered trade secret of \n                which the applicant is the owner or lawful possessor;\n                    (D) the applicant will suffer an immediate and \n                irreparable injury if a seizure is not ordered;\n                    (E) the matter to be seized is located at the place \n                identified in the application;\n                    (F) the harm to the applicant that would be caused \n                by denying the application outweighs the harm to the \n                legitimate interests of the person against whom seizure \n                is sought that would be caused by granting the \n                application; and\n                    (G) if the applicant were to proceed on notice to \n                the person against whom seizure is sought, that person, \n                or persons acting in concert with that person, would \n                destroy, move, hide, or otherwise make the matter to be \n                seized inaccessible to the court.\n    (c) Procedure.--A seizure order shall--\n            (1) direct that service of a copy of the seizure order \n        shall be made by a Federal law enforcement officer (such as a \n        United States marshal), who, upon making service, shall carry \n        out the seizure under the seizure order;\n            (2) direct that any items seized shall be taken into the \n        custody of the court;\n            (3) include a protective order with respect to items \n        seized, to ensure that confidential, private, proprietary, or \n        privileged information contained in the items seized, including \n        any such information belonging to the defendant and third \n        parties, is appropriately protected and that access to the \n        items seized is appropriately restricted; and\n            (4) specify a hearing date, not earlier than 3 days and not \n        later than 10 days after the seizure order is issued, for the \n        court to review whether the items seized should remain in the \n        custody of the court.\n    (d) Order Under Seal.--\n            (1) In general.--Except as provided under paragraph (2), a \n        seizure order, together with any supporting documents, shall be \n        sealed until the person against whom the seizure order is \n        directed has an opportunity to contest the seizure order.\n            (2) Access after seizure.--A court shall allow a person \n        against whom a seizure order is directed to have access to the \n        seizure order and any supporting documents after the seizure is \n        carried out.\n    (e) Seizure Hearing.--\n            (1) Date.--A court that issues a seizure order shall hold a \n        hearing under this subsection on the date set by the court \n        under subsection (c)(4) unless a party shows good cause for \n        setting a different date.\n            (2) Burden of proof.--At a hearing under this subsection, \n        the party that obtained the seizure order shall have the burden \n        of proving that the factual and legal grounds necessary to \n        support the seizure order are still in effect.\n            (3) Dissolution or modification of order.--If a party fails \n        to meet the burden specified under paragraph (2), the court \n        shall dissolve or modify the seizure order appropriately.\n            (4) Discovery time limits.--The court may issue an order \n        modifying the time limits for discovery under the Federal Rules \n        of Civil Procedure as necessary to prevent the frustration of \n        the purposes of a hearing under this subsection.\n    (f) Injured Party.--\n            (1) Cause of action.--A party that is injured by a seizure \n        carried out in a civil action brought under this Act and that \n        prevails in the civil action may bring a civil action under \n        this subsection against the applicant for the seizure order in \n        a district court of the United States.\n            (2) Remedies.--A party that prevails in a civil action \n        brought under this subsection shall recover--\n                    (A) reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred \n                in defense against the seizure order described in \n                paragraph (1) unless the court finds that extenuating \n                circumstances merit denying such costs and fees; and\n                    (B) lost profits and punitive damages if the \n                seizure order described in paragraph (1) was sought in \n                bad faith."
