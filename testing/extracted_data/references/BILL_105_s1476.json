FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) It is in the interest of the United States that the \n        precarious peace process now underway in Northern Ireland and \n        the Republic of Ireland succeed, both to ensure stability for \n        important allies and friends of the United States and to assure \n        a mutually beneficial flow of trade and commerce.\n            (2) Locally sustainable economic development within \n        Northern Ireland and the border counties of the Republic of \n        Ireland creates the basis for political stability and enhances \n        the likelihood of peace.\n            (3)(A) The granting of reasonable tariff concessions for \n        products and goods originating in Northern Ireland and the \n        border counties of the Republic of Ireland will provide an \n        incentive for such development.\n            (B) Because both the United Kingdom and the Republic of \n        Ireland are members of the European Union (hereafter in this \n        Act referred to as the ``EU''), tariff issues relating to \n        Northern Ireland and the border counties of the Republic of \n        Ireland are subject to the common commercial policy provided \n        for in Article 113 of the Treaty of Rome, and any negotiations \n        concerning them must conform to EU law and Paragraphs 5, 6, 7, \n        and 8 of Article XXIV of the GATT 1994.\n            (C) While there is no precedent in EU practice for the free \n        trade agreement contemplated in this Act, the effect of such an \n        agreement will be to support important on-going efforts by the \n        EU to achieve greater social cohesion in a unique and \n        disadvantaged region, to the long-term benefit of the EU, the \n        United States, and the larger international community.\n            (4) The President should be authorized to negotiate such \n        concessions in accordance with the terms and conditions set \n        forth in the Act.\n\nSEC. 2. FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH NORTHERN IRELAND.\n\n    (a) Negotiations.--\n            (1) In general.--The President may enter into a trade \n        agreement with respect to qualified areas of Northern Ireland \n        and the Republic of Ireland which provides for--\n                    (A) the harmonization, reduction, and elimination \n                of trade barriers;\n                    (B) the prohibition of or limitations on the \n                imposition of trade barriers; and\n                    (C) the elimination or reduction of any duty \n                imposed by the United States.\n            (2) Agreement limited to qualified areas of northern \n        ireland and the republic of ireland.--Notwithstanding any other \n        provision of law, no trade benefit shall be extended to any \n        country by reason of the extension of any trade benefit to \nanother country under a trade agreement entered into under paragraph \n(1) with such other country.\n    (b) Limitations and Staging.--\n            (1) In general.--No proclamation may be made under \n        subsection (a) that--\n                    (A) reduces any rate of duty (other than a rate of \n                duty that does not exceed 5 percent ad valorem on the \n                date of enactment of this Act) to a rate of duty which \n                is less than 5 percent of the rate of duty that applies \n                on such a date of enactment;\n                    (B) reduces the rate of duty on an article over a \n                period greater than 10 years after the first reduction \n                that is proclaimed to carry out a trade agreement with \n                respect to such article; or\n                    (C) increase any rate of duty above the rate that \n                applies on the date of enactment of this Act.\n            (2) Limitation on aggregate reduction.--The aggregate \n        reduction in the rate of duty on any article which is in effect \n        on any day pursuant to a trade agreement entered into under \n        subsection (a) shall not exceed the aggregate reduction which \n        would have been in effect on such a day if a reduction of 3 \n        percent ad valorem per year or a reduction of 10 percent per \n        year of the total reduction, whichever is greater, had taken \n        effect on the effective date of the first reduction proclaimed \n        pursuant to subsection (a).\n            (3) Exemption from staging.--No staging is required under \n        paragraph (2) with respect to a duty reduction that is \n        proclaimed under subsection (a) for an article of a kind that \n        is not produced in the United States. The United States \n        International Trade Commission shall advise the President of \n        the identity of articles that may be exempted from staging \n        under this paragraph.\n            (4) Rounding.--If the President determines that such action \n        will simplify the computation of reductions under paragraph (1) \n        or (2), the President may round an annual reduction by an \n        amount equal to the lesser of--\n                    (A) the difference between the reduction without \n                regard to this paragraph and the next lower whole \n                number; or\n                    (B) one-half of 1 percent ad valorem.\n            (5) Other limitations.--A rate of duty reduction or \n        increase that may not be proclaimed by reason of paragraph (1) \n        may take effect only if a provision authorizing such reduction \nis included within an implementing bill provided for in connection with \nthe agreement authorized by this Act and that bill is enacted into law.\n\nSEC. 3.
