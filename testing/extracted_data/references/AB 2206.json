    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) California imports 91 percent of its natural gas, which is responsible for 25 percent of the state\u2019s emissions of greenhouse gases.\n(b) California made a commitment to address climate change with the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and Safety Code) and the adoption of a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (Chapter 4.2 (commencing with Section 39730) of Part 2 of Division 26 of the Health and Safety Code). For California to meet its goals for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants, the state must reduce emissions from the natural gas sector and increase the production and distribution of renewable and low-carbon gas supplies.\n(c) Biomethane is gas generated from organic waste through anaerobic digestion, gasification, pyrolysis, or other conversion technology that converts organic matter to gas. Biomethane may be produced from multiple sources, including agricultural waste, forest waste, landfill gas, wastewater treatment byproducts, and diverted organic waste.\n(d) Biomethane provides a sustainable and clean alternative to natural gas. If 10 percent of California\u2019s natural gas use were to be replaced with biomethane use, emissions of greenhouse gases would be reduced by tens of millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent every year.\n(e) Investing in biomethane would create cobenefits, including flexible generation of electricity from a renewable source that is available 24 hours a day, reduction of fossil fuel use, reduction of air and water pollution, and new jobs.\n(f) Biomethane can also be used as transportation fuel or injected into natural gas pipelines for other uses. The most appropriate use of biomethane varies depending on the source, proximity to existing natural gas pipeline injection points or large vehicle fleets, and the circumstances of existing facilities.\n(g) The biomethane market has been slow to develop in California because the collection, purification, and pipeline injection of biomethane can be costly.\n(h) Biomethane is poised to play a key role in future natural gas and hydrogen fuel markets as a blendstock that can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of these two fossil-based alternative fuels.\n(i) Biomethane is one of the most promising alternative vehicle fuels because it generates the least net emissions of greenhouse gases. According to the low-carbon fuel standard regulations (Subarticle 7 (commencing with Section 95480) of Article 4 of Subchapter 10 of Chapter 1 of Division 3 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations) adopted by the State Air Resources Board, vehicles running on biomethane generate significantly lower emissions of greenhouse gases than vehicles running on electricity or fossil fuel-derived hydrogen.\n(j) The California Council on Science and Technology was established by California academic research institutions, including the University of California, the University of Southern California, the California Institute of Technology, Stanford University, and the California State University, and was organized as a nonprofit corporation pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, in response to Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 162 (Resolution Chapter 148 of the Statutes of 1988).\n(k) The California Council on Science and Technology was uniquely established at the request of the Legislature for the specific purpose of offering expert advice to state government on public policy issues significantly related to science and technology.\n(l) It is in the public\u2019s interests, and in the interest of ratepayers of the state\u2019s gas corporations, that the policies and programs adopted by the Public Utilities Commission be guided by the best science reasonably available.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 39734 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:\n39734.\n(a) For purposes of this section, \u201cbiogas\u201d has the same meaning as in Section 25420.\n(b) To meet the state\u2019s renewable energy, low-carbon fuel, and waste diversion goals, the state board, in coordination with the Public Utilities\nCommission and State Energy Resources and Conservation Development\nCommission, shall\nconsider and, as appropriate,\nadopt\na policy\npolicies or programs\nthat\nis\nare\nconsistent with existing state policies and programs to increase the production and use of renewable gas, including biogas, generated by either of the following:\n(1) An eligible renewable energy resource that meets the requirements of the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program (Article 16 (commencing with Section 399.11) of Chapter 2.3 of Part 1 of Division 1 of the Public Utilities Code).\n(2) Direct solar energy.\n(c) In adopting the policy described in subdivision (b), the state board shall ensure that eligible renewable gas provides direct benefits to the state\u2019s environment by reducing or avoiding all of the following:\n(1) Emissions of criteria pollutants.\n(2) Emissions that adversely affect the waters of the state.\n(3) Nuisances associated with the emission of odors.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 784.1 is added to the\nPublic Utilities Code\n, to read:\n784.1.\n(a)The Legislature requests that the California Council on Science and Technology undertake and complete a study analyzing the regional and gas corporation specific issues relating to minimum heating value and maximum siloxane specifications for biomethane before it can be injected into common carrier gas pipelines, including those specifications adopted in Sections 4.4.3.3 and 4.4.4 of commission Decision 14-01-034 (January 16, 2014), Decision Regarding the Biomethane Implementation Tasks in Assembly Bill 1900. The study shall consider and evaluate other states\u2019 standards, the source of biomethane, the dilution of biomethane after it is injected into the pipeline, the equipment and technology upgrades required to meet the minimum heating value specifications, including the impacts of those specifications on the cost, volume of biomethane sold, equipment operation, and safety. The study shall also consider whether different sources of biogas should have different standards or if all sources should adhere to one standard for the minimum heating value and maximum permissible level of siloxanes. The study shall develop the best science reasonably available and not merely be a literature review. In order to meet the state\u2019s goals for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants and the state\u2019s goals for promoting the use of renewable energy resources in place of burning fossil fuels, the California Council on Science and Technology, if it agrees to undertake and complete the study, shall complete the study within nine months of entering into a contract to undertake and complete the study.\n(b)(1)If the California Council on Science and Technology agrees to undertake and complete the study pursuant to subdivision (a), the commission shall require each gas corporation operating common carrier pipelines in California to proportionately contribute to the expenses to undertake the study pursuant to Sections 740 and 740.1. The commission may modify the monetary incentives made available pursuant to commission Decision 15-06-029 (June 11, 2015), Decision Regarding the Costs of Compliance with Decision 14-01-034 and Adoption of Biomethane Promotion Policies and Program, to allocate some of the moneys that would be made available for incentives to instead be made available to pay for the costs of the study so as to not further burden ratepayers with additional expense.\n(2)The commission\u2019s authority pursuant to paragraph (1) shall apply notwithstanding whether the gas corporation has proposed the program pursuant to Section 740.1.\n(c)If the California Council on Science and Technology agrees to undertake and complete the study pursuant to subdivision (a), within six months of its completion, the commission shall reevaluate its requirements and standards adopted pursuant to Section 25421 of the Health and Safety Code relative to the requirements and standards for biomethane to be injected into common carrier pipelines and, if appropriate, change those requirements and standards or adopt new requirements and standards, giving due deference to the conclusions and recommendations made in the study by the California Council on Science and Technology.\nSEC. 4.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution."
