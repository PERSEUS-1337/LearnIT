FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Each year more than 250,000 adults suffer cardiac \n        arrest, usually away from a hospital. More than 95 percent of \n        them will die, in many cases because cardiopulmonary \n        resuscitation (``CPR''), defibrillation, and advanced life \n        support are provided too late to reverse the cardiac arrest. \n        These cardiac arrests occur primarily from occult underlying \n        heart disease and from drowning, allergic or sensitivity \n        reactions, or electrical shocks.\n            (2) Every minute that passes before returning the heart to \n        a normal rhythm after a cardiac arrest causes the chance of \n        survival to fall by 10 percent.\n            (3) In communities where strong public access to \n        defibrillation programs have been implemented, survival from \n        cardiac arrest has improved by as much as 20 percent.\n            (4) Survival from cardiac arrest requires successful early \n        implementation of a chain of events, known as the chain of \n        survival, which must be initiated as soon as the person \n        sustains a cardiac arrest and must continue until the person \n        arrives at the hospital.\n            (5) The chain of survival is the medical standard of care \n        for treatment of cardiac arrest.\n            (6) A successful chain of survival requires the first \n        person on the scene to take rapid and simple initial steps to \n        care for the patient and to assure that the patient promptly \n        enters the emergency medical services system. These steps \n        include--\n                    (A) recognizing an emergency and activating the \n                emergency medical services system;\n                    (B) beginning CPR; and\n                    (C) using an automated external defibrillator \n                (``AED'') if one is available at the scene.\n            (7) The first persons at the scene of an arrest are \n        typically lay persons who are friends or family of the victim, \n        fire services, public safety personnel, basic life support \n        emergency medical services providers, teachers, coaches and \n        supervisors of sports or other extracurricular activities, \n        providers of day care, school bus drivers, lifeguards, \n        attendants at public gatherings, coworkers, and other leaders \n        within the community.\n            (8) The Federal Government should facilitate programs for \n        the placement of AEDs in public buildings, including provisions \n        regarding the training of personnel in CPR and AED use, \n        integration with the emergency medical services system, and \n        maintenance of the devices.\n\nSEC. 3. RECOMMENDATIONS OF SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n              REGARDING PLACEMENT OF AUTOMATIC EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS \n              IN BUILDINGS.\n\n    Part B of title II of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 238 \net seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following section:\n\n      ``recommendations regarding placement of automated external \n                      defibrillators in buildings\n\n    ``Sec. 247.

The Secretary shall in addition assist Federal \n        agencies in implementing programs for such placement.\n            ``(2) Agency assessments.--Not later than 180 days after \n        the date on which the recommendations are published under \n        paragraph (1), the head of each Federal agency that occupies a \n        Federal building that meets the criteria described in \n        subsection (a)(1) shall submit to the Secretary an assessment \n        of the ability of each such agency to meet the goals described \n        in subsection (c).\n    ``(b) Additional Recommendations.--The Secretary shall publish, as \npart of the recommendations referred to in subsection (a), \nrecommendations with respect to the placement of automatic external \ndefibrillators in buildings and facilities, or other appropriate \nvenues, frequented by the public (other than the buildings referred to \nin subsection (a)).
