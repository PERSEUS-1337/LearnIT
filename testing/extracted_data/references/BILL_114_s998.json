SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE NEED FOR A MISCELLANEOUS TARIFF BILL.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) As of the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n        Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States imposes duties \n        on imported goods for which there is no domestic availability \n        or insufficient domestic availability.\n            (2) The imposition of duties on such goods creates \n        artificial distortions in the economy of the United States that \n        negatively affect United States manufacturers and consumers.\n            (3) It is in the interests of the United States to update \n        the Harmonized Tariff Schedule every 3 years to eliminate such \n        artificial distortions by suspending or reducing duties on such \n        goods.\n            (4) The manufacturing competitiveness of the United States \n        around the world will be enhanced if Congress regularly and \n        predictably updates the Harmonized Tariff Schedule to suspend \n        or reduce duties on such goods.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, to remove \nthe competitive disadvantage to United States manufactures and \nconsumers resulting from an outdated Harmonized Tariff Schedule and to \npromote the competitiveness of United States manufacturers, Congress \nshould consider a miscellaneous tariff bill not later than 180 days \nafter the United States International Trade Commission and the \nDepartment of Commerce issue reports on proposed duty suspensions and \nreductions under this Act.\n\nSEC. 3. PROCESS FOR CONSIDERATION OF DUTY SUSPENSIONS AND REDUCTIONS.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to establish a \nprocess by the appropriate congressional committees, in conjunction \nwith the Commission pursuant to its authorities under section 332 of \nthe Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1332), for the submission and \nconsideration of proposed duty suspensions and reductions.\n    (b) Establishment.--Not later than October 15, 2015, and October \n15, 2018, the appropriate congressional committees shall establish and, \non the same day, publish on their respective publicly available \nInternet websites a process--\n            (1) to provide for the submission and consideration of \n        legislation containing proposed duty suspensions and reductions \n        in a manner that, to the maximum extent practicable, is \n        consistent with the requirements described in subsection (c); \n        and\n            (2) to include in a
