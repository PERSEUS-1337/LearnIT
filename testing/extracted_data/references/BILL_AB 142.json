The suitability analysis contained in the report shall consider all of the following:\n(1) The potential effects of the proposed designation on the ability of public agencies and utilities within the Mokelumne River watershed to meet current and projected future water requirements through the development of new and more reliable water supplies from the Mokelumne River and its tributaries. When considering projected future water requirements, the secretary shall only consider feasible projects to meet foreseeable demands.\n(2) Any effects of climate change on river values described in Section 5093.50 and current and projected water supplies.\n(3) The following feasibility studies and assessments included within the implementation plan of the Mokelumne Watershed Interregional Sustainability Evaluation, Final Report dated June 12, 2015: 7a, 7b, 7d, and 7f. The inclusion of these studies and assessments in this subdivision shall not be construed as an exemption from wild and scenic designation.\n(4) The instances when the secretary has determined pursuant to Section 5093.55 that a water diversion facility may be constructed on a river or segment of a river that is part of the system.\n(5) The instances when the State Water Resources Control Board has approved an application to appropriate water from a river or a segment of a river that is part of the system and what restrictions, if any, were placed on the appropriation of water as a result of the river or segment of a river\u2019s inclusion in the system.\n(b) The report shall also include the information required in subdivision (b) of Section 5093.547 and the secretary\u2019s recommendations and proposals with respect to the proposed designation.\n(c) The report required for the segments of the Mokelumne River designated for potential addition to the system pursuant to Section 5093.549 shall be submitted to the Legislature and Governor no later than December 31, 2017, and shall include a clear recommendation on the suitability or nonsuitability for addition to the system of each of the designated segments of the Mokelumne River.\n(d) A study undertaken by the secretary pursuant to subdivision (a) shall provide for public input from a broad range of stakeholders.\n(e)  A report required to be submitted pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.\n(f) Until the completion of the study period and the implementation of any recommendation to add segments to the system, or December 31, 2021, whichever occurs first, no dam, reservoir, diversion, or other water impoundment facility may be constructed on any segment designated for study by the secretary as a potential addition to the system unless the secretary determines that the facility is needed to supply domestic water to the residents of the county or counties through which the river and segment flows and the secretary determines that the facility will not adversely affect the free-flowing condition and natural character of the river and segment. This subdivision shall not apply to, and shall not in any way affect, Amador Water Agency\u2019s water rights application 5647X03 pending before the State Water Resources Control Board.\n(g) (1) The secretary shall develop a cost estimate of the study and report required by subdivision (c) and enter into a cost-sharing agreement with the Upper Mokelumne River Watershed Authority. The cost-sharing agreement shall require that the state pay not more than 50 percent of the cost of the study and report required by subdivision (c), with the remaining cost to be paid by the authority. The payment by the authority may consist of appropriated funds or a contribution of services.\n(2) Nothing in this section shall preclude any private donations or contributions from interested parties to be used for the purposes of this subdivision.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 5093.549 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:\n5093.549.\nThe following segments of the North Fork and main stem Mokelumne River are hereby designated for potential addition to the system.\n(a) The North Fork Mokelumne River from 0.50 miles downstream of the Salt Springs 97-006 Dam to 0.50 miles upstream of the Tiger Creek Powerhouse.\n(b) The North Fork Mokelumne River from 1,000 feet downstream of the Tiger Creek Afterbay 97-105 Dam to State Highway Route 26.\n(c) The North Fork Mokelumne River from 400 feet downstream of the small reregulating dam at the outlet of the West Point Powerhouse to the confluence of the North and Middle Forks of the Mokelumne River.\n(d) The main stem of the Mokelumne River from the confluence of the North and Middle Forks to 300 feet upstream of the Electra Powerhouse.\n(e) The main stem of the Mokelumne River from 300 feet downstream of the small reregulating dam downstream of the Electra Powerhouse to the Pardee Reservoir flood surcharge pool at 580 feet elevation above mean sea level.\nSEC. 4.\nSection 5093.56 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:\n5093.56.\nNo department or agency of the state may assist or cooperate, whether by loan, grant, license, or otherwise, with any department or agency of the federal, state, or local government, in the planning or construction of a dam, reservoir, diversion, or other water impoundment facility that could have an adverse effect on the free-flowing condition and natural character of either of the following:\n(a) The rivers and segments thereof designated in Section 5093.54 as included in the system.\n(b) The segments of the Mokelumne River designated in Section 5093.549 for study by the secretary as potential additions to the system until after the study period and implementation of any recommendations have been completed, or December 31, 2021, whichever occurs first. This subdivision shall not apply to, and shall not in any way affect, Amador Water Agency\u2019s water rights application 5647X03 pending before the State Water Resources Control Board, or prejudice, alter, affect in any way, or interfere with the maintenance, repair, or operation by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company of the Mokelumne River Project (FERC 137) currently under the 2001 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license for the project, the incorporated settlement agreement, any license amendments made with the agreement of the parties to the incorporated settlement agreement, and any adjustment of flows permitted to occur pursuant to the license for enhancement of ecological resources.\nSEC. 5.\nDue to the unique geographical features of the Mokelumne River and its tributaries, the Legislature hereby finds and declares that a special law is necessary and a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution.\nSEC. 6.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district are the result of a program for which legislative authority was requested by that local agency or school district, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code and Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution."
