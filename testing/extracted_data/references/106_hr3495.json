    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Energy Nuclear \nEmployees Exposure Compensation Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Federal nuclear activities have long been explicitly \n        recognized by the Government as an ultra-hazardous activity \n        under law.\n            (2) Since the inception of the Federal nuclear weapons \n        program, the Department of Energy and its predecessors have \n        self-regulated worker safety and health, which places a unique \n        responsibility upon the Department to ensure a safe working \n        environment.\n            (3) Since the inception of the nuclear weapons program, \n        nuclear workers at sites operated by the Department of Energy \n        and its predecessor agencies were put at risk of exposure to \n        harmful substances without the knowledge or consent of the \n        workers.\n            (4) For decades the Department of Energy and its \n        predecessor agencies withheld information about worker health \n        risks for reasons that were not in the national interest--while \n        actively resisting efforts by workers to seek compensation.\n            (5) The Department of Energy currently does not have \n        accurate and complete records of exposure to radioactive and \n        hazardous substances--which unfairly places the burden of proof \n        of harm upon workers.\n            (6) Current remedies under State compensation programs are \n        ill-suited to address chronic diseases and those that have long \n        latency periods which are associated with exposure to \n        radioactive and hazardous substances at Department of Energy \n        facilities.\n            (7) Scientific evidence shows that ionizing radiation is a \n        carcinogenic substance and that specific types of cancer are \n        considered radiogenic by the scientific and medical community.\n\nSEC. 3.
