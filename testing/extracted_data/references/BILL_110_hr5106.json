FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) populations of marine mammals that occur in waters of \n        the United States are resources of substantial ecological, \n        scientific, socioeconomic, and esthetic value;\n            (2) although progress has been made toward understanding \n        the impacts of human activities and natural environmental \n        changes on marine mammal populations, much work remains to be \n        done;\n            (3) some marine mammal populations are in various stages of \n        recovery, while many others remain critically endangered and \n        their status has not improved or has declined;\n            (4) there is a clear need to better understand, evaluate, \n        and mitigate the impacts on marine mammals and other marine \n        species of an array of anthropogenic activities;\n            (5) data gaps and scientific uncertainty present resource \n        managers with significant challenges in implementing the Marine \n        Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) the \n        Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), and \n        the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 \n        et seq.);\n            (6) funding has been insufficient to support all of the \n        research required to fully understand and properly conserve and \n        manage marine mammal populations;\n            (7) in particular, in a recent report to Congress the \n        Marine Mammal Commission recommended the establishment of a \n        research program, the initial goal of which is to improve \n        understanding of anthropogenic sound, its biologically \n        significant effects on marine mammals and marine ecosystems, \n        and effective means for mitigating and monitoring those \n        effects;\n            (8) understanding marine mammals through research is \n        essential for using the oceans wisely and protecting marine \n        living resources, and the United States should maintain its \n        world leadership in marine mammal science and oceanography as \n        one key to its competitive future; and\n            (9) the Marine Mammal Commission established under section \n        201 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. \n        1401) has research and management responsibilities under that \n        Act that make it the appropriate entity to administer a marine \n        mammal research program.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL MARINE MAMMAL RESEARCH PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Program.--Title II of the Marine Mammal \nProtection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by inserting after the title heading the following:\n\n                  ``Subtitle A--General Provisions'';\n\n        and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n\n                  ``Subtitle B--Marine Mammal Research\n\n``SEC. 221.
