FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') was \n        required by the terms of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 \n        and a 1998 consent agreement to determine whether regulation of \n        mercury from electric utility steam generating units under \n        section 112 of the Clean Air Act was appropriate and necessary.\n            (2) In a December 2000, regulatory finding, the EPA \n        concluded that regulation of mercury from electric utility \n        steam generating units was appropriate and necessary.\n            (3) In 2005, the EPA withdrew its 2000 regulatory finding \n        in favor of a national cap-and-trade system for mercury \n        emissions from electric utility steam generating units, the \n        Clean Air Mercury Rule (``CAMR'').\n            (4) CAMR was subsequently challenged in petitions for \n        review filed by 17 States.\n            (5) The United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n        Columbia Circuit vacated the rule on February 8, 2008, finding \n        that once the EPA had listed electric utility steam generating \n        units as a source of hazardous air pollutants, it was required \n        by law to proceed with Maximum Achievable Control Technology \n        (``MACT'') regulations under section 112 of the Clean Air Act \n        unless it delisted the source category, under procedures set \n        forth in section 112(c)(9).\n            (6) Mercury control technologies for coal-fired electric \n        utility steam generating units have advanced rapidly in the \n        last few years.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect public health \nand welfare, and the environment, through mercury emission reductions \nfrom electric utility steam generating units.\n\nSEC. 3.
