FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) employment of private security officers in the United \n        States is growing rapidly;\n            (2) private security officers function as an adjunct to, \n        but not a replacement for, public law enforcement by helping to \n        reduce and prevent crime;\n            (3) such private security officers protect individuals, \n        property, and proprietary information, and provide protection \n        to such diverse operations as banks, hospitals, research and \n        development centers, manufacturing facilities, defense and \n        aerospace contractors, high technology businesses, nuclear \n        power plants, chemical companies, oil and gas refineries, \n        airports, communication facilities and operations, office \n        complexes, schools, residential properties, apartment \n        complexes, gated communities, and others;\n            (4) sworn law enforcement officers provide significant \n        services to the citizens of the United States in its public \n        areas, and are supplemented by private security officers;\n            (5) the threat of additional terrorist attacks requires \n        cooperation between public and private sectors and demands \n        professional security officers for the protection of people, \n        facilities, and institutions;\n            (6) the trend in the Nation toward growth in such security \n        services has accelerated rapidly;\n            (7) such growth makes available more public sector law \n        enforcement officers to combat serious and violent crimes;\n            (8) the American public deserves the employment of \n        qualified, well-trained private security personnel as an \n        adjunct to sworn law enforcement officers;\n            (9) private security officers and applicants for private \n        security officer positions should be thoroughly screened and \n        trained; and\n            (10) standards are essential for the selection, training, \n        and supervision of qualified security personnel providing \n        security services.\n\nSEC. 3.
