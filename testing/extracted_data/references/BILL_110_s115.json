FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) record highs in oil and natural gas prices have \n        resulted in record profits for oil and natural gas producers \n        and refiners;\n            (2) oil prices are projected to remain high for the \n        foreseeable future;\n            (3) the Department of the Interior estimates that as much \n        as $66,000,000,000 worth of oil and natural gas taken from the \n        deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico over the next 5 years will be \n        exempt from Government royalty payments, which could amount to \n        the Government losing an estimated $7,000,000,000 to \n        $9,500,000,000 based on anticipated production and current \n        price projections for oil and gas, according to an analysis in \n        the 5-year budget plan of the Department of the Interior;\n            (4) the chief executive officers of the top 5 oil companies \n        stated at a November 9, 2005, joint hearing of the Committee on \n        Energy and Natural Resource of the Senate and the Committee on \n        Environment and Public Works of the Senate that their companies \n        did not need the Federal tax incentives provided in the Energy \n        Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15801 et seq.);\n            (5) the Statement of Administration Policy of June 14, \n        2005, on the energy bill that would become the Energy Policy \n        Act of 2005 states, ``The President believes that additional \n        taxpayer subsidies for oil-and-gas exploration are unwarranted \n        in today's price environment, and urges the Senate to eliminate \n        the Federal oil-and-gas subsidies and other exploration \n        incentives contained in the bill.''; and\n            (6) incentives for the energy industry should be focused on \n        the development of renewable energy resources in the United \n        States that will also promote, jobs, investment, innovation, \n        and economic development in rural, agriculture-dependent areas.\n\nTITLE I--TERMINATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE ENERGY POLICY ACT OF \n                                  2005\n\nSEC. 101.
