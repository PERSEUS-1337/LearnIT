FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The struggle to end discrimination against people of \n        African descent is a global challenge, and one that is central \n        to the United States commitment to human rights.\n            (2) Targeted exclusion, violence, and discrimination \n        against people of African descent continues around the world.\n            (3) Issues range from the fight for ancestral lands in \n        Latin America, hate crimes resulting in injury and death in \n        Europe, profiling and excessive use of force by law enforcement \n        in the United States, and continuing global disparities in \n        health, education, employment, housing, and other sectors.\n            (4) It is imperative that the world actively address the \n        vestiges of slavery and colonialism that have long hindered \n        racial equality and justice and prevented the recognition of \n        the important contributions of people of African descent to the \n        world.\n            (5) The International Decade for People of African Descent, \n        from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2025, offers an \n        opportunity to address these issues domestically and globally \n        through coordinated government and civil society strategies, \n        including the private sector.\n\nSEC. 3.
