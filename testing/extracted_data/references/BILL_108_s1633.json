FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the privacy and financial security of individuals is \n        increasingly at risk due to the ever more widespread collection \n        of personal information by both the private and public sector;\n            (2) credit card transactions, real estate records, consumer \n        surveys, credit reports, and Internet websites are all sources \n        of personal information and form the source material for \n        identity thieves;\n            (3) identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes \n        committed in the United States, and identity theft has become \n        one of the major law enforcement challenges of the new economy, \n        as vast quantities of sensitive personal information are now \n        vulnerable to criminal interception and misuse;\n            (4) criminals who steal personal information use the \n        information to open fraudulent credit card accounts, write bad \n        checks, buy products, and commit other financial crimes with \n        assumed financial identities;\n            (5) in 2002, more than 160,000 people notified the Federal \n        Trade Commission that they had been victims of identity theft, \n        more than 3 times the number reported in 2000;\n            (6) identity theft is costly to consumers and to the United \n        States marketplace;\n            (7) victims of identity theft are often required to contact \n        numerous Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies, \n        consumer credit reporting agencies, and creditors over many \n        years, as each event of fraud arises;\n            (8) the Government, financial institutions, financial \n        service providers, and credit reporting agencies that handle \n        sensitive personal information of consumers have a shared \n        responsibility to protect the information from identity \n        thieves, to assist identity theft victims, and to mitigate the \n        harm that results from fraud perpetrated in the name of the \n        victim; and\n            (9) the private sector can better protect consumers by \n        improving customer notification, implementing effective fraud \n        alerts, affording greater consumer access to credit reports, \n        and establishing other financial identity theft prevention \n        measures.\n\nSEC. 3. TIMELY NOTIFICATION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO PERSONAL \n              INFORMATION.\n\n    Subtitle B of title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6821 \net seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating sections 526 and 527 as sections 528 \n        and 529, respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 525 the following:\n\n``SEC. 526.
