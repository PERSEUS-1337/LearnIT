FINDINGS.\n\n     Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The members of the Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and \n        Chippewa Indians, whose historic name is the Cheboigan (or \n        Cheboygan) Band, are descendants and political successors to \n        signatories of the 1836 Treaty of Washington and the 1855 \n        Treaty of Detroit. The Band was twice recognized by the United \n        States, on a government-to-government relationship basis, \n        through the execution and ratification of those treaties.\n            (2) The 1836 Treaty of Washington provided that the \n        Cheboigan Band would receive a reservation of 1,000 acres on \n        the Cheboigan, within its aboriginal territory, but the United \n        States failed to provide that reservation. The 1855 Treaty of \n        Detroit provided for the withdrawal of unsold lands in 2 \n        Michigan townships 35 North and 36 North Range 3 West for the \n        use of the Cheboygan Band, but due to the Federal Government's \n        failure to act, those members who selected allotments within \n        that area were not awarded those individual land holdings until \n        3 years after a special Act of Congress was passed in 1872.\n            (3) Between 1845 and 1850 the Band's members used treaty \n        annuity payments to purchase land for the Band in Burt \n        Township, Cheboygan County, Michigan. That land, called \n        Colonial Point, was placed in trust with the Governor of \n        Michigan on the advice of Federal Indian agents.\n            (4) During the next 50 years, questions arose regarding the \n        taxability of the property, and the acreage was ultimately sold \n        for back taxes in 1900.\n            (5) After the Band was forcibly evicted from Colonial Point \n        and its village was burned to the ground by its new owner, John \n        McGinn, the majority of the Band's families took up residency \n        on nearby Indian Road on lands which other Band members had \n        purchased or received as treaty allotments or homesteads.\n            (6) In 1911, the United States filed suit in the United \n        States Federal District Court for Eastern Michigan seeking to \n        regain possession of the Colonial Point Lands (United States v. \n        McGinn, Equity No. 94, filed June 11, 1911). In its complaint, \n        the United States advised the Court that it was suing on behalf \n        of the: ``Cheboygan band of Indians [which] is now and was at \n        all the times mentioned in this bill of complaint a tribe of \n        indians [sic] under the care, control, and guardianship of the \n        plaintiff and said band is now and was at all times mentioned \n        in this bill of complaint recognized by the plaintiff through \n        its chiefs or head men which it annually elects.''.\n            (7) In 1917, the Federal District Court decided the McGinn \n        case against the United States finding that the language in the \n        Colonial Point deeds did not prevent the Colonial Point land \n        from being taxed.\n            (8) Over the next 20 years, members of the Band asked the \n        United States to appeal, or otherwise rectify the District \n        Court's decision, but no Federal action was taken. Throughout \n        this period, the United States continued to provide the Band \n        and its members with many of the same Federal services that \n        were being provided to other Indian tribes in Michigan.\n            (9) The Act of June 18, 1934 (hereafter in this Act \n        referred to as the ``Indian Reorganization Act''), authorized \n        and directed the Bureau of Indian Affairs to provide technical \n        assistance and Federal funds to petitioning tribes to assist \n        them in reorganizing their governments and improving their \n        economies. Members of the Cheboigan Band, as well as members of \n        other landless treaty Tribes in Michigan, submitted petitions \n        to receive that assistance. Similar petitions were also \n        submitted by 4 Michigan bands that still held communal lands. \n        Possession of a tribal land base was a prerequisite to the \n        receipt of most of the Federal funds and services provided for \n        in the Indian Reorganization Act.\n            (10) While the Indian Reorganization Act directed the \n        Secretary to assist landless bands, like Burt Lake, and \n        authorized Federal funds to acquire land for landless tribes, \n        no Federal funds were appropriated to acquire new tribal lands \n        for any of the landless bands in Michigan. After struggling \n        with this dilemma, the Bureau of Indian Affairs extended the \n        benefits of the Indian Reorganization Act to only those 4 \n        Michigan tribes that had an existing land base on the date of \n        the enactment of the Indian Reorganization Act. Of the Ottawa \n        and Chippewa Tribes who signed the 1836 and 1855 Treaties, only \n        1 group, the Bay Mills Indian Community was reaffirmed.\n            (11) The failure of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to grant \n        Indian Reorganization Act benefits to the Cheboigan Band did \n        not terminate the band's government-to-government relationship \n        with the United States, and Congress has never taken any action \n        to terminate the Federal acknowledgment of the Burt Lake Band.\n            (12) The Bureau of Indian Affairs lacked and lacks the \n        legal authority to terminate a tribe that has been acknowledged \n        by an Act of Congress.\n            (13) In recent years, the Federal recognition of the \n        following Michigan tribes, who were also denied the benefits of \n        the Indian Reorganization Act, has been reaffirmed:\n                    (A) The Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa was \n                reaffirmed by a Memorandum of the Commissioner of \n                Indian Affairs on September 7, 1972.\n                    (B) The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa \n                Indians was reaffirmed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs \n                Branch of Acknowledgment on May 27, 1980.\n                    (C) The Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indian \n                and the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians each had \n                its Federal status reaffirmed by an Act of Congress on \n                September 21, 1994.\n                    (D) The Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior \n                Chippewa Indians had its Federal status reaffirmed by \n                an Act of Congress at the request of the Administration \n                on September 8, 1988.\n                    (E) The Pokagon Indian Nation had its Federal \n                status reaffirmed by an Act of Congress on September \n                21, 1994.\n                    (F) The Huron Potawatomi Nation had its Federal \n                status reaffirmed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs' \n                Branch of Acknowledgment and Research on March 17, \n                1996.\n                    (G) The Gun Lake Tribe (Match-She-Be-Nash-She-Wish) \n                had its Federal status reaffirmed by the Bureau of \n                Indian Affairs' Office of Federal Acknowledgment on \n                August 23, 1999.\n            (14) The Band has been consistently recognized by third \n        parties as a distinct Indian community since well before 1900.\n            (15) All of the Band's adult members are the children, \n        grandchildren, or great grandchildren of Indian persons who \n        resided on or near Colonial Point or Indian Road at the time of \n        the Burn Out. Most of the Band's adult members grew up on or \n        near Indian Road or had an immediate family member who did. As \n        the result, the Band's members have maintained very close \n        social and political ties.\n            (16) The Band's families have and continue to provide \n        mutual aid to each other, visit each other regularly, mobilize \n        to assist each other in times of need, practice traditional \n        arts and crafts, gather for Ghost Suppers, decorate the graves \n        of their ancestors, and participate in other traditional tribal \n        ceremonies and events.\n            (17) Since 1829 the Band's members have attended and \n        consistently mobilized to maintain the Indian Mission Church of \n        St. Mary's, first on Colonial Point and later on Indian Road. \n        The Band's members have also worked together to maintain the \n        Tribe's 2 Indian cemetaries. They have also dug the graves and \n        buried their relatives in those 2 Indian cemeteries for almost \n        200 years.\n            (18) The Band's members have throughout time made formal \n        and informal decisions for the community. The Band has also \n        organized its own modern tribal government without the \n        assistance of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n            (19) The majority of the Band's elders have a high degree \n        of Indian blood and continue to speak the Ottawa language when \n        they gather with each other. Before World War II, more than 50 \n        percent of the Burt Lake families were still speaking the \n        traditional language in their homes, and more than 50 percent \n        of those tribal members who were married were married to other \n        Ottawa and Chippewa individuals.\n\nSEC. 3.
