FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) An increasing number of children are becoming separated \n        from their primary caretaker parents due to the incarceration \n        of such parents in prisons and jails.\n            (2) This separation of children from their primary \n        caretaker parents can cause irreparable harm to the children's \n        psychological well-being and hinder their growth and \n        development.\n            (3) A significant number of children are born shortly \n        before or during the incarceration of their mothers and are \n        then quickly separated from their mothers, preventing the \n        parent-child bonding that is crucial to developing in children \n        a sense of security and trust.\n            (4) Maintaining close relationships with their children \n        provides a powerful incentive for prisoners to participate in \n        and successfully benefit from rehabilitative programs.\n            (5) Maintaining strong family ties during imprisonment has \n        been shown to decrease recidivism, thereby reducing prison \n        costs.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to create demonstration projects designed to alleviate \n        the harm to children and primary caretaker parents caused by \n        separation due to the incarceration of such parents,\n            (2) to promote development of policies to assign prisoners \n        whenever possible to correctional facilities for which they \n        qualify closest to their family homes,\n            (3) to reduce prison populations,\n            (4) to reduce recidivism rates of prisoners by encouraging \n        strong and supportive family relationships, and\n            (5) to reduce the cost of providing correctional services \n        and maintaining traditional correctional facilities by \n        decreasing recidivism and maintaining community correctional \n        facilities at lower cost.\n\nSEC. 103.
