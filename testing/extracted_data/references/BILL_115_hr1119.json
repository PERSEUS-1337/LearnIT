and\n                    (C) uses coal refuse as at least 75 percent of the \n                annual fuel consumed, by heat input, of the unit.\n            (5) Coal refuse-fired facility.--The term ``coal refuse-\n        fired facility'' means all coal refuse electric utility steam \n        generating units that are--\n                    (A) located on one or more contiguous or adjacent \n                properties;\n                    (B) specified within the same Major Group (2-digit \n                code), as described in the Standard Industrial \n                Classification Manual (1987);
