    "content": "This report describes selected health care-related provisions that are scheduled to expire during the second session of the 116 th Congress (i.e., during calendar year [CY] 2020). For purposes of this report, expiring provisions are defined as portions of law that are time-limited and will lapse once a statutory deadline is reached, absent further legislative action. The expiring provisions included in this report are those related to Medicare, Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and private health insurance programs and activities. The report also includes health care-related provisions enacted in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 ) or extended under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act; P.L. 116-136 ). This report describes health care-related provisions within the same scope that expired during the first session of the 116 th Congress (i.e., during CY2019). Although the Congressional Research Service (CRS) has attempted to be comprehensive, it cannot guarantee that every relevant provision is included here. The two types of provisions discussed in this report generally are enacted in the context of authorization laws and thus are typically within the purview of congressional authorizing committees. The duration that a provision is in effect usually is regarded as creating a timeline for legislative decisionmaking. In choosing this timeline, Congress navigates tradeoffs between the frequency of congressional review and the stability of funding or other legal requirements that pertain to the program.  The first type of provision in this report provides or controls mandatory spending, meaning it provides temporary funding, temporary increases or decreases in funding (e.g., Medicare provider bonus payments), or temporary special protections that may result in changes in funding levels (e.g., Medicare funding provisions that establish a floor). The second type of provision defines the authority of government agencies or other entities to act, usually by authorizing a policy, project, or activity. Such provisions also may temporarily delay the implementation of a regulation, requirement, or deadline, or establish a moratorium on a particular activity. Expiring health care provisions that are predominantly associated with discretionary spending activities\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as discretionary authorizations of appropriations and authorities for discretionary user fees\u00e2\u0080\u0094are excluded from this report. Certain types of provisions with expiration dates that otherwise would meet the criteria set forth above are also excluded from this report. Some of these provisions are excluded, because they are transitional or routine in nature or have been superseded by congressional action that otherwise modifies the intent of the expiring provision. For example, statutorily required Medicare payment rate reductions and payment rate re-basings that are implemented over a specified period are not considered to require legislative attention and are excluded. The report is organized as follows: Table 1 lists the relevant provisions that are scheduled to expire in 2020. Table 2 lists the relevant provisions that expired during 2019. The provisions in each table are organized by expiration date and applicable health care-related program.  The report then describes each listed provision, including a legislative history. The summaries are grouped by provisions scheduled to expire in 2020 followed by those that expired in 2019. Appendix A lists demonstration projects and pilot programs that are scheduled to expire in 2020 or that expired in 2019 and are related to Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and private health insurance programs and activities or other health care-related provisions that were enacted in the ACA or last extended under the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-94 ). Appendix B lists the status of provisions included in CRS Report R45781, Health Care-Related Expiring Provisions of the 116th Congress, First Session , that did not apply within the scope of this report. Appendix C lists all laws that created, modified, or extended the health care-related expiring provisions described in this report. Appendix D lists abbreviations used in the report. The Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education (SRAE) program, formerly known as the Abstinence Education Grants program, provides funding for education to adolescents aged 10 to 20 exclusively on abstaining from sexual activity outside of marriage.

Additionally, funding was provided for a specified portion of FY2021 (October 1, 2020 through November 30, 2020) at the same proportional share of amounts provided during that same period in FY2020.  Funding authorized under the CARES Act for the Title V SRAE program expires after November 30, 2020. The Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) is a broad approach to teen pregnancy prevention that seeks to educate adolescents ages 10 through 19 and pregnant and parenting youth under age 21 on both abstinence and contraceptives to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Education services can address abstinence and/or contraceptives to prevent pregnancy and STIs. PREP includes four types of grants, which are administered by HHS: (1) State PREP grants, (2) Competitive PREP grants, (3) Tribal PREP, and (4) PREP\u00e2\u0080\u0093Innovative Strategies (PREIS). A majority of PREP funding is allocated to states and territories via the State PREP grant. The 50 states, District of Columbia, and the territories are eligible for funding.

Funding authorized under the CARES Act for PREP expires after November 30, 2020. SSA Section 1890A requires the HHS Secretary to establish a pre-rulemaking process to select quality measures for use in the Medicare program. As part of this process, the Secretary makes available to the public measures under consideration for use in Medicare quality programs and broadly disseminates the quality measures that are selected to be used, while the consensus-based entity with a contract (National Quality Form, or NQF) gathers multi-stakeholder input and annually transmits that input to the Secretary. NQF fulfills this requirement through its Measure Applications Partnership (MAP), an entity that convenes multi-stakeholder groups to provide input into the selection of quality measures for use in Medicare and other federal programs. MAP publishes annual reports with recommendations for selection of quality measures in February of each year, with the first report published in February 2012.  ACA, Section 3014(c) , transferred a total of $20 million from the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) and Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Funds for each of FY2010 through FY2014 to carry out SSA Section 1890A(a)-(d) (and the amendments made to SSA Section 1890(b) by ACA Section 3014(a)). PAMA, Section 109 , transferred $5 million for the remainder of FY2014 (from April 1, 2014, to September 30, 2014) and $15 million for the first six months of FY2015 (from October 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015) to carry out both SSA Section 1890 and SSA Section 1890A(a)-(d); funds were required to remain available until expended. MACRA, Section 207 , transferred $30 million for each of FY2015 through FY2017 to carry out both SSA Section 1890 and SSA Section 1890A(a)-(d). The funding provided under MACRA for FY2015 replaced the funding provided under PAMA for that year; therefore, the total funding for FY2015 was $30 million. BBA 2018, Section 50206 , transferred $7.5 million for each of FY2018 and FY2019 to carry out both Section 1890 and SSA Section 1890A(a)-(d). The section also added new HHS reporting requirements and modified existing NQF reporting requirements to specify use of funding, among other things. Amounts transferred for each of FY2018 and FY2019 are in addition to any unobligated balances that remained from prior years' transfers. Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020, and Health Extenders Act of 2019 , Section 1401, transferred $1,069,000 for the period beginning October 1, 2019, and ending November 21, 2019.

Funding authorized under the CARES Act to carry out the measure selection activities under SSA Section 1890A(a)-(d) expires after November 30, 2020. Under SSA Section 1890, the HHS Secretary is required to have a contract with a consensus-based entity (e.g., NQF) to carry out specified duties related to performance improvement and measurement. These duties include, among others, priority setting, measure endorsement, measure maintenance, and annual reporting to Congress. MIPPA, Section 183 , transferred, from the Medicare HI and SMI Trust Funds, a total of $10 million for each of FY2009 through FY2012 to carry out the activities under SSA Section 1890.

PAMA, Section 109 , transferred $5 million for the remainder of FY2014 (from April 1, 2014, to September 30, 2014) and $15 million for the first six months of FY2015 (from October 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015) to carry out both SSA Section 1890 and SSA Section 1890A(a)-(d); funds were required to remain available until expended. MACRA, Section 207 , transferred $30 million for each of FY2015 through FY2017 to carry out both SSA Section 1890 and SSA Section 1890A(a)-(d). The funding provided under MACRA for FY2015 effectively replaced the funding provided under PAMA for that year; therefore, the total funding for FY2015 was $30 million. Funds were required to remain available until expended. BBA 2018, Section 50206 , transferred $7.5 million from the Medicare HI and SMI Trust Funds for each of FY2018 and FY2019 to carry out both Section 1890 and SSA Section 1890A(a)-(d). The section also added new HHS reporting requirements and modified existing NQF reporting requirements to specify use of funding, among other things. Amounts transferred for each of FY2018 and FY2019 are in addition to any unobligated balances that remained from prior years' transfers. Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020, and Health Extenders Act of 2019 , Section 1401, transferred $1,069,000 for the period beginning October 1, 2019, and ending November 21, 2019. Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020, and Further Health Extenders Act of 2019, Section 1401, transferred $1,665,000 for the period beginning October 1, 2019, and ending December 20, 2019.

Funding authorized under the CARES Act to support the contract with the consensus-based entity under SSA Section 1890 expires after November 30, 2020. MACRA made several fundamental changes to how Medicare pays for physician and practitioner services by (1) changing the methodology for determining the annual updates to the conversion factor, (2) establishing new methods for paying for professional services under Medicare Part B, including a merit-based incentive payment system (MIPS) to consolidate and replace several existing incentive programs and to apply value and quality adjustments to the Medicare physician fee schedule (MPFS), and (3) establishing the development of, and participation in, alternative payment models (APMs).  To provide technical assistance to small practices and practices in health professional shortage areas, MACRA required the HHS Secretary to enter into contracts or agreements with appropriate entities (such as quality-improvement organizations, regional extension centers, or regional health collaboratives) to offer guidance and assistance to MIPS-eligible professionals in practices of 15 or fewer professionals. Under the technical assistance program, priority is required to be given to professionals located in rural areas, health professional shortage areas, or practices with low composite scores under the new payment system. The guidance and assistance is provided with respect to the MIPS performance categories or with respect to how to transition to the implementation of and participation in an APM.  For purposes of implementing the technical assistance program, $20 million from the SMI Trust Fund was made available to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for each of FY2016-FY2020. These amounts are available until expended. MACRA, Section 101, provided for the transfer of $20 million, for each of FY2016 through FY2020, from the Medicare SMI Trust Fund. No funds to support the technical assistance program have been authorized beyond FY2020. Payments under the Medicare MPFS are adjusted geographically for three factors to reflect differences in the cost of resources needed to produce physician services: physician work, practice expense, and medical malpractice insurance. The geographic adjustments are indices\u00e2\u0080\u0094known as Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs)\u00e2\u0080\u0094that reflect how each area compares to the national average in a \"market basket\" of goods. A value of 1.00 represents the average across all areas. These indices are used in the calculation of the payment rate under the MPFS. Several laws have established a minimum value of 1.00 (floor) for the physician work GPCI for localities where the work GPCI was less than 1.00. MMA , Section 412, provided for an increase in the work geographic index to 1.0 (floor) for any locality for which the work geographic index was less than 1.0 for services furnished from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2006. TRHCA , Section 102 , extended the floor through December 31, 2007. MMSEA , Section 103, extended the floor through June 30, 2008. MIPPA , Section 134, extended the floor through December 31, 2009. In addition, beginning January 1, 2009, MIPAA set the work geographic index for Alaska to 1.5 if the index otherwise would be less than 1.5; no expiration was set for this modification. ACA , Section 3102, extended the floor through December 31, 2010. Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act of 2010 (MMEA; P.L. 111-309 ) , Section 103, extended the floor through December 31, 2011. Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 ( TPTCCA, P.L. 112-78 ) , Section 303, extended the floor through February 29, 2012. Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (MCTRJCA, P.L. 112-96 ) , Section 3004, extended the floor through December 31, 2012, and required the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) to report on whether any work geographic adjustment to the MPFS is appropriate, what that level of adjustment should be (if appropriate), and where the adjustment should be applied. The report also was required to assess the impact of such an adjustment, including how it would affect access to care. ATRA , Section 602, extended the floor through December 31, 2013. PAMA , Section 102, extended the floor through March 31, 2015. MACRA , Section 201, extended the floor through December 31, 2017. BBA 2018 , Section 50201, extended the floor through December 31, 2019. Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, Division N, Section 101 , extended the floor through March 22, 2020. CARES Act, Section 3801, extended the floor through November 30, 2020. The authority for the MPFS GPCI floor expires after November 30, 2020. Federally certified home health (HH) agencies receive increased payments under the HH prospective payment system (PPS) for Medicare home health care episodes furnished to beneficiaries in rural areas. Before BBA 2018, when provided by legislation, the HH\u00c2\u00a0 rural add-on \u00c2\u00a0was a fixed percent age \u00c2\u00a0increase to the HH PPS that was applied\u00c2\u00a0uniformly to \u00c2\u00a0 Medicare home health episodes of care provided in rural counties.\u00c2\u00a0 Under BBA 2018, the add-on was applied unvaryingly for the first year the legislation extended the increase d \u00c2\u00a0payment, providing a 3% rural add-on payment to Medicare home health episodes furnished in any rural county that began in CY2018. After CY2018, BBA 2018 provided home health agencies a 3%, 2%, and 1% HH PPS add-on payment for services furnished in rural counties beginning during CY2019-CY2021, respectively, unless the Medicare home health services were, or are, furnished in a rural county with one of the two\u00c2\u00a0 below-described\u00c2\u00a0 designations, in which case alternative add-on payments were /are \u00c2\u00a0provided: For home health episodes furnished to beneficiaries who reside in\u00c2\u00a0 low population density\u00c2\u00a0 counties, which are defined as rural counties that have a population density of six or fewer individuals per square mile, BBA 2019 provided 4%, 3%, 2%, and 1% HH PPS add-on payments for services beginning during CY2019-CY2022, respectively , and For home health episodes provided to beneficiaries who reside in\u00c2\u00a0 high utilization\u00c2\u00a0 counties, which are defined as rural counties in the top quartile of all counties rendering home health services (by the number of HH episodes furnished per 100 Medicare eligibles), BBA 2018 provided 1.5% and 0.5% HH PPS add-on payments for home health episodes beginning in CY2019-CY2020, respectively. BBA 2018 provided no add-on payment for episodes furnished in high utilization rural counties that begin in CY2021 or CY2022. Under BBA 2018, rural counties were to be categorized only once and such determination applies to payment home health episodes through CY2022.  The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA 2000; P.L. 106-554 ), Section 508, \u00c2\u00a0established a 10% add-on to Medicare's HH PPS rates for home health episodes provided to beneficiaries in rural areas beginning April 1, 2001, through March 31, 2003. Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 ( MMA ; P.L. 108-173 ), Section 421, \u00c2\u00a0provided a 5% add-on for services beginning April 1, 2004, through March 31, 2005.

ACA Section, 3131, \u00c2\u00a0provided a 3% add-on for services beginning April 1, 2010, through December 31, 2015. MACRA, Section 210, \u00c2\u00a0provided a 3% add-on for services beginning January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017. BBA 2018, Section 50208, \u00c2\u00a0provided a 3% add-on for services beginning in CY2018. BBA 2018 provided a 3%, 2%, and 1% add-on for services beginning in years CY2019-CY2021, respectively, unless the services were provided in a low population density or high utilization rural county. For services provided in low population density rural counties, BBA 2018 provided an add-on at 4%, 3%, 2%, and 1% for services beginning in years CY2019-CY2022, respectively. For services furnished in high utilization rural counties, a 1.5% and 0.5% add-on was provided for services beginning in years CY2019-CY2020, respectively.\u00c2\u00a0 After December 31, 2020, home health agencies are no longer set to receive an add-on payment for services provided in rural counties designated as high utilization counties.\u00c2\u00a0 The Administration for Community Living (ACL) administers federal grant programs that fund outreach and assistance to older adults, individuals with disabilities, and their caregivers in accessing various health and social services. Funding for these programs is provided through discretionary budget authority in annual appropriations to the following entities: State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIPs): programs that provide outreach, counseling, and information assistance to Medicare beneficiaries and their families and caregivers on Medicare and other health insurance issues. Area Agencies on Aging (AAA): state-designated public or private nonprofit agencies that address the needs and concerns of older adults at the regional or local levels. AAAs plan, develop, coordinate, and deliver a wide range of home and community-based services. Most AAAs are direct providers of information and referral assistance programs. Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs): programs in local communities that assist older adults, individuals with disabilities, and caregivers in accessing the full range of long-term services and supports options, including available public programs and private payment options. The National Center for Benefits and Outreach Enrollment assists organizations to enroll older adults and individuals with disabilities into benefit programs that they may be eligible for, such as Medicare, Medicaid, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), among others. In addition to discretionary funding for these programs, beginning in FY2009, MIPPA provided funding for specific outreach and assistance activities to Medicare beneficiaries. This mandatory funding was extended multiple times, most recently in the CARES Act through November 30, 2020, and provided for outreach and assistance to low-income Medicare beneficiaries including those who may be eligible for the Low-Income Subsidy program, Medicare Savings Program (MSP), and the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program. The HHS Secretary is required to transfer specified amounts for MIPPA program activities from the Medicare Trust Funds.

However, funds appropriated will be available for obligation until expended. When determining financial eligibility for Medicaid-covered long-term services and supports (LTSS), there are specific rules under SSA Section 1924 for the treatment of a married couple's assets when one spouse needs long-term care provided in an institution, such as a nursing home. Commonly referred to as \"spousal impoverishment rules,\" these rules attempt to equitably allocate income and assets to each spouse when determining Medicaid financial eligibility and are intended to prevent the impoverishment of the non-Medicaid spouse. For example, spousal impoverishment rules require state Medicaid programs to exempt all of a non-Medicaid spouse's income in his or her name from being considered available to the Medicaid spouse. Joint income of the couple is divided in half between the spouses, and the Medicaid spouse can transfer income to bring the non-Medicaid spouse up to certain income thresholds. Assets of the couple, regardless whose name they are in, are combined and then split in half. The non-Medicaid spouse can retain assets up to an asset threshold determined by the state within certain statutory parameters. Prior to enactment of the ACA, spousal impoverishment rules applied only in situations where the Medicaid participant was receiving LTSS in an institution. States had the option to extend these protections to certain home and community-based services (HCBS) participants under a Section 1915(c) waiver program. Beginning January 1, 2014, ACA Section 2404 temporarily substituted the definition of \"institutionalized spouse\" under SSA Section 1924(h)(1) to include application of these spousal impoverishment protections to all married individuals who are eligible for HCBS authorized under certain specified authorities. Thus, beginning January 1, 2014, for a five-year time period, the ACA required states to apply the spousal impoverishment rules to all married individuals who are eligible for HCBS under these specified authorities, not just those receiving institutional care. This modified definition expired on December 31, 2018. The 116 th Congress extended the authority for these protections and included a provision regarding state flexibility in the application of income or asset disregards for married individuals receiving certain HCBS. ACA, Section 2404, required states to extend spousal impoverishment rules to certain beneficiaries receiving HCBS for a five-year period beginning on January 1, 2014. The Medicaid Extenders Act of 2019 ( P.L. 116-3 ), Section 3 , extended this provision through March 31, 2019. The Medicai d Services Investment and Accountability Act of 2019 ( P.L. 116-16 ), Section 2, extended this provision through September 30, 2019. The Sustaining Excellence in Medicaid Act of 2019 ( P.L. 116-39 ), Section 3, extended this provision through December 31, 2019. Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 , Section 204, extended this provision through May 22, 2020. CARES Act, Section 3812, further extended this provision through November 30, 2020. The authority for the extension of spousal impoverishment protections for certain Medicaid HCBS recipients will expire after November 30, 2020. The federal government's share of CHIP expenditures (including both services and administration) is determined by the enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (E-FMAP) rate. The E-FMAP rate is based on the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) rate, which is the federal matching rate for the Medicaid program. The FMAP formula compares each state's average per capita income with average U.S. per capita income. FMAP rates have a statutory minimum of 50% and a statutory maximum of 83%. The E-FMAP rate is calculated by reducing the state share under the regular FMAP rate by 30%. Statutorily, the E-FMAP (or federal matching rate) can range from 65% to 85%. For some CHIP expenditures, the federal matching rate is different from the E-FMAP rate. For instance, the matching rate for translation and interpretation services is the higher of 75% or states' E-FMAP rate plus 5 percentage points. Also, for services provided to children with family incomes exceeding 300% of the federal poverty level (FPL) with an exception for certain states, the matching rate is the lower regular FMAP rate.  ACA, Section 2101 , included a provision to increase the E-FMAP rate by 23 percentage points (not to exceed 100%) for most CHIP expenditures from FY2016 through FY2019. Making further continuing appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes ( P.L. 115-120 ), Section 3005, extended the increase to the E-FMAP rate for one year through FY2020. However, for FY2020 the increase to the E-FMAP is 11.5 percentage points instead of 23 percentage points. The increase to the E-FMAP expires after September 30, 2020. The Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) provided mandatory funding for federal health centers authorized in PHSA Section 330. These centers are located in medically underserved areas and provide primary care, dental care, and other health and supportive services to individuals regardless of their ability to pay. The mandatory CHCF appropriations are provided in addition to discretionary funding for the program; however, the CHCF comprised more than 70% of health center programs' appropriations in FY2019, the last year where final appropriations data are available.  ACA, Section 10503, established the CHCF and provided a total of $9.5 billion to the fund annually from FY2011 through FY2015, as follows: $1 billion for FY2011, $1.2 billion for FY2012, $1.5 billion for FY2013, $2.2 billion for FY2014, and $3.6 billion for FY2015.

The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) provides scholarships and loan repayments to certain health professionals in exchange for providing care in a health professional shortage area for a period of time that varies based on the length of the scholarship or the number of years of loan repayment received. The NHSC receives mandatory funding from the CHCF through PHSA Title III. The NHSC also received discretionary appropriations in FY2011. Between FY2012 and FY2017, the program did not receive discretionary appropriations. Beginning in FY2018 and continuing in FY2019, the program received discretionary appropriations, primarily to expand the number and type of substance abuse providers participating in the NHSC. The mandatory funding from the CHCF represents more nearly three-quarters of the program's funding in both FY2018 and FY2019, the last years where final appropriations data are available.  ACA, Section 10503, funded $1.5 billion to support the NHSC annually from FY2011 through FY2015, as follows: $290 million for FY2011, $295 million for FY2012, $300 million for FY2013, $305 million for FY2014, and $310 million for FY2015.

CARES Act, Section 3831, provided $126.5 million for FY2020, which supersedes the funding previously provided by law for all periods of FY2020. Additionally, $21,141,096 was provided for the period of October 1, 2020 through November 30, 2020. Funding authorized under the CARES Act for Teaching Health Center GME payments expires after November 30, 2020, but unused funds remain available until expended. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) subsidizes 72.5% of the cost of qualified health insurance for eligible taxpayers and their family members. Potential eligibility for the HCTC is limited to two groups of taxpayers. One group is composed of individuals eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) allowances because they experienced qualifying job losses. The other group consists of individuals whose defined-benefit pension plans were taken over by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation because of financial difficulties. HCTC-eligible individuals are allowed to receive the tax credit only if they either cannot enroll in certain other health coverage (e.g., Medicaid) or are not eligible for other specified coverage (e.g., Medicare Part A). To claim the HCTC, eligible taxpayers must have qualified health insurance (specific categories of coverage, as specified in statute). The credit is financed through a permanent appropriation under 31 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a71324(b)(2); therefore, the financing of the HCTC is not subject to the annual appropriations process. The T rade Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-210 ), Sections 2 01-203, authorized the Health Coverage Tax Credit, specified the eligibility criteria for claiming the credit, and made conforming amendment to the U.S.C. for purposes of financing the credit. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ), Part VI: TAA Health Coverage Improvement Act of 2009 , expanded eligibility for and subsidy of the HCTC including retroactive amendments, and provided $80 million for FY2009 and FY2010 to implement the enacted changes to the HCTC. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Extension Act of 2011 ( P.L. 112-40 ), Section 241 , established a sunset date of before January 1, 2014. The T rade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 ( P.L. 114-27 ), Section 407 , retroactively reauthorized the HCTC and established a new sunset date of before January 1, 2020. Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, Section 146 , established a new sunset date of before January 1, 2021.  Authorization for the HCTC is scheduled to expire after December 31, 2020. The Pregnancy Assistance Fund (PAF) program focuses on meeting the educational, social service, and health needs of vulnerable expectant and parenting individuals and their families during pregnancy and the postnatal period. The program identifies eligible populations as expectant and parenting teens, college students, and women of any age who experience domestic violence, sexual violence, sexual assault, or stalking. HHS administers the PAF program, and funding is awarded competitively to the 50 states, DC, U.S. territories, and tribal entities (hereinafter, grantees) that apply successfully. Grantees may use funds (1) to establish, operate, or maintain pregnancy or parenting services at institutions of higher education (IHEs), high schools, or community service providers; (2) to provide, in partnership with the state attorney general's office, certain legal and supportive services for women who experience domestic violence, sexual violence, sexual assault, or stalking while they are pregnant or parenting an infant; and (3) to support, either directly or through a subgrantee, public awareness about PAF services for the expectant and parenting population that is eligible for the program. ACA, Section 10212 , established PAF and provided $25 million annually from FY2010 through FY2019. Funding authorized under the ACA expired after September 30, 2019.  Section 101 of MACRA made fundamental changes to the way Medicare payments to physicians are determined and how they are updated. To implement the payment modifications in Section 101 of MACRA, the law authorized the transfer of $80 million from the SMI Trust Fund for each fiscal year beginning with FY2015 and ending with FY2019. The amounts transferred are to be available until expended. MACRA , Section 101 , provided for the transfer of $80 million, for each of FY2015 through FY2019, from the Medicare SMI Trust Fund. Appropriated funds to support the activities under this subsection have not been enacted for FY2020 or subsequent fiscal years.  SSA Section 1848(s) required the HHS Secretary to develop a plan for the development of quality measures for use in the MIPS program, which is to be updated as needed. The subsection also requires the Secretary to enter into contracts or other arrangements to develop, improve, update, or expand quality measures, in accordance with the plan. In entering into contracts, the Secretary must give priority to developing measures of outcomes, patient experience of care, and care coordination, among other things. The HHS Secretary, through CMS, annually reports on the progress made in developing quality measures under this subsection.  MACRA, Section 102 , provided for the transfer of $15 million, for each of FY2015 through FY2019, from the Medicare SMI Trust Fund. Appropriated funds to support the activities under this subsection have not been enacted for FY2020 or subsequent fiscal years. However, funds appropriated prior to FY2020 are available for obligation through the end of FY2022. Medicare pays LTCHs for certain inpatient hospital care under the LTCH prospective payment system (LTCH PPS), which is typically higher than payments for inpatient hospital care under the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS). PSRA amended the law so that the LTCH PPS payment is no longer available for all LTCH discharges but instead is available only for those LTCH discharges that met specific clinical criteria. Specifically, LTCHs are paid under the LTCH PPS if a Medicare beneficiary either (1) had a prior three-day intensive-care-unit stay at a hospital paid under the IPPS immediately preceding the LTCH stay or (2) is assigned to an LTCH PPS case-mix group that is based on the receipt of ventilator services for at least 96 hours and had a prior hospital stay at a hospital paid under the IPPS immediately preceding the LTCH stay. Discharges involving patients who have a principal diagnosis relating to a psychiatric diagnosis or rehabilitation do not qualify for the LTCH PPS rate. Subsequent legislation provided for other criteria to temporarily receive payment under the LTCH PPS. See section \" Temporary Exception for Certain Spinal Cord Conditions from Application of the Medicare LTCH Site Neutral Payment for Certain LTCHs (SSA\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a71886(m)(6)(F); 42\u00c2\u00a0U.S.C.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a71395ww(m)(6)(F)) .\" For LTCH discharges that did not qualify for the LTCH PPS based on these clinical criteria, a \"site neutral payment rate\" similar to the PPS for inpatient acute care hospitals (IPPS) was to be phased-in. The site neutral rate is defined as the lower of an \"IPPS-comparable\" per diem amount, as defined in regulations, or the estimated cost of the services involved. PSRA, Section 1206(a), established patient criteria for payment under the LTCH PPS and a site neutral payment rate for LTCH patients who do not meet these criteria. During a phase-in period for discharges in cost-reporting periods beginning in FY2016 and FY2017, LTCHs received a blended payment amount based on 50% of what the LTCH would have been reimbursed under the LTCH PPS rate and 50% of the site neutral payment rate. For cost-reporting periods beginning in FY2018 and subsequent years, the LTCH was to receive the site neutral payment rate. BBA 2018, Section 51005 , extended the transition period to site neutral Medicare payments for LTCH patients who do not meet the patient criteria for an additional two years, to include discharges in cost-reporting periods beginning during FY2018 and FY2019. During this period, LTCHs continue to receive the 50/50 blended payment for discharges that do not meet certain LTCH PPS criteria. The extended transition period to site neutral payments during which LTCHs receive a blended payment for discharges that do not meet the patient criteria expired for discharges occurring in cost-reporting periods beginning during FY2020 and subsequent years. Medicare pays LTCHs for inpatient hospital care under the LTCH PPS, which is typically higher than payments for inpatient hospital care under the IPPS. Effective for cost-reporting periods beginning in FY2016, LTCHS are paid the LTCH PPS rate for patients that meet one of the following two criteria: (1) had a prior three-day intensive-care-unit stay at a hospital paid under the IPPS immediately preceding the LTCH stay or (2) is assigned to an LTCH PPS case-mix group that is based on the receipt of ventilator services for at least 96 hours and had a prior hospital stay at a hospital paid under the IPPS immediately preceding the LTCH stay. Discharges involving patients who have a principal diagnosis relating to a psychiatric diagnosis or rehabilitation do not qualify for the LTCH PPS rate. For LTCH discharges that did not qualify for the LTCH PPS based on these criteria, a site neutral payment rate is being phased-in for cost-reporting periods beginning FY2016 through FY2019. Subsequent legislation provided for other criteria to temporarily receive payment under the LTCH PPS. See section \" Temporary Extension of Long-Term Care Hospital (LTCH) Site Neutral Payment Policy Transition Period (SSA\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a71886(m)(6)(B)(i); 42\u00c2\u00a0U.S.C.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a71395ww(m)(6)(B)(i)) \" for details related to site neutral payment. The 21 st Century Cures Act (Cures Act; P.L. 114-255 ), Division C, Section 15009 , established an additional temporary criterion for payment under the LTCH PPS related to certain spinal cord conditions for discharges occurring in cost-reporting periods FY2018 and FY2019. Specifically, the LTCH PPS rate would apply to an LTCH discharge if all of the following are met: (1) the LTCH was a not-for-profit on June 1, 2014; (2) at least 50% of the LTCH's CY2013 LTCH PPS-paid discharges were classified under LTCH diagnosis related groups (DRGs) associated with catastrophic spinal cord injuries, acquired brain injury, or other paralyzing neuromuscular conditions; and (3) the LTCH during FY2014 discharged patients (including Medicare beneficiaries and others) who had been admitted from at least 20 of the 50 states, as determined by the HHS Secretary based on a patient's state of residency. The authority for the temporary criterion related to certain spinal cord conditions to receive payment under the LTCH PPS expired for discharges occurring in cost reporting periods during FY2020 and for subsequent years. Currently, Medicare payments for services of physicians and certain non-physician practitioners, including radiation therapy services, are made on the basis of a fee schedule.  To set payment rates under the MPFS, relative values units (RVUs) are assigned to each of more than 7,000 service codes that reflect physician work (i.e., the time, skill, and intensity it takes to provide the service), practice expenses, and malpractice costs. The relative value for a service compares the relative work and other inputs involved in performing one service with the inputs involved in providing other physicians' services. The relative values are adjusted for geographic variation in input costs. The adjusted relative values are then converted into a dollar payment amount by a conversion factor. CMS, which is responsible for maintaining and updating the fee schedule, continually modifies and refines the methodology for estimating RVUs. CMS is required to review the RVUs no less than every five years; the ACA added the requirement that the HHS Secretary periodically identify physician services as being potentially misvalued, and make appropriate adjustments to the relative values of such services under the Medicare physician fee schedule.  In determining adjustments to RVUs used as the basis for calculating Medicare physician reimbursement under the fee schedule, the HHS Secretary has authority, under previously existing law and as augmented by the ACA, to adjust the number of RVUs for any service code to take into account changes in medical practice, coding changes, new data on relative value components, or the addition of new procedures.  Under the potentially misvalued codes authority, certain radiation therapy codes were identified as being potentially misvalued in 2015. However, because of concerns that the existing code set did not accurately reflect the radiation therapy treatments identified, CMS created several new codes during the transition toward an episodic alternative payment model.  Patient Access and Medicare Protection Act (PAMPA; P.L. 114-115 ), required CMS to apply the same code definitions, work RVUs, and direct inputs for the practice expense RVUs in CY2017 and CY2018 as applied in 2016 for these transition codes, effectively keeping the payments for these services unchanged, subject to the annual update factor. PAMPA exempted these radiation therapy and related imaging services from being considered as potentially misvalued services under CMS's misvalued codes initiative for CY2017 and CY2018. PAMPA also instructed the HHS Secretary to report to Congress on the development of an episodic alternative payment model under the Medicare program for radiation therapy services furnished in non-facility settings. BBA 2018 Section 51009, extended the restrictions through CY2019. The payment restrictions expired after December 31, 2019. Appendix A. Demonstration Projects and Pilot\u00c2\u00a0Programs This appendix lists selected health care-related demonstration projects and pilot programs that are scheduled to expire during the second session of the 116 th Congress (i.e., during calendar year [CY] 2020). The expiring demonstration projects and pilot programs listed below have portions of law that are time-limited and will lapse once a statutory deadline is reached, absent further legislative action. The expiring demonstration projects and pilot programs included here are those related to Medicare, Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and private health insurance programs and activities. This appendix also includes health care-related demonstration projects and pilot programs that were enacted in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 ) or extended in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act; P.L. 116-136 ). No relevant demonstration projects and pilot programs within the same scope expired during the first session of the 116 th Congress (i.e., during CY2019).  Although CRS has attempted to be comprehensive, it cannot guarantee that every relevant demonstration project and pilot program is included here.  Table A-1 lists the relevant demonstration projects and pilot programs that are scheduled to expire in 2020.  Appendix B. Provisions Included in the Previous CRS Health Care-Related Expiring Provisions\u00c2\u00a0Report This appendix provides information on the provisions that were included in the previous CRS report on health care-related expiring provisions (CRS Report R45781, Health Care-Related Expiring Provisions of the 116th Congress, First Session ) henceforth referred to as \"R45781,\" but were not detailed in the body of this report. As does the current report, R45781 included expiring provisions (of the same two types discussed herein) related to Medicare, Medicaid, State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and private health insurance programs and activities as well as selected other health care-related provisions. R45781 included health care-related provisions that were enacted in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 ) or, at the time of publication, had been extended under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018; P.L. 115-123 ). R45781 also described health care-related provisions that, at the time of publication, were set to expire during the first session of the 116 th Congress (i.e., during calendar year [CY] 2019) or had expired during the 115 th Congress (i.e., during CY2017 or CY2018). Some of the provisions detailed in R45781 fell within the scope of this report. Such provisions expired in CY2019 or were extended and are set to expire in CY2020. Table B-1 includes the provisions detailed in R45781 that remain expired or were extended to dates beyond the 116 th Congress (i.e., after CY2020). The third column in Table B-1 provides each provision's expiration date as it was in R45781. The fourth column reflects updated information, indicating whether the expiration date remains \"unchanged\" by law or providing the current expiration date for provisions extended pursuant to congressional modification.  Two private health insurance provisions were included in R45781 that did not meet the report criteria but were set to expire in 2019. These provisions modified fees and taxes established by the ACA to help fund ACA activities, including those related to private health insurance. As reflected in Table B-1, those fee and tax provisions were permanently repealed in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-94 ). Unlike the other provisions that were included in R45781 and were extended past CY2020, the extension for the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) was legislatively undertaken in a manner that resulted in significant revisions to the program and/or funding mechanisms detailed in R45781. Because of this, this appendix includes an updated provision summary below Table B-1. See, \"Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (IRC \u00c2\u00a79511 and \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a74375-4377, SSA \u00c2\u00a71183; 26 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a79511; 26 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a74375-4377; 42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a71320e-2).\" For more detailed background information on the other provisions included in Table B-1, see CRS Report R45781, Health Care-Related Expiring Provisions of the 116th Congress, First Session . Table B-1 does not include demonstration projects or pilot programs. The only project or program in Appendix A of R45781 that was not included in this report is the Demonstration Program to Increase Access to Dental Health Care Service. The demonstration program expired after March 23, 2017. Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (IRC \u00c2\u00a79511 and \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a74375-4377, SSA \u00c2\u00a71183; 26 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a79511; 26 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a74375-4377; 42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a71320e-2) Background SSA Section 1181 establishes the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), which is responsible for coordinating and supporting comparative clinical effectiveness research. PCORI has entered into contracts with federal agencies, as well as with academic and private sector research entities for both the management of funding and conduct of research. PHSA Section 937 requires the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to broadly disseminate research findings that are published by PCORI and other government-funded comparative effectiveness research entities.  IRC Section 9511 establishes the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund to support the activities of PCORI and to fund activities under PHSA Section 937. It provides annual funding to the PCORTF over the period FY2010-FY2019 from the following three sources: (1) annual appropriations, (2) fees on health insurance policies and self-insured plans, and (3) transfers from the Medicare HI and SMI Trust Funds. SSA Section 1183 provides for the transfer of the required funds from the Medicare Trust Funds. Transfers to PCORTF from the Medicare HI and SMI Trust Funds are calculated based on the number of individuals entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B. IRC Sections 4375-4377 impose the referenced fees on applicable health insurance policies and self-insured health plans and describe the method for their calculation.  For each of FY2011 through FY2019, IRC Section 9511 requires 80% of the PCORTF funds to be made available to PCORI, and the remaining 20% of funds to be transferred to the HHS Secretary for carrying out PHSA Section 937. Of the total amount transferred to HHS, 80% is to be distributed to AHRQ, with the remainder going to the Office of the Secretary (OS)/HHS. Relevant Legislation ACA, Section 6301 , provided the following amounts to the PCORTF: (1) $10 million for FY2010, (2) $50 million for FY2011, and (3) $150 million for each of FY2012 through FY2019. In addition, for each of FY2013 through FY2019, the section provided an amount equivalent to the net revenues from a new fee that the law imposed on health insurance policies and self-insured plans. For policy/plan years ending during FY2013, the fee equals $1 multiplied by the average number of covered lives. For policy/plan years ending during each subsequent fiscal year through FY2019, the fee equals $2 multiplied by the average number of covered lives. Finally, the section (in addition to ACA Section 6301(d)) provided for transfers to PCORTF from the Medicare Part A and Part B trust funds; these are generally calculated by multiplying the average number of individuals entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A, or enrolled in Medicare Part B, by $1 (for FY2013) or by $2 (for each of FY2014 through FY2019). Under this provision, PCORTF was to terminate on September 30, 2019. Continu ing Appropriations Act, 2020, and Health Extenders Act of 2019 ( P.L. 116-59 ), Section 1403 , extended the termination date of PCORTF through November 21, 2019. Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020, and Further Health Extenders Act of 2019 ( P.L. 116-69 ), Section 1403 , further extended the termination date of PCORTF through December 20, 2019. Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-94 ), Division N, Section 104 , extends funding for PCORTF through FY2029 by appropriating both the amount equivalent to the net revenues received from the fees on health insurance policies and self-insured plans and providing a direct appropriation in a specified amount (the \"applicable amount\") for each of fiscal years 2020 through 2029. The transfers from the Medicare HI and SMI Trust Funds were not extended. The section extends the termination date of PCTORF through FY2029; extends the termination dates of the fees on health insurance policies and self-insured plans through FY2029; and extends the requirement that 20% of PCORTF funds be transferred to the HHS Secretary for carrying out PHSA Section 937 for each fiscal year through FY2029. The section also makes modifications to the authorizing language for PCORI relating to the composition of its Board; appointments to its Methodology Committee; and the identification of research priorities, among others.  Current Status Appropriated funds to PCORTF expire after September 30, 2029. Funds transferred to the HHS Secretary under IRC Section 9511 remain available until expended. No amounts shall be available for expenditure from the PCORTF after September 30, 2029, and any amounts in the Trust Fund after such date shall be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury.
