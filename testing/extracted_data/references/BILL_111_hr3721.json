FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In enacting the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n        1967, Congress intended to eliminate discrimination against \n        individuals in the workplace based on age.\n            (2) In passing the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress \n        correctly recognized that unlawful discrimination is often \n        difficult to detect and prove because discriminators do not \n        usually admit their discrimination and often try to conceal \n        their true motives.\n            (3) Congress has relied on a long line of court cases \n        holding that language in the Age Discrimination in Employment \n        Act of 1967, and similar antidiscrimination and antiretaliation \n        laws, that is nearly identical to language in title VII of the \n        Civil Rights Act of 1964 would be interpreted consistently with \n        judicial interpretations of title VII of the Civil Rights Act \n        of 1964, including amendments made by the Civil Rights Act of \n        1991. The Supreme Court's decision in Gross v. FBL Financial \n        Services, Inc., 129 S. Ct. 2343 (2009), has eroded this long-\n        held understanding of consistent interpretation and \n        circumvented well-established precedents.\n            (4) The holding of the Supreme Court in Gross, by requiring \n        proof that age was the ``but for'' cause of employment \n        discrimination, has narrowed the scope of protection intended \n        to be afforded by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n        1967, thus eliminating protection for many individuals whom \n        Congress intended to protect.\n            (5) The Supreme Court's holding in Gross, relying on \n        misconceptions about the Age Discrimination in Employment Act \n        of 1967 articulated in prior decisions of the Court, has \n        significantly narrowed the broad scope of the protections of \n        the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.\n            (6) Unless Congress takes action, victims of age \n        discrimination will find it unduly difficult to prove their \n        claims and victims of other types of discrimination may find \n        their rights and remedies uncertain and unpredictable.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the \nstandard for proving unlawful disparate treatment under the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and other anti-discrimination \nand anti-retaliation laws is no different than the standard for making \nsuch a proof under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, including \namendments made by the Civil Rights Act of 1991.\n\nSEC. 3. STANDARD OF PROOF.\n\n    Section 4 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 \nU.S.C. 623) is amended by adding after subsection (f) the following:\n    ``(g)(1) For any claim brought under this Act or any other \nauthority described in paragraph (5), a plaintiff establishes an \nunlawful employment practice if the plaintiff demonstrates by a \npreponderance of the evidence that--\n            ``(A) an impermissible factor under that Act or authority \n        was a motivating factor for the practice complained of, even if \n        other factors also motivated that practice; or\n            ``(B) the practice complained of would not have occurred in \n        the absence of an impermissible factor.\n    ``(2) On a claim in which a plaintiff demonstrates a violation \nunder paragraph (1)(A) and a defendant demonstrates that the defendant \nwould have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible \nmotivating factor, the court--\n            ``(A) may grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief \n        (except as provided in subparagraph (B)), and attorney's fees \n        and costs demonstrated to be directly attributable only to the \n        pursuit of a claim under paragraph (1); and\n            ``(B) shall not award damages or issue an order requiring \n        any admission, reinstatement, hiring, promotion, or payment.\n    ``(3) In making the demonstration required by paragraph (1), a \nplaintiff may rely on any type or form of admissible circumstantial or \ndirect evidence and need only produce evidence sufficient for a \nreasonable trier of fact to conclude that a violation described in \nsubparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) occurred.\n    ``(4) Every method for proving either such violation, including the \nevidentiary framework set forth in McDonnell-Douglas Corp. v. Green, \n411 U.S. 792 (1973), shall be available to the plaintiff.\n    ``(5) This subsection shall apply to any claim that the practice \ncomplained of was motivated by a reason that is impermissible, with \nregard to that practice, under--\n            ``(A) this Act, including subsection (d);\n            ``(B) any Federal law forbidding employment discrimination;\n            ``(C) any law forbidding discrimination of the type \n        described in subsection (d) or forbidding other retaliation \n        against an individual for engaging in, or interference with, \n        any federally protected activity including the exercise of any \n        right established by Federal law (including a whistleblower \n        law); or\n            ``(D) any provision of the Constitution that protects \n        against discrimination or retaliation.\n    ``(6) This subsection shall not apply to a claim under a law \ndescribed in paragraph (5)(C) to the extent such law has an express \nprovision regarding the legal burdens of proof applicable to that \nclaim.\n    ``(7) In any proceeding, with respect to a claim described in \nparagraph (5), the plaintiff need not plead the existence of this \nsubsection.\n    ``(8) In this subsection, the term `demonstrates' means meet the \nburdens of production and persuasion.''.\n\nSEC. 4. APPLICATION.\n\n    This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall apply to all \nclaims described in section 4(g)(4) of the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 623(g)(4)) pending on or after June \n17, 2009."
