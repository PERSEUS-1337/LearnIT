FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) As a massive global network spanning not only State but \n        international borders, the Internet is inherently a matter of \n        interstate and foreign commerce within the jurisdiction of the \n        United States Congress under Article I, Section 8 of the United \n        States Constitution.\n            (2) Even within the United States, the Internet does not \n        respect State lines and operates independently of State \n        boundaries. Addresses on the Internet are designed to be \n        geographically indifferent. Internet transmissions are \n        insensitive to physical distance and can have multiple \n        geographical addresses.\n            (3) Because transmissions over the Internet are made \n        through packet-switching, it is impossible to determine with \n        any degree of certainty the precise geographic route or \n        endpoints of specific Internet transmissions, and infeasible to \n        separate intrastate from interstate, and domestic from foreign, \n        Internet transmissions.\n            (4) Inconsistent and unadministrable taxes imposed on \n        Internet activity by State and local governments threaten not \n        only to subject consumers, businesses, and other users engaged \n        in interstate and foreign commerce to multiple, confusing, and \n        burdensome taxation, but also to restrict the growth and \n        continued technological maturation of the Internet itself, and \n        to call into question the continued viability of this dynamic \n        medium.\n            (5) Because the tax laws and regulations of so many \n        jurisdictions were established before the Internet or \n        interactive computer services, their application to this new \n        medium in unintended and unpredictable ways threatens every \n        Internet user, access provider, vendor, and interactive \n        computer service provider.\n            (6) The electronic marketplace of services, products, and \n        ideas available through the Internet or interactive computer \n        services can be especially beneficial to senior citizens, the \n        physically challenged, citizens in rural areas, and small \n        businesses. It also offers a variety of uses and benefits for \n        educational institutions and charitable organizations.\n            (7) Consumers, businesses, and others engaging in \n        interstate and foreign commerce through the Internet or \n        interactive computer services could become subject to more than \n        30,000 separate taxing jurisdictions in the United States \n        alone.\n            (8) The consistent and coherent national policy regarding \n        taxation of Internet activity that is needed to avoid burdening \n        this evolving form of interstate and foreign commerce can best \n        be achieved by the United States exercising its authority under \n        Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the United States \n        Constitution.\n\nSEC. 3. MORATORIUM ON IMPOSITION OF TAXES ON INTERNET OR INTERACTIVE \n              COMPUTER SERVICES.\n\n    (a) Moratorium.--Except as otherwise provided in this section, no \nState or local government (including any political subdivision) may \nimpose, assess, or attempt to collect any tax or fee directly or \nindirectly on--\n            (1) the Internet or interactive computer services; or\n            (2) the use of the Internet or interactive computer \n        services.\n    (b) Preservation of State and Local Taxing Authority.--Subsection \n(a)--\n            (1) does not apply to taxes imposed on and measured by net \n        income derived from the Internet or interactive computer \n        services;\n            (2) does not apply to fairly apportioned business license \n        taxes applied to businesses that have a business location in \n        the taxing jurisdiction, and\n            (3) does not affect the authority of a State, or political \n        subdivision thereof, to impose a sales or use tax on sales or \n        other transactions effected by use of the Internet or \n        interactive computer services if--\n                    (A) the tax is the same as the tax imposed and \n                collected by that State, or political subdivision \n                thereof, on sales or interstate transactions effected \n                by mail order, telephone, or other remote means within \n                its taxing jurisdiction; and\n                    (B) the obligation to collect the tax from sales or \n                other transactions effected by use of the Internet or \n                interactive computer services is imposed on the same \n                person or entity as in the case of sales or \n                transactions effected by mail order, telephone, or \n                other remote means.\n\nSEC. 4.
