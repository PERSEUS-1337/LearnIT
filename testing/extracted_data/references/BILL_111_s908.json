FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The illicit nuclear activities of the Government of \n        Iran represent a serious threat to the security of the United \n        States and our allies in Europe, the Middle East, and around \n        the world.\n            (2) The United States and the international community have \n        a vital interest in working together to prevent the Government \n        of Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.\n            (3) The international community, acting through the \n        International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations, has \n        already adopted a range of sanctions designed to encourage the \n        Government of Iran to cease its unlawful nuclear activities and \n        comply with its obligations under the Treaty on Non-\n        Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (commonly known as the \n        ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'').\n            (4) As a presidential candidate, then-Senator Obama stated \n        that additional sanctions, especially those targeting Iran's \n        dependence on imported refined petroleum, may help to persuade \n        the Government of Iran to abandon its illicit nuclear \n        activities.\n            (5) On October 7, 2008, then-Senator Obama stated, ``Iran \n        right now imports gasoline, even though it's an oil producer, \n        because its oil infrastructure has broken down. If we can \n        prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the \n        refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-\n        benefit analysis. That starts putting the squeeze on them.''.\n            (6) On June 4, 2008, then-Senator Obama stated, ``We should \n        work with Europe, Japan, and the Gulf states to find every \n        avenue outside the UN to isolate the Iranian regime--from \n        cutting off loan guarantees and expanding financial sanctions, \n        to banning the export of refined petroleum to Iran.''.\n            (7) Our allies in the international community have \n        expressed support for additional sanctions should the \n        Government of Iran fail to verifiably suspend its illicit \n        nuclear activities.\n            (8) On March 17, 2009, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown \n        stated, ``[L]et me be equally clear that Iran's current nuclear \n        program is unacceptable. Iran has concealed nuclear activities, \n        refused to cooperate with the IAEA, and flouted UN Security \n        Council Resolutions. Its refusal to play by the rules leads us \n        to view its nuclear program as a critical proliferation threat. \n        Iran therefore faces a clear choice--continue in this way and \n        face further and tougher sanctions, or change to a UN overseen \n        civil nuclear energy program that will bring the greatest \n        benefits to its citizens.''.\n            (9) On February 7, 2009, British Foreign Secretary David \n        Miliband stated, ``We welcome US willingness to talk to Iran. \n        But if Iran doesn't respond we will need to be ready to impose \n        much tougher sanctions, even if that imposes costs on us here \n        in Europe. In this instance, nuclear security must come above \n        commercial interests.''.\n            (10) On February 7, 2009, German Chancellor Angela Merkel \n        stated, ``Let me be quite clear. We have offered to enter into \n        negotiations with Iran and we want a diplomatic solution. These \n        offers are on the table. . . . We're prepared to travel along \n        this road together, but we are also prepared to consider \n        tougher sanctions should there be no progress. It's imperative \n        that we prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.''.\n            (11) On June 23, 2008, French President Nicolas Sarkozy \n        stated, ``So that things are clear and there is no ambiguity, I \n        want to say that Iran's military nuclear program demands an \n        extremely firm response by the entire international community. \n        . . . France is determined to pursue with her partners a policy \n        of increasingly tough sanctions until there is a shift in \n        position.''.\n            (12) The serious and urgent nature of the threat from Iran \n        demands that the United States work together with our allies to \n        do everything possible--diplomatically, politically, and \n        economically--to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons \n        capability.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) the United States should continue to support diplomatic \n        efforts in the International Atomic Energy Agency and the \n        United Nations Security Council to end Iran's illicit nuclear \n        activities;\n            (2) diplomatic efforts with Iran are more likely to be \n        effective if the President is empowered with the explicit \n        authority to impose additional sanctions on the Government of \n        Iran;\n            (3) it should be the policy of the United States to \n        encourage foreign governments to direct state-owned entities to \n        cease all investment in, and support of, Iran's energy sector \n        and all exports of refined petroleum products to Iran;\n            (4) it should be the policy of the United States to \n        encourage foreign governments to require private entities based \n        in their territories to cease all investment in, and support \n        of, Iran's energy sector and all exports of refined petroleum \n        products to Iran;\n            (5) the President is urged to impose sanctions on the \n        Central Bank of Iran and any other Iranian bank or financial \n        institution engaged in proliferation activities or support of \n        terrorist groups;\n            (6) the Department of the Treasury should continue to work \n        with our allies to take appropriate measures to protect the \n        international financial system from deceptive and illicit \n        practices by Iranian banks and financial institutions involved \n        in proliferation activities or support of terrorist groups;\n            (7) the concerns of the United States regarding Iran are \n        strictly the result of the actions of the Government of Iran; \n        and\n            (8) the people of the United States--\n                    (A) have feelings of friendship for the people of \n                Iran;\n                    (B) regret that developments in recent decades have \n                created impediments to that friendship; and\n                    (C) hold the people of Iran, their culture, and \n                their ancient and rich history in the highest esteem.\n\nSEC. 3.
