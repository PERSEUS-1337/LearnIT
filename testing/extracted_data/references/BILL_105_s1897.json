FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Billing practices by telecommunications carriers may \n        not reflect accurately the cost or basis of the additional \n        telecommunications services and benefits that consumers receive \n        as a result of the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of \n        1996 (Public Law 104-104) and other Federal regulatory actions \n        taken since the enactment of that Act.\n            (2) Congress has never enacted a law with the intent of \n        permitting providers of telecommunications services to \n        misrepresent to customers the costs of providing services or \n        the services provided.\n            (3) Certain providers of telecommunications services have \n        established new, specific charges on customer bills commonly \n        known as ``line-item charges''.\n            (4) Certain providers of telecommunications services have \n        described such charges as ``Federal Universal Service Fees'' or \n        similar fees.\n            (5) Such charges have generated significant confusion among \n        customers regarding the nature of and scope of universal \n        service and of the fees associated with universal service.\n            (6) The State of New York is considering action to protect \n        consumers by requiring telecommunications carriers to disclose \n        fully in the bills of all classes of customers the fee \n        increases and fee reductions resulting from the enactment of \n        the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other regulatory actions \n        taken since the enactment of that Act.\n            (7) The National Association of Regulatory Utility \n        Commissioners adopted a resolution in February 1998 supporting \n        action by the Federal Communications Commission to require \n        interstate carriers to provide accurate customer notice \n        regarding the implementation and purpose of end user charges.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to require the Federal \nCommunications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to protect \nconsumers of telecommunications services by assuring accurate cost \nreporting and billing practices by telecommunications carriers \nnationwide.\n\nSEC. 2.
