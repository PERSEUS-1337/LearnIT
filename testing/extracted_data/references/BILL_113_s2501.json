FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Eliminating avoidable hospital readmissions should be a \n        core tenet of public and private efforts to improve quality of \n        care and reduce health care expenditures.\n            (2) Measures adopted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \n        Services should accurately reflect the quality of care provided \n        by specific hospitals and providers, and such measures should \n        never lower outcome or quality expectations for certain cohorts \n        of hospitals and providers.\n            (3) There are numerous socioeconomic conditions that impact \n        health outcomes and the Medicare hospital readmission reduction \n        program is one of many Federal outcome performance programs \n        that fails to accurately adjust for these influences.\n            (4) Holding all other factors constant, socioeconomic \n        conditions, such as poverty, low levels of literacy, limited \n        English proficiency, minimal social support, poor living \n        conditions, and limited community resources, likely have direct \n        and significant impacts on avoidable hospital readmissions.\n            (5) The Medicare hospital readmission reduction program \n        includes risk adjustment for clinical variables, such as \n        comorbidity and severity of illness, because hospitals should \n        not be penalized for the effects of these uncontrollable \n        factors. Socioeconomic factors can influence readmissions to an \n        equal or greater degree than these clinical factors and the \n        Medicare hospital readmissions reduction program will more \n        accurately measure quality of care once risk adjustment for \n        socioeconomic status is implemented.\n            (6) Research by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, \n        the National Quality Forum, and other independent experts has \n        provided compelling evidence that failing to adjust for \n        socioeconomic status in the Medicare hospital readmission \n        reduction program may provide an inaccurate picture of the \n        quality of care provided by hospitals, and has led to the \n        unfair penalization and stigmatization of hospitals serving \n        low-income populations that are, in fact, delivering high-\n        quality health care.\n            (7) Risk adjustment for socioeconomic status in the \n        Medicare hospital readmission reduction program will improve \n        quality of care, increase accountability for all inpatient \n        hospitals serving Medicare beneficiaries, and further reduce \n        preventable readmissions nationwide.\n            (8) The Secretary of Health and Human Services should \n        consider the adoption of socioeconomic adjustment methodologies \n        in other quality reporting and pay-for-performance programs \n        under the Medicare program.\n\nSEC. 3.
