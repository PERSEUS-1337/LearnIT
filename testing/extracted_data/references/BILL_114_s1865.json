FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Risk of death among individuals with anorexia nervosa \n        is 18 times greater than among individuals of the same age \n        without anorexia. It is estimated that at least one person dies \n        every 62 minutes from an eating disorder: at least 23 persons \n        each day.\n            (2) Health consequences such as osteoporosis (brittle \n        bones), gastrointestinal complications, cardiac, and dental \n        problems are significant health and financial burdens \n        throughout life.\n            (3) At lowest estimate, 14,500,000 people in the United \n        States suffer from eating disorders. One percent of adolescent \n        boys and 2 percent of adolescent girls suffer from eating \n        disorders. Eating disorders account for at least 4 percent of \n        all childhood hospitalizations.\n            (4) Eating disorders are treatable biopsychosocial \n        illnesses. There is a high rate of comorbidity with other \n        illnesses such as depression, substance abuse, or anxiety \n        disorders.\n            (5) Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by \n        self-starvation, weight loss, fear of gaining weight, and \n        disturbances in the way in which one's body weight or shape is \n        experienced.\n            (6) Anorexia nervosa is associated with serious health \n        consequences including heart failure, kidney failure, \n        osteoporosis, and death. People who suffer anorexia nervosa are \n        57 times more likely to die of suicide than their peers.\n            (7) Current estimates of the lifetime prevalence of bulimia \n        nervosa are between 0.9 and 1.5 percent among women and between \n        0.1 and 0.5 percent among men.\n            (8) Bulimia nervosa is associated with serious health \n        consequences, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, and dental \n        problems including irregular heartbeats, gastric rupture, \n        peptic ulcer, tooth decay, and death.\n            (9) Binge eating disorder is characterized by frequent \n        episodes of uncontrolled overeating. Binge eating disorder is \n        common: at lowest estimate, 3.5 percent of women in the United \n        States and 2.0 percent of men in the United States will suffer \n        from this disorder in their lifetimes.\n            (10) Binge eating is often associated with obesity, high \n        blood pressure, elevated cholesterol levels, elevated \n        triglyceride levels, increased risk of bowel, breast, and \n        reproductive cancers, increased risk of diabetes, and increased \n        risk of arthritic damage to the joints.\n            (11) Many suffer from some, but not all, of the symptoms of \n        anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge eating disorder, \n        which is referred to as other specified feeding or eating \n        disorder or ``OSFED''. Between 4 percent and 20 percent of \n        young women practice unhealthy patterns of dieting, purging, \n        and binge eating.\n            (12) Eating disorders are more common in women, but they do \n        occur in men. Rates of binge eating disorder are similar in \n        females and males.\n            (13) Academic evidence has demonstrated a connection \n        between the use of very thin models in advertising and consumer \n        attitudes toward a brand based on such advertising, as well as \n        a material influence of the use of such models on consumer \n        purchase intent, conduct, and reliance.\n            (14) Eating disorders appear across all age groups, races, \n        ethnicities, and socioeconomic groups in the United States and \n        are associated with substantial psychological problems, \n        including depression, substance abuse, and suicide. For \n        children 12 years of age and younger, hospitalizations for \n        eating disorders increased by 119 percent between 1999 and \n        2006.\n\nSEC. 4.
