FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There has been a substantial increase in poverty within \n        the United States during the past five years. The greatest \n        concentration of poverty exists in large metropolitan areas.\n            (2) The plight of the poor in New Orleans, Louisiana, as \n        revealed during the Katrina hurricane and the flood it caused \n        poses a considerable threat to health and life and creates \n        conditions that foster a total breakdown of civil society.\n            (3) The rescue and survival effort during the Katrina \n        disaster was greatly impeded by the lack of engagement and \n        contact with institutions and procedures of the mainstream \n        world.\n            (4) The lack of employment is at the center of problems \n        impacting on the poor and the primary antidote to alleviation \n        would be jobs.\n            (5) Within the Community Service Agency (CSA) there is a \n        structure in place presently capable of rapidly implementing \n        programs geared to help the poor. Through this Act, in \n        alignment with the Community Services Block Grant's purpose to \n        provide members of the community with meaningful employment, \n        low-income residents of metropolitan areas can be engaged in a \n        beneficially meaningful way while providing a vital service to \n        their communities.\n            (6) The structure established to implement the Faith Based \n        Initiative project is also immediately adoptable for the \n        implementation of programs to employ, train, counsel and place \n        low-income residents in permanent jobs.\n            (7) The shamefully slow pace of disaster recovery in New \n        Orleans and the Gulf Coast area demonstrates a need for \n        emergency action by the Congress.\n            (8) Circumstances require the launching of pilot projects \n        in Katrina-ravaged New Orleans and at least nine other at-risk \n        cities where recently released surveys and studies have shown \n        significant increases in poverty.\n\nSEC. 3. HOMELAND SECURITY COMMUNITY MOBILIZATION PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Program.--There is hereby established the \nHomeland Security Community Mobilization Program (hereafter in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Program'', which shall be administered under the \nauthority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (hereafter in \nthis Act referred to as the ``Secretary'').\n    (b) Pilot Projects.--To implement the Program, the Secretary may \nmake grants to local entities in 10 metropolitan areas (including the \ncity of New Orleans, Louisiana) to carry out pilot projects that--\n            (1) provide emergency response training to low-income \n        adults and youth to prepare them to provide emergency \n        assistance in metropolitan areas during disasters (These \n        individuals will provide neighborhood response to natural \n        disasters and terrorist attacks and shall be trained to work as \n        Neighborhood Emergency Response Operators.),\n            (2) provide job training and financial assistance to \n        families with children in school.

Participants shall be trained \n        to work as Informed Parent Program Specialists.),\n            (3) provide community education and school support \n        (Programs shall be established that organize parents and \n        volunteers to assist schools in such areas as school safety, \n        student discipline, after-school and weekend extracurricular \n        activities, physical education and sports activities, and \n        assistance with truant and delinquent children. Entry level job \n        training shall be developed for School Community \n        Coordinators.),\n            (4) provide juvenile delinquency prevention programs and \n        youth counseling (Programs shall be established which focus on \n        at-risk youth and are geared primarily to youth with identified \n        problems.

Individuals shall be trained \n        to work as Young Community Leader Trainees.), and\n            (6) provide family health care information and solutions \n        (Programs shall be established to train citizens to monitor \n        areas of potential terrorist attacks and low-level germ warfare \n        and to be first responders to such situations.
