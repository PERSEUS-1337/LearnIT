FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) in August 1776, the fortifications at Governors Island, \n        New York, provided cover allowing George Washington's \n        Continental Army to escape a British onslaught during the \n        Battle of Long Island;\n            (2) the State of New York, for nominal consideration, ceded \n        control of Governors Island to the Federal Government in 1800 \n        to provide for the defense of the United States;\n            (3) during the War of 1812, the combined firepower of \n        Castle Williams on Governors Island and the Southwest Battery \n        in Manhattan dissuaded the British from making a direct attack \n        on New York City, which was the largest city in and principal \n        seaport of the United States at the time;\n            (4) in 1901, 4,700,000 cubic yards of fill from the \n        excavation of the Lexington Avenue Subway in Manhattan were \n        deposited to increase the area of Governors Island from 90 to \n        172 acres;\n            (5) Governors Island played a significant role in the Civil \n        War, World War I, and World War II, and continued to serve the \n        United States Army through 1966;\n            (6) in 1958, the United States District Court for the \n        Southern District of New York formally ratified the long \n        possession of Governors Island by the United States through a \n        condemnation proceeding that required ``just compensation'' of \n        $1;\n            (7) in 1966, the Army relocated operations from Governors \n        Island, and the United States Coast Guard assumed control of \n        the Island, an action that established an integral component of \n        the Atlantic coast efforts of the Coast Guard for the following \n        30 years;\n            (8) the Admiral's House on Governors Island hosted the \n        final summit meeting between President Ronald W. Reagan and \n        Soviet Premier Mikhail S. Gorbachev in December 1988, where the \n        leaders presented each other with the Articles of Ratification \n        for the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty;\n            (9) the Coast Guard ceased operations at Governors Island \n        in 1997, leaving 225 buildings unoccupied, unused, and exposed \n        to the harsh elements of New York Harbor;\n            (10) Castle Williams is named after Lieutenant Colonel \n        Jonathan Williams, who built the semi-circular ``cheesebox'' \n        fort and later served as the first superintendent of West Point \n        Military Academy;\n            (11) the pentagonal Fort Jay, named after John Jay, is the \n        complement of Fort Wood on nearby Bedloe Island, which serves \n        as the base of the Statue of Liberty;\n            (12) Castle Williams and Fort Jay, located within the \n        Governors Island National Historic Landmark District, and more \n        than 200 years of contributions to the history of the United \n        States could be lost if Governors Island were to remain vacant \n        or be sold to a private entity;\n            (13) Castle Williams and Fort Jay, key elements of the \n        Governors Island National Historic Landmark District, are \n        worthy of continued Federal protection and should be designated \n        a unit of the National Park System; and\n            (14) the State of New York and the city of New York have \n        agreed to a plan to be administered by the Governors Island \n        Redevelopment Corporation, a subsidiary of the Empire State \n        Development Corporation, that--\n                    (A) offers what may be the only opportunity to \n                ensure--\n                            (i) public access to Governors Island;\n                            (ii) the preservation and protection of \n                        historic structures on Governors Island for \n                        future generations; and\n                            (iii) the ability of local elected \n                        officials, local community boards, and \n                        community organizations to participate in the \n                        redevelopment of Governors Island; and\n                    (B) would provide substantial educational and \n                recreational facilities to the public.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to prevent the deterioration of the historic military \n        buildings on Governors Island in New York Harbor;\n            (2) to ensure that Castle Williams and Fort Jay are--\n                    (A) retained in Federal ownership;\n                    (B) available for the benefit and inspiration of \n                the people of the United States; and\n                    (C) afforded protection by the National Park \n                Service as a unit of the National Park System;\n            (3) to provide the general public with--\n                    (A) access to Governors Island;\n                    (B) access to open park space to experience the \n                majestic views of New York Harbor; and\n                    (C) opportunities that illustrate the significant \n                contributions of Governors Island to the history of the \n                United States; and\n            (4) to return to the people of the State of New York \n        property that the State of New York conveyed to the Federal \n        Government, for nominal consideration, to provide for the \n        defense of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
