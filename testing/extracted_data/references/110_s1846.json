FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Close and continuing cooperation in defense between the \n        United States and the Republic of Korea continues to be in the \n        national security interest of the United States.\n            (2) The Republic of Korea was designated a Major Non-NATO \n        Ally in 1987, the first such designation.\n            (3) The Republic of Korea has been a major purchaser of \n        United States defense articles and services through the Foreign \n        Military Sales (FMS) program, totaling $6,900,000,000 in \n        deliveries over the last 10 years.\n            (4) Purchases of United States defense articles, services, \n        and major defense equipment facilitate and increase the \n        interoperability of Republic of Korea military forces with \n        United States military forces.\n            (5) Congress has previously enacted important, special \n        defense cooperation arrangements for the Republic of Korea, as \n        in the Act entitled ``An Act to authorize the transfer of items \n        in the War Reserves Stockpile for Allies, Korea'', approved \n        December 30, 2005 (Public Law 109-159), which authorized the \n        President, notwithstanding section 514 of the Foreign \n        Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2321h), to transfer to the \n        Republic of Korea certain defense items to be included in a war \n        reserve stockpile for that country.\n            (6) Such actions by Congress and sales to the Republic of \n        Korea enhance defense ties with that country and ensure \n        favorable consideration by the Government of the Republic of \n        Korea when it considers acquisitions of certain weapons \n        systems.\n            (7) Enhanced support for defense cooperation with the \n        Republic of Korea is important to the national security of the \n        United States, including through creation of a status in law \n        for the Republic of Korea similar to the countries in the North \n        Atlantic Treaty Organization, Japan, Australia, and New \n        Zealand, with respect to consideration by Congress of foreign \n        military sales to the Republic of Korea.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that expeditious consideration of \ncertifications of letters of offer to sell defense articles, defense \nservices, design and construction services, and major defense equipment \nto the Republic of Korea under section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control \nAct (22 U.S.C. 2776(b)) is fully consistent with United States security \nand foreign policy interests and the objectives of world peace and \nsecurity.\n\nSEC. 4.
