FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Investments in infrastructure create jobs while \n        fulfilling critical needs in communities throughout the United \n        States.\n            (2) According to the Brookings Institution, nearly 14.5 \n        million workers--11 percent of the U.S. workforce--were \n        employed in infrastructure jobs in 2013.\n            (3) According to data from the Brookings Institution, \n        infrastructure occupations often provide more competitive and \n        equitable wages in comparison to all jobs nationally, \n        consistently paying up to 30 percent more to low-income workers \n        over the past decade.\n            (4) The American Society of Civil Engineers gave the \n        infrastructure of the United States an overall grade of ``D+'' \n        in 2017 and estimated that the United States will need to \n        invest $4.59 trillion by 2025 in order to improve the condition \n        of the Nation's infrastructure and bring it to a state of good \n        repair.\n            (5) The American Society of Civil Engineers assigned a \n        ``D'' grade to the Nation's roads, a ``C+'' grade to the \n        Nation's bridges, and a ``D-'' grade to the Nation's transit \n        systems and estimated that the United States will need to \n        invest $2.04 trillion by 2025 to bring the Nation's surface \n        transportation infrastructure to a state of good repair.\n            (6) TIGER, formally known as the Transportation Investment \n        Generating Economic Recovery grant program, is a nationwide \n        competitive grant program that creates jobs by funding \n        investments in transportation infrastructure by States, local \n        governments, and transit agencies.\n            (7) TIGER funds projects that will have a significant \n        impact on the Nation, a metropolitan area, or a region.\n            (8) In distributing grants under TIGER, the Secretary of \n        Transportation is required to ensure an equitable geographic \n        distribution of funds, a balance in addressing the needs of \n        urban and rural areas, and investments in a variety of modes of \n        transportation.\n            (9) TIGER received an appropriation of $600,000,000 in \n        fiscal year 2014, an appropriation of $500,000,000 in fiscal \n        year 2015, and an appropriation of $500,000,000 in fiscal year \n        2016.\n            (10) Past appropriations for TIGER are not sufficient to \n        address the need for investments in transportation \n        infrastructure in communities throughout the United States as \n        the amounts only fund a small fraction of the transportation \n        infrastructure projects for which TIGER grant applications have \n        been received.\n            (11) Appropriating $7.5 billion in fiscal year 2017 for \n        TIGER and allowing the funds to remain available for 6 years \n        will enable the Secretary of Transportation to begin \n        immediately to expand investments in transportation \n        infrastucture throughout the United States.\n            (12) Restricting appropriations for TIGER through the use \n        of arbitrary budget caps or sequestration undermines economic \n        recovery and job creation efforts; disrupts planning by States, \n        local governments, and transit agencies; and leaves critical \n        infrastructure needs unmet.\n            (13) Emergency supplemental appropriations for TIGER, \n        provided in addition to other appropriations and not subject to \n        sequestration, will improve transportation infrastructure and \n        create jobs throughout the United States without reducing \n        funding for other domestic priorities.\n            (14) An emergency supplemental appropriation of $7.5 \n        billion for TIGER to be made available in fiscal year 2017 and \n        to remain available for 6 years will allow the Secretary of \n        Transportation to begin immediately to organize new \n        competitions for TIGER grants and allow States, local \n        governments, and transit agencies to prepare grant \n        applications, thus ensuring an efficient use of funds and \n        timely job creation.\n\nSEC. 3. SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR TIGER DISCRETIONARY GRANT \n              PROGRAM.\n\n    The following sums are appropriated, out of any money in the \nTreasury not otherwise appropriated, for fiscal year 2017:\n\n                      DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION\n\n                        Office of the Secretary\n\n                  national infrastructure investments\n\n    For an additional amount for ``National Infrastructure \nInvestments'' in accordance with the provisions under this heading in \ntitle I of division K of Public Law 115-31, $7,500,000,000, to remain \navailable through September 30, 2022: Provided, That the amount under \nthis heading is designated by the Congress as an emergency requirement \npursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \nDeficit Control Act of 1985, except that such amount shall be available \nonly if the President subsequently so designates such amount and \ntransmits such designation to the Congress.\n\nSEC. 4. EXEMPTION FROM SEQUESTRATION.\n\n    The appropriation in section 3 shall be exempt from sequestration \nunder the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985."
