    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Kosova Peace, Democracy, and Human \nRights Act of 1995''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of \n        Yugoslavia, adopted in 1946, and the amended Constitution of \n        Yugoslavia, adopted in 1974, described the status of Kosova as \n        one of the eight constituent territorial units of the Yugoslav \n        Federation.\n            (2) The political rights of the Albanian majority in Kosova \n        were curtailed when the Government of Yugoslavia illegally \n        amended the Constitution of Yugoslavia without the consent of \n        the people of Kosova on March 23, 1989, revoking the autonomous \n        status of Kosova.\n            (3) In 1990, the Parliament and Government of Kosova were \n        abolished by further unlawful amendments to the Constitution of \n        Yugoslavia.\n            (4) In September 1990, a referendum on the question of \n        independence for Kosova was held in which 87 percent of those \n        eligible to participate voted and 99 percent of those voting \n        supported independence for Kosova.\n            (5) In May 1992, a Kosovar national parliament was elected \n        and Dr. Ibrahim Rugova was overwhelmingly elected President of \n        the Republic of Kosova.\n            (6) The Parliament and Government of Kosova were not \n        permitted to assemble in Kosova.\n            (7) Credible reports of Serbian ``ethnic cleansing'' in \n        Kosova have been received by the United Nations Special \n        Rapporteur on Human Rights, and in January 1995, Serbia \n        announced a new policy to colonize Albanian land in Kosova.\n            (8) Over 100,000 ethnic Albanians in government, police, \n        the judiciary, enterprises, media, educational institutions, \n        and hospitals of Kosova have been removed from their jobs and \n        replaced by Serbians.\n            (9) The government in Belgrade has severely restricted the \n        access of ethnic Albanians in Kosova to all levels of \n        education, especially education in the Albanian language, \n        solely on the basis of their ethnicity.\n            (10) Reports of arrests and brutal beatings by the mostly \n        Serbian police, sometimes leading to the death of ethnic \n        Albanians in Kosova for expressing views in opposition to \n        Serbian authorities, are received almost daily.\n            (11) Observers of the Organization on Security and \n        Cooperation in Europe dispatched to Kosova in 1991 were \n        expelled by the government in Belgrade in July 1993.\n            (12) The Government of Serbia has ignored United Nations \n        Security Council Resolution 855 of August 1993, which calls \n        upon Belgrade to allow the continuation of the mission of the \n        Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe and to \n        guarantee the safety of and unimpeded access for monitors of \n        the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n            (13) Following the departure of such observers, several \n        international human rights organizations, including Amnesty \n        International, Human Rights Watch-Helsinki, and the Helsinki \n        Federation for Human Rights have documented an increase in \n        humanitarian abuses in Kosova.\n            (14) Congress provided for the opening of a United States \n        Information Agency cultural center in Prishtina, Kosova, in \n        section 223 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal \n        Years 1992 and 1993, but the Department of State has asserted \n        that security conditions have prevented the establishment of \n        such center.\n            (15) The President has explicitly warned the Government of \n        Serbia that the United States is prepared to respond in the \n        event of escalated conflict in Kosova caused by Serbia.\n            (16) On January 4, 1994, President Clinton stated, ``there \n        are a large number of issues, including Kosova, that I believe \n        must be addressed before Belgrade should be freed of United \n        Nations sanctions and able to return to the international \n        community. . . . As before, our decision of whether to support \n        suspension of any sanctions will be made in close consultation \n        with Congress.''.\n            (17) On February 15, 1994, President Clinton announced, \n        without prior consultation with the Congress, a set of \n        conditions, not including improvements in Kosova, which, if met \n        by Serbia and Montenegro, would result in the lifting of \n        international sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States that--\n            (1) the situation in Kosova must be resolved before \n        Belgrade is freed of international sanctions and is able to \n        return to the international community;\n            (2) the right of the people of Kosova to govern themselves \n        and to establish a separate identity for Kosova must not be \n        denied;\n            (3) international observers should be returned to Kosova;\n            (4) the elected Government of Kosova should be permitted to \n        meet and exercise its legitimate mandate as elected \n        representatives of the people of Kosova;\n            (5) all individuals whose employment was terminated on the \n        basis of their ethnicity should be reinstated to their previous \n        positions; and\n            (6) the education system in Kosova should be reopened to \n        all residents of Kosova regardless of ethnicity and the \n        majority ethnic Albanian population should be allowed to \n        educate its youth in its native tongue.\n\nSEC. 4.
