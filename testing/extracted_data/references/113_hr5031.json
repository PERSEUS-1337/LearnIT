DEFINITION OF STEM EDUCATION.\n\n    For purposes of carrying out STEM education activities at the \nNational Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, and the Environmental Protection Agency, the term ``STEM \neducation'' means education in the subjects of science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics, including other academic subjects that \nbuild on these disciplines such as computer science.\n\nSEC. 3. INFORMAL STEM EDUCATION.\n\n    (a) Grants.--The Director of the National Science Foundation, \nthrough the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, shall \ncontinue to award competitive, merit-reviewed grants to support--\n            (1) research and development of innovative out-of-school \n        STEM learning and emerging STEM learning environments in order \n        to improve STEM learning outcomes and engagement in STEM; and\n            (2) research that advances the field of informal STEM \n        education.\n    (b) Uses of Funds.--Activities supported by grants under this \nsection may encompass a single STEM discipline, multiple STEM \ndisciplines, or integrative STEM initiatives and shall include--\n            (1) research and development that improves our \n        understanding of learning and engagement in informal \n        environments, including the role of informal environments in \n        broadening participation in STEM; and\n            (2) design and testing of innovative STEM learning models, \n        programs, and other resources for informal learning \n        environments to improve STEM learning outcomes and increase \n        engagement for K-12 students, K-12 teachers, and the general \n        public, including design and testing of the scalability of \n        models, programs, and other resources.\n\nSEC. 4. NOYCE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM AMENDMENTS.\n\n    (a) Amendments.--Section 10A of the National Science Foundation \nAuthorization Act of 2002 (42 U.S.C. 1862n-1a) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)(2)(B), by inserting ``or bachelor's'' \n        after ``master's'';\n            (2) in subsection (c)--\n                    (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph \n                (2)(B);\n                    (B) in paragraph (3)--\n                            (i) by inserting ``for teachers with \n                        master's degrees in their field'' after \n                        ``Teaching Fellowships''; and\n                            (ii) by striking the period at the end of \n                        subparagraph (B) and inserting ``; and''; and\n                    (C) by adding at the end the following new \n                paragraph:\n            ``(4) in the case of National Science Foundation Master \n        Teaching Fellowships for teachers with bachelor's degrees in \n        their field and working toward a master's degree--\n                    ``(A) offering academic courses leading to a \n                master's degree and leadership training to prepare \n                individuals to become master teachers in elementary and \n                secondary schools; and\n                    ``(B) offering programs both during and after \n                matriculation in the program for which the fellowship \n                is received to enable fellows to become highly \n                effective mathematics and science teachers, including \n                mentoring, training, induction, and professional \n                development activities, to fulfill the service \n                requirements of this section, including the \n                requirements of subsection (e), and to exchange ideas \n                with others in their fields.'';\n            (3) in subsection (e), by striking ``subsection (g)'' and \n        inserting ``subsection (h)'';\n            (4) by redesignating subsections (g) through (i) as \n        subsections (h) through (j), respectively; and\n            (5) by inserting after subsection (f) the following new \n        subsection:\n    ``(g) Support for Master Teaching Fellows While Enrolled in a \nMaster's Degree Program.--A National Science Foundation Master Teacher \nFellow may receive a maximum of 1 year of fellowship support while \nenrolled in a master's degree program as described in subsection \n(c)(4)(A), except that if such fellow is enrolled in a part-time \nprogram, such amount shall be prorated according to the length of the \nprogram.''.\n    (b) Definition.--Section 10(i)(5) of the National Science \nFoundation Authorization Act of 2002 (42 U.S.C. 1862n-1(i)(5)) is \namended by inserting ``computer science,'' after ``means a science,''.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives July 14, 2014.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                 KAREN L.
