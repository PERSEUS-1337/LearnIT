FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that:\n            (1) Since the creation of low-power television licenses by \n        the Federal Communications Commission, a number of license \n        holders have operated their stations in a manner beneficial to \n        the public good providing broadcasting to their communities \n        that would not otherwise be available.\n            (2) These low-power broadcasters have operated their \n        stations in a manner consistent with the programming objectives \n        and hours of operation of full-power broadcasters providing \n        worthwhile services to their respective communities while under \n        severe license limitations compared to their full-power \n        counterparts.\n            (3) License limitations, particularly the temporary nature \n        of the license, have blocked many low-power broadcasters from \n        having access to capital, and have severely hampered their \n        ability to continue to provide quality broadcasting, \n        programming, or improvements.\n            (4) The passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 has \n        added to the uncertainty of the future status of these stations \n        by the lack of specific provisions regarding the permanency of \n        their licenses, or their treatment during the transition to \n        high definition, digital television.\n            (5) It is in the public interest to promote diversity in \n        television programming formats by encouraging low power \n        television stations that serve foreign language communities. \n        These communities should not lose their access to foreign \n        language programming as a result of the transition to digital \n        television.\n\nSEC. 3. PRESERVATION OF LOW-POWER COMMUNITY TELEVISION BROADCASTING.\n\n    (a) Section 336 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 336) \nis amended:\n            (1) by redesignating subsections (f) and (g) as subsections \n        (g) and (h), respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after subsection (e) the following new \n        subsection:\n    ``(f) Preservation of Low-Power Community Television \nBroadcasting.--\n            ``(1) Creation of class a licenses.--Within 120 days after \n        the date of enactment of the Community Broadcasters Protection \n        Act of 1999, the Commission shall prescribe regulations to \n        establish a class A television license to be available to \n        licensees of qualifying low-power television stations. Such \n        license shall be subject to the same license terms, and renewal \n        standards as the licenses for full-power television stations \n        except as provided in this section, and each class A licensee \n        shall be accorded primary status as a television broadcaster as \n        long as the station continues to meet the requirements for a \n        qualifying low-power station in paragraph (2). Within 30 days \n        after the date of enactment of the Community Broadcasters \n        Protection Act of 1999, the Commission shall send a notice to \n        the licensees of all low-power television licenses that \n        describes the requirements for Class A designation. Within 60 \n        days after the date of enactment of the Community Broadcasters \n        Protection Act of 1999, licensees intending to seek Class A \n        designation shall submit to the Commission a certification of \n        eligibility based on the qualification requirements of this \n        Act. Absent a material deficiency, the Commission shall grant \n        certification of eligibility to apply for Class A status. The \n        Commission shall act to preserve the contours of low-power \n        television licensees pending the final resolution of a Class A \n        application. Under the requirements set forth in paragraph (2) \n        (A) and (B) and paragraph (6) of this subsection, a licensee \n        may submit an application for Class A designation under this \n        paragraph only within 30 days after final regulations are \n        adopted, except as provided for in paragraph (6)(A). The \n        Commission shall, within 30 days after receipt of an \n        application that is acceptable for filing, award such a Class A \n        television station license to any licensee of a qualifying low-\n        power television station. If, after granting certification of \n        eligibility or a Class A license, unforeseen technical problems \n        arise that require an engineering solution to a station's \n        allotted parameters or channel assignment in the digital \n        television Table of Allotments, the Commission may make such \n        modifications as are necessary to ensure replication of the \n        digital television applicant's service area as provided for in \n        section 622 of the Commission's regulations (47 CFR 602).\n            ``(2) Qualifying low-power television stations.--For \n        purposes of this subsection, a station is a qualifying low-\n        power television station if:\n                    ``(A) during the 90 days preceding the date of \n                enactment of the Community Broadcasters Protection Act \n                of 1999:\n                            ``(i) such station broadcast a minimum of \n                        18 hours per day;\n                            ``(ii) such station broadcast an average of \n                        at least 3 hours per week of programming that \n                        was produced within the market area served by \n                        such station, or the market area served by a \n                        group of commonly controlled stations that \n                        carry common local programming not otherwise \n                        available to their communities; and\n                            ``(iii) such station was in compliance with \n                        the Commission's requirements applicable to \n                        low-power television stations; and\n                    ``(B) from and after the date of its application \n                for a Class A license, the station is in compliance \n                with the Commission's operating rules for full power \n                television stations; or\n                    ``(C) the Commission determines that the public \n                interest, convenience, and necessity would be served by \n                treating the station as a qualifying low-power \n                television station for purposes of this section, or for \n                other reasons determined by the Commission.\n            ``(3) Common ownership.--No low-power television station \n        that is authorized as of the date of enactment of the Community \n        Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999 shall be disqualified for a \n        class A license based on common ownership with any medium of \n        mass communication.\n            ``(4) Issuance of licenses for advanced television services \n        to qualifying low-power television stations.--The Commission is \n        not required to issue any additional licenses for advanced \n        television services to the licensees of the class A television \n        stations but shall accept such license applications proposing \n        facilities that will not cause interference to any other \n        broadcast facility authorized on the date of filing of the \n        Class A advanced television applications. Such new license or \n        the original license of the applicant shall be forfeited at the \n        end of the digital television transition. Low-power television \n        station licensees may, at the option of licensee, elect to \n        convert to the provision of advanced television services on its \n        analog channel, but shall not be required to convert to digital \n        operation until the end of the digital television transition.\n            ``(5) No preemption of section 337.--Nothing in this \n        section preempts section 337 of this Act.\n            ``(6) Interim qualification.--\n                    ``(A) Stations operating within certain \n                bandwidth.--The Commission may not grant a Class A \n                license to a low power television station operating \n                between 698 and 806 megahertz, but the Commission shall \n                provide to low power television stations assigned to \n                and temporarily operating in that bandwidth the \n                opportunity to meet the qualification requirements for \n                a Class A license. When such a qualified applicant for \n                a Class A license is assigned a channel within the core \n                spectrum, the Commission shall simultaneously issue a \n                Class A license.\n                    ``(B) Certain channels off-limits.--The Commission \n                may not grant a channel within the core spectrum under \n                this subsection that includes any of the 175 additional \n                channels referenced in paragraph 45 of its February 23, \n                1998, Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration \n                of the Sixth Report and Order: MM Docket No. 87-268. \n                Within 18 months after the date of enactment of the \n                Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999, the \n                Commission shall identify by channel, location, and \n                applicable technical parameters those 175 channels.\n            ``(7) No interference requirement.--The Commission may not \n        grant a Class A license or approve a modification of a Class A \n        license unless the applicant or licensee shows that the Class A \n        station for which the license or modification is sought will \n        not cause:\n                    ``(A) interference within the Grade B contour of \n                any television station (as of the date of enactment of \n                the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999, or \n                as proposed in a minor change application filed on or \n                before such date) or the digital television service \n                areas provided in the digital television Table of \n                Allotments, or subsequently granted by the Commission \n                prior to the filing of a Class A application;\n                    ``(B) interference within the protected contour of \n                any low power television station or low power \n                television translator station licensed, authorized by \n                construction permit, or with a pending application \n                submitted prior to the date on which the application \n                for a Class A license, or for the modification of such \n                a license, was filed; or\n                    ``(C) interference within the protected contour of \n                80 miles from the geographic center of the areas listed \n                in section 22.625(b)(1) or 90.303 of the Commission's \n                regulations (47 C.F.R. 22.625(b)(1) and 90.303) for \n                frequencies in:\n                            ``(i) the 470-512 megahertz bank identified \n                        in section 22.621 or 90.303 of such \n                        regulations; or\n                            ``(ii) the 482-488 megahertz band in New \n                        York.''.\n    (b) Section 614 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 533) \nis amended:\n            ``(1) by inserting the following in subsection (h)(2)(F) \n        after the first sentence: `A television broadcast station shall \n        not lose its status as a qualified low power station because a \n        full power television station is subsequently licensed to a \n        community within the county or other equivalent political \n        subdivision served by the cable system or because a full power \n        television station subsequently begins to provide local news \n        and information to the community.'.''\n\nSEC. 4.
