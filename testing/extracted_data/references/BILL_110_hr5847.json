FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) On December 22, 2007, the United States and 45 other \n        member states of the United Nations voted not to support the \n        2009 United Nations Durban Review Conference (``Durban II \n        Conference''), a follow-up meeting to the 2001 United Nations \n        World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, \n        Xenophobia and Related Intolerance (``Durban I Conference'') in \n        Durban, South Africa;\n            (2) The Durban I Conference was used as a platform to \n        advance anti-Semitism and, consequently, the United States and \n        Israeli delegates walked out.\n            (3) The United States has taken strong steps to avoid \n        giving support to the Durban II Conference, including \n        implementing a policy of voting against the Durban II \n        Conference in the United Nations (including voting against \n        funding for the Durban II Conference) and forgoing \n        participation in preparatory meetings for the Durban II \n        Conference.\n            (4) The United States has pledged to boycott the Durban II \n        Conference if it appears to be a repeat of the Durban I \n        Conference.\n            (5) Canada's Multiculturalism Secretary of State, Jason \n        Kennedy, announced in January 2008 that Canada will not \n        participate in the Durban II Conference.\n            (6) Israel's Foreign Affairs Minister Tzipi Livni announced \n        that Israel will boycott the Durban II Conference unless it is \n        proven that it will not be used as a platform of further anti-\n        Israeli and anti-Semitic behavior.\n            (7) Pre-conference drafts for the Durban I Conference \n        condemned Israel for allegedly pursing a racist Zionist agenda \n        and committing crimes against humanity.\n            (8) An African-led effort at the Durban I Conference sought \n        to include a demand for reparations from the West for slavery.\n            (9) Conferees at the Durban I Conference tried to condemn \n        the United States for refusing to adopt certain United Nations \n        treaties.\n            (10) The United States cannot accept treaty requirements \n        that are incompatible with the United States Constitution.\n            (11) Former United States Secretary of State Colin Powell \n        gave the following statement after the Durban I Conference: ``I \n        know that you do not combat racism by conferences that produce \n        declarations containing hateful language, some of which is a \n        throwback to the days of `Zionism equals racism;' or support \n        the idea that we have made too much of the Holocaust; or \n        suggest that apartheid exists in Israel; or that single out \n        only one country in the world--Israel--for censure and \n        abuse.''.\n            (12) The United Nations Human Rights Council is responsible \n        for organizing the Durban II Conference.\n            (13) The United Nations Human Rights Council has ignored \n        ongoing repression in Belarus, the People's Republic of China, \n        Cuba, North Korea, Zimbabwe, and other countries.\n            (14) The United Nations Human Rights Council has condemned \n        Israel 15 times in two years.\n            (15) The Preparatory Committee for the Durban II Conference \n        includes Libya, Cuba, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, and South Africa, \n        none of which has demonstrated consistent equality or respect \n        for human rights.\n            (16) Libya is the chair and Iran is the co-chair of the \n        Preparatory Committee for the Durban II Conference.\n            (17) Both Libya and Iran are strong supporters of the \n        Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in the United \n        Nations Human Rights Council, which has historically been \n        hostile to Israel.\n            (18) Libya is a member of the League of Arab States, whose \n        Arab Charter on Human Rights calls for the elimination of \n        ``Zionism''.\n            (19) United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/86 \n        rejects the position that Zionism is racism or a form of racial \n        discrimination.\n            (20) In December 2007, the United States delegation to the \n        United Nations rejected the United Nations biennial budget for \n        2008-2009 due, in part, because of proposals to fund the Durban \n        II Conference.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON UNITED STATES FUNDING FOR THE 2009 UNITED \n              NATIONS DURBAN REVIEW CONFERENCE AND RELATED ACTIVITIES.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law--\n            (1) no funds appropriated or otherwise made available by \n        any Act may be made available to support the 2009 United \n        Nations Durban Review Conference (``Durban II Conference'') or \n        any other activity relating to the planning, preparation, or \n        implementation of a follow-up meeting to the 2001 United \n        Nations World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, \n        Xenophobia and Related Intolerance (``Durban I Conference'') in \n        Durban, South Africa; and\n            (2) the United States shall withhold from its assessed \n        contributions to the United Nations regular budget, in \n        proportion to the United States assessment for the United \n        Nations regular budget, the amount allocated for the Durban II \n        Conference and any other activity relating to the planning, \n        preparation, or implementation of a follow-up meeting to the \n        Durban I Conference."
