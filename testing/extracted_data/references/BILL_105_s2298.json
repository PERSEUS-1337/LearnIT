FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (25 U.S.C. \n        1301 et seq.) (commonly known as the ``Indian Civil Rights \n        Act'') was enacted to protect the civil rights of individuals \n        who interact with tribal governments and other tribal \n        organizations;\n            (2) individuals who interact with tribal governments and \n        other tribal organizations continue to suffer civil rights \n        abuses, including unfair dismissals from employment with a \n        tribal government or other tribal organization, election \n        irregularities, and improper use of law enforcement authority;\n            (3) a 1991 report of the United States Commission on Civil \n        Rights found that the enforcement of rights guaranteed by the \n        Act commonly known as the ``Indian Civil Rights Act'' continued \n        to be impeded by reluctance among Indian tribes to waive tribal \n        immunity;\n            (4) Congress has considered the impediments to enforcing \n        the Act commonly known as the ``Indian Civil Rights Act'' for a \n        period preceding the date of enactment of this Act of more than \n        10 years;\n            (5) under article III of the Constitution of the United \n        States, individuals have the opportunity to seek action in a \n        district court of the United States after exhausting remedies \n        in tribal courts for enforcement of the Act commonly known as \n        the ``Indian Civil Rights Act''; and\n            (6) to provide for the opportunity referred to in paragraph \n        (5), tribal immunity should be waived.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Indian tribe.--The term ``Indian tribe'' means any \n        Indian tribe or band with a governing body duly recognized by \n        the Secretary of the Interior.\n            (2) Tribal government.--The term ``tribal government'' \n        means a governing body of an Indian tribe referred to in \n        paragraph (1).\n            (3) Tribal immunity.--The term ``tribal immunity'' means \n        the immunity of an Indian tribe from jurisdiction of the \n        courts, judicial review of an action of that Indian tribe, and \n        other remedies.\n            (4) Tribal organization.--The term ``tribal organization'' \n        has the meaning given that term in section 4(l) of the Indian \n        Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. \n        450b(l)).\n\nSEC. 4.
