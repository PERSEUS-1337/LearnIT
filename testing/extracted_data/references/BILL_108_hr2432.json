FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 1980, in the Paperwork Reduction Act, Congress \n        established the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \n        (OIRA) in the Office of Management and Budget. OIRA's principal \n        responsibility is to reduce the paperwork burden on the public \n        that results from the collection of information by or for the \n        Federal Government. In 2002, OIRA estimated that the paperwork \n        burden imposed on the public was 7.7 billion hours, at a cost \n        of $230 billion. The Internal Revenue Service accounted for 83 \n        percent of the paperwork burden.\n            (2) In 1995, Congress amended the Paperwork Reduction Act \n        and established annual governmentwide paperwork reduction goals \n        of 10 percent for each of fiscal years 1996 and 1997, and 5 \n        percent for each of fiscal years 1998 through 2001, but the \n        paperwork burden increased, rather than decreased, in each of \n        those fiscal years and fiscal year 2002. Both the Office of \n        Management and Budget and the Internal Revenue Service need to \n        devote additional attention to paperwork reduction.\n            (3) In 2002, the House Report accompanying the Treasury and \n        General Government Appropriations Act, 2003 (House Report 107-\n        575) stated, ``The Office of Management and Budget has reported \n        that paperwork burdens on Americans have increased in each of \n        the last six years. Since the Internal Revenue Service imposes \n        over 80 percent of these paperwork burdens, the Committee \n        believes that OMB should work to identify and review proposed \n        and existing IRS paperwork.''.\n            (4) One key to success in paperwork reduction is the Office \n        of Management and Budget's systematic review of every new and \n        revised agency paperwork proposal. Recent statutory exemptions \n        from that office's review responsibility, especially those \n        without any stated justification, should be removed.\n            (5) In 2000, researchers Mark Crain of George Mason \n        University and Thomas Hopkins of the Rochester Institute of \n        Technology, in their October 2001 publication titled ``The \n        Impact of Regulatory Costs on Small Firms'', estimated that \n        Americans spend $843 billion annually to comply with Federal \n        regulations. Congress has a responsibility to review major \n        rules (as defined by section 804 of title 5, United States \n        Code) proposed by agencies, especially regulatory alternatives \n        and the costs and benefits associated with each of them. In \n        2000, in the Truth in Regulating Act, Congress established new \n        responsibility within the General Accounting Office to assist \n        Congress with this responsibility.\n            (6) In 1996, because of the increasing costs and \n        incompletely estimated benefits of Federal rules and paperwork, \n        Congress required the Office of Management and Budget for the \n        first time to submit an annual report to Congress on the total \n        costs and benefits to the public of Federal rules and paperwork \n        requirements, including an assessment of the effects of Federal \n        rules on the private sector and State and local governments. In \n        1998, Congress changed the annual report's due date to coincide \n        with the due date of the President's budget, so that Congress \n        and the public could be given an opportunity to simultaneously \n        review both the on-budget and off-budget costs associated with \n        the regulatory and paperwork requirements of each Federal \n        agency. In 2000, Congress made this a permanent annual \n        reporting requirement.\n            (7) The Office of Management and Budget requires agencies \n        to submit annual budget and paperwork burden estimates in order \n        to prepare certain required reports for Congress, but it does \n        not require agencies to submit estimates on costs and benefits \n        of agency rules and paperwork. The Office of Management and \n        Budget needs to require agencies to submit such estimates on \n        costs and benefits to help prepare the annual accounting \n        statement and associated report required under section 624 of \n        the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2001.\n\nSEC. 3. REDUCTION OF TAX PAPERWORK.\n\n    Section 3504 of title 44, United States Code, is amended by adding \nat the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(i) In carrying out subsection (c)(3), the Director shall (in \nconsultation with the Internal Revenue Service and the Office of Tax \nPolicy of the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Advocacy of \nthe Small Business Administration) conduct a review of the collections \nof information conducted by the Internal Revenue Service to identify \nactions that the Internal Revenue Service can take to reduce the \ninformation collection burden imposed on small business concerns, \nconsistent with section 3520(c)(1) of this chapter. The Director shall \ninclude the results of the review in the annual report that the \nDirector submits under section 3514 of this chapter for fiscal year \n2006.''.\n\nSEC. 4. REPEAL OF EXEMPTIONS FROM PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT, ETC.\n\n    (a) Repeals.--The following provisions of the Farm Security and \nRural Investment Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-171) are repealed:\n            (1) Subparagraphs (A) and (C) of section 1601(c)(2).\n            (2) Section 1601(c)(3).\n            (3) Section 2702(b)(1)(A).\n            (4) Section 2702(b)(2)(A).\n            (5) Section 2702(c).\n            (6) Subparagraphs (A) and (C) of section 6103(b)(2).\n            (7) Section 6103(b)(3).\n            (8) Subparagraphs (A) and (C) of section 10105(d)(2).\n            (9) Section 10105(d)(3).\n    (b) Effective Date.--The repeals of the provisions listed in \nsubsection (a) shall take effect 180 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. AMENDMENT OF TRUTH IN REGULATING ACT TO MAKE PERMANENT PILOT \n              PROJECT FOR REPORT ON RULES.\n\n    The purpose of this section is to make permanent the authority to \nrequest the performance of regulatory analysis to enhance Congressional \nresponsibility for regulatory decisions developed under the laws \nenacted by Congress. The Truth in Regulating Act of 2000 (Public Law \n106-312; 5 U.S.C. 801 note) is amended--\n            (1) in the heading for section 4, by striking ``PILOT \n        PROJECT FOR'',\n            (2) by striking section 5 and redesignating section 6 as \n        section 5; and\n            (3) in section 5 (as redesignated by paragraph (2))--\n                    (A) in the heading, by striking ``and duration of \n                pilot project'';\n                    (B) in subsection (a), by striking ``(a) Effective \n                Date.--''; and\n                    (C) by striking subsections (b) and (c).\n\nSEC. 6. IMPROVED REGULATORY ACCOUNTING.\n\n    (a) Requirement for Agencies To Submit Information on Regulations \nand Paperwork to OMB.--Section 624 of the Treasury and General \nGovernment Appropriations Act, 2001 (as enacted into law by Public Law \n106-554; 114 Stat. 2763A-161), is amended\n            (1) by redesignating subsections (b), (c), and (d) as \n        subsection (c), (d), and (e), respectively, and\n            (2) by inserting after subsection (a) the following new \n        subsection:\n    ``(b) Agency Submissions to OMB.--To carry out subsection (a), the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget shall require each \nagency annually to submit to the Office of Management and Budget an \nestimate of the total annual costs and benefits of Federal rules and \npaperwork, to the extent feasible--\n            ``(1) for the agency in the aggregate; and\n            ``(2) for each agency program.''.\n    (b) Integration of OMB Accounting Statement and Report Into \nPresident's Budget.--Section 624 of the Treasury and General Government \nAppropriations Act, 2001 (as enacted into law by Public Law 106-554; \n114 Stat. 2763A-161) is further amended in subsection (a), by striking \n``with the budget'' and inserting ``as part of the budget''.\n    (c) Regulatory Budgeting.--(1) Chapter 11 of title 31, United \nStates Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n``Sec. 1120.
