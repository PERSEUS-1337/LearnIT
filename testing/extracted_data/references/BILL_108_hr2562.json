FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The ability to repay financial obligations incurred in \n        obtaining a legal education has become a deterrent to law \n        school graduates accepting public interest employment.\n            (2) The increasing level of educational debt leads recent \n        law school graduates to accept positions with private firms \n        offering high salaries rather than with lower paying public \n        interest organizations.\n            (3) This has led to a decrease in the number of attorneys \n        available to serve public needs in government, non-profit, and \n        special interest capacities.\n            (4) The establishment of a Federal loan repayment \n        assistance program for attorneys entering public interest jobs \n        will increase access to legal services in these areas by \n        helping recent law school graduates to meet their educational \n        financial obligations.\n\nSEC. 3.
