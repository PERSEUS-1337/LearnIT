FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) there is a 12-percent Federal retail excise tax on \n        certain new heavy trucks, tractors, and trailers, coupled with \n        new regulatory mandates, significantly increasing the cost of \n        new heavy-duty trucks, tractors, and trailers, and discourages \n        the replacement of older, less environmentally clean and less \n        fuel economical vehicles;\n            (2) this 12-percent Federal retail excise tax is the \n        highest percentage rate of any Federal ad valorem excise tax;\n            (3) the Federal excise tax was first levied by Congress in \n        1917 to help finance America's involvement in World War I;\n            (4) in 2016, the average manufacturer suggested retail \n        price for heavy trucks was over $175,921;\n            (5) the 12-percent Federal retail excise tax routinely adds \n        between $12,000 and $22,000 to the cost of a heavy truck, \n        tractor, or trailer;\n            (6) the average in-use, heavy truck is 9.5 years old, close \n        to the historical all-time high;\n            (7) the Environmental Protection Agency's model year 2002-\n        2010 tailpipe emissions rules account for $20,000 of the \n        average price of today's new heavy-duty trucks;\n            (8) according to the 2011 Environmental Protection Agency \n        and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Regulatory \n        Impact Analysis entitled ``Final Rulemaking to Establish \n        Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards and Fuel Efficiency \n        Standards for Medium and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles'', \n        model year 2014-2018 EPA-Department of Transportation fuel \n        economy rules will add up to approximately $6,683 to the price \n        of new heavy-duty trucks;\n            (9) according to the 2016 Environmental Protection Agency \n        and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Final Rule \n        entitled ``Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Fuel Efficiency \n        Standards for Medium and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles--Phase \n        2'', model year 2021-2027 fuel economy rules will add up to \n        approximately $12,500 to the price of new heavy-duty trucks;\n            (10) the $39,183 average per truck cost of these regulatory \n        mandates results in an additional $4,700 Federal excise tax, on \n        average;\n            (11) since the Federal retail excise tax on certain new \n        heavy trucks, tractors, and trailers is based on annual sales, \n        receipts from the tax deposited in the Highway Trust Fund can \n        vary greatly; and\n            (12) Congress should consider a more reliable and \n        consistent revenue mechanism to protect the Highway Trust Fund.\n\nSEC. 3.
