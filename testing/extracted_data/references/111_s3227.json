    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Preserving the American Historical \nRecord Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Much of the American historical record, such as \n        evidence of births, education, marriage, divorce, property \n        owned, obligations satisfied, and criminal conduct, is held at \n        the State and local level by organizations that preserve the \n        records that protect the rights of the Nation.\n            (2) The United States has recognized the importance of \n        history by its support of national institutions such as the \n        National Archives, the Library of Congress, and the Smithsonian \n        Institution. Yet, this support is not adequate to reach the \n        rest of the Nation's archives being held in State and local \n        historical societies, archives, and library history \n        collections.\n            (3) More resources need to be directed to State and local \n        organizations to ensure essential care of documents and \n        archival records in their many forms so that they can be \n        readily used by the people of this Nation.\n            (4) History connects people to community--whether the \n        community is a family, a neighborhood, a city, a State, or a \n        Nation. Connections to the past are essential to sustaining \n        democracy, educating students, creating a sense of place in \n        family and community, supporting information needs in business \n        and legal affairs, and making reasoned decisions about the \n        Nation's future direction.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to protect historical records from harm, to prolong \n        their life, and to preserve them for public use, through the \n        use of electronic records initiatives and plans for disaster \n        preparedness, recovery, and other preservation activities;\n            (2) to use historical records in new and creative ways to \n        convey the importance of State, territorial, and community \n        history, including the development of teaching materials for \n        elementary, secondary, and postsecondary teachers, active \n        participation in National History Day, and support for lifelong \n        learning opportunities;\n            (3) to provide education and training to archivists and \n        others who care for historical records, ensuring that they have \n        the necessary knowledge and skills to fulfill their important \n        responsibilities; and\n            (4) to create a wide variety of access tools, including \n        archival finding aids, documentary editions, indexes, and \n        images of key records maintained on Internet websites of State \n        and local organizations.\n\nSEC. 4.
