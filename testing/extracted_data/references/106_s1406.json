    "content": "SECTION 1. HATE CRIMES.\n\n    (a) Declarations.--Congress declares that--\n            (1) further efforts must be taken at all levels of \n        government to respond to the staggering brutality of hate \n        crimes that have riveted public attention and shocked the \n        Nation;\n            (2) hate crimes are prompted by bias and are committed to \n        send a message of hate to targeted communities, usually defined \n        on the basis of immutable traits;\n            (3) the prominent characteristic of a hate crime is that it \n        devastates not just the actual victim and the victim's family \n        and friends, but frequently savages the community sharing the \n        traits that caused the victim to be selected;\n            (4) any efforts undertaken by the Federal Government to \n        combat hate crimes must respect the primacy that States and \n        local officials have traditionally been accorded in the \n        criminal prosecution of acts constituting hate crimes; and\n            (5) an overly broad reaction by the Federal Government to \n        this serious problem might ultimately diminish the \n        accountability of State and local officials in responding to \n        hate crimes and transgress the constitutional limitations on \n        the powers vested in Congress under the Constitution.\n    (b) Studies.--\n            (1) Collection of data.--\n                    (A) Definition of hate crime.--In this paragraph, \n                the term ``hate crime'' means--\n                            (i) a crime described in subsection (b)(1) \n                        of the first section of the Hate Crime \n                        Statistics Act (28 U.S.C. 534 note); and\n                            (ii) a crime that manifests evidence of \n                        prejudice based on gender or age.\n                    (B) Collection from cross-section of states.--Not \n                later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this \n                Act, the Comptroller General of the United States, in \n                consultation with the National Governors' Association, \n                shall select 10 jurisdictions with laws classifying \n                certain types of crimes as hate crimes and 10 \n                jurisdictions without such laws from which to collect \n                data described in subparagraph (C) over a 12-month \n                period.\n                    (C) Data to be collected.--The data to be collected \n                are--\n                            (i) the number of hate crimes that are \n                        reported and investigated;\n                            (ii) the percentage of hate crimes that are \n                        prosecuted and the percentage that result in \n                        conviction;\n                            (iii) the length of the sentences imposed \n                        for crimes classified as hate crimes within a \n                        jurisdiction, compared with the length of \n                        sentences imposed for similar crimes committed \n                        in jurisdictions with no hate crime laws;

and\n                    (B) prepare an analysis of all reasons why any \n                crime motivated by prejudice based on any traits of a \n                victim should or should not be included.\n    (d) Support for Criminal Investigations and Prosecutions by State \nand Local Law Enforcement Officials.--\n            (1) Assistance other than financial assistance.--\n                    (A) In general.--At the request of a law \n                enforcement official of a State or a political \n                subdivision of a State, the Attorney General, acting \n                through the Director of the Federal Bureau of \n                Investigation, shall provide technical, forensic, \n                prosecutorial, or any other form of assistance in the \n                criminal investigation or prosecution of any crime \n                that--\n                            (i) constitutes a crime of violence (as \n                        defined in section 16 of title 18, United \n                        States Code);\n                            (ii) constitutes a felony under the laws of \n                        the State;
