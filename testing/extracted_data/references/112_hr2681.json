Reg. 15704 (March 21, \n                2011).\n                    (B) ``Identification of Non-Hazardous Secondary \n                Materials That Are Solid Waste'', published at 76 Fed. \n                Reg. 15456 (March 21, 2011).\n\nSEC. 3. COMPLIANCE DATES.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Compliance Dates.--For each regulation \npromulgated pursuant to section 2, the Administrator--\n            (1) shall establish a date for compliance with standards \n        and requirements under such regulation that is, notwithstanding \n        any other provision of law, not earlier than 5 years after the \n        effective date of the regulation; and\n            (2) in proposing a date for such compliance, shall take \n        into consideration--\n                    (A) the costs of achieving emissions reductions;\n                    (B) any non-air quality health and environmental \n                impact and energy requirements of the standards and \n                requirements;\n                    (C) the feasibility of implementing the standards \n                and requirements, including the time needed to--\n                            (i) obtain necessary permit approvals; and\n                            (ii) procure, install, and test control \n                        equipment;\n                    (D) the availability of equipment, suppliers, and \n                labor, given the requirements of the regulation and \n                other proposed or finalized regulations of the \n                Environmental Protection Agency; and\n                    (E) potential net employment impacts.\n    (b) New Sources.--The date on which the Administrator proposes a \nregulation pursuant to section 2(a)(1) establishing an emission \nstandard under section 112 or 129 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412, \n7429) shall be treated as the date on which the Administrator first \nproposes such a regulation for purposes of applying the definition of a \nnew source under section 112(a)(4) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(a)(4)) \nor the definition of a new solid waste incineration unit under section \n129(g)(2) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 7429(g)(2)).\n    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed \nto restrict or otherwise affect the provisions of paragraphs (3)(B) and \n(4) of section 112(i) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(i)).\n\nSEC. 4. ENERGY RECOVERY AND CONSERVATION.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and to ensure the \nrecovery and conservation of energy consistent with the Solid Waste \nDisposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.; commonly referred to as the \n``Resource Conservation and Recovery Act''), in promulgating rules \nunder section 2(a) addressing the subject matter of the rules specified \nin section 2(b)(2), the Administrator--\n            (1) shall adopt the definitions of the terms ``commercial \n        and industrial solid waste incineration unit'', ``commercial \n        and industrial waste'', and ``contained gaseous material'' in \n        the rule entitled ``Standards of Performance for New Stationary \n        Sources and Emission Guidelines for Existing Sources: \n        Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units'', \n        published at 65 Fed. Reg. 75338 (December 1, 2000); and\n            (2) shall identify non-hazardous secondary material to be \n        solid waste only if--\n                    (A) the material meets such definition of \n                commercial and industrial waste; or\n                    (B) if the material is a gas, it meets such \n                definition of contained gaseous material.\n\nSEC. 5. OTHER PROVISIONS.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Standards Achievable in Practice.--In \npromulgating rules under section 2(a), the Administrator shall ensure \nthat emissions standards for existing and new sources established under \nsection 112 or 129 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412, 7429), as \napplicable, can be met under actual operating conditions consistently \nand concurrently with emission standards for all other air pollutants \nregulated by the rule for the source category, taking into account \nvariability in actual source performance, source design, fuels, inputs, \ncontrols, ability to measure the pollutant emissions, and operating \nconditions.\n    (b) Regulatory Alternatives.--For each regulation promulgated \npursuant to section 2(a), from among the range of regulatory \nalternatives authorized under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et \nseq.) including work practice standards under section 112(h) of such \nAct (42 U.S.C. 7412(h)), the Administrator shall impose the least \nburdensome, consistent with the purposes of such Act and Executive \nOrder No. 13563 published at 76 Fed. Reg. 3821 (January 21, 2011).\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives October 6, 2011.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                 KAREN L.
