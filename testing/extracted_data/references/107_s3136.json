FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the vermiculite ore mined and milled in Libby, Montana, \n        was contaminated by high levels of asbestos, particularly \n        tremolite asbestos;\n            (2) the vermiculite mining and milling processes released \n        thousands of pounds of asbestos-contaminated dust into the air \n        around Libby, Montana, every day, exposing mine workers and \n        Libby residents to high levels of asbestos over a prolonged \n        period of time;\n            (3) the Federal Government has known for over 50 years that \n        there are severe health risks associated with prolonged \n        exposure to asbestos, including higher incidences of asbestos \n        related disease such as asbestosis, lung cancer, and \n        mesothelioma;\n            (4) the United States was aware of accumulating asbestos \n        pollution in Libby, Montana, as early as 1941, but failed to \n        take any corrective action for decades, and once corrective \n        action was taken, it was inadequate to protect workers and \n        residents and asbestos-contaminated vermiculite dust continued \n        to be released into the air in and around Libby, Montana, until \n        the early 1990s when the vermiculite mining and milling process \n        was finally halted;\n            (5) the United States Environmental Protection Agency did \n        not respond to massive asbestos contamination in Libby, \n        Montana, until 1999, when the high rates of disease and death \n        associated with exposure to asbestos in Libby, Montana, made \n        national headlines;\n            (6) current and former residents of Libby, Montana, and \n        former vermiculite mine workers from the Libby mine suffer from \n        asbestos related diseases at a rate 40 to 60 times the national \n        average, and they suffer from the rare and deadly asbestos-\n        caused cancer, mesothelioma, at a rate 100 times the national \n        average;\n            (7) the State of Montana and the town of Libby, Montana, \n        face an immediate and severe health care crisis because--\n                    (A) many sick current and former residents and \n                workers who have been diagnosed with asbestos-related \n                exposure or disease cannot access private health \n                insurance;\n                    (B) the costs to the community and State government \n                related to providing health coverage for uninsured sick \n                residents and former mine workers are creating \n                significant pressures on the State's medicaid program \n                and threaten the viability of other community \n                businesses;\n                    (C) asbestos-related disease can have a long \n                latency period; and\n                    (D) the only significant responsible party \n                available to compensate sick residents and workers has \n                filed for bankruptcy protection; and\n            (8) the United States should recognize that it has a \n        responsibility to work in partnership with the State of \n        Montana, the town of Libby, Montana, and appropriate health \n        care organizations to address escalating health care costs \n        caused by decades of asbestos pollution in Libby, Montana.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide a permanent \nsource of funding for medical benefit payments to current and former \nresidents of Libby, Montana, who suffer from asbestos related disease \nor illness.\n\nSEC. 3.
