FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths among \n        individuals who are over 65 years of age.\n            (2) In 2000, falls among older adults accounted for 10,200 \n        deaths and 1,600,000 emergency department visits.\n            (3) Hospital admissions for hip fractures among the elderly \n        have increased from 231,000 admissions in 1988 to 332,000 in \n        1999.\n            (4) Annually, more than 64,000 individuals who are over 65 \n        years of age sustain a traumatic brain injury as a result of a \n        fall.\n            (5) The total cost of all fall injuries for people age 65 \n        and older was calculated in 1994 to be $27,300,000,000 (in 2004 \n        dollars).\n            (6) A national approach to reducing falls among older \n        adults, which focuses on the daily life of senior citizens in \n        residential, institutional, and community settings, is needed.\n\nSEC. 3.
