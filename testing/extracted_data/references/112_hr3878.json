SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Chemawa Indian \nSchool Trust Transfer and Self-Determination Act of 2012''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Chemawa Indian School, originally opened in Forest \n        Grove, Oregon, in 1880, is the longest continuously operating \n        off-reservation boarding school for Indian children in the \n        United States.\n            (2) Circa 1885, Chemawa Indian School students and staff \n        donated significant resources toward the purchase of the Salem, \n        Oregon, school property and expressed a desire that the school \n        lands and buildings belong to the Indians.\n            (3) All the land purchased for the Chemawa Indian School \n        was deeded directly to the Federal Government, has never been \n        converted to trust status, and is not considered ``Indian \n        country'' under title 18, United States Code.\n            (4) The land that comprises the Chemawa Indian School is \n        now managed by the General Services Administration.\n            (5) As much as one-third of the Chemawa Indian School \n        property has been sold or transferred by the Federal Government \n        for various purposes, without direct benefit to the Chemawa \n        students and without input from the Oregon tribes regarding \n        whether such sales or transfers would affect the mission of the \n        Chemawa Indian School or whether the property could be used for \n        other Indian purposes.\n            (6) Consistent with principles of tribal self-\n        determination, decisions about the operation and future of the \n        Chemawa Indian school, lands, and purposes should be under the \n        control and authority of the Oregon tribes.\n            (7) Resolutions supporting the transfer of the Chemawa \n        Indian School into trust status for the benefit of the \n        federally recognized Indian tribes in Oregon have been passed \n        by the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of \n        Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Oregon, \n        the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the \n        Coquille Indian Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of Coos, the \n        Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians, the Klamath Tribes, the Cow \n        Creek Band of Umpqua Indians, the Burns Paiute Tribe, the \n        Chemawa Indian School Board, the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest \n        Indians, and the National Congress of American Indians.\n\nSEC. 2.
