FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The world's governments spend $840,000,000,000 each \n        year to support military forces of more than 23,000,000 \n        soldiers.\n            (2) This expenditure for achieving security has itself \n        become a serious threat to security, absorbing 11 percent of \n        all government expenditures at a time when citizens in both \n        developed and developing countries face sharp cuts in \n        programs--such as health, education, research, and job \n        training--that provide the human building blocks for our common \n        future.\n            (3) The United States and other developed nations bear \n        significant responsibility for excessive military expenditures, \n        accounting for 77 percent of world military spending and for 94 \n        percent of arms transfers to developing nations, with the \n        United States being the world's leader in both categories.\n            (4) The United States and other developed nations jointly \n        have a controlling vote in the International Monetary Fund, the \n        International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and \n        other international financial institutions that have subsidized \n        excessive military spending in numerous countries by exempting \n        the military portions of a country's budget from audit and \n        assessment.\n            (5) Developing nations also bear significant responsibility \n        for excessive military expenditures, spending $191,000,000,000 \n        each year, or 4 times all receipts of foreign aid from all \n        sources.\n            (6) In the developing world, where more than 900,000,000 \n        people cannot read or write, military spending is nearly as \n        high as spending on education.\n            (7) In the developing world, where 1,000,000,000 people \n        never see a health professional and where more than 2,000,000 \n        children die each year of preventable infectious diseases, \n        military spending is higher than spending on health.\n            (8) The lack of transparency, to both a country's citizens \n        and to international financial institutions, of the military \n        budget and of military ownership or other forms of involvement \n        in the civilian economy provides refuge for corruption and \n        undercuts the international financial institutions' efforts to \n        promote ``good governance''.\n            (9) Ownership of businesses and investment funds and other \n        types of financial interests of armed forces in the civilian \n        sector of the economy in countries as diverse as Chile, China, \n        Ecuador, Guatemala, and Indonesia distorts prices and reduces \n        competition, and also increases the political power of armed \n        forces, thereby posing a threat to the transition to economic \n        and political freedom in the developing world that is a primary \n        goal of United States foreign policy.\n            (10) Top-ranking United States and international officials, \n        including the Secretary of the Treasury, the President of the \n        World Bank, and the Managing Director of the International \n        Monetary Fund, have publicly recognized the urgent need to \n        reduce world military spending, and pledged to make policy \n        changes in their institutions to promote reductions.\n            (11) Congress and the President have also made the \n        reduction of world military spending a goal of United States \n        foreign policy, and provided for the use of the financial \n        resources and technical capabilities of the international \n        financial institutions to achieve that goal, by enacting--\n                    (A) section 60 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, \n                which requires the United States Executive Director at \n                the International Monetary Fund to report on methods to \n                promote reductions in military spending;\n                    (B) the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and \n                Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1993, which, in \nits statement of managers, urges United States executive directors at \nall the international financial institutions to use the United States \nvoice and vote to promote reductions in military spending;\n                    (C) section 570 of the Foreign Operations, Export \n                Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, \n                1994, which requires the State Department to report on \n                countries' efforts to reduce military spending, \n                including regional force reduction talks; and\n                    (D) section 1502 of the International Financial \n                Institutions Act, which requires United States \n                executive directors at the international financial \n                institutions to take into account, when deciding on \n                loan proposals, the proposed recipient's commitment to \n                providing accurate military spending data and ending \n                military involvement in the civilian economy.\n                    (E) section 576 of the Foreign Operations, Export \n                Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, \n                1997, which states that beginning three years after the \n                date of enactment of this Act, the United States \n                Executive Director of each international financial \n                institution must use the voice and vote of the United \n                States to oppose any loan or other utilization of the \n                funds of their respective institutions, other than to \n                address basic human needs, for the government of any \n                country which the Secretary of the Treasury \n                determines--\n                            (i) does not have in place a functioning \n                        system for a civilian audit of all receipts and \n                        expenditures that fund activities of the armed \n                        forces and security forces;\n                            (ii) has not provided a summary of a \n                        current audit to the institution.\n            (12) Despite these high-level statements and requirements \n        in law, no significant progress has been made in establishing \n        either a mechanism for regional talks on mutual military \n        reductions or mechanisms within the international financial \n        institutions for--\n                    (A) verifying through accepted auditing procedures \n                the accuracy of reported military budgets;\n                    (B) receiving and assessing the justification for \n                various expenditures within military budgets as well as \n                the overall trends and amounts of such expenditures; \n                and\n                    (C) ending military ownership and financial \n                interests in the civilian economy.\n            (13) Dr. Oscar Arias, former President of Costa Rica and \n        1987 Nobel Peace Laureate, has joined with over 80 citizens' \n        groups around the world to propose a practical plan to achieve \n        the goals of these high-level statements and requirements in \n        law, The Year 2000 Campaign to Redirect World Military Spending \n        to Human Development, which contains the following 6 proposals:\n                    (A) The Security Council and General Assembly of \n                the United Nations call on all nations to commit to \n                meeting with their neighbors to identify and implement \n                confidence-building measures and mutual reductions in \n                military threats that will reduce the likelihood of \n                future conflicts. These nations will seek to achieve \n                substantial reductions in military forces and \n                expenditures by the year 2000.\n                    (B) Special envoys be appointed by the United \n                Nations Secretary-General to organize these \n                demilitarization talks in various regions of the world.\n                    (C) Every nation meet with its regional envoy to \n                present plans for regional security at reduced force \n                levels. These nations will also participate in \n                negotiations guided by the envoy in order to identify \n                military capacities and implement mutual force \n                reductions. Such negotiations will reduce the threat \n                that nations pose to each other due to the size, \n                proximity, and technological sophistication of their \n                armed forces.\n                    (D) With savings from reduced military spending, \n                all nations, in cooperation with grassroots \n                organizations, implement economic reforms related to \n                demilitarization, such as the conversion of military to \n                non-military production, landmine clearance, community \n                reconstruction, and the reintegration of demobilized \n                soldiers.\n                    (E) In support of the steps taken toward \n                demilitarization by developing countries, \n                industrialized nations condition their bilateral and \n                multilateral aid to promote demilitarization. They will \n                exchange debt forgiveness for military conversion \n                efforts, provide special funding for programs to assist \n                the demilitarization process, promote full transparency \n                and reductions in military budgets, and bring about the \n                end of military involvement in the civilian economy.\n                    (F) All arms-exporting nations agree to a Code of \n                Conduct on arms transfers that would bar exports to \n                nondemocratic governments, countries engaged in armed \n                aggression in violation of international law, countries \n                that do not fully participate in the United Nations \n                Register of conventional arms, and governments \n                permitting gross violations of internationally \n                recognized human rights.\n            (14) Citizens around the world are signing The Arias Peace \n        Pledge and communicating to their governments their support for \n        the proposals of The Year 2000 Campaign to Redirect World \n        Military Spending to Human Development.\n            (15) The United Nations is expected to consider crucial \n        components of this 6-point plan.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to enhance international security by \nusing the resources and expertise of the international financial \ninstitutions and the United Nations to redirect world military spending \nto human development.\n\nSEC. 4. SPECIAL ENVOYS FOR MUTUAL DISARMAMENT.\n\n    The President shall instruct the United States Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations to support in the Security Council, the General \nAssembly, and other United Nations bodies, resolutions and other \nefforts to--\n            (1) appoint special envoys for conflict prevention to \n        organize and conduct, in cooperation with appropriate \n        multilateral institutions, mutual disarmament talks in every \n        region of the world in which all nations would participate, and \n        to report to international financial institutions on the degree \n        of cooperation of governments with these talks;\n            (2) commit each member state to agree to meet with its \n        regional special envoy within 3 months of appointment to \n        deliver and discuss its proposal for regional (and, where \n        appropriate, international) confidence-building measures, \n        including mutual reductions in the size, proximity, and \n        technological sophistication of its and other nations' armed \n        forces, that would lead to significant cuts in threat levels \n        and military spending; and\n            (3) commit each member state to agree to continue meeting \n        with the special envoy and such regional bodies and states as \n        the special envoy shall suggest to complete negotiations on \n        such confidence-building measures, with the goal of making \n        significant cuts in military spending by the year 2000.\n\nSEC. 5. ALTERNATIVE SECURITY PLAN.\n\n    Within 3 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \nPresident shall prepare and deliver to the Congress and to the \nSecretary General of the United Nations a report as described in \nsection 4(2) that would detail the changes in other nations' forces and \nUnited States forces that would permit by the year 2000 a dramatic \nreduction in United States military spending.\n\nSEC. 6. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) the United States should not provide economic \n        assistance, military assistance, or approve arms transfers or \n        related training, to any foreign government at any time during \n        which the United States is opposing loans to that foreign \n        government at international financial institutions pursuant to \n        section 576 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and \n        Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997.\n            (2) the President should designate the United States Agency \n        for International Development to be the lead agency for the \n        determinations made pursuant to section 576 (also section \n        15027); and\n            (3) the President should report annually to the Congress on \n        the progress made by international financial institutions in \n        integrating military spending issues such as those raised in \n        this Act into the loan review process of such international \n        financial institutions."
