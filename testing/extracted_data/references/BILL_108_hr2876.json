FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Unless the prevalence of tobacco use is cut \n        dramatically, about 24,000,000 Americans, 1 out of every 2 \n        current smokers in America, will die prematurely of a disease \n        directly caused by their dependence on tobacco.\n            (2) Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in \n        the United States with 400,000 premature deaths annually, and \n        $157,000,000,000 in annual health-related economic losses, \n        including more than $75,000,000,000 in excess medical \n        expenditures.\n            (3) Clinical studies have shown that pharmacological \n        treatments are an effective treatment for tobacco dependence, \n        and there are currently 6 medications that have been approved \n        by the FDA for tobacco use cessation.\n            (4) Clinical studies have shown that counseling is an \n        effective treatment for tobacco dependence, and that counseling \n        can be provided in individual or group settings, or via \n        telephone, such as the Quit Lines provided by 33 States.\n            (5) Studies have also shown that when counseling is \n        combined with pharmacological treatment, the effectiveness of \n        treatment doubles or triples (compared to counseling alone).\n            (6) The cost of over-the-counter Nicotine Replacement \n        Therapy (gum, patch, lozenges) is not covered by Medicare, and \n        is rarely covered by private insurance. Fifteen states under \n        Medicaid cover no Nicotine Replacement Therapy and many of the \n        remaining 35 states do not cover all Nicotine Replacement \n        Therapies. Nicotine Replacement Therapy is rarely tax-\n        deductible, and typically costs about $300 for a suggested 10-\n        week course of treatment.\n            (7) The Guide to Community Preventive Services: Tobacco Use \n        Prevention and Control (CDC 2000) and Treating Tobacco Use and \n        Dependence: Clinical Practice Guideline (2000) recommended a \n        reduction or elimination of out-of-pocket costs to increase the \n        use of tobacco use cessation treatments.\n            (8) Under current law, unreimbursed tobacco use cessation \n        counseling programs and prescribed nicotine-withdrawal drugs \n        are considered expenses for medical care that are deductible \n        subject to the 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income limitation.\n            (9) Two-thirds of all filers do not itemize.\n\nSEC. 3. REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR AMOUNTS PAID TO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS TO \n              CEASE USING TOBACCO PRODUCTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 \nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to refundable credits) \nis amended by inserting after section 35 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 35A.
