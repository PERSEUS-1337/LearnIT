organizations that administer \nunemployment compensation, in order to obtain such information as the \nCommissioner may require to carry out the provisions of this section.\n    ``(g) For purposes of this section, the term `unemployment \ncompensation' has the meaning given that term in section 85(b) of the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, and the total amount of unemployment \ncompensation to which an individual is entitled shall be determined \nprior to any applicable reduction under State law based on the receipt \nof benefits under section 202 or 223.''.\n    (b) Conforming
