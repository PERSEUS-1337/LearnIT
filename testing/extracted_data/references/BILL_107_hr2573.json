FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) certain species of salmon and steelhead in the Columbia \n        and Snake River basin are on the brink of extinction as a \n        consequence of various factors, including hydroelectric \n        projects, harvest management practices, habitat degradation, \n        altered in-stream flow, and unsound hatchery practices;\n            (2) these salmon and steelhead have major economic, \n        ecological, educational, recreational, scientific, cultural, \n        and spiritual significance to the Nation and its people;\n            (3) salmon and steelhead are a symbol of the Northwest, \n        support thousands of jobs in coastal and inland communities, \n        and serve as an indicator of the health of Northwest river \n        ecosystems;\n            (4) the United States Government has signed treaties with \n        Indian tribes of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho and with the \n        Government of Canada creating a legally enforceable trust \n        responsibility to restore salmon populations to sustainable, \n        harvestable levels;\n            (5) since the construction of 4 Federal dams on the lower \n        Snake River in Washington, salmon and steelhead populations in \n        the Snake River have plummeted, and all salmon and steelhead in \n        the Snake River are extinct or listed under the Endangered \n        Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.);\n            (6) recent studies indicate that the time to protect \n        remaining Snake River salmon and steelhead is short, with \n        scientists estimating that, if changes do not occur, remaining \n        Snake River salmon will be extinct in our lifetime;\n            (7) salmon and steelhead extinction could cost taxpayers \n        billions of dollars;\n            (8) a federally funded group of State, tribal, Federal, and \n        independent scientists found that partially removing the 4 \n        lower Snake River dams in Washington is the surest way to \n        protect and recover Snake River salmon and steelhead;\n            (9) several communities that rely on the 4 lower Snake \n        River dams would be affected by partial dam removal;\n            (10) a Federal court has found that the 4 lower Snake River \n        dams violate water quality standards under the Federal Water \n        Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.); and\n            (11) energy production in the Northwest is heavily \n        dependent upon hydropower and thus, the prospects for salmon \n        recovery and Northwest energy production are inextricably \n        linked.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to ensure the protection of Columbia and Snake River \n        salmon and steelhead while providing for reliable, reasonably \n        priced energy in the Northwest, an economically sustainable \n        salmon recovery program, and effective mitigation of potential \n        economic impacts to communities from potential dam removal; and\n            (2) to ensure that the Northwest and the Nation have \n        completed the necessary planning and evaluation to respond \n        rapidly if major new actions are necessary to protect and \n        recover salmon and steelhead in the Columbia and Snake River \n        basin.\n\nSEC. 3. PEER REVIEW OF NMFS BIOLOGICAL OPINION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce shall enter into an \narrangement with the National Academy of Sciences providing for peer \nreview of the NMFS biological opinion and submission of a report on the \nresults of the peer review in accordance with subsection (c).\n    (b) Contents.--For purposes of this section, peer review shall \ninclude, at a minimum, the following:\n            (1) Review of performance standards in the NMFS biological \n        opinion.\n            (2) Review of any recovery standards established by the \n        National Marine Fisheries Service pursuant to the NMFS \n        biological opinion for each listed salmon and steelhead \n        population.\n            (3) Review of the effectiveness of the implementation plans \n        required by the NMFS biological opinion and the appropriateness \n        of the timelines for implementing such plans.\n            (4) Review of the NMFS biological opinion and its analyses \n        and conclusions and review of any future analyses required by \n        the NMFS biological opinion.\n    (c) Report.--Not later than 12 months after the date of enactment \nof this Act, the National Academy of Sciences shall submit to the \nSecretary of Commerce, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the \nInterior, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \na report on the results of the peer review conducted under this \nsection.\n    (d) Determination of Sufficiency.--Not later than December 31, \n2003, the Secretary of Commerce shall publish--\n            (1) a determination of whether implementation of the salmon \n        recovery measures in the NMFS biological opinion are sufficient \n        to achieve recovery, as defined under the Endangered Species \n        Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), of the salmon and \n        steelhead populations that are the subject of the biological \n        opinion; and\n            (2) if the determination under paragraph (1) is that such \n        measures are not sufficient to achieve such recovery, a \n        determination of whether partially removing the 4 lower Snake \n        River dams is necessary to restore Snake River salmon and \n        steelhead populations to meet obligations under such Act.\n    (e) Determination of Necessity To Meet Treaty Obligations.--Not \nlater than December 31, 2003, the Secretary of the Interior shall \npublish a determination of whether partially removing the 4 lower Snake \nRiver dams is necessary to meet treaty obligations to Indian tribes or \nother sovereign nations.\n    (f) Determination of Necessity To Meet Clean Water Requirements.--\nNot later than December 31, 2003, the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency shall publish a determination of \nwhether partially removing the 4 lower Snake River dams is necessary to \nmeet the requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \nU.S.C. 1251 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 4. GAO STUDY OF PARTIAL REMOVAL OF LOWER SNAKE RIVER DAMS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall \nconduct a study of the potential effects of partially removing the 4 \nlower Snake River dams.\n    (b) Contents.--The study shall include examination of and \nrecommendation for addressing, at a minimum, the following:\n            (1) The economic effects of partial dam removal for local \n        communities and for downstream and coastal communities, \n        including downstream and coastal communities located within the \n        boundaries of Alaska and Canada, including employment gains or \n        losses that would result from dam removal.\n            (2) The effects of partial dam removal on transportation by \n        water, including--\n                    (A) the feasibility, costs, and sufficiency of \n                alternative transportation by railroad, highway, and \n                other means;\n                    (B) the economic benefits and costs of such \n                alternatives;\n                    (C) the environmental impact of shifting to such \n                alternatives;\n                    (D) the means for mitigating any environmental harm \n                that might be caused by the use of such alternatives; \n                and\n                    (E) any development or expansion of such \n                alternatives that would be required to continue moving \n                the same amount of cargo that is currently transported \n                by water.\n            (3) The effects of partial dam removal on irrigation, \n        including the availability of or need for alternatives to \n        replace irrigation water or to extend irrigation pumps.\n            (4) The effects of partial dam removal on energy \n        production, including the regional effects of any changes in \n        energy production, identification of alternative energy sources \n        that could replace any loss in energy production, and the \n        benefits and costs of such alternatives.\n            (5) The effects, including economic effects, of the \n        extinction of salmon and steelhead populations in the Snake \n        River.\n    (c) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment \nof this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to each of the \nSecretary of the Army, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Administrator \nof the Environmental Protection Agency a report on the results of the \nstudy conducted under this section.\n\nSEC. 5.
