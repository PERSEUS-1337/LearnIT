REPLACEMENT PROGRAMS FOR HIGH-RISK NATURAL GAS PIPELINES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) Federal requirements related to repairing pipeline \n        leaks are limited to ``hazardous'' leaks, which are leaks that \n        represent an existing or probable hazard to persons or property \n        and require immediate repair;\n            (2) there are no Federal requirements to address slower or \n        less hazardous leaks, which can allow the leaks to persist \n        unrepaired indefinitely;\n            (3) in States without a standard definition and methodology \n        for calculating unaccounted-for gas (the difference between the \n        amount of gas purchased by a utility and the amount used or \n        sold to customers), data inconsistencies may be pervasive and \n        these inconsistencies hinder the ability of regulators to \n        monitor gas system and utility performance;\n            (4) the cost of leaked or otherwise unaccounted-for natural \n        gas in the distribution system is typically passed on to \n        ratepayers without limitation as an accepted cost of service, \n        which removes financial incentive for utilities to minimize the \n        leaks;\n            (5) methane, the primary constituent of natural gas, is a \n        greenhouse gas at least 20 times more potent than carbon \n        dioxide;\n            (6) according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials \n        Safety Administration, the United States natural gas \n        distribution system still includes 61,000 miles of bare steel \n        pipe without adequate corrosion protection and 32,000 miles of \n        cast iron pipe, which was installed beginning in the 1830s and \n        can be prone to failure;\n            (7) major recent pipeline explosions that led to human \n        fatalities, including those in Austin, Texas, Philadelphia, \n        Pennsylvania, and Allentown, Pennsylvania, have been traced to \n        aging, leaking, and high-risk pipeline infrastructure;\n            (8) natural gas distribution utilities may be discouraged \n        from making capital expenditures for the replacement of leaking \n        and failure-prone pipelines because traditional ratemaking \n        structures may not allow for cost recovery on a timely basis; \n        and\n            (9) according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials \n        Safety Administration, the natural gas pipeline replacement \n        programs established as part of the ratemaking process in 27 \n        States and the District of Columbia have played a vital role in \n        enhancing public safety by better ensuring the prompt \n        rehabilitation, repair, or replacement of high-risk natural gas \n        distribution infrastructure.\n    (b) Natural Gas Distribution Companies.--\n            (1) In general.--Chapter 601 of title 49, United States \n        Code, is amended by inserting after section 60112 the \n        following:\n``Sec. 60112A.
