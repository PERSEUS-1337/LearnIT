    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Working Together for Rural Access to \nMental Health and Wellness for Children and Seniors Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Providing adequate mental health care in rural \n        communities is a national problem. Mental health is an integral \n        part of a person's general health and well-being. In rural \n        areas, where specialized mental health services are scarce, \n        accessing mental health professional services is difficult. \n        Primary care is often the only system for delivering mental \n        health services.\n            (2) Rural primary care providers are seeing an increase in \n        mental health issues in their clinics.\n            (3) The need is overwhelming with the Surgeon General \n        estimating 21 percent of children experience the signs or \n        symptoms of a mental disorder. Left untreated, these problems \n        lead to rampant school failure, drug abuse, and often \n        incarceration.\n            (4) The Department of Health and Human Services indicates \n        that 1 in 5 children and adolescents may have a diagnosable \n        disorder, yet 70 percent to 80 percent receive little or no \n        help.\n            (5) Few schools have the resources to implement a full \n        range of school mental health interventions. Identifying \n        sustainable and flexible funding sources for these programs is \n        extremely important.\n            (6) Health, and especially mental health, is a fundamental \n        cornerstone for ensuring that all youth have an equal \n        opportunity to succeed at school.\n            (7) Promoting and expanding telemental health \n        collaborations to strengthen delivery of mental health services \n        in remote and underserved areas is needed.\n            (8) Telemental health is an effective tool for diagnosing \n        and treating some mental health conditions. For rural and \n        remote areas, telemental health offers patients access and \n        care.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) provide assistance to rural schools, hospitals, and \n        communities for the conduct of collaborative efforts to secure \n        a progressive and innovative system to improve access to mental \n        health care for youth, seniors and families;\n            (2) increase access of elementary and secondary school \n        students to mental health services in rural areas by operating \n        a mobile health services van program in such areas; or\n            (3) increase access of individuals of all ages to mental \n        health services in rural areas by providing telemental health \n        services in such areas.\n\nSEC. 3.
