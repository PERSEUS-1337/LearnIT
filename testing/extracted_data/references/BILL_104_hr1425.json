FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In India, tens of thousands of political prisoners, \n        including prisoners of conscience, are being held without \n        charge or trial under special or preventive detention laws.\n            (2) The special and preventive detention laws most \n        frequently cited by human rights organizations are the \n        Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) of \n        1987, the National Security Act of 1980, the Armed Forces \n        (Punjab and Chandigarh) Special Powers Act of 1983, the Armed \n        Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act of 1990, and the \n        Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act of 1978.\n            (3) These laws provide the military and police forces of \n        India sweeping powers of arrest and detention with broad powers \n        to shoot to kill with virtual immunity from prosecution.\n            (4) These laws contravene important international human \n        rights standards established under the International Covenant \n        on Civil and Political Rights, to which India is a party, such \n        as the right of liberty and security, the right to a fair \n        trial, the right to freedom of expression, and the right not to \n        be subjected to torture or arbitrary arrest and detention.\n            (5) Throughout India, political detainees are often held \n        for several months, and in some cases a year, without access to \n        family, friends, or legal counsel.\n            (6) Throughout India, the torture of detainees has been \n        routine, and scores of people have died in police and military \n        custody as a result.\n            (7) Throughout India, scores of political detainees have \n        ``disappeared'' and hundreds of people are reported to have \n        been extrajudicially executed by military and police forces.\n            (8) In Punjab, the Punjab Government encouraged \n        extrajudicial executions by offering bounties for the killing \n        of militants and paid over 41,000 such bounties between 1991 \n        and 1993.\n            (9) Abuses by the military and police forces of India are \n        particularly widespread in the states of Punjab, Assam, \n        Manipur, Nagaland, and the portion of the disputed territory of \n        Jammu and Kashmir under the control of the Government of India.\n            (10) Many victims come from underprivileged and vulnerable \n        sections of society in India, particularly the scheduled castes \n        and tribes.\n            (11) The establishment of the National Human Rights \n        Commission by the Government of India is an important first \nstep toward improving the human rights record of India.\n            (12) However, many human rights organizations are deeply \n        concerned about the severe limitations placed on the powers, \n        mandate, and methodology of the National Human Rights \n        Commission.\n            (13) In 1994, the decision by the Government of India to \n        allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to provide \n        limited humanitarian assistance in the portion of the disputed \n        territory of Jammu and Kashmir under the control of the \n        Government of India was an important first step in providing \n        international humanitarian organizations greater access to \n        troubled areas of India.\n            (14) However, in 1994, the Government of India continued to \n        prohibit several international human rights organizations from \n        conducting independent investigations in the portion of the \n        disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir under the control of \n        the Government of India and provided only limited access to \n        such organizations to other states such as Punjab, Assam, \n        Manipur, and Nagaland where significant human rights problems \n        exist.\n            (15) In India, armed opposition groups have committed human \n        rights abuses.\n            (16) Several human rights organizations have called on such \n        armed opposition groups to respect basic standards of \n        humanitarian law which require that individuals not taking part \n        in hostilities should at all times be treated humanely.\n\nSEC. 3.
