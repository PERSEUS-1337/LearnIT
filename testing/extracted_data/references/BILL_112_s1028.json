DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n        ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the following:\n                    (A) The Committee on Armed Services, the Committee \n                on Foreign Relations, the Committee on Finance, and the \n                Committee on the Budget of the Senate.\n                    (B) The Committee on Armed Services, the Committee \n                on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Ways and Means, \n                and the Committee on the Budget of the House of \n                Representatives.\n            (2) Debt instruments of the united states.--The term ``debt \n        instruments of the United States'' means all bills, notes, and \n        bonds issued or guaranteed by the United States or by an entity \n        of the United States Government, including any Government-\n        sponsored enterprise.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On March 16, 2006, the United States Senate debated and \n        then narrowly passed legislation, H.J. Res. 47, to increase the \n        statutory limit on the public debt of the United States. In a \n        statement published in the Congressional Record, then-Senator \n        Barack Obama opposed the legislation and stated, ``The fact \n        that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit \n        is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. \n        Government can't pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now \n        depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries \n        to finance our Government's reckless fiscal policies.''. Then-\n        Senator Obama went on to say that ``Increasing America's debt \n        weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means \n        that `the buck stops here'. Instead, Washington is shifting the \n        burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and \n        grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of \n        leadership. Americans deserve better.''.\n            (2) On February 25, 2010, United States Secretary of State, \n        Hillary Rodham Clinton, urged members of Congress to address \n        the Federal budget deficit: ``We have to address this deficit \n        and the debt of the United States as a matter of national \n        security, not only as a matter of economics. I do not like to \n        be in a position where the United States is a debtor nation to \n        the extent that we are.''. The Secretary went on to say that \n        reliance on foreign creditors has hit the United States \n        ``ability to protect our security, to manage difficult problems \n        and to show the leadership that we deserve.''.\n            (3) On February 16, 2011, Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of \n        the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified before the Committee on \n        Armed Services of the Senate: ``Indeed, I believe that our debt \n        is the greatest threat to our national security. If we as a \n        country do not address our fiscal imbalances in the near-term, \n        our national power will erode, and the costs to our ability to \n        maintain and sustain influence could be great.''.\n            (4) The Department of the Treasury borrows from the private \n        economy by selling securities, including Treasury bills, notes, \n        and bonds, in order to finance the Federal budget deficit. This \n        additional borrowing to finance the deficit adds to the Federal \n        debt.\n            (5) The Federal debt stands at more than \n        $14,345,000,000,000.\n            (6) According to a report issued by the Department of the \n        Treasury on May 16, 2011, entitled ``Major Foreign Holders of \n        Treasury Securities'', foreign holdings of United States \n        Treasury securities stood at more than $3,175,000,000,000 at \n        the end of March 2011. The People's Republic of China was the \n        single largest holder with holdings of more than \n        $1,144,000,000,000.\n            (7) Despite efforts by the Department of the Treasury to \n        identify the nationality of the ultimate holders of United \n        States securities, including United States Treasury securities, \n        data pertaining to foreign holders of these securities may \n        still fail to reflect the true nationality of the foreign \n        entities involved. For example, another Department of the \n        Treasury report, issued on February 28, 2011, entitled \n        ``Preliminary Report on Foreign Holdings of U.S. Securities At \n        End-June 2010'', assigns $732,000,000,000 worth of United \n        States securities to the Cayman Islands, a British overseas \n        territory with a population of only 55,000 people. The Cayman \n        Islands is not itself a large investor in United States \n        securities; rather, it is a major international financial \n        center and is routinely used as a place to invest funds from \n        elsewhere.\n            (8) On February 25, 2010, Simon Johnson, an economics \n        professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a \n        former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, \n        testified before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review \n        Commission that United States Treasury data understate Chinese \n        holdings of United States Government debt and ``do not reveal \n        the ultimate country of ownership when debt instruments are \n        held through an intermediary in another jurisdiction.''. He \n        stated that ``a great deal'' of the United Kingdom's increase \n        in United States Treasury securities last year ``may be due to \n        China placing offshore dollars in London-based banks'', which \n        are then used to purchase United States Treasury securities.\n            (9) On February 25, 2010, Dr. Eswar Prasad, an economist at \n        Cornell University, testified before the U.S.-China Economic \n        and Security Review Commission that the amount of United States \n        debt held by the People's Republic of China is much higher than \n        United States Treasury data indicate. In his revised testimony, \n        Dr. Prasad went on to explain that China is probably currently \n        holding more than $1,300,000,000,000 in United States Treasury \n        securities.\n            (10) According to a February 3, 2009, report by the \n        Heritage Foundation, entitled ``Chinese Foreign Investment: \n        Insist on Transparency'', the State Administration of Foreign \n        Exchange (SAFE) of the People's Republic of China, the \n        government body that purchases foreign securities, is the \n        single largest global investor and the largest foreign investor \n        in the United States.\n            (11) According to a September 2008 Council on Foreign \n        Relations report entitled ``Sovereign Wealth and Sovereign \n        Power,'' ``. . . political might is often linked to financial \n        might, and a debtor's capacity to project military power hinges \n        on the support of its creditors . . . The United States' main \n        sources of financing are not allies.''. The report goes on to \n        argue that, ``the United States' current reliance on other \n        governments for financing represents an underappreciated \n        strategic vulnerability.''.\n            (12) In recent years, Chinese military officials have \n        publicized the potential use of United States Treasury \n        securities as a means of influencing United States policy and \n        deterring specific United States actions. On February 8, 2010, \n        retired People's Liberation Army (PLA) Major General Luo Yuan, \n        from the PLA Academy of Military Science, stated in an \n        interview with state-controlled media that China could attack \n        the United States ``by oblique means and stealthy feints'', in \n        retaliation for United States arms sales to Taiwan. He went on \n        to say, ``Our retaliation should not be restricted to merely \n        military matters, and we should adopt a strategic package of \n        counterpunches covering politics, military affairs, diplomacy \n        and economics to treat both the symptoms and root cause of this \n        disease. For example, we could sanction them using economic \n        means, such as dumping some U.S. government bonds.''.\n            (13) The PLA has also referenced the concept of nonmilitary \n        aspects of deterrence in written statements. A PLA textbook, \n        ``The Science of Military Strategy'', observes that there are \n        various forms of deterrence, including economic and \n        technological, all of which need to be developed and \n        consciously strengthened in order to maximize effect. These \n        forms will only work ``with the determination and volition of \n        employment of the force, and by dangling the word of deterrence \n        over the rival's head in case of necessity.''.\n            (14) According to a May 16, 2011, report by ABC News, a \n        congressional delegation of 10 United States Senators visited \n        China in April 2011, and met with Chinese government officials. \n        The news report indicates that, during one meeting, the \n        Senators were reprimanded by a Chinese official regarding the \n        mounting United States Federal debt.\n            (15) A February 7, 2010, report by Defense News suggests \n        that China's extensive holdings of United States Government \n        securities have already directly influenced United States \n        national security policy. According to an unnamed Pentagon \n        official, Obama Administration officials softened a draft of a \n        key national security document in order to avoid ``harsh \n        words'' that ``might upset Chinese officials at a time when the \n        United States and China are economically intertwined.''. The \n        news report indicates that these officials ``deleted several \n        passages and softened others about China's military buildup''. \n        This critical document, the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, \n        provides an assessment of long-term threats and challenges for \n        the Nation and is intended to guide military programs, plans, \n        and budgets in the coming decades.\n            (16) The United States Government pays China a substantial \n        amount of interest on China's $1,144,000,000,000 in holdings of \n        United States Government debt, and this enhances China's \n        ability to fund its own military programs.\n            (17) According to a March 4, 2011, report by Xinhua, the \n        official press agency of the government of the People's \n        Republic of China, China plans to increase its 2011 military \n        budget by 12.7 percent to 601,000,000,000 yuan (the equivalent \n        of $91,500,000,000). This increase is in addition to China's \n        2010 increase in its military budget of 7.5 percent.\n            (18) According to the Department of Defense's (DoD) 2010 \n        report entitled ``Military and Security Developments Involving \n        the People's Republic of China,'' the DoD estimates China's \n        actual total military-related spending for 2009 to be over \n        $150,000,000,000.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the growing Federal debt of the United States has the \n        potential to jeopardize the national security and economic \n        stability of the United States;\n            (2) the increasing dependence of the United States on \n        foreign creditors has the potential to make the United States \n        vulnerable to undue influence by certain foreign creditors in \n        national security and economic policymaking;\n            (3) the People's Republic of China is the largest foreign \n        creditor of the United States, in terms of its overall holdings \n        of debt instruments of the United States;\n            (4) the current level of transparency in the scope and \n        extent of foreign holdings of debt instruments of the United \n        States is inadequate and needs to be improved, particularly \n        regarding the holdings of the People's Republic of China;\n            (5) through the People's Republic of China's large holdings \n        of debt instruments of the United States, China has become a \n        super creditor of the United States;\n            (6) under certain circumstances, the holdings of the \n        People's Republic of China could give China a tool with which \n        China can try to manipulate the domestic and foreign \n        policymaking of the United States, including the United States \n        relationship with Taiwan;\n            (7) under certain circumstances, if the People's Republic \n        of China were to be displeased with a given United States \n        policy or action, China could attempt to destabilize the United \n        States economy by rapidly divesting large portions of China's \n        holdings of debt instruments of the United States; and\n            (8) the People's Republic of China's expansive holdings of \n        such debt instruments of the United States could potentially \n        pose a direct threat to the United States economy and to United \n        States national security. This potential threat is a \n        significant issue that warrants further analysis and \n        evaluation.\n\nSEC. 5.
