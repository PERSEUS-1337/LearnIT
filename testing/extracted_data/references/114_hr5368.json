ENHANCED SECURITY MEASURES FOR SHIPMENTS OF SECURITY SENSITIVE \n              MATERIAL.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment \nof this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall issue regulations to \nrequire enhanced security measures for shipments of security sensitive \nmaterial.\n    (b) Security Sensitive Material.--The Secretary shall designate a \nmaterial, or a group or class of material, in a particular amount and \nform as security sensitive if the Secretary determines that \ntransporting the material in commerce poses a significant risk to \nnational security due to the potential use of the material in an act of \nterrorism. In making such a designation, the Secretary shall consider \nthe following:\n            (1) A highway route-controlled quantity of a Class 7 \n        (radioactive) material, as defined in section 173.403 of title \n        49, Code of Federal Regulations, in a motor vehicle, railroad \n        car, or freight container.\n            (2) More than 25 kilograms of a division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 \n        explosive, as defined in section 173.50 of title 49, Code of \n        Federal Regulations, in a motor vehicle, rail car, or freight \n        container.\n            (3) More than one liter per package of a material poisonous \n        by inhalation, as defined in section 171.8 of title 49, Code of \n        Federal Regulations, that meets the criteria for hazard zone A, \n        as specified in section 173.116(a) or section 173.133(a) of \n        title 49, Code of Federal Regulations.\n            (4) A shipment of a quantity of hazardous materials in a \n        bulk packaging having a capacity equal to or greater than \n        13,248 liters for liquids or gases or more than 13.24 cubic \n        meters for solids.\n            (5) A select agent or toxin regulated by the Centers for \n        Disease Control and Prevention under part 73 of title 42, Code \n        of Federal Regulations.\n            (6) A quantity of hazardous material that requires \n        placarding under the provisions of subpart F of part 172 of \n        title 49, Code of Federal Regulations.\n    (c) Compilation of Route and Storage Pattern Information for \nRailroad Carriers Transporting Security Sensitive Material.--Not later \nthan 90 days after the last day of each calendar year, a railroad \ncarrier that transports security sensitive material shall compile \ncommodity data by route and storage pattern, a line segment or series \nof line segments as aggregated by the railroad carrier. Within a \nrailroad carrier selected route, the commodity data shall identify the \ngeographic location of the route and storage pattern and the total \nnumber of shipments by United Nations identification number for \nsecurity sensitive material and storage patterns along the route.\n    (d) Rail Transportation Route and Storage Pattern Analysis for \nSecurity Sensitive Material.--For each calendar year, a railroad \ncarrier that transports security sensitive material shall submit to the \nSecretary a written analysis of the security risks for the \ntransportation routes and storage patterns identified in the commodity \ndata collected as required by subsection (c). The analysis shall \ninclude the security risks present for the route, railroad facilities, \nrailroad storage facilities, private storage facilities, and areas of \nconcern along or in proximity to the route.\n    (e) Alternative Route and Storage Pattern Analysis for Security \nSensitive Material.--\n            (1) In general.--Before the last day of each calendar year, \n        a railroad carrier that transports security sensitive material \n        shall submit to the Secretary of Transportation a report \n        containing--\n                    (A) a description of any practical alternative \n                routes and storage patterns that avoid areas of concern \n                for each of the transportation routes or facilities \n                such carrier used to transport or store security \n                sensitive material through or near areas of concern \n                during such calendar year;\n                    (B) a security risk assessment of each alternative \n                route and storage pattern that includes the information \n                required under subsection (d); and\n                    (C) a comparison of the risks identified under \n                subparagraph (B) to the applicable primary rail \n                transportation route and storage pattern analyzed under \n                subsection (d).\n            (2) Considerations.--A railroad carrier shall consider the \n        availability of interchange agreements or systems of tracks and \n        facilities owned by other operators when determining whether an \n        alternate route for transporting security sensitive material to \n        avoid areas of concern is practical pursuant to paragraph \n        (1)(A).\n            (3) Impractical alternative route or storage facility.--A \n        railroad carrier may consider an alternate route or storage \n        facility that avoids an area of concern to not be a practical \n        alternative route and storage pattern under paragraph (1)(A) \n        if--\n                    (A) the shipment originates in or is destined for \n                the area of concern; or\n                    (B) there would be no harm beyond the property of \n                the railroad carrier transporting the shipment or \n                storage facility storing the shipment in the event of a \n                successful terrorist attack on the shipment.\n    (f) Alternative Route and Storage Pattern Selection for Security \nSensitive Material.--Not later than 90 days after submission of a \nreport under subsection (e), the railroad carrier shall begin using the \nroute and storage pattern that, as determined by the analyses required \nunder subsections (d) and (e), best reduces the risk, including \nconsequences, of a terrorist attack on, or derailment of, a shipment of \nsecurity sensitive material that is transported through or near an area \nof concern.\n    (g) Review.--Not less than once every 5 years, each railroad \ncarrier that transports security sensitive material shall conduct a \ncomprehensive, system-wide review of all operational changes, \ninfrastructure modifications, traffic adjustments, changes in the \nnature of the areas of concern located along or in proximity to the \nroute, or other changes affecting the security of the movements of the \nmaterials determined to be security sensitive under subsection (b) that \nwere implemented during the 5-year period.\n    (h) Definitions.--In this section, the following definitions apply:\n            (1) Area of concern.--The term ``area of concern'' means a \n        geographic region designated by the Secretary of Transportation \n        as commanding special consideration with respect to the \n        security of the transportation of security sensitive material, \n        which shall include high threat urban areas as determined by \n        the Secretary.\n            (2) Railroad carrier.--The term ``railroad carrier'' has \n        the meaning given that term in section 20102 of title 49, \n        United States Code.\n            (3) Security sensitive material.--The term ``security \n        sensitive material'' means a material determined by the \n        Secretary of Transportation to be security sensitive pursuant \n        to subsection (b).\n            (4) Storage pattern.--The term ``storage pattern'' means \n        the conditions of storage, including--\n                    (A) location of cars in railroad yards or on \n                railroad-controlled leased tracks;\n                    (B) type of storage, such as bulk transfer;\n                    (C) typical types and numbers of security sensitive \n                material cars stored in close proximity (in ranges);\n                    (D) population density;\n                    (E) average length of time cars are stored, \n                attended or unattended; and\n                    (F) security measures present, including physical \n                security measures, secure handoffs and nearest \n                available safe havens for storage in case of heightened \n                threat conditions.\n            (5) Terrorism.--The term ``terrorism'' has the meaning \n        given that term in section 2 of the Homeland Security Act of \n        2002 (6 U.S.C. 101)."
