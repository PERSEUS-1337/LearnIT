FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Congress finds that:\n            (1) The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 \n        enbodied a visionary concept--that a portion of the proceeds \n        from Outer Continental Shelf mineral leasing revenues and the \n        depletion of a nonrenewable natural resource should result in a \n        legacy of public places accessible for public recreation and \n        benefit from resources belongings to all people, of all \n        generations, and the enhancement of the most precious and most \n        renewable natural resource of any nation, healthy and active \n        citizens.\n            (2) The States and local governments were to occupy a \n        pivotal role in accomplishing the purposes of the Land and \n        Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 and the Act originally \n        provided an equitable portion of funds to the States, and \n        through them, to local governments.\n            (3) However, because of competition for limited federal \n        monies and the need for an annual appropriation, this original \n        intention has been abandoned and, in recent years, the States \n        have not received an equitable proportion of funds.\n            (4) Nonetheless, with population growth and urban sprawl, \n        the demand for recreation areas and open spaces, at the state \n        and local level, remains a high priority for our citizens.\n            (5) A new vision is called for--a vision that encompasses a \n        multi-level national network of parks, recreation areas, open \n        space preserves and greenways that reaches across the country \n        to touch all communities. National parks are not enough; the \n        federal government alone cannot accomplish this. A bold \n        national vision, backed by realistic national funding support, \n        to stimulate state, local and private sector, as well as \n        federal efforts, is the only way to effectively address our \n        ongoing recreation and open space conservation needs.\n            (6) On June 19, 1997, the United States Supreme Court held \n        in United States v. Alaska (No. 84 original) that the United \n        States retains title to lands underlying the tidal waters off \n        the State of Alaska's North Slope.\n            (7) As a result of the Supreme Court decision, \n        approximately $1,600,000,000 in escrowed oil and gas lease sale \n        revenues are to be received by the United States. These funds \n        are double the amount included by the Congressional Budget \n        Office in revenue estimates for the concurrent resolution on \n        the budget.\n            (8) By placing these escrowed funds in an interest bearing \n        account a permanent source of monies for state and local \n        recreation and conservation acquisition, planning and \n        development can be established.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to revitalize state, local \nand private commitments envisioned in the Land and Water Conservation \nFund Act of 1965 by creating a new Community Recreation and \nConservation Endowment with the escrowed oil and gas lease sale \nrevenues received by the United States pursuant to the Supreme Court \ndecision in United States v. Alaska to provide funding for state, local \nand urban recreation and conservation needs.\n\nSEC 3. COMMUNITY RECREATION AND CONSERVATION ENDOWMENT.\n\n    Section 6 of the Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. \n460l-8) is amended by inserting the following new subsection at the \nbeginning:\n    ``(a) Community Recreation and Conservation Endowment.--\n            ``(1) Special account.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n        of law, all escrowed oil and gas revenues and interest received \n        by the United States pursuant to the June 19, 1997 Supreme \n        Court decision in United States v. Alaska shall be deposited in \n        a special account in the Treasury of the United States, to be \n        known as the `Community Recreation and Conservation Endowment \n        Account', for use pursuant to the provisions of this section.\n            ``(2) Investment of special account.--All funds deposited \n        as principal in the Community Recreation and Conservation \n        Endowment Account shall earn interest in the amount determined \nby the Secretary of the Treasury. Such interest shall be added to the \nprincipal of the account and be expended according to the provisions of \nthis section.\n            ``(3) Expenditure of special account.--Interest on the \n        Community Recreation and Conservation Endowment Account shall \n        be available without further appropriation at the beginning of \n        each fiscal year for expenditure by the Secretary of the \n        Interior (hereinafter referred to as the `Secretary') for \n        purposes of providing monies to the states according to the \n        provisions of this section.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
