FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On November 4, 1979, the Iranian militants seized the \n        United States Embassy in Tehran, Iran, and held 52 Americans \n        hostage for 444 days until their negotiated release on January \n        20, 1981.\n            (2) On January 19, 1981, the Department of State entered \n        into a series of agreements with Iran that came to be known as \n        the Algiers Accords. The accords established the United States-\n        Iran Claims Tribunal to adjudicate United States and Iranian \n        commercial claims. The Accords, however, sought to preclude the \n        52 American hostages or their families from bringing suit \n        against Iran for their seizure, detention, torture, and \n        injuries.\n            (3) On December 29, 2000, the 52 American hostages and \n        their spouses and children filed suit in the United States \n        District Court for the District of Columbia, pursuant to the \n        Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Public \n        Law 104-132).\n            (4) On August 6, 2001, the District Court entered a default \n        judgment against Iran after certifying the case as a class \n        action.\n            (5) The Department of State moved to vacate the decision of \n        the District Court, despite Iran's continued refusal to appear \n        in court.\n            (6) In response to the motion to vacate by the Department \n        of State, Congress amended the Antiterrorism and Effective \n        Death Penalty Act of 1996 by adding language to allow the claim \n        of the hostages to proceed to judgment. The accompanying \n        Conference Report specifically stated that the amendment \n        ``quashes the State Department's motion to vacate the judgment \n        obtained by plaintiffs in Case Number 1:00CV03110 (ESG) in the \n        United States District Court for the District of Columbia''.\n            (7) Congress further reaffirmed this view by enacting \n        section 208 of division B of Public Law 107-117, making a \n        technical correction to the case number.\n            (8) On May 12, 2003, during oral arguments, the United \n        States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \n        noted that the agreements reached pursuant to the Algiers \n        Accords ``were at the point of a gun'', and observed that the \n        Court ``doubt[ed] that the Government of the United States \n        would defend this agreement on the theory that we would have \n        entered into this voluntarily without them holding onto our \n        hostages''.\n            (9) On May 12, 2003, during oral arguments before the Court \n        of Appeals, the attorneys representing the Department of \n        Justice affirmed to the Court that ``both Congress and the \n        President, both the political branches in other words, have the \n        authority to abrogate the international obligations of the \n        United States''.\n\nSEC. 2. STATEMENTS OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Pursuit of Justice and Accountability.--It is the policy of the \nUnited States, as articulated in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death \nPenalty Act of 1996 and in other United States laws, to seek justice \nfor United States victims of terrorism and to hold terrorists and their \nstate-sponsors accountable for their actions.\n    (b) Preemption.--United States law regarding victims of terrorism \nsupersedes the Algiers Accords and any other agreement with Iran \nstemming from the holding of American hostages in Iran from November 4, \n1979, through January 20, 1981.\n\nSEC. 3. JUSTICE FOR FORMER AMERICAN HOSTAGES IN IRAN.\n\n    (a) Inapplicability of Algiers Accords.--Any provision of the \nAlgiers Accords, entered into with Iran on January 19, 1981, that \npurports to bar a citizen of the United States from prosecuting any \nclaim in any court of the United States or to limit the jurisdiction of \nany court of the United States is hereby abrogated and deemed \nnonapplicable.\n    (b) Common Fund for Hostages.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury, in \n        consultation with the Secretary of State, shall commence \n        payments to a common fund to be established and administered by \n        the certified class representatives for the former American \n        hostages in Iran and their survivors (as identified in case \n        number 1:00CV03110 (EGS) of the United States District Court \n        for the District of Columbia). Such common fund shall--\n                    (A) be administered to pay claims to the Americans \n                held hostage in Iran, and to members of their families, \n                who are identified as class members in case number \n                1:00CV03110 (EGS) of the United States District Court \n                for the District of Columbia; and\n                    (B) be administered solely for purposes of \n                satisfying such claims, as approved by the certified \n                class representatives identified in that case number.\n            (2) Funding.--Payments to the fund under paragraph (1) \n        shall be derived from the liquidation of blocked assets (as \n        defined in section 201(d)(2) of the Terrorism Risk Insurance \n        Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-297; 28 U.S.C. 1610 note) with \n        respect to Iran, and from amounts in the Iran Foreign Military \n        Sales Fund account within the Foreign Military Sales Fund. The \n        Secretary of the Treasury may liquidate such assets for \n        purposes of this subsection.\n            (3) Amount.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall make \n        payments into the fund in amounts equal to--\n                    (A) for each former hostage identified as a class \n                member under paragraph (1)(A), $1,000 for each day of \n                captivity;\n                    (B) for each spouse and child identified as a class \n                member under pareagraph (1)(A), $500 for each day of \n                captivity of the former hostages; and\n                    (C) interest on each amount under subparagraph (A) \n                and (B), calculated at the daily prime rate, as \n                determined by the Board of Governors of the Federal \n                Reserve System, for the period from the date of the \n                taking of the hostages until the date of payment under \n                this section."
