FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The persistence of decades-old violence, conflict, and \n        instability in the Middle East gravely affects the national \n        security of the United States and peace and stability \n        throughout the world.\n            (2) The ongoing Israeli-Palestinian and broader Arab-\n        Israeli conflicts strengthen extremists and opponents of peace \n        throughout the region.\n            (3) The establishment of peace between Israelis and \n        Palestinians, Muslims, Christians, and Jews, in the Middle East \n        is in the vital interests of the United States, Israelis, \n        Palestinians, the region, and the world.\n            (4) While the United States and its international allies \n        continue to support diplomatic and political negotiations \n        between the national government representatives of the parties \n        to the conflict, such efforts require broad popular support \n        among the Israeli, Palestinian, Muslim, Christian, and Jewish \n        peoples in order to succeed. Indeed, political agreements may \n        never arrive or endure without substantial public support.\n            (5) Through many independent nongovernmental activities, \n        tens of thousands of Israelis and Palestinians, and Muslims, \n        Christians, and Jews, already work together to build better \n        relations between peoples, through people-to-people coexistence \n        and reconciliation activities and other cooperative efforts.\n            (6) Such civil society initiatives promote contact, \n        cooperation, dialogue, shared community building, peaceful \n        coexistence, joint economic development, and reconciliation \n        between Israelis and Palestinians, and Muslims, Christians, and \n        Jews, in the Middle East and thereby constitute a key means for \n        building grassroots support for a peaceful resolution to the \n        conflict.\n            (7) By working together, building positive relationships, \n        learning about each other, and interacting regularly in their \n        daily lives, participants in such activities come to recognize \n        the human face of people across conflict lines, understand that \n        people of good will seek peaceful coexistence, and support \n        efforts to marginalize extremists and build peace. The impact \n        of these programs spreads from participants to their families \n        and communities.\n            (8) These tangible initiatives also provide much-needed \n        services to individuals and communities in their everyday \n        lives, helping Israelis and Palestinians, and Muslims, \n        Christians, and Jews, in the region work, learn, and play \n        together; solve shared problems; and build socially and \n        economically stronger societies. These efforts extend into \n        every sphere of everyday life, promoting cooperation in \n        business, education, healthcare, community building, sports, \n        the environment, and the arts.\n            (9) While such efforts have demonstrated inspiring success \n        and touched tens of thousands of people, severely limited \n        funding has heretofore prevented them from reaching millions of \n        Israelis, Palestinians, Muslims, Christians, and Jews and thus \n        having a truly widespread impact on popular support for peace.\n            (10) Majorities of Israelis and Palestinians privately \n        indicate their support for peace and a final settlement of the \n        conflict, but extensive, direct grassroots efforts are needed \n        to mobilize these silent majorities into active and vocal \n        constituents for peace.\n            (11) Dramatically increased funding, coordination, and \n        support for people-to-people coexistence, reconciliation, and \n        joint economic initiatives can engage millions of ordinary \n        citizens affected by this conflict in building support for \n        peace.\n            (12) Working together, the United States, nations around \n        the world, and the private sector can catalyze widespread \n        support for peace with the establishment and funding of an \n        independent International Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace, \n        to promote contact, cooperation, dialogue, shared community \n        building, peaceful coexistence, joint economic development, and \n        reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians, and Muslims, \n        Christians and Jews, in the Middle East.\n            (13) Such a Fund will be an expert coordinating body, \n        adhering to best practices for governance, transparency, and \n        accountability. It will ensure that the United States and the \n        international community stand fully behind the brave Israelis \n        and Palestinians and Muslims, Christians, and Jews willing to \n        work together for peace and a better future. It will be an \n        ongoing presence and catalyst, building broad public support \n        for a lasting peace in the region. The Fund is not intended to \n        be a political forum, but a grant-making body.\n    (b) Purposes.--Therefore, the purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To urge the President to make every effort, in \n        conjunction with the Government of Israel, the Palestinian \n        Authority, and the international community to establish a non-\n        political International Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace to \n        promote and support contact, cooperation, dialogue, shared \n        community building, peaceful coexistence, joint economic \n        development, and reconciliation between Israelis and \n        Palestinians, and Muslims, Christians, and Jews.\n            (2) To provide for United States contributions to consist \n        of Economic Support Fund assistance for payment to the \n        International Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace to carry out \n        the activities described in paragraph (1).\n\nSEC. 3.
