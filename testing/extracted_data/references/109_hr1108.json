FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) An estimated 25,000,000 people in the United States are \n        affected by a liver or liver-related disease.\n            (2) In excess of $8,800,000,000 is spent annually to \n        provide medical care for people in the United States with liver \n        disease.\n            (3) There are over 4,000,000 people in the United States \n        who are or have been infected with hepatitis C, 3,000,000 of \n        whom are chronically infected.\n            (4) Due to limited research, current treatments for \n        hepatitis C are effective in fewer than 50 percent of the \n        cases.\n            (5) A vaccine has not been developed for hepatitis C.\n            (6) There are 8,000 to 10,000 deaths each year due to \n        hepatitis C, and the annual death total is projected to \n        increase to 30,000 each year absent increased public health and \n        research interventions.\n            (7) Chronic infection with hepatitis B or C is associated \n        with an increased incidence of primary liver cancer, once a \n        rare malignancy in the United States, but now the fastest \n        growing cancer.\n            (8) There are 1,250,000 people in the United States who \n        have been infected with hepatitis B.\n            (9) Up to 15 percent of Asian and Pacific-Islander \n        Americans are chronically infected with hepatitis B.\n            (10) Fifteen out of every 100,000 people in the United \n        States are affected by a chronic, life-threatening disease \n        known as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and 95 percent of \n        those affected are women.\n            (11) There is an emerging obesity-related chronic liver \n        disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which may \n        affect as many as 1 in every 4 adults over the age of 18.\n            (12) There are 15,000 children hospitalized in the United \n        States each year due to liver disease.\n            (13) The only option for many individuals with liver \n        disease is a liver transplant.\n            (14) There are over 17,600 people in the United States on \n        the waiting list for a liver transplant, but because of the \n        limited supply of livers available for transplantation only \n        approximately 5,100 transplants are performed each year.\n            (15) There are 1,400 people in the United States who die \n        each year waiting for a liver transplant, and that number is \n        expected to increase.\n            (16) To address the public health threat posed by liver \n        disease, there is a need for the establishment of a National \n        Center on Liver Disease Research to provide dedicated \n        scientific leadership, to create a research action plan, and to \n        ensure the funding of the scientific opportunities identified \n        by the plan.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL CENTER ON LIVER DISEASE RESEARCH.\n\n    Subpart 3 of part C of title IV of the Public Health Service Act \n(42 U.S.C. 285c, et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n\n              ``national center on liver disease research\n\n    ``Sec. 434B. (a) Establishment.--There is established the National \nCenter on Liver Disease Research (hereafter in this section referred to \nas the `Center') in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive \nand Kidney Diseases.\n    ``(b) Director.--The Center shall be headed by a Director, who \nshall be appointed by the Director of the Institute, in consultation \nwith the Director of NIH, from among individuals with the highest \nscientific credentials.

The Director of NIH shall \n        invite 1 representative of the Centers for Disease Prevention \n        and Control, 1 representative of the Food and Drug \n        Administration, and 1 representative of the Department of \n        Veterans Affairs to serve as such a member. Each ex officio \n        member of the Advisory Board may appoint an individual to serve \n        as that member's representative on the Advisory Board.\n    ``(e) Liver Disease Research Action Plan.--\n            ``(1) Development.--Not later than 15 months after the date \n        of the enactment of the Liver Research Enhancement Act of 2005, \n        the Advisory Board shall develop (with appropriate support from \n        the Director and staff of the Center) a comprehensive plan for \n        the conduct and support of liver disease research to be known \n        as the Liver Disease Research Action Plan.
