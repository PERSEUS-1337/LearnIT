SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Routine HIV \nScreening Coverage Act of 2009''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) HIV/AIDS continues to infect and kill thousands of \n        Americans, 25 years after the first cases were reported.\n            (2) It has been estimated that at least 1.6 million \n        Americans have been infected with HIV since the beginning of \n        the epidemic and over 500,000 of them have died.\n            (3) The HIV/AIDS epidemic has disproportionately impacted \n        African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans and its impact on \n        women is growing.\n            (4) It has been estimated that almost one quarter of those \n        infected with HIV in the United States do not know they are \n        infected.\n            (5) Not all individuals who have been infected with HIV \n        demonstrate clinical indications or fall into high risk \n        categories.\n            (6) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \n        determined that increasing the proportion of people who know \n        their HIV status is an essential component of comprehensive \n        HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention efforts and that early \n        diagnosis is critical in order for people with HIV/AIDS to \n        receive life-extending therapy.\n            (7) On September 21, 2006, the Centers for Disease Control \n        and Prevention released new guidelines that recommend routine \n        HIV screening in health care settings for all patients aged 13-\n        64, regardless of risk.\n            (8) Standard health insurance plans generally cover HIV \n        screening when there are clinical indications of infection or \n        when there are known risk factors present.\n            (9) Requiring health insurance plans to cover routine HIV \n        screening could play a critical role in preventing the spread \n        of HIV/AIDS and allowing infected individuals to receive \n        effective treatment.\n\nSEC. 2.
