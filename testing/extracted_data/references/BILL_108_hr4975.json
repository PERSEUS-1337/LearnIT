REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO PREVENTION OF POLLUTION FROM VESSELS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Pollution prevention devices required on vessels are \n        designed to reduce pollution. If they malfunction or are not \n        functioning then they cannot prevent pollution.\n            (2) Ensuring that these anti-pollution devices are \n        functioning will ensure a reduction in pollution and will also \n        give authorities advanced warning of pollution that has \n        occurred.\n            (3) Requiring biannual inspections of pollution prevention \n        equipment on vessels will ensure that such equipment is fully \n        operational and can ensure that it will perform its designed \n        task to its full potential.\n            (4) Department of Justice officials have found in a number \n        of cases fabricated entries in vessel oil record books that \n        give a false sense of compliance with MARPOL discharge \n        limitations.\n            (5) Recording shore-side disposal of garbage and sludge \n        from vessels will help to identify violators and help to deter \n        others from unlawful discharges at sea.\n            (6) Making violations of this Act a felony will have a \n        deterrent effect. Imposing stiff fines will also accomplish \n        that goal.\n    (b) Toll-Free Telephone Number for Reporting Illegal Dumping.--The \nSecretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall \nprescribe regulations by not later than 6 months after the date of the \nenactment of this Act that require--\n            (1) that each cruise vessel that enters a port or place in \n        the United States while operating in the foreign or domestic \n        commerce of the United States must have posted, in elevators \n        and other common areas of the vessel, a notice stating--\n                    (A) that any passenger who witnesses illegal \n                dumping from the vessel into waters of the United \n                States may report that dumping to the Coast Guard by \n                calling a toll-free telephone number of the National \n                Response Center or another appropriate office of the \n                Coast Guard; and\n                    (B) such telephone numbers; and\n            (2) that the notice prescribed under paragraph (1) must be \n        included on each ticket for carriage of a passenger on such a \n        vessel in such commerce.\n    (c) Prohibitions.--It shall be unlawful--\n            (1) for any vessel to enter a port or place in the United \n        States if--\n                    (A) the vessel does not have on board all pollution \n                prevention equipment otherwise required by law that \n                functions in proper functioning condition; or\n                    (B) does not comply with requirements that apply to \n                the vessel under regulations prescribed under \n                subsection (b);\n            (2) to make any false entry in--\n                    (A) any oil record book for a vessel; or\n                    (B) any record of a vessel of shore-side disposal \n                of garbage or sludge from the vessel;\n            (3) to operate any cruise vessel in the foreign or domestic \n        commerce of the United States that does not comply with any \n        requirement that applies to the vessel under regulations \n        prescribed subsection (b); or\n            (4) to sell a ticket referred to in paragraph (2) of \n        subsection (b) that does not include any notice required under \n        regulations prescribed under subsection (b).\n    (d) Inspections.--The Secretary of the department in which the \nCoast Guard is operating shall biannually inspect each vessel that is \ndocumented under the laws of the United States to determine whether--\n            (1) the vessel has on board all pollution prevention \n        equipment required under subsection (c);\n            (2) such equipment functions properly; and\n            (3) in the case of a cruise vessel, the vessel complies \n        with requirements that apply to the vessel under regulations \n        prescribed under subsection (b).\n    (e) Penalty.--Any person that violates this section, and the owner \nor operator of a vessel that violates this section, shall be fined \nunder title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned for one year and a \nday (or such longer period as may apply under another provision of \nlaw), or both.\n    (f) Relationship to Other Law.--This section is not intended to \naffect the application of any other provision of law.\n    (g) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1)  cruise vessel.--\n                    (A) In general.--The term ``cruise vessel'' means a \n                passenger vessel (as defined in section 2101(22) of \n                title 46, United States Code), that--\n                            (i) is authorized to carry at least 250 \n                        passengers; and\n                            (ii) has onboard sleeping facilities for \n                        each passenger.\n                    (B) Exclusions.--The term ``cruise vessel'' does \n                not include--\n                            (i) a vessel of the United States operated \n                        by the Federal Government; or\n                            (ii) a vessel owned and operated by the \n                        government of a State.\n            (2) Passenger.--\n                    (A) In general.--The term ``passenger'' means any \n                person on board a cruise vessel for the purpose of \n                travel.\n                    (B) Inclusions.-- The term ``passenger'' includes--\n                            (i) a paying passenger; and\n                            (ii) a staffperson, such as a crew member, \n                        captain, or officer."
