REPORT ON LONG-TERM COSTS OF OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM AND \n              OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States has been engaged in military \n        operations in Afghanistan since October 2001 as Operation \n        Enduring Freedom and in military operations in Iraq since March \n        2003 as Operation Iraqi Freedom and its successor contingency \n        operation, Operation New Dawn.\n            (2) According to the Congressional Research Service, \n        through fiscal year 2013, Congress has appropriated \n        $1,500,000,000,000 for the Department of Defense, for the State \n        Department, and for medical costs paid by the Department of \n        Veterans Affairs. This amount includes $821,000,000,000 related \n        to operations in Iraq and $645,000,000,000 related to \n        operations in Afghanistan.\n            (3) Over 90 percent of the funds appropriated for the \n        Department of Defense for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan \n        have been provided as supplemental or additional appropriations \n        and designated as an emergency funding requirement.\n            (4) The Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional \n        Research Service have stated that future costs for operations \n        in Iraq and Afghanistan are difficult to estimate because the \n        Department of Defense provides little information on costs \n        incurred to date and actual expenditure for operations in Iraq \n        and Afghanistan (because war and baseline funds are mixed in \n        the same accounts) and because of a lack of information from \n        the Department of Defense on many of the key factors that \n        determine costs, including personnel levels and the pace of \n        operations.\n            (5) Over 2,400,000 members of the United States Armed \n        Forces have served in Afghanistan and Iraq since the beginning \n        of the conflicts.\n            (6) Over 4,400 members of the Armed Forces and Department \n        of Defense civilian personnel have been killed in Operation \n        Iraqi Freedom, and over 2,100 members of the Armed Forces and \n        Department of Defense civilian personnel have been killed in \n        Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.\n            (7) Over 1,715 members of the Armed Forces have suffered \n        amputations as a result of wounds or other injuries incurred in \n        Afghanistan or Iraq.\n            (8) More than 250,000 veterans of military service in Iraq \n        and Afghanistan have been treated for mental health conditions, \n        more than 100,000 of these veterans have been diagnosed with \n        post-traumatic stress disorder, and approximately 253,330 of \n        these veterans have a confirmed traumatic brain injury \n        diagnosis.\n            (9) Approximately 54 percent of veterans of military \n        service in Iraq and Afghanistan have sought treatment at a \n        Department of Veterans Affairs hospital or medical clinic.\n            (10) The Independent Review Group on Rehabilitative Care \n        and Administrative Processes at Walter Reed Army Medical Center \n        and National Naval Medical Center identified traumatic brain \n        injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, increased survival of \n        severe burns, and traumatic amputations as the four signature \n        wounds of the current conflicts, and the Independent Review \n        Group report states that the recovery process ``can take months \n        or years and must accommodate recurring or delayed \n        manifestations of symptoms, extended rehabilitation and all the \n        life complications that emerge over time from such trauma''.\n    (b) Report Requirement.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \nthe enactment of this Act, the President, with contributions from the \nSecretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs, shall submit to Congress a report containing an \nestimate of previous costs of Operation New Dawn (the successor \ncontingency operation to Operation Iraqi Freedom) and the long-term \ncosts of Operation Enduring Freedom for a scenario, determined by the \nPresident and based on current contingency operation and withdrawal \nplans, that takes into account expected force levels and the expected \nlength of time that members of the Armed Forces will be deployed in \nsupport of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n    (c) Estimates To Be Used in Preparation of Report.--In preparing \nthe report required by subsection (b), the President shall make \nestimates and projections through at least fiscal year 2023, adjust any \ndollar amounts appropriately for inflation, and take into account and \nspecify each of the following:\n            (1) The total number of members of the Armed Forces \n        expected to be deployed in support of Operation Enduring \n        Freedom, including--\n                    (A) the number of members of the Armed Forces \n                actually deployed in Southwest Asia in support of \n                Operation Enduring Freedom;\n                    (B) the number of members of reserve components of \n                the Armed Forces called or ordered to active duty in \n                the United States for the purpose of training for \n                eventual deployment in Southwest Asia, backfilling for \n                deployed troops, or supporting other Department of \n                Defense missions directly or indirectly related to \n                Operation Enduring Freedom;
