Indian tribes exercise inherent sovereign \n        powers over their members and territory. The United States \n        continues to work with Indian tribes on a government-to-\n        government basis to address issues concerning Indian tribal \n        self-government, tribal trust resources, and Indian tribal \n        treaty and other rights.\n            (3) The United States recognizes the right of Indian tribes \n        to self-government and supports tribal sovereignty and self-\n        determination.\n\nSEC. 4.
