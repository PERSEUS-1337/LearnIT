FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) mercury and mercury compounds are highly toxic to \n        humans, ecosystems, and wildlife;\n            (2) as many as 10 percent of women in the United States of \n        childbearing age have mercury in their bloodstreams at a level \n        that could pose risks to their unborn babies, and as many as \n        630,000 children born annually in the United States are at risk \n        of neurological problems relating to mercury exposure in utero;\n            (3) the most significant source of mercury exposure to \n        people in the United States is ingestion of mercury-\n        contaminated fish;\n            (4) the long-term solution to mercury pollution is to \n        minimize global mercury use and releases of mercury to \n        eventually achieve reduced contamination levels in the \n        environment, rather than reducing fish consumption, since \n        uncontaminated fish represents a critical and healthy source of \n        nutrition for people worldwide;\n            (5) mercury pollution is a transboundary pollutant that--\n                    (A) is deposited locally, regionally, and globally; \n                and\n                    (B) affects bodies of water near industrial areas, \n                such as the Great Lakes, as well as bodies of water in \n                remote areas, such as the Arctic Circle;\n            (6) of the approximately 30 plants in the United States \n        that produce chlorine, only 7 use the obsolete ``mercury cell'' \n        chlor-alkali process, and 4 have not yet committed to phasing \n        out mercury use;\n            (7) an estimated additional 24,000 to 30,000 tons of \n        mercury are used at mercury cell chlor-alkali plants worldwide;\n            (8)(A) less than 10 percent of the total quantity of \n        chlorine and caustic soda produced in the United States comes \n        from the chlor-alkali plants described in paragraph (7) that \n        use the mercury cell chlor-alkali process;\n            (B) cost-effective alternatives are available and in use in \n        the remaining 90 percent of chlorine and caustic soda \n        production; and\n            (C) other countries, including Japan, have already banned \n        the mercury cell chlor-alkali process;\n            (9) the chlor-alkali industry acknowledges that--\n                    (A) mercury can contaminate products manufactured \n                at mercury cell facilities; and\n                    (B) the use of some of those products results in \n                the direct and indirect release of mercury;\n            (10) despite those quantities of mercury known to have been \n        used or to be in use, neither the chlor-alkali industry nor the \n        Environmental Protection Agency is able--\n                    (A) to adequately account for the disposition of \n                the mercury used at those facilities; or\n                    (B) to accurately estimate current mercury \n                emissions; and\n            (11) it is critically important that the United States work \n        aggressively toward the minimization of supply, demand, and \n        releases of mercury, both domestically and internationally.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    Congress declares that the United States should develop policies \nand programs that will--\n            (1) reduce mercury use and emissions within the United \n        States;\n            (2) reduce mercury releases from the reservoir of mercury \n        currently in use or circulation within the United States; and\n            (3) reduce exposures to mercury, particularly exposures of \n        women of childbearing age and young children.\n\nSEC. 4. USE OF MERCURY IN CHLORINE AND CAUSTIC SODA MANUFACTURING.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title I of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 \nU.S.C. 2601 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 6 the \nfollowing:\n\n``SEC. 6A.
