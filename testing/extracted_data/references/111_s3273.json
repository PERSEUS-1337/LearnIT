FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States and Mexico have recently experienced \n        a significant increase in violence along the international \n        border between the 2 countries.\n            (2) The international border between the United States and \n        Mexico is being used as a gateway for drug cartels and criminal \n        enterprises that are illegally trafficking guns, people, and \n        drugs.\n            (3) The partnership between the United States and Mexican \n        governments is critical--\n                    (A) to address recent border violence; and\n                    (B) to ensure the continued flow of legitimate \n                cross-border commerce, traffic and trade.\n            (4) The national security of the United States is \n        paramount.\n            (5) While it is the job of the Federal Government to \n        protect national security by securing our Nation's borders, \n        State, local, and tribal law enforcement entities also provide \n        the first line of defense on the border and are critical first \n        responders to national security or public safety threats.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) providing financial assistance for law enforcement \n        initiatives with our Mexican partners is important; and\n            (2) in addition to such assistance, Congress must provide \n        immediate resources and equipment to State and local law \n        enforcement entities that are currently responding to border \n        violence and criminal activities on a daily basis.\n\nSEC. 3.
