FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States should continue to lead the \n        international effort to identify, protect, and return looted \n        assets taken by the Nazis and their collaborators from victims \n        of the Holocaust.\n            (2) The citizens of the United States should understand \n        exactly how the United States Government dealt with the assets \n        looted from victims of the Nazis that came into its possession.\n            (3) The United States forces in Europe made extraordinary \n        efforts to locate and restitute assets taken by the Nazis and \n        their collaborators from victims of the Holocaust.\n            (4) However, the restitution policy formulated by the \n        United States and implemented in the countries in Europe \n        occupied by the United States had many inadequacies and fell \n        short of realizing the goal of returning stolen property to the \n        victims.\n            (5) As a result of these United States policies and their \n        implementation, there remain today many survivors or heirs of \n        survivors who have not had restored to them that which the \n        Nazis looted.\n            (6) The Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust \n        Assets in the United States, established in Public Law 105-186, \n        found the following:\n                    (A) Despite the undertaking by United States \n                agencies to preserve, protect, and return looted \n                assets, United States restitution policy could never \n                fully address the unimaginable dimension and complexity \n                of restituting assets to victims of the Holocaust. Many \n                inadequacies reveal that United States authorities were \n                driven by necessity, and practical concerns of \n                restitution commingled with conflicting interests, \n                priorities, and political considerations. Restitution \n                competed with, and was often subordinated to, the \n                desire to bring American troops home, the need to \n                rebuild devastated European economies, and provide \n                humanitarian assistance to millions of displaced \n                persons, and the Cold War.\n                    (B) With respect to many types of assets, the \n                United States followed international legal tradition \n                and undertook only to restore property to national \n                governments, which it assumed would be responsible for \n                satisfying the claims of their citizens. Because this \n                practice excluded those who no longer had a nation to \n                represent their interests, or who had fallen victim to \n                the Nazi genocide, the United States also designated \n                certain ``successor organizations'' to sell heirless \n                and unclaimed property and apply the proceeds to the \n                care, resettlement, and rehabilitation of surviving \n                victims. This practice led many assets to be too \n                hastily labeled as heirless or unidentifiable, with the \n                result that they were assigned to the successor \n                organizations, rather than returned to their rightful \n                owners.\n                    (C) Far more regrettable is the United States \n                failure to adequately assist victims, heirs, and \n                successor organizations to identify victims' assets, \n                instead relying upon them to present their own claims, \n                often within unrealistically short deadlines, with the \n                result that much victim property was never recovered.\n                    (D) Even when property was returned to individual \n                owners or their heirs, it was often only after \n                protracted, cumbersome, and expensive administrative \n                proceedings that yielded settlements far less than the \n                full value of the assets concerned.\n                    (E) While the overall record of the United States \n                is one in which its citizens can legitimately take \n                pride, even the most farsighted and best-intentioned \n                policies intended to restitute stolen property to its \n                country of origin failed to realize the goal of \n                returning property to the victims who suffered the \n                loss.\n                    (F) In many instances, policy and circumstance \n                combined and led to results that can be improved upon \n                now, to provide a modicum of justice to Holocaust \n                victims and their heirs and in memory of those who did \n                not survive.\n            (7) The United States Government should promote both the \n        review of Holocaust-era assets in Federal, State, and private \n        institutions, and the return of such assets to victims or their \n        heirs.\n            (8) The best way to achieve this is to create a single \n        institution to serve as a centralized repository for research \n        and information about Holocaust-era assets.\n            (9) Enhancing these policies will also assist victims of \n        future armed conflicts around the world.\n            (10) The Government of the United States has worked to \n        address the consequences of the National Socialist era with \n        other governments and nongovernmental organizations, including \n        the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, which \n        has worked since 1951 with the Government of the United States \n        and with other governments to accomplish material restitution \n        of the looted assets of Holocaust victims, wherever those \n        assets were identified, and has played a major role in \n        allocating restitution funds and funds contributed by the \nUnited States and other donor countries to the Nazi Persecutee Relief \nFund.\n\nSEC. 3.
