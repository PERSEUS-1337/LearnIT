REDUCING THE PROLIFERATION OF BOUTIQUE FUELS.\n\n    (a) Temporary Waivers During Supply Emergencies.--Section \n211(c)(4)(C) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(c)(4)(C)) is amended \nby inserting ``(i)'' after ``(C)'' and by adding the following new \nclauses at the end thereof:\n    ``(ii) The Administrator may temporarily waive a control or \nprohibition respecting the use of a fuel or fuel additive required or \nregulated by the Administrator pursuant to subsection (c), (h), (i), \n(k), or (m) of this section or prescribed in an applicable \nimplementation plan under section 110 approved by the Administrator \nunder clause (i) of this subparagraph if, after consultation with, and \nconcurrence by, the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator determines \nthat--\n            ``(I) extreme and unusual fuel or fuel additive supply \n        circumstances exist in a State or region of the Nation which \n        prevent the distribution of an adequate supply of the fuel or \n        fuel additive to consumers;\n            ``(II) such extreme and unusual fuel and fuel additive \n        supply circumstances are the result of a natural disaster, an \n        Act of God, a pipeline or refinery equipment failure, or \n        another event that could not reasonably have been foreseen or \n        prevented and not the lack of prudent planning on the part of \n        the suppliers of the fuel or fuel additive to such State or \n        region; and\n            ``(III) it is in the public interest to grant the waiver \n        (for example, when a waiver is necessary to meet projected \n        temporary shortfalls in the supply of the fuel or fuel additive \n        in a State or region of the Nation which cannot otherwise be \n        compensated for).\n    ``(iii) If the Administrator makes the determinations required \nunder clause (ii), such a temporary extreme and unusual fuel and fuel \nadditive supply circumstances waiver shall be permitted only if--\n            ``(I) the waiver applies to the smallest geographic area \n        necessary to address the extreme and unusual fuel and fuel \n        additive supply circumstances;\n            ``(II) the waiver is effective for a period of 20 calendar \n        days or, if the Administrator determines that a shorter waiver \n        period is adequate, for the shortest practicable time period \n        necessary to permit the correction of the extreme and unusual \n        fuel and fuel additive supply circumstances and to mitigate \n        impact on air quality;\n            ``(III) the waiver permits a transitional period, the exact \n        duration of which shall be determined by the Administrator, \n        after the termination of the temporary waiver to permit \n        wholesalers and retailers to blend down their wholesale and \n        retail inventory;\n            ``(IV) the waiver applies to all persons in the motor fuel \n        distribution system;
