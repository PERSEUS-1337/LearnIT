    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Iran Sanctions Enabling Act of \n2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \n        Crime of Genocide, completed at Paris, December 9, 1948 \n        (commonly referred to as the ``Genocide Convention'') defines \n        genocide as, among other things, the act of killing members of \n        a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group with the intent \n        to destroy, in whole or in part, the targeted group. In \n        addition, the Genocide Convention also prohibits conspiracy to \n        commit genocide, as well as ``direct and public incitement to \n        commit genocide''.\n            (2) 133 member states of the United Nations have ratified \n        the Genocide Convention and thereby pledged to prosecute \n        individuals who violate the Genocide Convention's prohibition \n        on incitement to commit genocide, as well as those individuals \n        who commit genocide directly.\n            (3) On October 27, 2005, at the World Without Zionism \n        Conference in Tehran, Iran, the President of Iran, Mahmoud \n        Ahmadinejad, called for Israel to be ``wiped off the map,'' \n        described Israel as ``a disgraceful blot [on] the face of the \n        Islamic world,'' and declared that ``[a]nybody who recognizes \n        Israel will burn in the fire of the Islamic nation's fury.'' \n        President Ahmadinejad has subsequently made similar types of \n        comments, and the Government of Iran has displayed inflammatory \n        symbols that express similar intent.\n            (4) On December 23, 2006, the United Nations Security \n        Council unanimously approved Resolution 1737, which bans the \n        supply of nuclear technology and equipment to Iran and freezes \n        the assets of certain organizations and individuals involved in \n        Iran's nuclear program, until Iran suspends its enrichment of \n        uranium, as verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n            (5) Following Iran's failure to comply with Resolution \n        1737, on March 24, 2007, the United Nations Security Council \n        unanimously approved Resolution 1747, to tighten sanctions on \n        Iran, imposing a ban on arms sales and expanding the freeze on \n        assets, in response to the country's uranium-enrichment \n        activities.\n            (6) There are now signs of domestic discontent within Iran, \n        and targeted financial and economic measures could produce \n        further political pressure within Iran. According to the \n        Economist Intelligence Unit, the nuclear crisis ``is imposing a \n        heavy opportunity cost on Iran's economic development, slowing \n        down investment in the oil, gas, and petrochemical sectors, as \n        well as in critical infrastructure projects, including \n        electricity''.\n            (7) Targeted financial measures represent one of the \n        strongest non-military tools available to convince Tehran that \n        it can no longer afford to engage in dangerous, destabilizing \n        activities such as its nuclear weapons program and its support \n        for terrorism.\n            (8) Foreign persons that have invested in Iran's energy \n        sector, despite Iran's support of international terrorism and \n        its nuclear program, have provided additional financial means \n        for Iran's activities in these areas, and many United States \n        persons have unknowingly invested in those same foreign \n        persons.\n            (9) There is an increasing interest by States, local \n        governments, educational institutions, and private institutions \n        to seek to disassociate themselves from companies that directly \n        or indirectly support the Government of Iran's efforts to \n        achieve a nuclear weapons capability.\n            (10) Policy makers and fund managers may find moral, \n        prudential, or reputational reasons to divest from companies \n        that accept the business risk of operating in countries that \n        are subject to international economic sanctions or that have \n        business relationships with countries, governments, or entities \n        with which any United States company would be prohibited from \n        dealing because of economic sanctions imposed by the United \n        States.\n\nSEC. 3. TRANSPARENCY IN CAPITAL MARKETS.\n\n    (a) List of Persons Investing in Iran Energy Sector or Selling arms \nto the Government of Iran.--\n            (1) Publication of list.--Not later than 6 months after the \n        date of the enactment of this Act and every 6 months \n        thereafter, the President or a designee of the President shall, \n        using only publicly available (including proprietary) \n        information, ensure publication in the Federal Register of a \n        list of each person, whether within or outside of the United \n        States, that, as of the date of the publication, has an \n        investment of more than $20,000,000 in the energy sector in \n        Iran, sells arms to the Government of Iran, or is a financial \n        institution that extends $20,000,000 or more in credit to the \n        Government of Iran for 45 days or more.
