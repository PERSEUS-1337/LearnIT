The carbon intensity for the transportation fuel shall include the indirect land use change emission if an agricultural commodity that is a food product is used as a feedstock for the production of the transportation fuel.\n(b)The state board may establish a very low carbon fuel market commitment program that requires a wholesaler, producer, importer, or any other entity that provides transportation fuel to a retailer or sells transportation fuel to a consumer to include as part of its transportation fuel sales in the state percentages of very low carbon transportation fuel. The percentages of very low carbon transportation fuel shall be determined by the state board and measured in energy equivalent units. The state board may require percentages of very low carbon transportation fuel as low as one-quarter of 1 percent or as high as 2 percent.\n(c)When the state board determines that very low carbon transportation fuel sales have reached 2 percent of all transportation fuel sales in the state, the state board shall notify the Secretary of State and this section shall be inoperative five years from that notification.\n(d)This section does not replace or modify any existing fuel standards or requirements imposed under the Low Carbon Fuel Standard regulation (Subarticle 7 (commencing with Section 95480) of Article 4 of Subchapter 10 of Chapter 1 of Division 3 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations)."
