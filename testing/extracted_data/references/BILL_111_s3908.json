SCHULTZ FIRE FLOODING AREA ASSISTANCE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) on June 20, 2010, the Schultz wildfire began burning in \n        the Coconino National Forest on Federal land that is located \n        approximately 4 miles north of the City of Flagstaff, Arizona;\n            (2) the Schultz Fire burned for 10 days, destroyed more \n        than 15,000 acres of Forest Service land, and prompted the \n        evacuation of approximately 400 homes before being 100 percent \n        contained on June 30, 3010;\n            (3) the Schultz Fire severely burned a large portion of the \n        forest along the steep terrain on the east side of the San \n        Francisco Peaks, leaving little ground vegetation to absorb and \n        retain rainwater;\n            (4) on July 6, 2010, the Forest Service Burn Area Emergency \n        Response Team issued a hydrology specialist report that \n        assessed post-fire watershed conditions and determined that \n        there was a constant daily flooding threat to nearby \n        communities from summer monsoon storms;\n            (5) on July 7, 2010, community meetings were held urging \n        residents to purchase flood insurance for the affected area, \n        which had not previously been designated as a flood plain;\n            (6) on July 20, 2010, after nearly 2 inches of rain fell in \n        less than 1 hour, flash flooding occurred in the unincorporated \n        communities downstream from the Schultz wildfire burn area in \n        Coconino County;\n            (7) widespread flooding and debris disrupted public \n        infrastructure, damaged approximately 32 homes in the \n        communities of Doney Park, Timberline, Hutchison Acres, and \n        Wupatki Trails Estates, and killed a 12-year-old girl;\n            (8) affected homeowners who purchased flood insurance were \n        not eligible for coverage under the National Flood Insurance \n        Program at the time of the loss because of the statutorily \n        mandated 30-day waiting period before flood insurance coverage \n        takes effect; and\n            (9) because the Schultz Fire occurred on Forest Service \n        land and has affected private property, public safety, and \n        human life, the Federal Government is obligated to provide an \n        appropriate level of disaster assistance, including Federal \n        flood insurance to homeowners.\n    (b) Schultz Fire Flooding Area Task Force.--\n            (1) Establishment.--There is established the Schultz Fire \n        Flooding Area Task Force.\n            (2) Membership.--The Task Force shall consist of members \n        who have expertise in Federal disaster management and \n        assistance, flood prevention and mitigation, forestry, wildfire \n        management and recovery, civil engineering, soil conservation, \n        or watershed protection, including representatives from--\n                    (A) the Federal Emergency Management Agency;\n                    (B) the Corps of Engineers;\n                    (C) the Forest Service;\n                    (D) the Natural Resources Conservation Service;\n                    (E) the United States Geological Survey;\n                    (F) State and local governments;\n                    (G) community-based organizations and other \n                interested parties; and\n                    (H) any other entity the Administrator determines \n                to be appropriate.\n            (3) Chair.--The Administrator shall be the Chair of the \n        Task Force.\n            (4) Duties.--For the affected area, the Task Force shall--\n                    (A) coordinate the efforts of the entities \n                represented on the Task Force to implement interim and \n                long-term flood protection systems; and\n                    (B) identify existing and potential--\n                            (i) funding;\n                            (ii) technical assistance;\n                            (iii) general investigations; and\n                            (iv) construction of flood protection \n                        projects.\n            (5) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to the \n        appropriate committees of Congress a report describing the \n        findings and work of the Task Force.\n            (6) Application of the federal advisory committee act.--The \n        Task Force shall not be considered an advisory committee under \n        the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C.
