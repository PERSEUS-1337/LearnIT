    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Honoring the Choctaw and Commanche \nCode Talkers Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) on April 6, 1917, the United States, after \n        extraordinary provocations, declared war on Germany and began \n        what is known as the First World War;\n            (2) at that time, Indian people in the United States, \n        including members of the Choctaw Nation, were not accorded \n        citizenship;\n            (3) without regard to this lack of citizenship, many \n        members of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma and other Indian \n        tribes and Nations enlisted in the armed forces to fight on \n        behalf of the United States;\n            (4) members of the Choctaw Nation enlisted in the force \n        known as the American Expeditionary Force, which began hostile \n        actions in France in the fall of 1917;\n            (5) members of the Choctaw Nation were incorporated in a \n        company of Indian enlistees serving in the 142nd Infantry \n        Company of the 36th Division;\n            (6) because of the proximity and static nature of the \n        battle lines in World War I, a method of communication that \n        could be used without the knowledge of the enemy was necessary;\n            (7) a commander of the United States realized that he had \n        under his command a number of soldiers who spoke a Native \n        language;\n            (8) while the use of Native languages was discouraged by \n        the military of the United States, the commander sought out and \n        recruited 18 Choctaw Indians to assist in the transmission of \n        field telephone communications during an upcoming campaign;\n            (9) because the language used by the Choctaw soldiers in \n        the transmission of information was not based on a European \n        language or mathematical progression, the Germans were unable \n        to understand any of the transmissions;\n            (10) the Choctaw soldiers were placed in different command \n        positions, to achieve the widest possible area for \n        communications;\n            (11) the use of the Choctaw code talkers was particularly \n        important in the movement of military personnel of the United \n        States in October 1918 (including securing forward and exposed \n        positions), in--\n                    (A) the protection of supplies during action \n                (including protecting gun emplacements from enemy \n                shelling); and\n                    (B) in the preparation for the assault on German \n                positions in the final stages of combat operations in \n                the fall of 1918;\n            (12) in the opinion of the officers involved, the use of \n        the Choctaw Indians to transmit information in their Native \n        language saved men and munitions, and was highly successful;\n            (13) based on that successful experience, Choctaw Indians \n        were withdrawn from front line units to be trained in the \n        transmission of codes so as to be more widely used when World \n        War I ended;\n            (14) the Germans never succeeded in breaking the Choctaw \n        code;\n            (15) use of the Choctaw code talkers was the first instance \n        in modern warfare in which the transmission of messages in a \n        Native American language was used for the purpose of confusing \n        the enemy;\n            (16) on December 7, 1941, the Japanese Empire attacked \n        Pearl Harbor, prompting Congress to declare war on the Japanese \n        the following day;\n            (17) the military code had been developed by the United \n        States for transmitting messages, but that code had been \n        deciphered by the Japanese;\n            (18) a search by intelligence officials of the United \n        States was carried out to develop new means to counter the \n        enemy;\n            (19) as occurred during World War I, the Federal Government \n        called on an Indian tribe, in this instance, the Comanche \n        Nation, to support the military effort;\n            (20) the United States Army sent 14 Commanche Indians \n        overseas to serve as members of the 4th Signal Company of the \n        4th Infantry Division;\n            (21) the Comanche code talkers passed messages over \n        telephones and radios in their native tongue so as to prevent \n        the enemy from intercepting and deciphering the messages;\n            (22) because no written Comanche language existed, and \n        because there were no Comanche words for many military terms, a \n        military code had to be devised and written;\n            (23) by using the Comanche language, Comanche code talkers \n        were able to--\n                    (A) provide secure communications;\n                    (B) protect tactical movements; and\n                    (C) ensure that troops would not be in danger from \n                an enemy eavesdropping on signal transmissions;\n            (24) several of the 14 Comanche code talkers coded messages \n        sent from the battlefields in Europe back to division \n        headquarters, where the remainder of the Commanche code talkers \n        decoded the messages;\n            (25) the work of the Comanche code talkers thwarted enemy \n        efforts to steal communications of the United States;\n            (26) the efforts of the Comanche code talkers were \n        especially important during and after the Allied landings at \n        Normandy in June 1944;\n            (27) the Comanche code talkers contributed greatly to the \n        Allied war effort in Europe and were instrumental in winning \n        the war in Europe;\n            (28) the efforts of the Comanche code talkers saved \n        countless lives;\n            (29) only 1 of the Comanche code talkers remains alive as \n        of the date of enactment of this Act; and\n            (30) the actions of the Choctaw and Comanche members of the \n        military of the United States during World War I and World War \n        II--\n                    (A) are evidence of the commitment of members of \n                Indian tribes of the United States to the defense of \n                the United States; and\n                    (B) add to the proud legacy of service by those \n                members in the military of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
