    "content": "In 1891, Congress authorized the President to proclaim forest reserves from existing federal lands. Six years later, in what has become known at the Forest Service Organic Administration Act, Congress defined the purposes of the reserves: \"No public forest reservation shall be established, except to improve and protect the forest within the reservation, or for the purpose of securing favorable conditions of water flows, and to furnish a continuous supply of timber for the use and necessities of citizens of the United States ...\" Initially the reserves were administered by the Forestry Division of the General Land Office, within the Department of the Interior. In 1905, the 75 million acres of forest reserves (renamed national forests in 1907) were transferred to the Department of Agriculture; the Forestry Division was merged with the existing USDA Bureau of Forestry (whose purpose was to conduct forestry research and to provide assistance to forestland owners) to create a new agency: the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) in the Department of Agriculture. President Theodore Roosevelt increased the acreage of national forests to 172 million acres by 1909. The National Forest System (NFS) has continued to expand slowly, to 193 million acres in 2010. The original NFS management goals in the Organic Administration Act were to improve and protect the forest, secure favorable water flows, and furnish timber for citizens. Congress expanded theses goals in the Multiple Use-Sustained Yield Act of 1960 (MUSYA). Section 1 of MUSYA directs that the national forests \"shall be administered for outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife and fish purposes.\" Section 2 requires that the surface resources be developed and administered for \"multiple use and sustained yield,\" considering the relative values of the various resources, and notes that creating and managing areas of wilderness is consistent with the purposes of the act. Section 4(a) of MUSYA defines multiple-use management of national forest resources. It directs management to best meet the needs of the American people, with adjustments to changing needs and conditions. Multiple-use management also permits some land to be used for only one or a few resources. Finally, multiple-use management must maintain the productivity of the lands. Thus, MUSYA directs that national forest management balance recreation, timber, grazing, water, and wildlife, as desired by the American people, while sustaining productivity. Planning for NFS use and management is guided by the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA). NFMA requires comprehensive land and resource management plans for each unit of the NFS, to be amended as needed and revised periodically but at least every 15 years. The planning requires an interdisciplinary approach combining \"physical, biological, economic, and other sciences,\" directs that the plans provide for multiple use in accordance with MUSYA, and requires public participation in developing, reviewing, and revising the plans. In Section 6 (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604), NFMA established numerous requirements and considerations for the planning process. Some provisions were particularly controversial, because of their potential to reduce or otherwise constrain timber harvesting. The more controversial provisions include: Section 6(g)(1): \"insure that land management plans are prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ...\" Section 6(g)(3)(B): \"provide for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area ...\" Section 6(g)(3)(E): \"insure that timber will be harvested ... only where\u2014(i) soil, slope, and other watershed conditions will not be irreversibly damaged; (ii) there is assurance that such lands can be adequately restocked within five years after harvest; [and] (iii) protection is provided for streams, streambanks, shorelines, lakes, wetlands, and other bodies of water from detrimental changes in water temperatures, blockages of water courses, and deposits of sediment, where harvests are likely to seriously and adversely affect water conditions or fish habitat ...\" Section 6(k): \"identify lands within the management area which are not suited for timber production, considering physical, economic, and other pertinent factors to the extent feasible, ... [and] assure that, except for salvage sales or sales necessitated to protect other multiple-use values, no timber harvesting shall occur on such lands for a period of 10 years.\" Two of these provisions\u2014Section 6(g)(3)(E) and Section 6(k)\u2014were intended to constrain timber harvesting by establishing biophysical and economic requirements, respectively, for timber production. The NEPA provision\u2014Section 6(g)(1)\u2014establishes a procedural requirement that can be, and has been, used to delay or prevent timber harvesting and other development activities in the national forests. The biological diversity provision\u2014Section 6(g)(3)(B)\u2014has perhaps had the most significant impact, however. The 1979 and 1982 regulations to implement this provision required the USFS to maintain viable populations of all native and desirable non-native species. This requirement for viable populations was the initial basis for the litigation that reduced USFS (and BLM) timber harvesting in the Pacific Northwest by 90% or more to maintain the northern spotted owl. (The subsequent listing of the owl under the Endangered Species Act provided further impetus to reduce timber harvesting to preserve northern spotted owl habitat.) In addition to the controversial provisions of NFMA, efforts to revise the 1982 implementing regulations have been controversial. In November 2000, the Clinton Administration finalized new rules (to be phased in) that emphasized planning for the biological sustainability of the national forests. The Bush Administration delayed implementing the Clinton rules, then replaced them in January 2005 before they went into effect. The final Bush rules were to balance biological and socioeconomic sustainability, to make fewer decisions nationally by reducing regulatory guidelines, and to exempt plans from NEPA and ESA, because the Bush Administration viewed plans as guides to decision-making that would not include site-specific decisions. The Bush planning rules were successfully challenged. In 2007, the USFS reissued the Bush rules as a proposed rule with a draft NEPA environmental impact statement and ESA consultation to meet court requirements. The final planning rules were issued in April 2008, and were invalidated by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June 2009 for failing to comply with NEPA and ESA. In December 2009, the Obama Administration announced its intent to develop new NFMA planning regulations. Congress has at times seen fit to alter the general NFS management guidance for particular areas. These areas are commonly designated to emphasize particular resources or values, such as recreation or wildlife, sometimes with detailed congressional guidance for the areas. As part of its special area designations for some NFS lands, Congress has established two systems of special management areas, with general guidance that applies to all such designated areas: the National Wilderness Preservation System and the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. These two systems include lands administered by other federal land management agencies, as well as NFS lands, and the general guidance for the designated systems apply to all designated areas. In 1964, the Wilderness Act created the National Wilderness Preservation System, initially with 54 areas (totaling 9.1 million acres) that the USFS had previously established administratively as wilderness or wild areas. The act also reserved to Congress the right to expand the Wilderness System. Today, the Wilderness System contains 759 wilderness areas totaling nearly 110 million acres in 44 states. Of these, 441 areas with 36.2 million acres (33% of the total) are in the NFS. (See Table 1 .) The remaining wilderness areas are administered by the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management. The Wilderness Act established general objectives and standards for areas to be included in the Wilderness System. Section 2(c) defines wilderness. A wilderness, in contrast with those areas where man and his own works dominate the landscape, is hereby recognized as an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain. An area of wilderness is further defined to mean in this Act an area of undeveloped Federal land retaining its primeval character and influence, without permanent improvements or human habitation, which is protected and managed so as to preserve its natural conditions and which (1) generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature, with the imprint of man's work substantially unnoticeable; (2) has outstanding opportunities for solitude or a primitive and unconfined type of recreation; (3) has at least five thousand acres of land or is of sufficient size as to make practicable its preservation and use in an unimpaired condition; and (4) may also contain ecological, geological, or other features of scientific, educational, scenic, or historical value. (16 U.S.C. \u00a71131(c)) In addition to the objectives and standards for areas to be designated as wilderness, the Wilderness Act established standards and guidelines for managing designated wilderness areas. In general, each agency administering wilderness areas is to preserve and protect the wilderness character of the areas under its jurisdiction. To achieve these objectives, Section 4(c) of the Wilderness Act generally prohibits commercial activities; roads, structures, and other infrastructure; and motorized and mechanical access. Specifically, the act states: Except as specifically provided for in this Act, and subject to existing private rights, there shall be no commercial enterprise and no permanent road within any wilderness area designated by this Act and, except as necessary to meet minimum requirements for the administration of the area for the purpose of this Act (including measures required in emergencies involving the health and safety of persons within the area), there shall be no temporary road, no use of motor vehicles, motorized equipment or motorboats, no landing of aircraft, no other form of mechanical transport, and no structure or installation within any such area. Thus, this section prohibits commercial uses, such as timber harvesting. It bars motorized and mechanical access, such as via cars and trucks, bicycles and motorbikes, off-road and all-terrain vehicles, motorboats, and all aircraft. It also prevents construction and maintenance of temporary and permanent roads and structures, such as shelters, water impoundments, fire towers, and communication equipment. The Wilderness Act and subsequent statutes designating wilderness areas have included numerous exceptions to the prohibitions described above. In particular, Section 4(d) of the Wilderness Act provides for several specific exceptions: Section 4(d)(1) allows continued use of motorboats and aircraft \"where these uses have already become established ...\" Section 4(d)(1) also allows necessary measures for controlling wildfires, and insect and disease infestations, \"subject to such conditions as the Secretary deems desirable.\" Section 4(d)(2) allows prospecting for minerals or other resources. Section 4(d)(4)(1) allows the President \"within a specific area and subject to such regulations as he may deem desirable\" to authorize water resource projects and associated infrastructure and access. Section 4(d)(4)(2) allows continued livestock grazing, subject to reasonable regulations. Section 4(d)(6) allows commercial services \"to the extent necessary for activities which are proper for realizing the recreational or other wilderness purposes ...\" Through December 31, 1983, Section 4(d)(3) allowed establishing mineral rights under mining and mineral leasing laws, subject \"to such reasonable regulations as may be prescribed ...\" and with patents limited to the minerals (i.e., not to the surface of the land). \"Mineral leases, permits, and licenses ... shall contain such reasonable stipulations as may be prescribed ... for the protection of the wilderness character of the land consistent with the use of the land for the purposes for which they were leased, permitted, or licensed.\" Many of the 117 laws designating wilderness areas that have been enacted since 1964 also have exceptions to the no-commerce, no-structures, no-motorized access strictures of the Wilderness Act. Six general types of provisions in many wilderness statutes provide exceptions to the general wilderness management restrictions. Access to private land s. Section 5 of the Wilderness Act provided for adequate and reasonable access to nonfederal lands and \"valid occupancies\" (e.g., valid mining claims) within designated wilderness areas. Several subsequent wilderness statutes have essentially reiterated this direction, allowing for adequate access to private lands within designated wilderness areas. Access for wildfire, insect, or disease contro l. Section 4(d)(1) of the Wilderness Act explicitly provided for measures needed to control wildfires, insects, and diseases, subject to reasonable regulations. As catastrophic wildfires have apparently become more frequent and more intense in recent years, this authority for nonconforming activities in wilderness areas to control fire, insects, and diseases has essentially been repeated in more recent wilderness statutes. Access for livestock grazin g. Section 4(d)(4)(2) of the Wilderness Act allowed continued livestock grazing in wilderness areas. Continued concerns over access for livestock management led to detailed guidelines for managing livestock grazing in wilderness areas in Appendix A, \"Grazing Guidelines,\" (pp. 41-43) of H.Rept. 101-405, the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee's report on the Arizona Desert Wilderness Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-628 ). The language from the Wilderness Act and from the committee report on the Arizona Desert Wilderness Act of 1990 has subsequently been repeated or referenced in several statutes. Native and tribal rights and acces s. Several wilderness statutes have provided for access to the designated wilderness areas for native traditional cultural and religious purposes. The guidance has either been that nothing in the act \"alters, modifies, enlarges, diminishes, or abrogates the treaty rights ...\" or that the Secretary is to \"ensure access for traditional cultural and religious purposes\" and to allow temporary closures (i.e., exclusive access) for the smallest possible area and minimum possible period. Provisions in other statutes have also directed cooperation, memoranda of understanding, and agreements to provide access to and protection of important tribal use areas. Low-level military overflight s. Since 1990, several wilderness statutes have included provisions to specify that nothing in the act \"shall preclude low level overflights of military aircraft, the designation of new units of special airspace, or the use or establishment of military flight training routes over wilderness areas designated by this\" act. Access for hydrological, meteorological, and climatological equipmen t. Several wilderness statutes have included provisions allowing the installation and maintenance of weather-related equipment and facilities within one or more of the areas designated by the statute. Other provision s. Many statutes have included specific exceptions, usually for a specific area, commonly to allow motorized access for wildlife management or for maintaining water resource infrastructure; to allow continued motorboat access; to allow aircraft for specific purposes; or to allow establishment and maintenance of water infrastructure or telecommunication equipment. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System was established in the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968. The act established a policy of preserving designated free-flowing rivers and their immediate environments \"for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations.\" Rivers are generally added to the system by an act of Congress, although states can nominate, and the Secretary of the Interior can approve, rivers protected under state law and managed by a state agency. The Rivers System includes three classes of rivers\u2014wild, scenic, and recreational\u2014depending on the extent and nature of development along the river segment. The administering agency establishes boundaries for the designated river's corridor, averaging not more than a half-mile in width (including the river and adjacent shoreline). Management of the lands within the corridor depends, in part, on the river's classification; developmental activities are most restricted along wild rivers and least restricted along recreational rivers. Administration is to emphasize the values that led to the designation, and uses are generally restricted only if they harm those values. Section 10(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act states: Each component of the national wild and scenic rivers system shall be administered in such a manner as to protect and enhance the values which caused it to be included in said system without, insofar as is consistent therewith, limiting other uses that do not substantially interfere with public use and enjoyment of these values. In such administration primary emphasis shall be given to protecting its esthetic, scenic, historic, archaeologic, and scientific features. Thus, the USFS is to manage the national forest lands within the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System under MUSYA and NFMA, as long as the activities are consistent with protecting the wild, scenic, or recreational nature of the designated rivers. Table 2 shows the area of wild and scenic river corridors within the National Forest System in each state with one or more designated rivers. In addition to the two standardized systems of special management areas, Congress has designated numerous individual special management areas (SMAs) with management guidelines for each area. Six major types of designations have been enacted: national monuments, recreation areas, scenic areas, game refuges, protection areas, and other. These areas differ from the two standardized systems (wilderness and wild and scenic river corridors) in having neither general authorizing legislation for the type of designation nor general management direction for all such areas. Rather, each SMA has been created by an act of Congress with its own management guidelines and restrictions. Furthermore, there are no obvious differences in the guidelines and restrictions for the different types of designations. Table 3 shows the number of areas for each of the major types of SMAs, and the total area designated. The Appendix provides a complete list of the 97 SMAs designated to date, with a quotation or summary of the major provisions enacted for each. Numerous provisions have been used commonly in many of the statutes designating SMAs. The common provisions can be grouped into administrative provisions and resource management provisions. In addition, some provisions have been used in a few of the SMA statutes, and can similarly be grouped into administrative and resource management provisions. Eight types of administrative provisions have commonly been enacted for SMAs in the National Forest System. The details of the language used often differs, especially for the first two types of provisions, but the intent and effect is usually quite similar. 1. Findings. Many SMA statutes include findings about the unique attributes of the area being designated. 2. Purpose. Most SMA statutes include a statement about the purpose(s) for designating the area. Such statements often provide a basis for management that may differ from management of the area prior to designation. 3. Designation. Many SMA statutes include a provision explicitly designating and naming the area. These provisions often include a reference to the area's boundaries and to a map (commonly identified by a name and date) to be retained in a specific office (typically the Forest Supervisor's office for the national forest in which the SMA is located). 4. NFS Laws. Most SMA statutes direct that the SMA is to be managed consistent with the laws, rules, and regulations generally applicable to National Forest System lands. Thus, the purposes and provisions enacted for the designated area are generally supplemental to existing governance, and not a substitute for that management guidance. 5. Management Plan. Many SMA statutes require a management plan for the designated area, commonly completed within a specified period. Sometimes the planning guidance requires public participation; sometimes it does so indirectly, by reference to the NFMA planning process and requirements. 6. Advisory Committee. Many SMA statutes provide for an advisory committee or group for the designated area. This advisory committee is frequently permanent, but sometimes is just for the development of the management plan. Also, some advisory groups are to represent the array of general public interests, but others are to focus on scientific issues associated with management of the area. 7. Land Acquisition. Most SMA statutes authorize land acquisition for nonfederal land within the boundaries of the area. As the USFS has general land acquisition authority under the Weeks Law (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 515 et al.) and the SMAs are within the NFS, such land acquisition authority might be redundant. 8. Withdrawal. Many of the SMA statutes withdraw the lands of the designated area from access under public land laws, such as the Homestead Act. As most of the public land laws were repealed in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) and are no longer applicable to NFS or other federal lands, the more recent SMA statutes are less likely to include such a provision. Three resource provisions have been included in many of the statutes designating SMAs in the NFS. These provisions generally address management of, and access to, minerals, timber, and fish and wildlife. 1. Minerals. Most SMA statutes withdraw the designated lands from access under the mining and the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, subject to valid existing rights. This is very similar to the provisions of the Wilderness Act for withdrawing lands from access for mineral exploration and development. Some statutes authorize the USFS to continue to sell mineral materials (sand and gravel) from within the designated area. 2. Timber. Many SMA statutes restrict timber harvesting. The most common approach is to use the restrictions of the Wilderness Act: no commercial timber harvesting, except as needed for fire, insect, and disease control and for visitor and administrative safety. Other approaches include requiring uneven-aged management practices, directing that harvesting be adjusted for possible scenic impacts, or limiting the size or species of trees that can be cut and removed. 3. Fish and Wildlife. Most of the statutes designating SMAs include provisions relating to fish and wildlife management. In general, the statutes explicitly retain state jurisdiction over the management of the animals, limiting federal SMA administration to habitat management. Many of the statutes also explicitly allow hunting and fishing, and sometimes trapping, consistent with state law. These provisions also typically allow seasonal and/or area closures to protect critical wildlife needs (e.g., elk calving grounds), usually in consultation with the relevant state agency. Several additional administrative provisions have been enacted in at least a few statutes designating SMAs. 1. Regulations. Several SMA statutes direct that the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service, promulgate regulations for administering the designated area. 2. Inholder Access. Some SMA statutes explicitly allow access for nonfederal landowners whose lands are within the designated SMA. In some instances, the language parallels the Wilderness Act, allowing \"reasonable\" rights of access. 3. Buffer Zones. Some of the statutes designating SMAs prohibit the USFS from establishing buffer zones around the SMA. This provision is akin to provisions enacted in several statutes designating wilderness areas, which note that the ability to see or hear a nonconforming activity from within the wilderness is not sufficient authority to restrict or prohibit that activity. 4. Effect on Governance. Several SMA statutes direct that the designation is to have no effect on state or local laws and regulations, including law enforcement and taxation of private enterprise within the SMA. 5. Authorization of Appropriations. Some SMA statutes explicitly authorize appropriations for administering the area consistent with the statute. However, since few, if any, SMA statutes authorize any activity not already authorized for NFS lands generally (typically they restrict already-authorized activities), and since USFS appropriations are enacted for activities, not for specific units, it is not clear that an authorization is required for an SMA. In addition to administrative provisions, several of the statutes designating SMAs have included additional provisions governing natural resource management within the SMA. 1. Motorized Access. Several SMA statutes prohibit motorized access in the area, except on existing roads and other routes designated for motorized access. In addition, some of the statutes also prohibit the construction of new roads within the SMA. Exceptions to this prohibition have been included for new roads to replace existing, environmentally damaging roads and for new roads as decided in the planning process for the area. 2. Wildfire, Insect, and Disease Control. Some SMA statutes explicitly allow activities to control fires, insects, and diseases. In general, these provisions use the same language as the Wilderness Act\u2014necessary measures subject to reasonable restrictions as determined by the Secretary. 3. Livestock Grazing. Some of the statutes designating SMAs explicitly allow livestock grazing to continue where it existed prior to the designation. Motorized access, even in areas where such access is generally prohibited, is generally permitted, consistent with historic use. The provisions, when enacted, are commonly similar in intent to the provisions in the Wilderness Act. 4. Military Overflights. Some SMA statutes explicitly direct that the designation is not to prohibit or otherwise affect low-level military training overflights of the SMA. Again, the language is generally the same as is used in the several statutes designating wilderness areas. 5. Water Use/Water Rights. A few statutes designating SMAs specifically address water use and water rights associated with the area. These provisions are more difficult to summarize, as they are more variable than many of the other provisions, ranging from those that stipulate no effect on water rights and water use, to an explicit reservation of water as needed for the SMA, to an explicit denial of water rights for the SMA. This appendix lists the 97 specially designated individual areas, grouped into six major types of designations: national monuments; recreation areas; scenic areas; game refuges; protection areas; and other. The areas are listed chronologically for each type of designation. For each area, the entry displays the statute designating the area and the length of its statutory provisions; the length cited for each is the number of pages in the U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News , by West Publishing Co. (St. Paul, MN), or in the free-standing slip law produced by the U.S. Government Printing Office, except as otherwise noted. Each entry then identifies the management purposes, provisions, requirements, and prohibitions with quotations or brief CRS annotations. National Monuments Four national monuments and two national volcanic monuments have been established within the National Forest System. Five have been designated by acts of Congress; one was established by presidential proclamation under the Antiquities Act of 1906 (16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 431 et seq.). No conclusions can be drawn about the general management guidance for these areas, or the differences compared to recreation or scenic areas. The sizes of the national monuments vary widely, from about 55,000 acres for the Newberry National Volcanic Monument to nearly 2.3 million for the Misty Fjords National Monument. 1 & 2.

Wildlife Preserves Congress has designated six wildlife preserves within the National Forest System. These designations contrast with the other designations. First, they are much older, all having been designated prior to 1934; the oldest of all the other congressionally designated areas is Spruce Knob-Seneca Rocks NRA, designated in 1965. Also, the general management guidance for these areas is much less specific than for other congressionally designated areas, focusing exclusively on wildlife management activities. Finally, the preserves are more difficult to identify on the ground; none have reference maps showing the areas, and none identify the acreage encompassed. According to USFS data, the congressionally designated preserves range from less than 10,000 acres (for several units of the Ouachita and Ozark Preserves) to 612,736 acres for the Grand Canyon Preserve. 1.

Protection Areas Congress has designated 37 areas within the National Forest System for some form of special protection. Each has distinct purposes and management direction enacted in the law designating the area. A few general designations are used\u2014special management area, protection area, etc.\u2014but many are unique and some areas have no title or name in the enabling legislation. Because of the broad array of purposes and guidance, no general conclusions can be drawn about these designations, or their differences compared to national monuments, recreation areas, and/or scenic areas. These designations are generally smaller than the monuments and recreation areas, but have a wide range of acreage, from less than 300 acres to 222,000 acres. 1.
