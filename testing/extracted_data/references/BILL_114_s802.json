FINDINGS.\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) According to the United States Census Bureau's 2013 \n    international figures, 1 person in 12, or close to 900,000,000 \n    people, is a girl or young woman age 10 through 24.\n        (2) The Census Bureau's data also illustrates that young people \n    are the fastest growing segment of the population in developing \n    countries.\n        (3) Even though most countries do have birth registration laws, \n    four out of ten babies born in 2012 were not registered worldwide. \n    Moreover, an estimated 36 percent of children under the age of five \n    worldwide (about 230,000,000 children) do not possess a birth \n    certificate.\n        (4) A nationally recognized proof of birth system is important \n    to determining a child's citizenship, nationality, place of birth, \n    parentage, and age. Without such a system, a passport, driver's \n    license, or other identification card is difficult to obtain. The \n    lack of such documentation can prevent girls and women from \n    officially participating in and benefitting from the formal \n    economic, legal, and political sectors in their countries.\n        (5) The lack of birth registration among girls worldwide is \n    particularly concerning as it can exacerbate the disproportionate \n    vulnerability of women to trafficking, child marriage, and lack of \n    access to health and education services.\n        (6) A lack of birth registration among women and girls can also \n    aggravate what, in many places, amounts to an already reduced \n    ability to seek employment, participate in civil society, or \n    purchase or inherit land and other assets.\n        (7) Girls undertake much of the domestic labor needed for poor \n    families to survive: carrying water, harvesting crops, tending \n    livestock, caring for younger children, and doing chores.\n        (8) Accurate assessments of access to education, poverty \n    levels, and overall census activities are hampered by the lack of \n    official information on women and girls. Without this rudimentary \n    information, assessments of foreign assistance and domestic social \n    welfare programs are difficult to gauge.\n        (9) To help ensure that women and girls are considered in \n    United States foreign assistance policies and programs, that their \n    needs are addressed in the design, implementation, and evaluation \n    of foreign assistance programs, and that women and girls have the \n    opportunity to succeed, it is important that girls be counted and \n    have access to birth certificates and other official documentation.\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n    It is the policy of the United States to--\n        (1) encourage countries to support the rule of law and ensure \n    girls and boys of all ages are able to fully participate in \n    society, including by providing birth certifications and other \n    official documentation;\n        (2) enhance training and capacity-building in key developing \n    countries, local nongovernmental organizations, and other civil \n    society organizations, including faith-based organizations and \n    organizations representing children and families in the design, \n    implementation, and monitoring of programs under this Act, to \n    effectively address the needs of birth registries in countries \n    where girls are systematically undercounted; and\n        (3) incorporate into the design, implementation, and evaluation \n    of policies and programs measures to evaluate the impact that such \n    policies and programs have on girls.\nSEC. 4. UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT COUNTING OF GIRLS IN THE \nDEVELOPING WORLD.\n    (a) Authorization.--The Secretary and the Administrator are \nauthorized to prioritize and advance ongoing efforts to--\n        (1) support programs that will contribute to improved and \n    sustainable Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Systems (CRVS) \n    with a focus on birth registration;\n        (2) support programs that build the capacity of developing \n    countries' national and local legal and policy frameworks to \n    prevent discrimination against girls in gaining access to birth \n    certificates, particularly where this may help prevent \n    exploitation, violence, and other abuse; and\n        (3) support programs and key ministries, including, interior, \n    youth, and education ministries, to help increase property rights, \n    social security, home ownership, land tenure security, inheritance \n    rights, access to education, and economic and entrepreneurial \n    opportunities, particularly for women and girls.\n    (b) Coordination With Multilateral Organizations.--The Secretary \nand the Administrator are authorized to coordinate with the World Bank, \nrelevant United Nations agencies and programs, and other relevant \norganizations to encourage and work with countries to enact, implement, \nand enforce laws that specifically collect data on girls and establish \nregistration programs to ensure girls are appropriately counted and \nhave the opportunity to be active participants in the social, legal, \nand political sectors of society in their countries.\n    (c) Coordination With Private Sector and Civil Society \nOrganizations.--The Secretary and the Administrator are authorized to \nwork with the United States, international, and local private sector \nand civil society organizations to advocate for the registration and \ndocumentation of all girls and boys in developing countries, in order \nto help prevent exploitation, violence, and other abuses and to help \nprovide economic and social opportunities.\nSEC. 5.
