FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Every year thousands of adults become missing due to \n        advanced age, diminished mental capacity, or foul play. Often \n        there is no information regarding the whereabouts of these \n        adults and many of them are never reunited with their families.\n            (2) Missing adults are at great risk of both physical harm \n        and sexual exploitation.\n            (3) In most cases, families and local law enforcement \n        officials have neither the resources nor the expertise to \n        undertake appropriate search efforts for a missing adult.\n            (4) The search for a missing adult requires cooperation and \n        coordination among Federal, State, and local law enforcement \n        agencies and assistance from distant communities where the \n        adult may be located.\n            (5) Federal assistance is urgently needed to help with \n        coordination among such agencies.\n\nSEC. 203.
