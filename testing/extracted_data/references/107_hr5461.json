FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Responders to the terrorist attacks at the World Trade \n        Center, the Pentagon, and the tragedy in Pennsylvania on \n        September 11, 2001, from numerous jurisdictions assisted the \n        fire and rescue workers responsible for responding within their \n        jurisdictions.\n            (2) Even in the largest municipality, first responders need \n        the support of local elected officials and neighboring \n        jurisdictions, as well as support from numerous regional, \n        State, Federal, and private sector entities.\n            (3) The sheer number of agencies taking part in any \n        emergency response demands coordination, mutual support, and \n        effective communication.
