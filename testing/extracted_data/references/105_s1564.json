FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n        (1) Among the $198,000,000 in German assets located in the \n    United States and seized by the United States Government in World \n    War II were believed to be bank accounts, trusts, securities, or \n    other assets belonging to Jewish victims of the Holocaust.\n        (2) Among an estimated $1,200,000,000 in assets of Swiss \n    nationals and institutions which were frozen by the United States \n    Government during World War II (including over $400,000,000 in bank \n    deposits) were assets whose beneficial owners were believed to \n    include victims of the Holocaust.\n        (3) In the aftermath of the war, the Congress recognized that \n    some of the victims of the Holocaust whose assets were among those \n    seized or frozen during the war might not have any legal heirs, and \n    legislation was enacted to authorize the transfer of up to \n    $3,000,000 of such assets to organizations dedicated to providing \n    relief and rehabilitation for survivors of the Holocaust.\n        (4) Although the Congress and the Administration authorized the \n    transfer of such amount to the relief organizations referred to in \n    paragraph (3), the enormous administrative difficulties and cost \n    involved in proving legal ownership of such assets, directly or \n    beneficially, by victims of the Holocaust, and proving the \n    existence or absence of heirs of such victims, led the Congress in \n    1962 to agree to a lump-sum settlement and to provide $500,000 for \n    the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization of New York, such sum \n    amounting to \\1/6\\th of the authorized maximum level of \n    ``heirless'' assets to be transferred.\n        (5) In June of 1997, a representative of the Secretary of \n    State, in testimony before the Congress, urged the reconsideration \n    of the limited $500,000 settlement.\n        (6) While a precisely accurate accounting of ``heirless'' \n    assets may be impossible, good conscience warrants the recognition \n    that the victims of the Holocaust have a compelling moral claim to \n    the unrestituted portion of assets referred to in paragraph (3).\n        (7) Furthermore, leadership by the United States in meeting \n    obligations to Holocaust victims would strengthen--\n            (A) the efforts of the United States to press for the \n        speedy distribution of the remaining nearly 6 metric tons of \n        gold still held by the Tripartite Commission for the \n        Restitution of Monetary Gold (the body established by France, \n        Great Britain, and the United States at the end of World War II \n        to return gold looted by Nazi Germany to the central banks of \n        countries occupied by Germany during the war); and\n            (B) the appeals by the United States to the 15 nations \n        claiming a portion of such gold to contribute a substantial \n        portion of any such distribution to Holocaust survivors in \n        recognition of the recently documented fact that the gold held \n        by the Commission includes gold stolen from individual victims \n        of the Holocaust.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n        (1) To provide a measure of justice to survivors of the \n    Holocaust all around the world while they are still alive.\n        (2) To authorize the appropriation of an amount which is at \n    least equal to the present value of the difference between the \n    amount which was authorized to be transferred to successor \n    organizations to compensate for assets in the United States of \n    heirless victims of the Holocaust and the amount actually paid in \n    1962 to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization of New York \n    for that purpose.\n        (3) To facilitate efforts by the United States to seek an \n    agreement whereby nations with claims against gold held by the \n    Tripartite Commission for the Restitution of Monetary Gold would \n    contribute all, or a substantial portion, of that gold to \n    charitable organizations to assist survivors of the Holocaust.\n\nSEC. 102. DISTRIBUTIONS BY THE TRIPARTITE GOLD COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) Directions to the President.--The President shall direct the \ncommissioner representing the United States on the Tripartite \nCommission for the Restitution of Monetary Gold, established pursuant \nto Part III of the Paris Agreement on Reparation, to seek and vote for \na timely agreement under which all signatories to the Paris Agreement \non Reparation, with claims against the monetary gold pool in the \njurisdiction of such Commission, contribute all, or a substantial \nportion, of such gold to charitable organizations to assist survivors \nof the Holocaust.\n    (b) Authority To Obligate the United States.--\n        (1) In general.--From funds otherwise unobligated in the \n    Treasury of the United States, the President is authorized to \n    obligate subject to paragraph (2) an amount not to exceed \n    $30,000,000 for distribution in accordance with subsections (a) and \n    (b).\n        (2) Conformance with budget act requirement.--Any budget \n    authority contained in paragraph (1) shall be effective only to \n    such extent and in such amounts as are provided in advance in \n    appropriation Acts.\n\nSEC. 103. FULFILLMENT OF OBLIGATION OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to the President such sums as may be necessary for fiscal \nyears 1998, 1999, and 2000, not to exceed a total of $25,000,000 for \nall such fiscal years, for distribution to organizations as may be \nspecified in any agreement concluded pursuant to section 102.\n    (b) Archival Research.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \nthe President $5,000,000 for archival research and translation services \nto assist in the restitution of assets looted or extorted from victims \nof the Holocaust and such other activities that would further Holocaust \nremembrance and education.\n\n                         TITLE II--WORKS OF ART\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n        (1) Established pre-World War II principles of international \n    law, as enunciated in Articles 47 and 56 of the Regulations annexed \n    to the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs \n    of War on Land, prohibited pillage and the seizure of works of art.\n        (2) In the years since World War II, international sanctions \n    against confiscation of works of art have been amplified through \n    such conventions as the 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting \n    and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership \n    of Cultural Property, which forbids the illegal export of art work \n    and calls for its earliest possible restitution to its rightful \n    owner.\n        (3) In defiance of the 1907 Hague Convention, the Nazis \n    extorted and looted art from individuals and institutions in \n    countries it occupied during World War II and used such booty to \n    help finance their war of aggression.\n        (4) The Nazis' policy of looting art was a critical element and \n    incentive in their campaign of genocide against individuals of \n    Jewish and other religious and cultural heritage and, in this \n    context, the Holocaust, while standing as a civil war against \n    defined individuals and civilized values, must be considered a \n    fundamental aspect of the world war unleashed on the continent.\n        (5) Hence, the same international legal principles applied \n    among states should be applied to art and other assets stolen from \n    victims of the Holocaust.\n        (6) In the aftermath of the war, art and other assets were \n    transferred from territory previously controlled by the Nazis to \n    the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, much of which has not been \n    returned to rightful owners.\n\nSEC. 202. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING RESTITUTION OF PRIVATE \n              PROPERTY, SUCH AS WORKS OF ART.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that consistent with the 1907 Hague \nConvention, all governments should undertake good faith efforts to \nfacilitate the return of private and public property, such as works of \nart, to the rightful owners in cases where assets were confiscated from \nthe claimant during the period of Nazi rule and there is reasonable \nproof that the claimant is the rightful owner.\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
