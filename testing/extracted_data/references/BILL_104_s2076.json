FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is in the interest of the United States to maximize \n        economic return from the growing trade in cruise ships sailings \n        to and from Alaska by encouraging the use of United States \n        berthing and repair facilities, labor, supplies, and other \n        services, as well as the growth of new enterprises such as the \n        carriage of passengers on luxury cruises between ports in \n        Alaska.\n            (2) In promoting additional economic benefits to the United \n        States from the cruise ship industry, there is a need to ensure \n        that existing employment and economic activity associated with \n        the Alaska Marine Highway System, United States-flag tour boats \n        operating from Alaska ports, and similar United States \n        enterprises are protected from adverse impacts.\n            (3) Cruise ship sailings to Alaska comprise a vital and \n        growing segment of the United States travel industry. Since \n        1989, the number of Alaska tourist arrivals via cruise ship has \n        grown by 86 percent. With over one-half million passengers per \n        year, Alaska has become the third most popular cruise \n        destination in the world, after the Caribbean and Europe.\n            (4) No United States-flag cruise ships are presently \n        available to enter the Alaska trade. Thus, all cruise ships \n        carrying passengers to and from Alaska destinations are \n        foreign-flag vessels which are precluded, under current law, \n        from carrying passengers between United States ports.\n            (5) The City of Vancouver, British Columbia receives \n        substantial economic benefit through providing services to \n        cruise ships in the Alaska trade. In 1995, Alaska sailings \n        accounted for 283 voyages, up from 275 in 1994, and for a total \n        of 595,577 passengers, up from 591,160. Past estimates of \n        Vancouver's gains from this industry included direct and \n        indirect employment of almost 2,500 people, and direct and \n        indirect payments for goods and services of approximately $120 \n        million per year.\n            (6) The transfer of cruise ship-based economic activity \n        from Vancouver, British Columbia to United States ports could \n        yield additional Federal revenues of nearly $100 million per \n        year, and additional State and local government revenues of \n        approximately $30 million.\n\nSEC. 2. FOREIGN FLAG CRUISE VESSELS.\n\n    (a) Waiver.--Notwithstanding provisions of section 8 of the Act of \nJune 19, 1886 (46 U.S.C. 289), or any other provision of law, \npassengers may be transported in foreign-flag cruise vessels between \nports in Alaska and between ports in Alaska and other ports on the west \ncoast of the contiguous states, except as otherwise provided by this \nsection.\n    (b) Coastwise Trade.--Upon a showing satisfactory to the Secretary \nof Transportation, by the owner or charterer of a United States cruise \nvessel, that service aboard such vessel qualified to engage in the \ncoastwise trade is being offered or advertised pursuant to a \nCertificate of Financial Responsibility for Indemnification of \nPassengers for Nonperformance of Transportation (46 App. U.S.C. 817(e)) \nfor service in the coastwise trade between ports in Alaska or between \nports in Alaska and other ports on the west coast of the contiguous \nstates, or both, the Secretary shall notify the owner or operator of \none or more foreign-flag cruise vessels transporting passengers under \nauthority of this section, if any, that he shall, within one year from \nthe date of notification, terminate such service. Coastwise privileges \ngranted to any owner or operator of a foreign-flag cruise vessel under \nthis section shall expire on the 365th day following receipt of the \nSecretary's notification.\n    (c) Notification.--Notifications issued by the Secretary under \nsubsection (b) of this section shall be issued to the owners or \noperators of foreign-flag cruise vessels--\n            (1) in the reverse of the order in which foreign-flag \n        cruise vessels entered the coastwise service under this section \n        determined by the date of the vessels' first coastwise sailing; \n        and\n            (2) in the minimum number as to ensure that the passenger-\n        carrying capacity thereby removed from coastwise service \n        exceeds the passenger-carrying capacity of the United States \n        cruise vessel which is entering the service.\n    (d) Termination.--If, at the expiration of the 365-day period \nspecified in subsection (b) of this section, the United States cruise \nvessel that has offered or advertised service pursuant to a Certificate \nof Financial Responsibility for Indemnification of Passengers for \nNonperformance of Transportation (46 App. U.S.C. 817(e)) has not \nentered the coastwise passenger trade between ports in Alaska or \nbetween ports in Alaska and other ports on the west coast of the \ncontiguous states, then the termination of service required by \nsubsection (b) shall not take effect until 90 days following the entry \ninto trade by the United States vessel.\n    (e) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section, the term--\n            (1) ``cruise vessel'' means a vessel of greater than 5,000 \n        deadweight tons which provides a full range of luxury \n        accommodations, entertainment, dining and other services for \n        its passengers; and\n            (2)(A) ``foreign-flag cruise vessels'' does not apply to \n        vessels which regularly carry for hire both passengers and \n        vehicles or other cargo, or--\n            (B) which serve residents of their ports of call in Alaska \n        or other ports in the United States as a common or frequently \n        used means of transportation between United States ports.\n    (f) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed as \naffecting or otherwise modifying the authority contained in the Act of \nJune 30, 1961 (46 U.S.C. 289(b)) authorizing the transportation of \npassengers and merchandise in Canadian vessels between ports in Alaska \nand the United States."
