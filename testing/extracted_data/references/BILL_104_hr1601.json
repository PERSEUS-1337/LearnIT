FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the development, assembly, and operation of the \n        International Space Station is in the national interest of the \n        United States;\n            (2) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has \n        restructured and redesigned the International Space Station, \n        consolidated contract responsibility, and achieved program \n        management, control, and stability;\n            (3) the significant involvement by private ventures in \n        marketing and using, competitively servicing, and commercially \n        augmenting the operational capabilities of the International \n        Space Station during its assembly and operational phases will \n        lower costs and increase benefits to the international \n        partners;\n            (4) further rescoping or redesigns of the International \n        Space Station will lead to costly delays, increase costs to its \n        international partners, discourage commercial involvement, and \n        weaken the international space partnership necessary for future \n        space projects;\n            (5) total program costs for development, assembly, and \n        initial operations have been identified and capped to ensure \n        financial discipline and maintain program schedule milestones;\n            (6) in order to contain costs, mission planning and \n        engineering functions of the National Space Transportation \n        System (Space Shuttle) program should be coordinated with the \n        Space Station Program Office;\n            (7) complete program authorizations for large development \n        programs promote program stability, reduce the potential for \n        cost growth, and provide necessary assurance to international \n        partners and commercial participants; and\n            (8) the International Space Station represents an important \n        component of an adequately funded civil space program which \n        balances human space flight with science, aeronautics, and \n        technology.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For the purposes of this Act--\n            (1) the term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of \n        the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and\n            (2) the term ``cost threat'' means a potential change to \n        the program baseline documented as a potential cost by the \n        Space Station Program Office.\n\nSEC. 4. SPACE STATION COMPLETE PROGRAM AUTHORIZATION.\n\n    (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--Except as provided in \nsubsection (b), there are authorized to be appropriated to the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration for the period encompassing fiscal \nyear 1996 and all subsequent fiscal years not to exceed \n$13,141,000,000, to remain available until expended, for complete \ndevelopment and assembly of, and to provide for initial operations, \nthrough fiscal year 2002, of, the International Space Station. Not more \nthan $2,121,000,000 may be appropriated for any one fiscal year.\n    (b) Certification and Report.--None of the funds authorized under \nsubsection (a) may be appropriated for any fiscal year unless, within \n60 days after the submission of the President's budget request for that \nfiscal year, the Administrator--\n            (1) certifies to the Congress that--\n                    (A) the program reserves available for such fiscal \n                year exceed the total of all cost threats known at the \n                time of certification;\n                    (B) the Administrator does not foresee delays in \n                the International Space Station's development or \n                assembly, including any delays relating to agreements \n                between the United States and its international \n                partners; and\n                    (C) the International Space Station can be fully \n                developed and assembled without requiring further \n                authorization of appropriations beyond amounts \n                authorized under subsection (a); or\n            (2) submits to the Congress a report which describes--\n                    (A) the circumstances which prevent a certification \n                under paragraph (1);\n                    (B) remedial actions undertaken or to be undertaken \n                with respect to such circumstances;\n                    (C) the effects of such circumstances on the \n                development and assembly of the International Space \n                Station; and\n                    (D) the justification for proceeding with the \n                program, if appropriate.\nIf the Administrator submits a report under paragraph (2), such report \nshall include any comments relating thereto submitted to the \nAdministrator by any involved party.\n    (c) Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory.--The Administrator is authorized \nto exercise an option to purchase, for not more than $35,000,000, the \nClear Lake Development Facility, containing the Sonny Carter Training \nFacility and the approximately 13.7 acre parcel of land on which it is \nlocated, using funds authorized by this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. COORDINATION WITH SPACE SHUTTLE.\n\n    The Administrator shall--\n            (1) coordinate the engineering functions of the Space \n        Shuttle program with the Space Station Program Office to \n        minimize overlapping activities; and\n            (2) in the interest of safety and the successful \n        integration of human spacecraft development with human \n        spaceflight operations, maintain at one lead center the \n        complementary capabilities of human spacecraft engineering and \n        astronaut training.\n\nSEC. 6. COMMERCIALIZATION OF SPACE STATION.\n\n    (a) Policy.--The Congress declares that a priority goal of \nconstructing the International Space Station is the economic \ndevelopment of Earth orbital space. The Congress further declares that \nthe use of free market principles in operating, allocating the use of, \nand adding capabilities to the Space Station, and the resulting fullest \npossible engagement of commercial providers and participation of \ncommercial users, will reduce Space Station operational costs for all \npartners and the Federal Government's share of the United States burden \nto fund operations.\n    (b) Report.--The Administrator shall deliver to the Congress, \nwithin 60 days after the submission of the President's budget request \nfor fiscal year 1997, a market study that examines the role of \ncommercial ventures which could supply, use, service, or augment the \nInternational Space Station, the specific policies and initiatives the \nAdministrator is advancing to encourage these commercial opportunities, \nthe cost savings to be realized by the international partnership from \napplying commercial approaches to cost-shared operations, and the cost \nreimbursements to the United States Federal Government from commercial \nusers of the Space Station.\n\nSEC. 7. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the ``cost incentive fee'' single \nprime contract negotiated by the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration for the International Space Station, and the \nconsolidation of programmatic and financial accountability into a \nsingle Space Station Program Office, are two examples of reforms for \nthe reinvention of all National Aeronautics and Space Administration \nprograms that should be applied as widely and as quickly as possible \nthroughout the Nation's civil space program.\n\nSEC. 8. SPACE STATION ACCOUNTING REPORT.\n\n    Within one year after the date of enactment of this Act, and \nannually thereafter, the Administrator shall transmit to the Congress a \nreport with a complete annual accounting of all costs of the space \nstation, including cash and other payments to Russia.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives September 28, 1995.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                ROBIN H. CARLE,\n\n                                                                 Clerk."
