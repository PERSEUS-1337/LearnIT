FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Internships are increasingly important to the ability \n        of college students to gain skills, make professional \n        connections, and find jobs after graduation.\n            (2) In 2011, according to the National Association of \n        Colleges and Employers, employers offered full-time positions \n        to 61.2 percent of their interns with an acceptance rate of \n        86.5 percent.\n            (3) Many students struggle to make ends meet; 66 percent of \n        young community college students dedicate more than 20 hours a \n        week to an outside job, and the need of many students to \n        maintain a part-time or full-time job reduces or eliminates the \n        time available for an internship.\n            (4) Internships often require significant time commitments \n        or temporary relocation, which many students are unable to \n        afford; these additional living expenses include housing, \n        meals, and travel, and these costs make unpaid internships with \n        employers like non-profit organizations and government even \n        more inaccessible for those with low and middle incomes.\n            (5) In 2011, 46 percent of students who had completed an \n        internship were offered jobs, compared with 31 percent of \n        students who did not complete an internship; more than 76 \n        percent of employers rank relevant experience as the most \n        important quality when hiring.\n            (6) Many university officials and employers acknowledge \n        that participating in an undergraduate internship is extremely \n        helpful for finding meaningful employment in today's job \n        market.\n\nSEC. 3. OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUCCESS PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Program Authorized.--From the amounts made available to carry \nout this Act, the Secretary of Education shall establish a grant \nprogram to award grants to qualifying educational institutions in \naccordance with this section in order to support eligible students \nattending such institutions during internships.\n    (b) Application.--To receive a grant under this section, a \nqualifying educational institution shall submit to the Secretary an \napplication at such time, in such manner, and containing such \ninformation as the Secretary may require.\n    (c) Use of Funds by Qualifying Educational Institutions.--A \nqualifying educational institution receiving a grant under this section \nshall use the grant funds in accordance with the following:\n            (1) Activities.--Such institution may only use the grant to \n        fund internship awards in accordance with this section to \n        eligible students enrolled at the institution.\n            (2) Administration of internship awards.--Internship awards \n        made from the grant--\n                    (A) shall be administered by the financial aid \n                office of such institution;
