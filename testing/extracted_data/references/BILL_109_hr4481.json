FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, \n        and Liability Act of 1980 established a Federal Superfund trust \n        fund for the purpose of hazardous substance remediation at \n        sites across the Nation;\n            (2) the release of hazardous substances threatens and \n        impairs public health, community infrastructure, the economy, \n        and social well being;\n            (3) the Environmental Protection Agency has evaluated more \n        than 45,900 sites and placed 1,540 Superfund sites on the \n        National Priorities List;\n            (4) more than 70,000,000 Americans live within 4 miles of a \n        Superfund site;\n            (5) the expiration of the crude oil, chemical feedstock, \n        and corporate taxes in 1995 has contributed to a funding \n        shortfall that prevented numerous Superfund sites from \n        receiving new construction funding in fiscal years 2004 and \n        2005 and slowed the pace of existing cleanups;\n            (6) delayed and slowed Superfund cleanup actions magnify \n        public health risks and increase total remediation costs;\n            (7) the reestablishment of the Superfund tax would have no \n        effect on the liability under the Comprehensive Environmental \n        Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 of \n        responsible parties or potentially responsible parties for \n        hazardous substance releases;\n            (8) Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused unprecedented \n        environmental damage in the Gulf Coast States of Alabama, \n        Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas;\n            (9) Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused significant new \n        releases of hazardous substances and also damaged, threatened, \n        or otherwise impaired the integrity of 54 sites listed on the \n        National Priorities List and other facilities producing, \n        manufacturing, storing, or releasing hazardous substances;\n            (10) released hazardous substances must be removed, \n        remediated, and otherwise cleaned up to mitigate environmental \n        damage and to protect public health;\n            (11) the current and future removal, remediation, and \n        cleanup efforts in Hurricane-affected areas will incur \n        significant costs; and\n            (12) the costs incurred to remove, remediate, and otherwise \n        clean up hazardous substances, in the Hurricane-impacted areas \n        of the Gulf Coast and nationwide, are most equitably borne by \n        the parties responsible for the manufacture, production, use, \n        storage, and release of such substances.\n\nSEC. 3.
