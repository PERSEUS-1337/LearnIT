FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) fostering and protecting the highest possible standards \n        of health care for the American people require--\n                    (A) creative scientific inquiry and information \n                exchanges in the medical sciences and the industries \n                that serve the American people;\n                    (B) dissemination and debate of the results of such \n                inquiry within the medical community; and\n                    (C) rapid development, testing, marketing approval, \n                and accessibility of state-of-the-art health care \n                products, such as drugs, biologics, and medical \n                devices;\n            (2) traditionally, free-flowing information exchanges \n        between health professionals and the producers of health care \n        products, with respect to potentially beneficial new uses of \n        existing products, have been a means to achieve scientific \n        advances and medical breakthroughs;\n            (3) such information exchanges have been protected by law, \n        but erroneous interpretation, application, and enforcement of \n        existing law have inhibited and even foreclosed such \n        information exchanges in recent years; and\n            (4) it is imperative to the health of the American people \n        to enact legislation to clarify the intent of Congress and the \n        existing state of the law to stimulate and encourage such \n        educational and scientific information exchanges among industry \n        and health care practitioners.\n\nSEC. 2.
