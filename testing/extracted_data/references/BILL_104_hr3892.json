FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) in D'Oench Duhme & Co. v. Federal Deposit Insurance \n        Corporation, 315 U.S. 447 (1942), the Supreme Court determined \n        that secret side agreements that were not recorded in the \n        records of an insured depository institution should not be \n        enforceable against Federal banking agencies when those \n        agencies acquired assets following the failure of the \n        institution;\n            (2) the Supreme Court based its holding (hereafter in this \n        section referred to as the ``D'Oench doctrine'') on its power \n        to develop Federal common law;\n            (3) in 1950, the Congress supplemented the D'Oench doctrine \n        by amending section 13(e) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act \n        to invalidate agreements relating to assets acquired by Federal \n        banking agencies that were not recorded in official depository \n        institution records;\n            (4) Federal and State courts have expanded the scope of the \n        D'Oench doctrine and section 13(e) of the Federal Deposit \n        Insurance Act by interpreting them to bar tort claims based on \n        oral representations, claims that do not relate to assets \n        acquired by Federal banking agencies, and numerous other claims \n        and defenses beyond the original scope and intent of those two \n        lines of authority;\n            (5) the Federal banking agencies' aggressive use of the \n        D'Oench doctrine and section 13(e) of the Federal Deposit \n        Insurance Act in the administrative claims process and \n        litigation, combined with the expansive interpretation of those \n        authorities by the Supreme Court, have led to fundamentally \n        unfair results; and\n            (6) many individuals have been barred from asserting \n        potentially valid claims and defenses once an insured \n        depository institution has been declared insolvent and taken \n        over by a Federal banking agency.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to unify the lines of authority developed under the \n        Federal common law and referred to in subsection (a) and \n        section 13(e) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, so that all \n        cases relating to agreements against the interest of the \n        Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are decided pursuant to \n        Federal statutory law; and\n            (2) to return the D'Oench doctrine to its original purpose \n        by continuing to bar the enforcement of unrecorded agreements, \n        but allowing certain potentially valid intentional tort and \n        other claims and defenses to be adjudicated on their merits.\n\nSEC. 3. CLARIFICATION.\n\n    Section 13(e) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. \n1823(e)) is amended to read as follows:\n    ``(e) Agreements Against Interests of the Corporation.--\n            ``(1) In general.--No agreement which tends to diminish or \n        defeat the interest of the Corporation in any asset acquired by \n        the Corporation under this section or under section 11, by \n        purchase or assumption, or in its capacity as receiver of any \n        insured depository institution, shall be enforceable against \n        the Corporation unless that agreement is in writing and was \n        executed in the ordinary course of business by an insured \n        depository institution through an officer or other employee or \n        representative of the institution having the authority to \n        execute such an agreement on behalf of the institution.\n            ``(2) Claims against the corporation.--Notwithstanding \n        paragraph (1), no court may bar, estop, or otherwise prohibit \n        the adjudication against the Corporation, in its corporate \n        capacity and as receiver of an insured depository institution, \n        of--\n                    ``(A) a claim or defense that does not relate to \n                specific assets acquired by the Corporation;\n                    ``(B) a claim or defense that does relate to \n                transactions that would not, in the normal course of \n                business, be reflected in the transaction records of \n                the institution;\n                    ``(C) a claim or defense in litigation commenced \n                before the date of the appointment of the Corporation \n                as receiver or conservator for the insured depository \n                institution;\n                    ``(D) a claim or defense, filed at any time, based \n                on alleged intentional torts or alleged violation of \n                State or Federal law, if--\n                            ``(i) the party asserting the claim or \n                        defense demonstrates that the party did not--\n                                    ``(I) participate in a scheme to \n                                defraud the subject insured depository \n                                institution; or\n                                    ``(II) knowingly lend itself to a \n                                scheme to mislead bank examiners by \n                                misrepresenting the value of the assets \n                                of the institution; and\n                            ``(ii) any oral representations relied upon \n                        are not in conflict with a written agreement \n                        contained in the records of the institution.\n            ``(3) Status as holder in due course.--Except as otherwise \n        provided in paragraph (1), any other provision of Federal \n        statutory law, or applicable State law, the Corporation may not \n        defeat a claim related to an asset by demonstrating that the \n        asset was acquired in good faith, for value, and without actual \n        knowledge of the claim, unless the Corporation also \n        demonstrates that the asset was not acquired by the Corporation \n        upon its appointment as conservator or receiver or as part of a \n        purchase and assumption transaction.\n            ``(4) Exception for vendor agreements.--Subsection (e)(1) \n        does not apply to an agreement for the sale or purchase of \n        goods or services actually received by or delivered to an \n        insured depository institution before the date of appointment \n        of a receiver for that institution.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
