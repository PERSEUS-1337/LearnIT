SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Student Loan \nEvaluation and Stabilization Act of 1995''.\n    (b) References.--References in this Act to ``the Act'' are \nreferences to the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 et \nseq.).\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that:\n            (1) The current public/private student loan partnership is \n        fulfilling the mission set for it by Congress, delivering loans \n        to students reliably and in a timely fashion, and should be \n        preserved.\n            (2) The Administration's dismantling of the Federal Family \n        Education Loan (FFEL) Program which has begun in order to \n        replace it with an unproven direct Government lending program, \n        which increases the Federal debt, further enlarges the Federal \n        bureaucracy, adds major new financial oversight activities to \n        the already overburdened Department of Education, and forces \n        Congress to depend on estimated budget savings which may prove \n        illusory, needs to be stopped so that a true and valid \n        comparison of the student loan programs can occur.\n            (3) The Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL) Program pilot is \n        only now getting started and has proceeded fairly smoothly when \n        dealing with 5 percent of new loan volume. This slow and \n        cautious approach should be continued as the volume increases \n        to 40 percent. This pilot program should continue to proceed \n        slowly and cautiously and demonstrate successful results before \n        expanding it to additional loan volume.\n            (4) While the FDSL Program pilot continues its test phase, \n        reform of the FFEL Program which will benefit students and \n        institutions of higher education should be a continuing \n        priority for the Department of Education.\n\nSEC. 3. PARTICIPATION OF INSTITUTIONS AND ADMINISTRATION OF DIRECT LOAN \n              PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Limitation on Proportion of Loans Made Under Direct Loan \nProgram.--Section 453(a) of the Act (20 U.S.C. 1087c(a)) is amended--\n            (1) by amending paragraph (2) to read as follows:\n            ``(2) Determination of number of agreements.--In the \n        exercise of the Secretary's discretion, the Secretary shall \n        enter into agreements under subsections (a) and (b) of section \n        454 with institutions for participation in the programs under \n        this part, subject to the following:\n                    ``(A) for academic year 1994-1995, loans made under \n                this part shall represent 5 percent of the new student \n                loan volume for such year; and\n                    ``(B) for academic year 1995-1996 and for any \n                succeeding fiscal year, loans made under this part \n                shall be limited to loans to students and parents of \n                students attending eligible institutions that have \n                applied and been accepted for participation in the \n                program under this part on or before December 31, \n                1994.''\n            (2) by striking paragraph (3); and\n            (3) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (3).\n    (b) Elimination of Conscription.--Section 453(b)(2) of such Act is \namended--\n            (1) by striking subparagraph (B);\n            (2) by redesignating subparagraphs (A)(i) and (A)(ii) as \n        subparagraphs (A) and (B) respectively; and\n            (3) in such subparagraph (B) (as so redesignated) by \n        striking ``clause (i); and'' and inserting ``subparagraph \n        (A).''.\n    (c) Control of Administrative Expenses.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 458(a) of the Act is amended to \n        read as follows:\n    ``(a) In General.--Each fiscal year, there shall be available to \nthe Secretary of Education from funds not otherwise appropriated, funds \nto be obligated for administrative costs under this part, not to exceed \n(from such funds not otherwise appropriated) $260,000,000 in fiscal \nyear 1994, $295,000,000 in fiscal year 1995, $395,000,000 in fiscal \nyear 1996, $400,000,000 in fiscal year 1997, and $400,000,000 in fiscal \nyear 1998.
