STREAMLINE GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Partially as a result of unnecessary Federal spending, \n        the United States national debt is over $15 trillion.\n            (2) Bureaucratic complexity and redundancy waste time and \n        money for consumers, businesses, and taxpayers.\n            (3) In March 2011, the Government Accountability Office \n        released a report entitled ``Opportunities to Reduce Potential \n        Duplication in Government Programs, Save Tax Dollars, and \n        Enhance Revenue'' that identifies areas where greater \n        efficiencies could be found in Government operations. Some of \n        the findings include:\n                    (A) Seven different Federal agencies have programs \n                dedicated to meeting the water needs in the United \n                States-Mexico border region.\n                    (B) There are 82 Federal programs dedicated to \n                improving teacher quality.\n                    (C) There are 56 programs in 20 different Federal \n                agencies designed to target financial literacy.\n                    (D) There are 80 Federal programs to boost \n                transportation opportunities for disadvantaged \n                individuals.\n                    (E) There are over 20 programs in seven different \n                Federal agencies working to combat homelessness.\n            (4) The Department of Commerce's core business and trade \n        functions, the Small Business Administration, the Office of the \n        United States Trade Representative, the Export-Import Bank, the \n        Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the United States \n        Trade and Development Agency all serve important, but sometimes \n        overlapping functions for consumers and businesses in the \n        United States.
