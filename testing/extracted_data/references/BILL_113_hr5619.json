SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``LEO Fair \nRetirement Act of 2014''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Federal law enforcement officers are never ``off-\n        duty''. They are counted on to respond at any time of the day \n        or night, regardless of their official duty status, to protect \n        the public safety. Outside of our Nation's armed forces, theirs \n        is the only occupation comprised of individuals who are \n        routinely called upon to put their lives on the line to keep \n        America safe.\n            (2) Though the Federal Government may house the largest \n        variety of occupations of any U.S. employer across its panoply \n        of agencies and entities, Federal law enforcement is absolutely \n        unique among them, and the Federal law enforcement officer has \n        no counterpart in the private sector. It is one of the most \n        stressful, most dangerous, and most rewarding careers for those \n        who meet the rigorous requirements of the job.\n            (3) It was in recognition of the unique nature of the \n        occupation, and the demanding schedules required of those who \n        fill its ranks, that Congress established distinct pay and \n        benefit systems for Federal law enforcement positions. This \n        includes basic pay, retirement, and even overtime compensation, \n        in the form of either Law Enforcement Availability Pay \n        (``LEAP'') or Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime \n        (``AUO'').\n            (4) Under current law, LEAP by its very nature is provided \n        to law enforcement officers to ensure that they are \n        ``available'', that they will be ``generally and reasonably \n        accessible by the agency'' in excess of the 40-hour workweek to \n        perform unscheduled duty based on the agency's needs.\n            (5) Similarly, AUO was established to provide overtime to \n        certain law enforcement officers in positions where ``the hours \n        of duty cannot be controlled administratively'' and that \n        require ``substantial amounts of irregular, unscheduled \n        overtime duty''.\n            (6) Because both LEAP and AUO compensation are subject to \n        the pay caps, they are payable to a Federal law enforcement \n        officer only to the extent that the payments do not cause the \n        aggregate of the employee's basic pay and premium pay to exceed \n        the established caps.\n            (7) In light of the continuing homeland and national \n        security threats facing our Nation, and after a three-year \n        Federal pay freeze, it is in the interest of the Federal \n        Government to ensure that it can continue to recruit and retain \n        the highest caliber personnel by guaranteeing Federal law \n        enforcement officers full credit in retirement for overtime \n        hours worked but never paid.\n\nSEC. 2. COMPUTATION OF ANNUITY FOR HOURS WORKED IN EXCESS OF LAW \n              ENFORCEMENT AVAILABILITY PAY AND ADMINISTRATIVELY \n              UNCONTROLLABLE OVERTIME LIMITATIONS.\n\n    (a) CSRS.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 8339 of title 5, United States \n        Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(v)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, \nincluding sections 5545a and 5547, any law enforcement availability pay \nunder section 5545a that would have been received by an individual \ndescribed under section 8331(3)(E) (i) or (ii) but for the limitation \nprovided in such section 5547 shall be included in the average pay of \nsuch an individual for purposes of computing the annuity of such an \nindividual under this section.\n    ``(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, including \nsection 5545(c)(2), any administratively uncontrollable overtime pay \nunder such section that would have been received by an employee but for \nthe limitation provided in such section shall be included in the \naverage pay of such employee for purposes of computing the annuity of \nsuch employee under this section.''.\n            (2) Clarification with respect to annuity limit.--The \n        limitation provided in section 8339(f) of title 5, United \n        States Code, shall apply to any annuity calculated pursuant to \n        subsection (v) of such section (as added by paragraph (1)).\n    (b) FERS.--Section 8415 of title 5, United States Code, is amended \nby adding at the end the following:\n    ``(o)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, \nincluding sections 5545a and 5547, any law enforcement availability pay \nunder section 5545a that would have been received by any individual \ndescribed under section 8331(3)(E) (i) or (ii) but for the limitation \nprovided in such section 5545a or 5547 shall be included in the average \npay of such an individual for purposes of computing the annuity of such \nan individual under this section.\n    ``(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, including \nsection 5545(c)(2), any administratively uncontrollable overtime pay \nunder such section that would have been received by an employee but for \nthe limitation provided in such section shall be included in the \naverage pay of such employee for purposes of computing the annuity of \nsuch employee under this section.''.\n    (c) Application.--The amendments made by this section shall apply \nto any applicable annuity calculated on or after the date that is one \nyear after the date of enactment of this Act."
