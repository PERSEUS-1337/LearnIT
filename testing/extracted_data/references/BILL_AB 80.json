Differences of language status, income, disability, sexual orientation, and many other factors influence the identity and experience of these young people, just as with any other population.\n(e) My Brother\u2019s Keeper is focused on the following milestones: (1) getting a healthy start and entering school ready to learn; (2) reading at grade level by third grade; (3) graduating from high school ready for college and career; (4) completing postsecondary education or training; (5) successfully entering the workforce; and (6) keeping kids on track and giving them second chances.\n(f) The My Brother\u2019s Keeper Task Force Report to the President (May 2014) cites numerous areas in which boys and men of color consistently experience disproportionately negative outcomes. These areas include living in poverty, living without a male parent in the household, high school dropout rates, unemployment, death by homicide, and imprisonment.\n(g) The My Brother\u2019s Keeper Task Force has identified initial recommendations and areas of opportunity at each of these key milestones or \u201cfocus areas.\u201d The task force has also identified several cross-cutting areas of opportunity that span all focus areas.\n(h) The recommendations in the My Brother\u2019s Keeper Task Force Report to the President inform and influence California policy and California\u2019s compliance with those recommendations makes the state more competitive for federal funding and strengthens its economic competitiveness.\n(i) Our state\u2019s future prosperity and health depend on all Californians having a fair chance to thrive and succeed. One of the best investments we can make is to be certain we do everything possible to help young people become healthy, productive adults. As California becomes more diverse, we must nurture and harness the talents, skills, and hopes of young people of color \u2014 boys and young men in particular.\n(j) The Department of Finance projects California\u2019s population of boys and men of color will increasingly represent a growing percentage of the state's male population, reaching close to 80 percent for boys and men of color compared to 20 percent for non-Hispanic white males by 2050.\n(k) The Assembly Select Committee on the Status of Boys and Men of Color in California has recognized that boys and young men of color are in jeopardy, and this poses a serious threat to California\u2019s economic strength and competitiveness.\n(l) The Assembly Select Committee on the Status of Boys and Men of Color\u2019s policy framework emphasizes the following issues: (1) health and safety; (2) education; (3) juvenile justice; (4) employment and wealth; and (5) youth development. Related issues that have been recommended for expansion of the committee\u2019s work include higher education, immigration, and housing.\n(m) Community and youth leaders from across the state have taken a significant interest in partnering with government and systems leaders through the Alliance for Boys and Men of Color in order to improve the health and success of our state\u2019s young people of color.\nSEC. 2.\nChapter 3.4 (commencing with Section 8265) is added to Division 1 of Title 2 of the Government Code, to read:\nCHAPTER  3.4.
