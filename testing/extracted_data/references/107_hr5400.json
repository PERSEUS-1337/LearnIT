SENSE OF THE CONGRESS RELATING TO UNITED STATES SUPPORT FOR \n              NADBANK PROJECTS FOR WHICH FINANCE WATER CONSERVATION FOR \n              IRRIGATORS AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS IN THE SOUTHWEST \n              UNITED STATES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Irrigators and agricultural producers are suffering \n        enormous hardships in the southwest United States. The border \n        States of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas are \n        suffering from one of the worst droughts in history. In \n        Arizona, this is the second driest period in recorded history \n        and the worst since 1904.\n            (2) In spite of decades of water conservation in the \n        southwest United States, irrigated agriculture uses more than \n        60 percent of surface and ground water.\n            (3) The most inadequate water supplies in the United States \n        are in the Southwest, including the lower Colorado River basin \n        and the Great Plains River basins south of the Platte River. In \n        these areas, 70 percent of the water taken from the stream is \n        not returned.\n            (4) The amount of water being pumped out of groundwater \n        sources in many areas is greater than the amount being \n        replenished, thus depleting the groundwater supply.\n            (5) On August 20, 2002, the Board of the North American \n        Development Bank agreed to the creation in the bank of a Water \n        Conservation Investment Fund.\n            (6) The Water Conservation Investment Fund of the North \n        American Development Bank stated that up to $80,000,000 would \n        be available for grant financing of water conservation \n        projects, which grant funds would be divided equally between \n        the United States and Mexico.\n    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) water conservation projects are eligible for funding \n        from the North American Development Bank under the Agreement \n        Between the Government of the United States of America and the \n        Government of the United Mexican States Concerning the \n        Establishment of a Border Environment Cooperation Commission \n        and a North American Development Bank;\n            (2) the Board of the North American Development Bank should \n        support qualified water conservation projects that can assist \n        irrigators and agricultural producers; and\n            (3) the Board of the North American Development Bank should \n        take into consideration the needs of all of the border states \n        before approving funding for water projects, and strive to fund \n        water conservation projects in each of the border states.\n\nSEC. 6. ADDITIONAL SENSES OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) It is the sense of the Congress that the Board of the North \nAmerican Development Bank should support the financing of projects, on \nboth sides of the international boundary between the United States and \nMexico, which address coastal issues and the problem of pollution in \nboth countries having an environmental impact along the Pacific Ocean \nand Gulf of Mexico shores of the United States and Mexico.\n    (b) It is the sense of the Congress that the Board of the North \nAmerican Development Bank should support the financing of projects, on \nboth sides of the international boundary between the United States and \nMexico, which address air pollution.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives October 10, 2002.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                                 Clerk."
