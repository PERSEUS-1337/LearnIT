FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) After decades of apartheid, South Africa has entered a \n        new era which presents a historic opportunity for a transition \n        to a peaceful, stable, and democratic future.\n            (2) Through broad and open negotiations, the parties in \n        South Africa have reached a landmark agreement on the future of \n        their country. This agreement includes the establishment of a \n        Transitional Executive Council and the setting of a date for \n        nonracial elections.\n            (3) The international community has a vital interest in \n        supporting the transition from apartheid toward nonracial \n        democracy.\n            (4) The success of the transition in South Africa is \n        crucial to the stability and economic development of the \n        southern African region.\n            (5) Representative leaders in South Africa, including \n        Nelson Mandela of the African National Congress, have called \n        for an end to all remaining measures limiting economic contacts \n        with South Africa.\n            (6) In light of recent developments, the continuation of \n        such measures is detrimental to persons disadvantaged by \n        apartheid.\n\nSEC. 3. UNITED STATES POLICY.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) the United States should--\n                    (A) strongly support the Transitional Executive \n                Council in South Africa,\n                    (B) encourage rapid progress toward the \n                establishment of a nonracial democratic government in \n                South Africa, and\n                    (C) support a consolidation of democracy in South \n                Africa through democratic elections for an interim \n                government and a new nonracial constitution;\n            (2) the United States should continue to provide assistance \n        to support the transition to a nonracial democracy in South \n        Africa, and should urge international financial institutions \n        and other donors to also provide such assistance;\n            (3) to the maximum extent practicable, the United States \n        should consult closely with international financial \n        institutions, other donors, and South African entities on a \n        coordinated strategy to support the transition to a nonracial \n        democracy in South Africa;\n            (4) in order to provide ownership and managerial \n        opportunities, professional advancement, training, and \n        employment for disadvantaged South Africans and to respond to \n        the historical inequities created under apartheid, the United \n        States should--\n                    (A) promote the expansion of private enterprise and \n                free markets in South Africa,\n                    (B) encourage the South African private sector to \n                take a special responsibility and interest in providing \n                such opportunities, advancement, training, and \n                employment for disadvantaged South Africans, and\n                    (C) encourage United States private sector \n                investment in and trade with South Africa;\n            (5) the United States should urge the Government of South \n        Africa to liberalize its trade and investment policies to \n        facilitate the expansion of the economy, and to shift resources \n        to meet the needs of disadvantaged South Africans;\n            (6) the United States should promote cooperation between \n        South Africa and other countries in the region to foster \n        regional stability and economic growth; and\n            (7) the United States should demonstrate its support for an \n        expedited transition to, and should adopt a long term policy \n        beneficial to the establishment and perpetuation of, a \n        nonracial democracy in South Africa.\n\nSEC. 4.
