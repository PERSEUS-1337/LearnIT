NATIONAL TRAILS SYSTEM ACT AMENDMENTS.\n\n    (a) National Discovery Trails.--Section 3(a) of the National Trails \nSystem Act (16 U.S.C. 1242(a)) is amended by inserting after paragraph \n(4) the following:\n            ``(5) National discovery trails, established under section \n        5, which--\n                    ``(A) shall be extended, continuous, interstate \n                trails so located as to provide for outstanding outdoor \n                recreation and travel and to connect representative \n                examples of America's trails and communities;\n                    ``(B) should provide for the conservation and \n                enjoyment of significant natural, cultural, and \n                historic resources associated with each trail and \n                should be so located as to represent metropolitan, \n                urban, rural, and back country regions of the Nation;\n                    ``(C) may be designated on Federal lands and, with \n                the consent of the owner thereof, on any non-Federal \n                lands; and\n                    ``(D) shall not be construed to modify, enlarge, or \n                diminish any authority of the Federal, State, or local \n                governments to regulate any use of land as provide for \n                by law or regulation.''.\n    (b) Designation of the American Discovery Trail as a National \nDiscovery Trail.--Section 5(a) of such Act (16 U.S.C. 1244(a)) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(__) The American Discovery Trail, a trail of \n        approximately 6,000 miles extending from Cape Henlopen State \n        Park in Delaware to Point Reyes National Seashore in \n        California, extending westward through Delaware, Maryland, the \n        District of Columbia, West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky, where \n        near Cincinnati it splits into two routes. The Northern Midwest \n        route traverses Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, and \n        Colorado, and the Southern Midwest route traverses Indiana, \n        Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, and Colorado. After the two routes \n        rejoin in Denver, Colorado, the route continues through \n        Colorado, Utah, Nevada, and California. The trail is generally \n        described in Volume 2 of the National Park Service feasibility \n        study dated June 1995 which shall be on file and available for \n        public inspection in the office of the Director of the National \n        Park Service, Department of the Interior, the District of \n        Columbia. The American Discovery Trail shall be administered by \n        the Secretary of the Interior in cooperation with at least one \n        competent trailwide volunteer-based organization and other \n        affected Federal land managing agencies, and State and local \n        governments, as appropriate. No lands or interests outside the \n        exterior boundaries of federally administered areas may be \n        acquired by the Federal Government solely for the American \n        Discovery Trail. The provisions of sections 7(e), 7(f), and \n        7(g) shall not apply to the American Discovery Trail.''.\n    (c) Comprehensive National Discovery Trail Plan.--Section 7 of such \nAct (16 U.S.C. 1246) is further amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing new subsection:\n    ``(l)(1) For purposes of subsection (5)(b), a trail shall not be \nconsidered feasible and desirable for designation as a national \ndiscovery trail unless it meets all of the following criteria:\n            ``(A) The trail must link one or more areas within the \n        boundaries of a metropolitan area (as those boundaries are \n        determined under section 134(c) of title 23, United States \n        Code). It should also join with other trails, connecting the \n        National Trails System to significant recreation and resources \n        areas.\n            ``(B) The trail must be supported by at least one competent \n        trailwide volunteer-based organization. Each trail should have \n        extensive local and trailwide support by the public, by user \n        groups, and by affected State and local governments.\n            ``(C) The trail must be extended and pass through more than \n        one State. At a minimum, it should be a continuous, walkable \n        route.\n    ``(2) The appropriate Secretary for each national discovery trail \nshall administer the trail in cooperation with at least one competent \ntrailwide volunteer-based organization. Where the designation of \ndiscovery trail is aligned with other units of the National Trails \nSystem, or State or local trails, the designation of a discovery trail \nshall not affect the protections or authorities provided for the other \ntrail or trails, nor shall the designation of a discovery trail \ndiminish the values and significance for which those trails were \nestablished. Not later than three complete fiscal years after the date \nof the enactment of any law designating a national discovery trail, the \nappropriate Secretary shall submit a comprehensive plan for the \nprotection, management, development, and use of the trail, to the \nCommittee on Natural Resources of the United States House of \nRepresentatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of \nthe United States Senate. The responsible Secretary shall ensure that \nthe comprehensive plan for the entire trail does not conflict with \nexisting agency direction and shall consult with the affected land \nmanaging agencies, the Governors of the affected States, affected \ncounty and local political jurisdictions, and local organizations \nmaintaining components of the trail. Components of the comprehensive \nplan include--\n            ``(A) policies and practices to be observed in the \n        administration and management of the trail, including the \n        identification of all significant natural, historical, and \n        cultural resources to be preserved, model agreements necessary \n        for joint trail administration among and between interested \n        parties, and an identified carrying capacity for critical \n        segments of the trail and a plan for their implementation where \n        appropriate;\n            ``(B) general and site-specific trail-related development \n        including costs; and\n            ``(C) the process to be followed by the volunteer-based \n        organization, in cooperation with the appropriate Secretary, to \n        implement the trail marking authorities in subsection (c) \n        conforming to approved trail logo or emblem requirements. \n        Nothing in this Act may be construed to impose or permit the \n        imposition of any landowner on the use of any non-Federal lands \n        without the consent of the owner thereof. Neither the \n        designation of a national discovery trail nor any plan relating \n        thereto shall affect or be considered in the granting or denial \n        of a right of way or any conditions relating thereto.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
