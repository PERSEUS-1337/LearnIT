FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to \n        prevent illegal immigration by enforcing existing laws and \n        enacting new laws and policies.\n            (2) The Federal Government has, to date, failed to carry \n        out this responsibility, resulting in a large and increasing \n        number of illegal immigrants residing within the borders of the \n        United States.\n            (3) Under current law, the States are required to provide \n        certain public benefits to their residents, including education \n        benefits for all children residing within their jurisdictions, \n        regardless of immigration status.\n            (4) The costs of educating illegal aliens are therefore \n        borne primarily by the States.\n            (5) The citizens of States that have a disproportionate \n        number of illegal immigrants therefore have borne a \n        disproportionate share of such educational costs, which result \n        from the failures of the Federal Government.\n            (6) In the interest of equity, the Federal Government \n        should reimburse the States for such educational costs.\n\nSEC. 3.
