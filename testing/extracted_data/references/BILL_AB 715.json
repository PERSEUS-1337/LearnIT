For this reason, the Legislature hereby occupies the subject matter of requirements related to school facilities levied or imposed in connection with, or made a condition of, any land use approval, whether legislative or adjudicative act, or both, and the mitigation of the impacts of land use approvals, whether legislative or adjudicative, or both, on the need for school facilities, to the exclusion of all other measures, financial or nonfinancial, on the subjects. For purposes of this subdivision, \u201cschool facilities\u201d means any school-related consideration relating to a school district\u2019s ability to accommodate enrollment.\n(f) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to limit or prohibit the use of Chapter 2.5 (commencing with Section 53311) of Division 2 of Title 5 to finance the construction or reconstruction of school facilities. However, the use of Chapter 2.5 (commencing with Section 53311) of Division 2 of Title 5 may not be required as a condition of approval of any legislative or adjudicative act, or both, if the purpose of the community facilities district is to finance school facilities.\n(g) (1) The refusal of a person to agree to undertake or cause to be undertaken an act relating to Chapter 2.5 (commencing with Section 53311) of Division 2 of Title 5, including formation of, or annexation to, a community facilities district, voting to levy a special tax, or authorizing another to vote to levy a special tax, may not be a factor when considering the approval of a legislative or adjudicative act, or both, involving, but not limited to, the planning, use, or development of real property, or any change in governmental organization or reorganization, as defined in Section 56021 or 56073, if the purpose of the community facilities district is to finance school facilities.\n(2) If a person voluntarily elects to establish, or annex into, a community facilities district and levy a special tax approved by landowner vote to finance school facilities, the present value of the special tax specified in the resolution of formation shall be calculated as an amount per square foot of assessable space and that amount shall be a credit against any applicable fee, charge, dedication, or other requirement for the construction or reconstruction of school facilities. For purposes of this paragraph, the calculation of present value shall use the interest rate paid on the United States Treasury\u2019s 30-year bond on the date of the formation of, or annexation to, the community facilities district, as the capitalization rate.\n(3) For purposes of subdivisions (f), (h), and (i), and this subdivision, \u201cschool facilities\u201d means any school-related consideration relating to a school district\u2019s ability to accommodate enrollment.\n(h) The payment or satisfaction of a fee, charge, or other requirement levied or imposed pursuant to Section 17620 of the Education Code in the amount specified in Section 65995 and, if applicable, any amounts specified in Section 65995.5 or 65995.7 are hereby deemed to be full and complete mitigation of the impacts of any legislative or adjudicative act, or both, involving, but not limited to, the planning, use, or development of real property, or any change in governmental organization or reorganization as defined in Section 56021 or 56073, on the provision of adequate school facilities.\n(i) A state or local agency may not deny or refuse to approve a legislative or adjudicative act, or both, involving, but not limited to, the planning, use, or development of real property, or any change in governmental organization or reorganization as defined in Section 56021 or 56073 on the basis of a person\u2019s refusal to provide school facilities mitigation that exceeds the amounts authorized pursuant to this section or pursuant to Section 65995.5 or 65995.7, as applicable."
