FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Great Lakes have experienced rapid changes in \n        recent years due to--\n                    (A) the introduction of multiple aquatic invasive \n                species;\n                    (B) alterations in the food web; and\n                    (C) decreases in the abundance of prey species;\n            (2) due to rapid biological change in the Great Lakes, the \n        Great Lakes need a collaborative, science-based program to \n        assist in making management actions regarding fish stocking \n        rates, the rehabilitation of important fish species, and \n        habitat restoration;\n            (3) the States of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, \n        Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and Wisconsin and Indian tribes \n        in those States, working through the Council of Lake Committees \n        of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, have identified that \n        mass marking is--\n                    (A) a precise tool to keep hatchery-produced fish \n                in balance with wild fish; and\n                    (B) essential to achieving fishery management and \n                research objectives through producing a better \n                understanding of--\n                            (i) the quantity of hatchery produced fish \n                        compared to wild fish in the Great Lakes;\n                            (ii) the effectiveness of hatchery \n                        operations; and\n                            (iii) the effectiveness of fishery \n                        management actions;\n            (4) the mass marking program of the United States Fish and \n        Wildlife Service in the Great Lakes--\n                    (A) was initiated in 2010 on a limited scale;\n                    (B) annually tags approximately 8,000,000 of the \n                hatchery-produced fish stocked in the Great Lakes;\n                    (C) is a basinwide cooperative effort among the \n                United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Indian tribes, \n                and State management agencies; and\n                    (D) produces data used by State and tribal fish \n                management agencies to make management decisions \n                regarding Great Lakes fisheries;\n            (5) annually, Federal, State, and tribal agencies stock \n        approximately 21,000,000 hatchery-produced fish in the Great \n        Lakes to support--\n                    (A) native species recovery; and\n                    (B) recreational and commercial fishing;\n            (6) mass marking of hatchery-produced fish, using automated \n        technology, is an efficient method of implementing a \n        collaborative, science-based fishery program; and\n            (7) the Great Lakes are an important and valued resource \n        that--\n                    (A) supports a robust regional economy valued at \n                more than $7,000,000,000; and\n                    (B) provides stability to the economy of the United \n                States.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n        the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.\n            (2) Program.--The term ``Program'' means the Great Lakes \n        Mass Marking Program established by section 4(a).\n\nSEC. 4. GREAT LAKES MASS MARKING PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--To assist in determining the effectiveness of \nhatchery operations and fisheries management actions and to support \nGreat Lakes fisheries, there is established within the United States \nFish and Wildlife Service a program for the mass marking of hatchery-\nproduced fish in the Great Lakes basin, to be known as the ``Great \nLakes Mass Marking Program''.\n    (b) Required Collaboration.--In carrying out the Program, the \nDirector shall collaborate with applicable Federal, State, and tribal \nfish management agencies, the Council of Lake Committees of the Great \nLakes Fishery Commission, and signatories to the Joint Strategic Plan \nfor Management of Great Lakes Fisheries.\n    (c) Availability of Data.--The Director shall make the data \ncollected under the Program available to applicable Federal, State, and \ntribal fish management agencies--\n            (1) to increase the understanding of the outcomes of \n        management action;\n            (2) to assist in meeting the restoration objectives of the \n        Great Lakes, including the fish community objectives and fish \n        management plans described in the Joint Strategic Plan for \n        Management of Great Lakes Fisheries;\n            (3) to assist in balancing predators and prey;\n            (4) to support and improve the economic status of tribal, \n        recreational, and commercial fisheries; and\n            (5) to assist in evaluating the effectiveness of habitat \n        restoration efforts in the Great Lakes.\n\nSEC. 5.
