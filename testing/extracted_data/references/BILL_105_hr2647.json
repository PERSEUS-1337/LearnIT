CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The People's Liberation Army is the principal \n        instrument of repression within the People's Republic of China, \n        responsible for occupying Tibet since 1950, massacring hundreds \n        of students and demonstrators for democracy in Tiananmen Square \n        on June 4, 1989, and running the Laogai (``reform through \n        labor'') slave labor camps.\n            (2) The People's Liberation Army is engaged in a massive \n        military buildup, which has involved a doubling since 1992 of \n        announced official figures for military spending by the \n        People's Republic of China.\n            (3) The People's Liberation Army is engaging in a major \n        ballistic missile modernization program which could undermine \n        peace and stability in East Asia, including 2 new \n        intercontinental missile programs, 1 submarine-launched missile \n        program, a new class of compact but long-range cruise missiles, \n        and an upgrading of medium- and short-range ballistic missiles.\n            (4) The People's Liberation Army is working to coproduce \n        the SU-27 fighter with Russia, and is in the process of \n        purchasing several substantial weapons systems from Russia, \n        including the 633 model of the Kilo-class submarine and the SS-\n        N-22 Sunburn missile system specifically designed to \n        incapacitate United States aircraft carriers and Aegis \n        cruisers.\n            (5) The People's Liberation Army has carried out acts of \n        aggression in the South China Sea, including the February 1995 \n        seizure of the Mischief Reef in the Spratley Islands, which is \n        claimed by the Philippines.\n            (6) In July 1995 and in March 1996, the People's Liberation \n        Army conducted missile tests to intimidate Taiwan when Taiwan \n        held historic free elections, and those tests effectively \n        blockaded Taiwan's 2 principal ports of Keelung and Kaohsiung.\n            (7) The People's Liberation Army has contributed to the \n        proliferation of technologies relevant to the refinement of \n        weapons-grade nuclear material, including transferring ring \n        magnets to Pakistan.\n            (8) The People's Liberation Army and associated defense \n        companies have provided ballistic missile components, cruise \n        missiles, and chemical weapons ingredients to Iran, a country \n        that the executive branch has repeatedly reported to Congress \n        is the greatest sponsor of terrorism in the world.\n            (9) In May 1996, United States authorities caught the \n        People's Liberation Army enterprise Poly Technologies and the \n        civilian defense industrial company Norinco attempting to \n        smuggle 2,000 AK-47s into Oakland, California, and offering to \n        sell urban gangs shoulder-held missile launchers capable of \n        ``taking out a 747'' (which the affidavit of the United States \n        Customs Service of May 21, 1996, indicated that the \n        representative of Poly Technologies and Norinco claimed), and \n        Communist Chinese authorities punished only 4 low-level arms \n        merchants by sentencing them on May 17, 1997, to brief prison \n        terms.\n            (10) The People's Liberation Army contributes to the \n        People's Republic of China's failure to meet the standards of \n        the 1995 Memorandum of Understanding with the United States on \n        intellectual property rights by running factories which pirate \n        videos, compact discs, and computer software that are products \n        of the United States.\n            (11) The People's Liberation Army contributes to the \n        People's Republic of China's failing to meet the standards of \n        the February 1997 Memorandum of Understanding with the United \n        States on textiles by operating enterprises engaged in the \n        transshipment of textile products to the United States through \n        third countries.\n            (12) The estimated $2 billion to $3 billion in annual \n        earnings of People's Liberation Army enterprises subsidize the \n        expansion and activities of the People's Liberation Army \n        described in this subsection.\n            (13) The commercial activities of the People's Liberation \n        Army are frequently conducted on noncommercial terms, or for \n        noncommercial purposes such as military or foreign policy \n        considerations.\n\nSEC. 2.
