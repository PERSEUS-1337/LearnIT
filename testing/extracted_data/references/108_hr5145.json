FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Nearly one-third of the population of the United States \n        participates in fish and wildlife-related recreation annually. \n        In 2001, 82 million people participated in wildlife-related \n        recreation, including sport angling, hunting, birding, \n        photography, and other activities.\n            (2) Vibrant, healthy, and well-managed natural living \n        resources are essential to obtaining the economic benefits \n        derived from them. Wildlife-related recreation contributes \n        significantly to the United States economy. In 2001, the \n        economic impact of fishing and hunting was $116,000,000,000 and \n        $68,000,000,000, respectively. In addition, approximately \n        1,000,000 jobs were created as a result of such recreation.\n            (3) There are over 50 university programs, dozens of State \n        and Federal agencies, and over $1 billion dedicated to \n        fisheries and wildlife research, management, and conservation.\n            (4) Expertise in freshwater and anadromous fisheries and \n        wildlife policy is paramount to the future effective management \n        of the Nation's fish and wildlife resources.\n            (5) The National Sea Grant John A. Knauss Fellowship has \n        been successful in promoting stewardship of the Nation's \n        natural marine and coastal resources. Since 1979, over 528 \n        marine scientists have been awarded fellowships that have \n        enabled them to bring their scientific expertise to the Federal \n        agencies and the Congress while obtaining valuable policy \n        experience. Many of the fellows continue to serve as marine \n        policy professionals in the Federal Government, the private \n        sector, and the university research community.\n            (6) Currently no formal mechanism exists to secure \n        individuals with specific expertise in freshwater and \n        anadromous fisheries, wildlife, or conservation biology, or \n        related natural resource management, while simultaneously \n        providing valuable policy experience within the Federal \n        Government and the Congress. Such a mechanism would support and \n        enhance stewardship of the Nation's fish and wildlife.\n\nSEC. 3.
