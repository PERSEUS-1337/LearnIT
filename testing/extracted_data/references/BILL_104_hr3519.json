ATTAINMENT DATE DETERMINATIONS.\n\n    (a) Paragraph (5) Extensions.--Section 181(a)(5)(B) is amended to \nread as follows:\n            ``(B)(i) no more than one exceedance of the national \n        ambient air quality standard for ozone has occurred in the area \n        in the year preceding the Extension Year,\n            ``(ii) the design value of the area (based on data from the \n        year preceding the extension year) does not exceed the design \n        value for the current classification of the area as specified \n        in table 1 of paragraph (1), or\n            ``(iii) the Administrator determines that infrequent \n        episodic variations in air pollution levels caused by weather \n        impact an area's ability to demonstrate attainment.''.\n    (b) Additional Extension for Certain Areas.--Section 181(a) is \namended by adding the following at the end thereof:\n            ``(6) Attainment followed by violation.--Upon application \n        by any State, the Administrator may extend, for up to an \n        additional 3 years, the date specified in Table I of paragraph \n        (1) of this subsection and the dates specified in section \n        182(b) regarding reasonable further progress, if--\n                    ``(A) the area has in a 3-year period prior to the \n                attainment date, qualified for redesignation as \n                attainment for ozone, but\n                    ``(B) subsequent to such 3-year period, the area \n                has violated the ozone standard.\n        No more than one extension may be issued under this paragraph \n        for a single nonattainment area.''.\n\nSEC. 9. ATTAINMENT REDESIGNATIONS.\n\n    Section 107(d)(3) is amended as follows:\n            (1) By amending the second sentence of subparagraph (D) to \n        read as follows: ``The Administrator shall publish notice in \n        the Federal Register of the Administrator's receipt of a \n        request for redesignation. The Administrator shall also publish \n        notice in the Federal Register of the Administrator's proposed \n        approval or denial within 90 days after receipt of a complete \n        State redesignation submittal and approve or deny such \n        redesignation within 90 days thereafter.''.\n            (2) By adding the following at the end of subparagraph (E):\n``If a State requests the Administrator to redesignate an area as \nattainment and submits information to the Administrator regarding such \narea adequate to demonstrate compliance with clauses (ii) through (v) \nand compliance (for a period of 3 years prior to the submission) with \nclause (i) and if the Administrator fails to publish notice in the \nFederal Register of the Administrator's proposed approval or denial of \nsuch request within 90 days after receipt of a complete State \nredesignation request or fails to approve or deny such request within \n90 days thereafter, the area shall be deemed to be redesignated as an \nattainment area by operation of law on the date 180 days after the \nAdministrator's receipt of a complete State redesignation request.''.\n\nSEC. 10. CREDIT FOR EPISODIC CONTROLS.\n\n    Section 110(a) is amended by inserting the following new \nsubparagraph immediately after paragraph (3):\n    ``(4) In determining whether the provisions of any plan or plan \nrevision submitted under this Act are adequate to attain and maintain \nany national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard, the \nAdministrator shall provide appropriate credits for plan provisions \nwhich are designed to control air pollution only during certain periods \nwhen levels of one or more air pollutants are, or are likely to be, at \nhigher levels than at other periods.''.\n\nSEC. 11. OPT-IN REFORMULATED GAS AREAS.\n\n    Section 211(k)(6)(A) of the Clean Air Act is amended as follows:\n            (1) By inserting the following after the second sentence: \n        ``No area included in the coverage of the prohibition set forth \n        in paragraph (5) pursuant to an application under this \n        paragraph may continue to be included in such prohibition after \n        December 31, 1999, unless the Governor of the State in which \n        such area is located has notified the Administrator of such \n        continued inclusion prior to December 31, 1997, and the \n        Administrator has published such notice in the Federal \n        Register.''.\n            (2) By adding the following at the end thereof: ``An area \n        that has been included in the coverage of the prohibition set \n        forth in paragraph (5) pursuant to an application under this \n        paragraph may subsequently be excluded from such coverage \n        pursuant to an application by the Governor to the \n        Administrator, but such exclusion shall not take effect for a \n        period of 1-year after the application is approved (in the case \n        of Phase I Reformulated Gas Regulations) or 8-years after the \n        date on which the area was first included in the coverage of \n        such prohibition (in the case of Phase II Reformulated Gas \n        Regulations). After an area is excluded from coverage pursuant \n        to the preceding sentence, any subsequent inclusion (or \n        subsequent exclusion) of the area from such coverage shall not \n        take effect for a period of 1-year after the Governor's \n        application is approved.

In establishing such level the Administrator \n        shall not take into account infrequent episodic variations in \n        air pollution levels that are caused by weather. The revised \n        national primary ambient air quality standards promulgated \n        under subsection (a)(3) shall be as close to such national \n        primary ambient air quality goals as feasible such that the \n        incremental costs of attaining such standard do not exceed the \n        incremental benefits of attaining the standard.''.\n\nSEC. 14. TRANSPORTATION CONFORMITY.\n\n    Section 176 is amended to read as follows:\n\n``SEC. 176. TRANSPORTATION CONFORMITY.\n\n    ``Beginning on November 15, 1996, and at 4-year intervals \nthereafter, each State shall submit a revised inventory and performance \nplan for review by the Administrator. Such plan shall include a \ncertification by the State that the plan has been developed so as to \nmeet air quality goals. The applicability of a State approved \nimplementation plan shall become effective for the purposes of this \nsection upon signature of the Governor and shall continue unless \ndisapproved by the Administrator within 30 days. The form and content \nof the inventory and performance plan shall solely be within the \npurview of each State and the Administrator shall not disapprove such \nplan unless the Administrator determines that a State has developed an \ninventory and plan without adhering to such State's own processes and \nprocedures. If not disapproved within 30 days, such inventories and \nplans shall be considered approved. Nothing in this section shall \nrequire the submission of an inventory or plan more than once every 4 \nyears.''.\n\nSEC. 15. OVERWHELMING TRANSPORT.\n\n    Section 181 is amended by adding the following at the end thereof:\n    ``(d) Overwhelming Transport.--If, based on photochemical grid \nmodeling demonstrations or any other analytical method determined by \nthe Administrator to be as effective, the Administrator determines that \nthe area is a downwind nonattainment area receiving ozone or ozone \nprecursor transport from outside the area and control of ozone \nconcentrations is beyond the ability of the area to control because \nvolatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen from sources within \nsuch area do not make a significant contribution to ozone \nconcentrations in such area (or in any other ozone nonattainment area), \nthe Administrator may redesignate the area as attainment or as having a \nlower classification.''.\n\nSEC. 16. AUTOMOBILE INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE.\n\n    Section 182(c)(3)(C)(iv) is amended by inserting ``safety \ninspection approval or'' after ``denial of''.\n\nSEC. 17.
