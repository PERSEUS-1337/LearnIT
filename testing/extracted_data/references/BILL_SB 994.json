The facts constituting the necessity are:\nIn order for the Beach Cities Health District and the Peninsula Health Care District to facilitate construction of facilities or other buildings in those districts at the earliest possible time pursuant to design-build authority, and to ensure the expedient provision of health care services in those districts at the earliest possible time, it is necessary that this act take immediate effect.\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a)The overuse and misuse of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant infections, a major public health threat.\n(b)The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that at least 2,000,000 Americans are infected with, and at least 23,000 Americans die as a result of, antibiotic-resistant infections every year, resulting in at least $20 billion in direct health care costs and at least $35 billion in lost productivity in the United States.\n(c)Antibiotic resistance is a growing threat. A recent study commissioned by the United Kingdom determined that by 2050, worldwide, more people will die from antibiotic-resistant infections than from cancer.\n(d)The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human medicine is a significant factor driving the development of antibiotic resistance, and a majority of antibiotics are prescribed in outpatient settings, including primary care physician offices, outpatient settings where physician assistants and nurse practitioners work, dentist offices, and other specialty health care providers.\n(e)According to the CDC, in one year, 262.5 million courses of antibiotics are written in outpatient settings. This equates to more than five prescriptions written each year for every six people in the United States. The CDC estimates that over one-half of the antibiotics prescribed in outpatient settings are unnecessary.\n(f)More than 10 million courses of antibiotics are prescribed each year for viral conditions that do not benefit from antibiotics.\n(g)Antibiotic stewardship programs, which are already required in general acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities in the state, but not in outpatient settings, are an effective way to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant infections.\n(h)The President\u2019s National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria calls for the establishment of antibiotic stewardship activities in all health care delivery settings, including outpatient settings, by 2020.\nSEC. 2.\nThe heading of Article 2.6 (commencing with Section 1645) of Chapter 4 of Division 2 of the\nBusiness and Professions Code\nis amended to read:\n2.6.\nContinuing Education and Antimicrobial Stewardship\nSEC. 3.\nSection 1645.5 is added to the\nBusiness and Professions Code\n, to read:\n1645.5.\n(a)For purposes of this section the following definitions apply:\n(1)\u201cAntimicrobial stewardship policy\u201d means efforts to promote the appropriate prescribing of antimicrobials for patients, with the goal of reducing antimicrobial overuse and misuse and minimizing the development of antimicrobial resistant infections, that is consistent with one of the following parameters:\n(A)Antimicrobial stewardship guidelines published by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, or similar recognized professional organizations.\n(B)Evidence-based methods. To the extent practicable, antimicrobial stewardship policies based on proven, evidence-based methods should include more than one intervention or component.\n(2)A \u201ccovered licensee\u201d means a dentist who practices dentistry in a setting other than a clinic licensed pursuant to Section 1204 of the Health and Safety Code, a general acute care hospital as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 1250 of the Health and Safety Code, or a skilled nursing facility as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 1250 of the Health and Safety Code.\n(3)\u201cEvidence-based methods\u201d means antimicrobial prescribing intervention methods that have been proven effective through outcome evaluations or studies, including, but not limited to, audit and feedback, academic detailing, clinical decision support, delayed prescribing practices, poster-based interventions, accountable justification, and peer comparison.\n(b)A covered licensee shall adopt and implement an antimicrobial stewardship policy before applying for a renewal license.\n(c)Upon filing an application with the board for a renewal license, a covered licensee shall certify in writing, on a form prescribed by the board, that he or she has both adopted an antimicrobial stewardship policy pursuant to subdivision (b) and is in compliance with that policy.\n(d)(1)The board shall audit during each year a random sample of covered licensees who have certified compliance pursuant to subdivision (c). The board shall not audit an individual covered licensee more than once every four years.\n(2)A covered licensee who is selected for audit shall submit to the board, on a form prescribed by the board, a copy of his or her antimicrobial stewardship policy.\n(e)If the board determines that an audited covered licensee has failed to comply with subdivision (b), the board shall require that covered licensee to comply with subdivision (b) during the following renewal period.
