FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 1993, the Congress amended and renamed the National \n        Cooperative Research Act of 1984 (now known as the National \n        Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993 (15 U.S.C. 4301 \n        et seq.)) by enacting the National Cooperative Production \n        Amendments of 1993 (Public Law 103-42) to encourage the use of \n        collaborative, procompetitive activity in the form of research \n        and production joint ventures that provide adequate disclosure \n        to the antitrust enforcement agencies about the nature and \n        scope of the activity involved.\n            (2) Subsequently, in 1995, the Congress in enacting the \n        National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 \n        U.S.C. 272 note) recognized the importance of technical \n        standards developed by voluntary consensus standards bodies to \n        our national economy by requiring the use of such standards to \n        the extent practicable by Federal agencies and by encouraging \n        Federal agency representatives to participate in ongoing \n        standards development activities. The Office of Management and \n        Budget on February 18, 1998, revised Circular A-119 to reflect \n        these changes made in law.\n            (3) Following enactment of the National Technology Transfer \n        and Advancement Act of 1995, technical standards developed or \n        adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies have replaced \n        thousands of unique Government standards and specifications \n        allowing the national economy to operate in a more unified \n        fashion.\n            (4) Having the same technical standards used by Federal \n        agencies and by the private sector permits the Government to \n        avoid the cost of developing duplicative Government standards \n        and to more readily use products and components designed for \n        the commercial marketplace, thereby enhancing quality and \n        safety and reducing costs.\n            (5) Technical standards are written by hundreds of \n        nonprofit voluntary consensus standards bodies in a \n        nonexclusionary fashion, using thousands of volunteers from the \n        private and public sectors, and are developed under the \n        standards development principles set out in Circular Number A-\n        119, as revised February 18, 1998, of the Office of Management \n        and Budget, including principles that require openness, \n        balance, transparency, consensus, and due process. Such \n        principles provide for--\n                    (A) notice to all parties known to be affected by \n                the particular standards development activity,\n                    (B) the opportunity to participate in standards \n                development or modification,\n                    (C) balancing interests so that standards \n                development activities are not dominated by any single \n                group of interested persons,\n                    (D) readily available access to essential \n                information regarding proposed and final standards,\n                    (E) the requirement that substantial agreement be \n                reached on all material points after the consideration \n                of all views and objections, and\n                    (F) the right to express a position, to have it \n                considered, and to appeal an adverse decision.\n            (6) There are tens of thousands of voluntary consensus \n        standards available for government use. Most of these standards \n        are kept current through interim amendments and \n        interpretations, issuance of addenda, and periodic \n        reaffirmation, revision, or reissuance every 3 to 5 years.\n            (7) Standards developed by government entities generally \n        are not subject to challenge under the antitrust laws.\n            (8) Private developers of the technical standards that are \n        used as Government standards are often not similarly protected, \n        leaving such developers vulnerable to being named as \n        codefendants in lawsuits even though the likelihood of their \n        being held liable is remote in most cases, and they generally \n        have limited resources to defend themselves in such lawsuits.\n            (9) Standards development organizations do not stand to \n        benefit from any antitrust violations that might occur in the \n        voluntary consensus standards development process.\n            (10) As was the case with respect to research and \n        production joint ventures before the passage of the National \n        Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993, if relief from \n        the threat of liability under the antitrust laws is not granted \n        to voluntary consensus standards bodies, both regarding the \n        development of new standards and efforts to keep existing \n        standards current, such bodies could be forced to cut back on \n        standards development activities at great financial cost both \n        to the Government and to the national economy.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Section 2 of the National Cooperative Research and Production Act \nof 1993 (15 U.S.C. 4301) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(7) The term `standards development activity' means any \n        action taken by a standards development organization for the \n        purpose of developing, promulgating, revising, amending, \n        reissuing, interpreting, or otherwise maintaining a voluntary \n        consensus standard, or using such standard in conformity \n        assessment activities.\n            ``(8) The term `standards development organization' has the \n        same meaning as the terms `voluntary consensus standards body' \n        and `voluntary, private sector consensus standards body' as \n        such term are used in section 12(d) of the National Technology \n        Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 and in Circular Number A-\n        119, as revised February 10, 1998, of the Office of Management \n        and Budget.\n            ``(9) The term `technical standard' has the meaning given \n        such term in section 12(d)(4) of the National Technology \n        Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995.\n            ``(10) The term `voluntary consensus standard' has the \n        meaning given such term in Circular Number A-119, as revised \n        February 10, 1998, of the Office of Management and Budget.''; \n        and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(c) The term `standards development activity' excludes the \nfollowing activities:\n            ``(1) Exchanging information among competitors relating to \n        cost, sales, profitability, prices, marketing, or distribution \n        of any product, process, or service that is not reasonably \n        required for the purpose of developing or promulgating a \n        voluntary consensus standard, or using such standard in \n        conformity assessment activities.\n            ``(2) Entering into any agreement or engaging in any other \n        conduct that would allocate a market with a competitor.\n            ``(3) Entering into any agreement or conspiracy that would \n        set or restrain prices of any good or service.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
