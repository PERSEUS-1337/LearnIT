DECLARATIONS OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Right To Support.--The Congress hereby declares that every \nunemancipated child has a natural, moral, social, and Federal right to \nbe supported by such child's parent or parents and that such right \ntranscends the status of debt.\n    (b) Effect of Exercise of Right To Travel.--The Congress further \ndeclares that while sound national policy requires that migration \nthroughout the United States be unrestricted, experience has disclosed \nthat in the exercise of the right of migration and travel many \nindividuals leave behind them dependent and neglected children; and \nthat although the courts of the State in which such children reside may \nhave properly ordered an individual to meet his or her natural, moral, \nsocial, and Federal obligation to such children, once such individual \nhas traveled to another State such individual has a practical sanctuary \nagainst jurisdiction of the original State of residence.\n    (c) Instances of Departure Preceding Court Jurisdiction.--The \nCongress further declares that in other instances the departure \npreceded acquisition of jurisdiction over the individual by courts of \nthe original State with like result.\n    (d) Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 Were Significant \nSteps.--In enacting the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 \nthe Congress took significant steps to assist children in obtaining \nneeded financial support from their parents regardless of their \ncircumstances, but many of the evils outlined above remain.\n    (e) Policy.--It is the policy of Congress in this Act to correct \nthese evils--\n            (1) by requiring that orders of State courts directing \n        individuals to meet their natural, moral, social, and Federal \n        obligations to such children shall be enforced in the State \n        courts in areas to which such individuals have migrated from \n        the original jurisdiction within the United States; and\n            (2) by giving State courts, in States to which such \n        individuals have migrated, original jurisdiction in suits \n        brought by citizens of other States to order such migrants to \n        meet such obligations, to the end that such children will not \n        suffer want or be made the objects of public welfare and thus \n        become an unnecessary burden to the general public and be \n        themselves thereby humiliated.\n\nSEC. 3.
