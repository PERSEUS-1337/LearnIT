    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) Research shows that children who eat breakfast have improved cognitive function, demonstrate higher academic achievement, exhibit better behavior, and have healthier diets, as compared to children who do not eat breakfast.\n(b) Research also shows that breakfasts served at school are generally more nutritious than breakfasts served at home.\n(c) Each\nschool day,\nschoolday,\n2.2 million of the state\u2019s low-income pupils miss out on the health and academic benefits of school breakfasts and, in total, 4.3 million of California\u2019s public school pupils miss out on school\nbreakfast\nbreakfasts\neach schoolday.\n(d) Serving breakfast after the start of the schoolday has been shown to significantly improve school breakfast participation, yield fiscal benefits, and improve the learning environment for all pupils by decreasing absenteeism, tardiness, reports of hunger-related illness, and disciplinary issues.\n(e) The federal School Breakfast Program enables school districts to draw on federal funds designated to serve low-income pupils. If the federal School Breakfast Program reached as many low-income pupils as the federal National School Lunch Program, California\u2019s public schools would receive an additional $344 million in federal meal reimbursements, providing essential resources to the state\u2019s most vulnerable children.\n(f) Fiscal research shows that increasing participation in the federal School Breakfast Program immediately and positively impacts the California economy by distributing federal funds to school districts, increasing local employment, and increasing purchases of food and equipment.\n(g) Given the academic, health, and fiscal benefits of school breakfasts, high-need schools serving low-income pupils should make breakfast readily available and accessible during the schoolday.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 49550 of the Education Code is amended to read:\n49550.\nNotwithstanding any other law:\n(a) A school district or county office of education maintaining any kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, shall provide for each pupil who is a needy child as defined in Section 49552 one nutritionally adequate free or reduced-price meal during each schoolday, except for family day care homes that shall be reimbursed for 75 percent of the meals served.\n(b) In order to comply with subdivision (a), a school district or county office of education may use funds that are available through any federal or state program the purpose of which includes the provision of meals to a pupil, including, but not necessarily limited to, the federal School Breakfast Program, the federal National School Lunch Program, the federal Summer Food Service Program, the federal Seamless Summer Option, or the state meal program, or may do so at the expense of the school district or county office of education.\n(c) Each school district or county office of education maintaining any kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, shall provide breakfast for its pupils in accordance with the following:\n(1) From July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017, inclusive, if at least 40 percent of the pupils enrolled in a school are needy children as defined in Section 49552, a nutritionally adequate breakfast shall be made available to pupils each schoolday.
