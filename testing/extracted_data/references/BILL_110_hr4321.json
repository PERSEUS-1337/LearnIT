SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Enhancing Safety in Medicine \nUtilizing Leading Advanced Simulation Technologies to Improve Outcomes \nNow Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Simulation-based education and training in medicine, \n        nursing, allied health, podiatry, osteopathy, dentistry, and \n        emergency response teams can enhance procedural skills and \n        reinforce best practices by allowing students, experienced \n        clinicians, and health care professionals to practice \n        procedures in a realistic setting.\n            (2) The enhanced clinical skill development provided by \n        simulation-based training benefits patients and health care \n        consumers in the form of improved health outcomes, patient \n        safety, and quality; reduced medical errors and deaths; and \n        reduced costs associated with providing patient care.\n            (3) Many educational institutions and health care \n        providers, particularly those in urban and rural settings, have \n        difficulty acquiring medical simulation technology. Financial \n        assistance in the form of Federal grants would significantly \n        enhance the ability of these entities to deploy medical \n        simulation technology and incorporate such technology into \n        training protocols.\n            (4) The creation of medical simulation centers of \n        excellence to provide guidance and leadership to educational \n        institutions and health care entities will facilitate the \n        deployment of medical simulation technologies and the \n        commercialization of cutting-edge medical simulation research.\n            (5) A Federal medical simulation coordinating council would \n        promote better communication and collaboration between the \n        Federal entities with experience or interest in simulation-\n        based education and medical simulation technology deployment.\n\nSEC. 3.
