    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that:\n            (1) By Interstate Compact (Chapter 170 of the Laws of 1937 \n        of the State of New York; Chapter 148 of the Laws of 1937 of \n        the State of New Jersey) and by Resolution of the 75th Congress \n        (H.J. Resolution 445), the Palisades Interstate Park Commission \n        was formed in 1937.\n            (2) The Palisades Interstate Park Commission is the only \n        interstate park management agency in the United States and is \n        responsible for the management of 23 parks and historic sites \n        in New York and New Jersey, consisting of 82,000 acres. More \n        than 8,000,000 national and international visitors per year \n        seek outdoor recreational opportunities in the Palisades Park \n        System. The management of these sites is consistent with \n        standards maintained by the National Park Service.\n            (3) Sterling Forest is a biologically diverse 17,500 acre \n        corporate-owned open space property on the New York/New Jersey \n        border. The property is a highly significant watershed area for \n        northern New Jersey, and an important outdoor recreational \n        asset in the Northeastern United States. Clean drinking water \n        flows from the property into a reservoir system which serves 25 \n        percent of the population of the State of New Jersey. Twenty-\n        seven rare and endangered wildlife species have been identified \n        at Sterling Forest by The Nature Conservancy. The land supports \n        a mixed hardwood forest, wetlands, lakes, glaciated valleys and \n        ridge lines, and is strategically located on a north-south \n        wildlife migratory route.\n            (4) The Appalachian Trail, administered by the National \n        Park Service, passes through Sterling Forest. Sterling Forest \n        shares a common boundary with the 51,680 acre Harriman/Bear \n        Mountain State Parks in which the first segment of the \n        Appalachian Trail was constructed in 1923. If protected, \n        Sterling Forest would greatly enhance the Appalachian Trail and \n        would become the largest park created in the Northeastern \n        United States since World War II.\n            (5) Sterling Forest is located in the most densely \n        populated metropolitan region in the United States, and is a \n        very critical open space buffer for a large urban population. A \n        14 percent growth rate is projected for the region in the next \n        20 years.\n            (6) Lands held and managed by the Palisades Interstate Park \n        Commission in the State of New York traditionally remain on the \n        tax rolls. Taxes are paid by the State.\n            (7) Stewardship and management costs for lands in the \n        Palisades Park System traditionally are paid by the States of \n        New York and New Jersey.\n            (8) The Palisades Interstate Park Commission is committed \n        to a willing seller--willing buyer transaction with the \n        corporate owners of Sterling Forest. Use of eminent domain \n        authority is not anticipated, nor would it be acceptable to the \n        Palisades Interstate Park Commission.\n            (9) In establishing the Federal Agencies Program for the \n        Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Congress specified the \n        need to address the increasing demand for the creation of \n        recreation areas of national significance easily accessible to \n        large centers of the population, and to provide a partial basis \n        for financing the extension of Federal recreational facilities \n        in the East and Midwest.\n            (10) Given the nationally significant watershed, outdoor \n        recreational, and wildlife attributes of Sterling Forest, the \n        demand for park open space in the Northeastern United States, \n        the lack of open space in the densely populated New York-New \n        Jersey-Connecticut Tri-State Region, and the presence of a \n        willing seller and a federally chartered interstate park \n        management agency, there is clear Federal interest in acquiring \n        land in Sterling Forest for permanent protection of watershed, \n        recreational, and wild flora and fauna open space.\n\nSEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION.\n\n    (a) Funding.--In order to enhance protection of watershed, outdoor \nrecreational, wildlife habitat, and Appalachian Trail values in the \nSterling Forest area of the New York/New Jersey Highlands Region, there \nis hereby authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of the \nInterior for transfer to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission \n(hereinafter in this Act referred to as the ``Commission'') for fiscal \nyear 1995 not more than $35,000,000 to be used by the Commission for \npurposes of acquiring an undeveloped, open space tract of land \npresently owned by the Sterling Forest Corporation. Such sums shall \nremain available for expenditure through fiscal year 1999.\n    (b) Property Taxes.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to \nauthorize the United States Government, or relieve the Commission and \nthe State of New York of any obligation otherwise imposed under New \nYork State law, to pay property taxes or provide for the costs of \nstewardship and management of any lands located in the State of New \nYork which may be acquired through this authorization.\n    (c) Management.--The Commission shall hold and manage all property \nacquired with funds made available under this Act for the purposes \nreferred to in subsection (a)."
