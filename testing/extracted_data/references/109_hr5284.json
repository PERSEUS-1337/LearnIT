FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The number of couples reporting infertility has \n        increased from 6.1 million in 2002 to more than 7.5 million \n        currently.\n            (2) Studies reveal that 80 to 90 percent of infertility is \n        acquired and could be prevented.\n            (3) Sexually transmitted diseases (``STDs'') are the most \n        preventable causes of infertility and potentially fatal tubal \n        pregnancies.\n            (4) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        estimates that 19 million new STD infections occur each year, \n        with almost half of them among young people ages 15 to 24 and \n        with an increased incidence in minority populations.\n            (5) New data reveals that environmental toxins, including \n        lead and mercury, as well as tobacco and alcohol, are a direct \n        threat to reproductive health.\n            (6) The Nation's expanding aging population requires that \n        health care providers and government agencies be prepared to \n        address the fertility complications of aging.\n            (7) In 10 percent of infertility cases, the causes cannot \n        be explained.\n            (8) Public awareness of the causes of infertility can \n        reduce its incidence.\n            (9) Many medical schools lack the resources to adequately \n        train students in the causes, treatment, and patient counseling \n        needed to reduce the incidence of infertility.\n\nSEC. 2.
