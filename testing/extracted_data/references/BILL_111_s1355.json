MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLAN PAYMENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1857(e) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1395w-27(e)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(4) Minimum payment rate for services furnished by a \n        rural health clinic.--A contract under this section between a \n        Medicare Advantage organization and the Secretary for the \n        offering of a Medicare Advantage plan shall require the \n        organization to provide for a payment rate under the plan for \n        rural health clinic services furnished to enrollees of the plan \n        (whether or nor the services are furnished pursuant to an \n        agreement between the organization and a rural health clinic) \n        that is not less than--\n                    ``(A) the applicable payment rate established under \n                part A or part B (which includes the payment of an \n                interim rate and a subsequent cost reconciliation) with \n                respect to the rural health clinic for such rural \n                health clinic services; or\n                    ``(B) if the rural health clinic determines \n                appropriate, 103 percent of the applicable interim \n                payment rate established under part A or part B with \n                respect to the rural health clinic for such rural \n                health clinic services.''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall \napply to Medicare Advantage contract years beginning on or after \nJanuary 1, 2010.\n\nSEC. 9. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ADEQUACY OF NETWORK-BASED HEALTH \n              PLANS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Senate that network-based health plans \nshall--\n            (1) be expected to provide a pool of health care \n        professionals that is adequate to meet the needs of enrollees \n        residing in rural and frontier areas;\n            (2) ensure that enrollees residing in rural and frontier \n        areas that have been designated by the Federal Government or a \n        State government as lacking an adequate number of health care \n        professionals are provided with reasonable access to an in-\n        network provider;\n            (3) make every effort to include as part of their provider \n        network any State-licensed or certified health care \n        professionals (particularly primary care and mental health \n        professionals) that are available in many underserved rural and \n        frontier areas; and\n            (4) recognize that reliance on a physician-only network, or \n        forcing enrollees to travel for more than 30 minutes to receive \n        primary care or mental health services from a network provider, \n        does not constitute an ``adequate'' network. The following \n        distances should be used as guidelines in determining distances \n        that correspond to a 30-minute travel time:\n                    (A) Under normal conditions with primary roads \n                available: 20 miles.\n                    (B) In mountainous terrain or in areas with only \n                secondary roads available: 15 miles.\n                    (C) In flat terrain or in areas connected by \n                interstate highways: 25 miles."
