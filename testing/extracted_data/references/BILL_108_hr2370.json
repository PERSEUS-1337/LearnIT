FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) According to the New England Journal of Medicine, after \n        September 11, 2001, Americans across the country, including \n        children, had substantial symptoms of stress. Even clinicians \n        who practice in regions that are far from the sites of the \n        attacks should be prepared to assist people with trauma-related \n        symptoms of stress.\n            (2) According to Military Medicine, experiences from the \n        1995 chemical weapons attack by terrorists in the Tokyo subway \n        system suggest that psychological casualties from a chemical \n        attack will outnumber physical casualties by approximately 4 to \n        1.\n            (3) According to Military Medicine, victims from the 1995 \n        Tokyo attack continued to suffer from psychological symptoms 5 \n        years later.\n            (4) According to the Journal of the American Medical \n        Association, the lessons learned from the 2001 anthrax attacks \n        should motivate local health departments, health care \n        organizations, and clinicians to engage in collaborative \n        programs to enhance their communications and local preparedness \n        and response capabilities.\n            (5) According to the Institute of Medicine of the National \n        Academy of Sciences, the Department of Health and Human \n        Services and the Department of Homeland Security should analyze \n        terrorism preparedness to ensure that the public health \n        infrastructure is prepared to respond to the psychological \n        consequences of terrorism, and Federal, State, and local \n        disaster planers should address these psychological \n        consequences in their planning and preparedness for terrorist \n        attacks.\n            (6) According to a national study by leading health care \n        foundations, in this time of growing threats of terrorism, many \n        doctors and other primary care providers are increasingly being \n        confronted with patients who complain of aches and pains, or \n        more serious symptoms, which mask serious anxiety or \n        depression.\n            (7) Substantial effort and funding are still needed to \n        adequately understand and prepare for the psychological \n        consequences associated with bioterrorism.\n            (8) The integration of mental health into public health \n        efforts, including integration and cooperation across Federal \n        agencies and State public health and mental health authorities, \n        is critical in addressing the psychological needs of the Nation \n        with regard to terrorism.\n\nSEC. 3. GOALS.\n\n    The goals of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To coordinate the efforts of different government \n        agencies in researching, developing, and implementing programs \n        and protocols designed to increase the psychological resilience \n        and mitigate distress reactions and maladaptive behaviors of \n        the American public as they relate to terrorism.\n            (2) To facilitate the work of the Department of Homeland \n        Security by incorporating programs and protocols designed to \n        increase the psychological resilience, and mitigate distress \n        reactions and maladaptive behaviors, of the American public \n        into the Department's efforts in reducing the vulnerability of \n        the United States to terrorism.\n            (3) To identify effective interventions to the harmful \n        psychosocial consequences of disasters and to integrate these \n        interventions into the United States' plans to mitigate, plan \n        for, respond to, and recover from potential and actual \n        terrorist attacks.\n            (4) To enable the States and localities to effectively \n        respond to the psychosocial consequences of terrorism.\n            (5) To integrate mental health and public health emergency \n        preparedness and response efforts in the United States.\n\n SEC. 4.
