FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) As of 2010, the statutory framework with respect to the \n        espionage statutes is a compilation of statutes that began with \n        Act of June 15, 1917 (40 Stat. 217, chapter 30) (commonly known \n        as the ``Espionage Act of 1917''), which targeted classic \n        espionage cases involving persons working on behalf of foreign \n        nations.\n            (2) The statutory framework was formed at a time when \n        intelligence and national security information existed \n        primarily in a tangible form, such as blueprints, photographs, \n        maps, and other documents.\n            (3) Since 1917, the United States has witnessed dramatic \n        changes in intelligence and national security information, \n        including technological advances that have revolutionized \n        information gathering abilities as well as the mediums used to \n        communicate such information.\n            (4) Some of the terms used in the espionage statutes are \n        obsolete and the statutes do not fully take into account the \n        classification levels that apply to national security \n        information in the 21st century.\n            (5) In addition, the statutory framework was originally \n        designed to address classic espionage cases involving persons \n        working on behalf of foreign nations. However, the national \n        security of the United States could be harmed, and lives may be \n        put at risk, when a Government officer, employee, contractor, \n        or consultant with access to classified information makes an \n        unauthorized disclosure of the classified information, \n        irrespective of whether the Government officer, employee, \n        contractor, or consultant intended to aid a foreign nation or \n        harm the United States.\n            (6) Federal whistleblower protection statutes and \n        regulations that enable Government officers, employees, \n        contractors, and consultants to report unlawful and improper \n        conduct are appropriate mechanisms for reporting such conduct.\n            (7) Congress can deter unauthorized disclosures of \n        classified information and thereby protect the national \n        security by--\n                    (A) enacting laws that improve, modernize, and \n                clarify the espionage statutes and make the espionage \n                statutes more relevant and effective in the 21st \n                century in the prosecution of persons working on behalf \n                of foreign powers;\n                    (B) promoting Federal whistleblower protection \n                statutes and regulations to enable Government officers, \n                employees, contractors, or consultants to report \n                unlawful and improper conduct; and\n                    (C) enacting laws that separately punish the \n                unauthorized disclosure of classified information by \n                Government officers, employees, contractors, or \n                consultants who knowingly and intentionally violate a \n                classified information nondisclosure agreement, \n                irrespective of whether the officers, employees, \n                contractors, or consultants intend to aid a foreign \n                power or harm the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
