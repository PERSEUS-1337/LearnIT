FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) sustaining a healthy and competitive national economy \n        is imperative to maintaining the security of the Nation;\n            (2) the development and production of proprietary economic \n        information is an integral part of virtually every aspect of \n        United States trade, commerce, and business;\n            (3) the development, production, protection, and lawful \n        exchange, sale, and transfer of proprietary economic \n        information is essential to maintaining the health and \n        competitiveness of critical segments of United States business \n        and industry, and hence to the national economy and the \n        national security;\n            (4) much proprietary economic information moves in \n        interstate and foreign commerce, and proprietary economic \n        information that does not move in interstate or foreign \n        commerce directly affects that which does;\n            (5) the theft, misappropriation, and wrongful receipt, \n        transfer, exchange, and use of stolen or misappropriated \n        proprietary economic information by foreign governments and \n        their agents or instrumentalities costs the United States \n        Government and United States firms, businesses, industries, and \n        consumers millions of dollars each year;\n            (6) the theft, misappropriation, and wrongful receipt, \n        transfer, and use of proprietary economic information belonging \n        to the United States Government and United States firms, \n        businesses, and industry by foreign governments and their \n        agents or instrumentalities directly and substantially \n        threatens the health and competitiveness of critical segments \n        of the United States economy and, consequently, the Nation's \n        security; and\n            (7) enforcement of existing State laws protecting \n        proprietary economic information is frustrated by the ease with \n        which stolen or wrongfully appropriated proprietary economic \n        information is transferred across State and national \n        boundaries.\n    (b) Purposes.--\n            (1) Primary purpose.--The primary purpose of this Act is to \n        protect the national security by preventing economic espionage \n        and furthering the development and lawful use of United States \n        proprietary economic information by protecting it from theft, \n        wrongful destruction or alteration, misappropriation, and \n        conversion by foreign governments and their agents or \n        instrumentalities. This Act is intended to protect the \n        proprietary economic information of the United States \n        Government and United States firms, businesses, industries, and \n        individuals both domestically and abroad by punishing \n        individuals, corporations, and institutions which engage in \n        economic espionage with the intent or purpose of aiding foreign \n        nations or governments and their instrumentalities.\n            (2) Secondary purpose.--The secondary purpose of this Act \n        is to affirm that proprietary economic information is included \n        in the term ``goods, wares, or merchandise'' as that term is \n        used in Federal laws relating to stolen property.\n\nSEC. 3.
