SAVINGS FROM STATE AUTHORIZED PUBLIC ENTITY BENEFITS \n              POOLS.\n\n    ``(a) Application.--\n            ``(1) In general.--A State authorized public entity health \n        benefits pool (in this section referred to as a `pool') may \n        apply to the Secretary for a pass through of funding described \n        in subsection (b) with respect to health care benefits provided \n        through that pool for coverage years beginning on or after \n        January 1, 2014.\n            ``(2) Approval of application.--The Secretary shall approve \n        such an application of a pool if the Secretary determines that \n        health care benefits provided through the pool--\n                    ``(A) will provide coverage that is at least as \n                comprehensive as the coverage defined in section \n                1302(b);\n                    ``(B) will provide coverage and cost sharing \n                protections against excessive out-of-pocket spending \n                that are at least as affordable as the provisions of \n                this title would provide; and\n                    ``(C) will result in cost savings to the Federal \n                Government because the cost of providing health care \n                benefits to individuals through the pool will be less \n                than the cost of providing health care benefits to such \n                individuals had they become participants in a qualified \n                health plan offered through an Exchange, and so the \n                payment amount under subsection (b) will be less than \n                the total of premium tax credits, cost-sharing \n                reductions, or small business credits that would \n                otherwise be required if individuals and small \n                employers in the pool were instead participants in an \n                Exchange.\n            ``(3) Consideration.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n        of the enactment of this section, the Secretary shall \n        promulgate regulations relating to pass through of funding \n        under this section.
