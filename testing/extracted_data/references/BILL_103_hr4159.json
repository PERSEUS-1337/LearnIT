PUBLIC HOUSING CEILING RENTS.\n\n    Section 3(a)(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. \n1437a(a)(2)) is amended--\n            (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking clause (iii) and \n        inserting the following new clause:\n            ``(iii) at the election of such agency and subject to \n        approval by the Secretary, is--\n                    ``(I) not less than the average monthly amount of \n                debt service and operating expenses attributable to \n                dwelling units of similar size in public housing \n                projects owned and operated by such agency;\n                    ``(II) not less than the rental paid by a family \n                the amount of whose rent is such that, on the date upon \n                which a public housing agency adopts ceiling rents \n                under this subclause for the project in which such \n                family resides, not less than 10 percent nor more than \n                20 percent (as determined by the Secretary from time to \n                time by regulation) of the families residing in such \n                project pay a higher rent; any ceiling rents so adopted \n                and approved by the Secretary shall be redetermined \n                annually by application of the automatic annual \n                adjustment factors issued from time to time by the \n                Secretary pursuant to section 8(c)(2)(A); or\n                    ``(III) not less than the fair market rent \n                determined by the agency for comparable units of \n                similar size pursuant to the procedures prescribed by \n                the Secretary for determining rent reasonableness under \n                the program for rental certificate assistance under \n                section 8(b); the Secretary may, not more frequently \n                than annually, review the ceiling rents determined \n                under this subclause by each agency and each agency's \n                application of the procedures for determining rent \n                reasonableness used in establishing such rents and if, \n                pursuant to such review, the Secretary determines on \n                the record after opportunity for an agency hearing, \n                that the ceiling rents adopted by an agency pursuant to \n                this subclause are deliberately and materially \n                understated, the Secretary may impose such corrective \n                actions as the Secretary considers appropriate, which \n                may include payment to the Secretary of some or all of \n                the aggregate amounts by which such rents are \n                understated; the Secretary may at any time require that \n                the determination of ceiling rents pursuant to this \n                subclause be conducted by a qualified independent third \n                party in accordance with regulations issued by the \n                Secretary.''; and\n            (2) by redesignating subparagraph (B) as subparagraph (I) \n        and inserting after subparagraph (A) the following new \n        subparagraphs:\n    ``(B) A waiver by the Secretary shall not be necessary for a public \nhousing agency to adopt ceiling rents under this paragraph. The \ndiscretion of the Secretary in approving an election by a public \nhousing agency to adopt ceiling rents shall be limited to ensuring that \nthe election meets the requirements of this paragraph. Without limiting \nany other provision of this subparagraph, the Secretary shall not \n(except as otherwise specifically provided in subparagraph (C)) hold or \nexercise any discretion with respect to the method under subparagraph \n(A)(iii) that an agency may elect to determine its ceiling rents, and \nsuch election shall be within the sole discretion of the agency.\n    ``(C) Unless otherwise approved by the Secretary, a public housing \nagency shall utilize the same method for determining ceiling rents for \nall projects with respect to which such agency elects to adopt ceiling \nrents; except that, with respect to single family scattered site \nhousing or projects consisting of 10 or less units, a public housing \nagency may elect, or the Secretary may require, that ceiling rents \napplicable to such units be calculated using the method under \nsubparagraph (A)(iii)(III), notwithstanding that ceiling rents \napplicable to the agency's other projects are calculated using another \nmethod. After the initial adoption of ceiling rents by a public housing \nagency and approval thereof by the Secretary, the agency may not \nthereafter elect a different method of calculating such rents except as \napproved by the Secretary.\n    ``(D) Subject to the limitations under subparagraph (C), different \nceiling rents may be adopted by a public housing agency and approved by \nthe Secretary for each project owned by the public housing agency. A \npublic housing agency may adopt and the Secretary may approve maximum \nrents for some or all of the projects owned by such agency.\n    ``(E) Any ceiling rents adopted shall be redetermined annually, for \neach project for which such rents are adopted, by the public housing \nagency and, subject to subsequent readjustment if the Secretary \ndetermines after review that such rents are improper, such redetermined \nceiling rents shall be effective without further approval by the \nSecretary.\n    ``(F) Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph--\n            ``(i) not more than 25 percent of the total number of \n        dwelling units contained in any project (rounded upward to the \n        nearest whole unit) may be occupied by families whose rents are \n        limited in amount by the ceiling rents adopted for such \n        project; if, at any time, families occupying more than 25 \n        percent of the units in a project are eligible for ceiling \n        rents, then, at the time of the next annual redetermination of \n        ceiling rents for such project, the public housing agency shall \n        increase the applicable ceiling rents so that, at the time of \n        such redetermination, not more than 25 percent of the dwelling \n        units in the project are occupied by families whose rent is \n        limited by ceiling rents; and\n            ``(ii) the total continuous period during which any \n        family's rent may be limited by the full application of ceiling \n        rents shall not exceed 3 years; if at any time commencing \n        before the expiration of the 3-year period, the rent payable by \n        a family is less than the applicable ceiling rent for a period \n        in excess of 12 consecutive months, because of a reduction in \n        the family's adjusted income or an increase in ceiling rents, \n        or both, then a new 3-year period shall commence when such \n        family's rent again would exceed the applicable ceiling rents; \n        after the expiration of any 3-year continuous period during \n        which ceiling rents are fully applied to limit a family's rent, \n        the reduction in such family's rent that would otherwise result \n        from full application of the ceiling rents shall be \n        successively decreased so that (I) during the 4th year, the \n        family shall receive 85 percent of the reduction that would \n        result if the ceiling rents were fully applied; (II) during the \n        5th year, the family shall receive 65 percent of such \n        reduction; (III) during the 6th year, the family shall receive \n        40 percent of such reduction; and (IV) during the 7th and \n        subsequent years the family shall not receive any reduction in \n        rent as a result of the adoption of ceiling rents; the \n        commencement of a family's initial 3-year eligibility or \n        subsequent 3-year reeligibility for full ceiling rent \n        limitations and the commencement of each reduction in the full \n        application of ceiling rents as provided in this clause shall, \n        in the case of each family, occur not later than the effective \n        date of such family's annual redetermination of rent and family \n        composition in accordance with its public housing lease.\n    ``(G) Ceiling rents authorized under this paragraph shall not be \napplicable to any project which is designated as housing for elderly \npersons.\n    ``(H) For purposes of this paragraph--\n            ``(i) the term `ceiling rent' means the maximum amount of \n        rent, adopted by a public housing agency and approved by the \n        Secretary pursuant to this subparagraph, that may be charged to \n        a family; and\n            ``(ii) the term `project' means a building or group of \n        buildings containing public housing units and having a common \n        identity and management, as determined by the public housing \n        agency; a project need not contain buildings or sets of \n        buildings having the same project number assigned by the \n        Secretary or all of the buildings or sets of buildings having \n        the same such number.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
