CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORIZATION OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT \n              CONTROL OVER MOVEMENT OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE AND \n              RECYCLABLE MATERIALS.\n\n    Subtitle D of the Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended by adding \nafter section 4010 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 4011. CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORIZATION OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT \n              CONTROL OVER MOVEMENT OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE AND \n              RECYCLABLE MATERIALS.\n\n    ``(a) Authority.--Each State and each political subdivision thereof \nis authorized to exercise flow control authority for municipal solid \nwaste, and recyclable materials voluntarily relinquished by the owner \nor generator of such materials, generated within its jurisdiction \ndirecting such municipal solid waste or recyclable materials to one or \nmore waste management facilities or facilities for recyclable \nmaterials, if such flow control authority--\n            ``(1) is imposed pursuant to a law, ordinance, regulation, \n        or other legally binding provision or official act of the State \n        or political subdivision in effect on May 15, 1994; and\n            ``(2) has been implemented by designating before May 15, \n        1994, the particular waste management facilities in operation \n        as of May 15, 1994, to which the municipal solid waste or \n        recyclable materials must be delivered.\nThe authority of this section shall only extend to the specific \nclasses, categories, volumes or sources of municipal solid waste to \nwhich flow control authority requiring a movement to one or more waste \nmanagement facilities was actually applied on May 15, 1994 (or, in the \ncase of a State or political subdivision that qualifies under \nsubsection (b), to the specific classes or categories of municipal \nsolid waste for which the State or political subdivision prior to May \n15, 1994, had committed to the designation of one or more waste \nmanagement facilities). With regard to facilities granted flow control \nauthority pursuant to subsection ``b'', if the specific classes or \ncategories of municipal solid waste are not clearly identified, the \nauthority of this section shall apply only to municipal solid waste \ngenerated by households. With respect to each designated facility, the \nauthority of subsections (a) and (b) shall be effective for the \nremaining life of a contract between the State or political subdivision \nand any other person for the movement or delivery of such waste or \nrecyclable materials (as in effect May 15, 1994), or until completion \nof the original schedule for payment of the capital costs of the \nfacility concerned (as in effect May 15, 1994). With respect to any \nfacility to which a local government was directing waste as of May 15, \n1994, pursuant to a law or ordinance of the State or political \nsubdivision in effect on May 15, 1994, the authority of this section \nshall be effective for the remaining life of a contract between the \nState or political subdivision and any other person for the movement or \ndelivery of such waste or recyclable materials (as in effect May 15, \n1994) or until completion of the original schedule for payment of the \ncapital costs of the facility concerned (as in effect May 15, 1994).\n    ``(b) Commitment to Construction.--Notwithstanding the restrictions \nin subsection (a) (1) and (2), any political subdivision of a State may \nbe granted the flow control authority in subsection (a), if--\n            ``(1) the law, ordinance, regulation, or other legally \n        binding provision specifically provides for flow control \n        authority for municipal solid waste generated within its \n        boundaries and was in effect as of May 15, 1994; and\n            ``(2) such political subdivision has taken action prior to \n        May 15, 1994, to commit to the designation of one or more waste \n        management facilities for such method of transportation or \n        disposal of municipal solid waste selected under such law, \n        ordinance, regulation, plan, or legally binding provision. Such \n        a commitment to the designation of one or more waste management \nfacilities is demonstrated by one or more of the following factors:\n                    ``(A) All required permits for the construction of \n                such facility were trained prior to May 15, 1994.\n                    ``(B) Contracts for the construction of such \n                facility were ratified and executed in effect prior to \n                May 15, 1994.\n                    ``(C) Revenue bonds were presented for sale to \n                specifically provide revenue for the construction of \n                such facility prior to May 15, 1994.\n                    ``(D) The State or political subdivision submitted \n                to the appropriate regulatory agency or agencies, on or \n                before May 16, 1994, administratively complete permit \n                applications for the construction and operation of the \n                waste management facility.\n    ``(c) Retained Authority.--Upon the request of any generator of \nmunicipal solid waste affected by this section, the State or political \nsubdivision shall authorize the diversion of all or a portion of the \nsolid wastes generated by the generator making such request to a solid \nwaste facility, other than the facility or facilities originally \ndesignated by the political subdivision, where the purpose of such \nrequest is to provide a higher level of protection for human health and \nthe environment or to indemnify or reduce potential future liability \nunder Federal or State law of such generator for the management of such \nwastes, unless the state or political subdivision determines that the \nfacility to which the municipal solid waste is being diverted does not \nprovide a higher level of protection for human health and the \nenvironment or does not indemnify or reduce the potential future \nliability under Federal or State law of such generator for the \nmanagement of such wastes. Requests shall include information on the \nenvironmental suitability of the proposed alternative treatment or \ndisposal facility and method, compared to that of the designated \nfacility and method.\n    ``(d) Reasonable Regulation of Commerce.--A law, ordinance, \nregulation, or other legally binding provision or official act of a \nState or political subdivision, described in subsection (a) or (b), \nthat implements flow control authority in compliance with this section \nshall be considered to be a reasonable regulation of commerce and shall \nnot be considered to be an undue burden on or otherwise as impairing, \nrestraining, or discriminating against interstate commerce.\n    ``(e) Flow Control Study.--The Administrator, in cooperation with \nthe National Academy of Public Administration and the Secretary of the \nTreasury, shall conduct a study of the extent to which the decision of \nthe United States Supreme Court in C&A Carbone v Clarkstown, New York \nhas affected the ability of public and private agencies and entities to \nsecure or retain financing for solid waste management facilities or \nservices. Such study shall address whether such decision is likely to \ninterfere with the implementation of State solid waste management \nplans, and whether such decision is likely to affect recycling or \ncomposting. The Administrator shall submit a report on such study to \nthe Congress, together with recommendations for needed legislation, if \nany, not later than March 31, 1996.\n    ``(f) Effect on Existing Laws and Contracts.--\n            ``(1) Environmental laws.--Nothing in this section shall be \n        interpreted or construed to have any effect on any other law \n        relating to the protection of human health and the environment, \n        or the management of municipal solid waste or recyclable \n        materials.\n            ``(2) State law.--Nothing in this section shall be \n        interpreted to authorize a political subdivision to exercise \n        the flow control authority granted by this section in a manner \n        inconsistent with State law.\n            ``(3) Ownership of recyclable materials.--Nothing in \nthis section shall authorize any State or political subdivision to \nrequire any generator or owner of recyclable materials to transfer any \nrecyclable materials to such State or political subdivision, nor shall \nprohibit any generator or owner of recyclable materials from selling, \npurchasing, accepting, conveying, or transporting any recyclable \nmaterials for purposes of transformation or remanufacture into usable \nor marketable materials, unless the generator or owner voluntarily made \nsuch recyclable materials available to the State or political \nsubdivision and relinquished any rights to, or ownership of, such \nrecyclable materials.\n    ``(g) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section--\n            ``(1) Municipal solid waste.--The term `municipal solid \n        waste' means, subject to the limitations of subsection (a), any \n        solid waste generated by the general public or by households \n        (including single residences and multifamily residences of up \n        to 4 units) and from commercial, institutional, and industrial \n        sources, consisting of paper, wood, yard waste, plastics, \n        leather, rubber, and other combustible materials and \n        noncombustible materials such as metal and glass, including \n        residue remaining after recyclable materials have been \n        separated from waste destined for disposal, and including waste \n        material removed from a septic tank, septage pit, or cesspool \n        (other than from portable toilets), except that the term does \n        not include--\n                    ``(A) any waste identified or listed as a hazardous \n                waste under section 3001 of this Act or waste regulated \n                under the Toxic Substances and Control Act;\n                    ``(B) any waste, including contaminated soil and \n                debris, resulting from response taken under section 104 \n                or 106 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \n                Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 or any \n                corrective action taken under this Act;\n                    ``(C) construction and demolition debris;\n                    ``(D) medical waste listed in section 11002 of this \n                Act;\n                    ``(E) industrial waste generated by manufacturing \n                or industrial processes, including waste generated \n                during scrap processing and scrap recycling;\n                    ``(F) recyclable materials; or\n                    ``(G) sludge.\n            ``(2) Recyclable materials.--The term `recyclable \n        materials' means any materials that have been separated from \n        waste otherwise destined for disposal (either at the source of \n        the waste or at processing facilities) or that have been \n        managed separately from waste destined for disposal, for the \n        purpose of recycling, reclamation, composting of organic \n        materials such as food and yard waste, or reuse (other than for \n        the purpose of incineration).
