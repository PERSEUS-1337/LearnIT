FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Economic prosperity and national security are closely \n        linked to an affordable and ample energy supply.\n            (2) Environmental quality is closely linked to energy \n        production and use.\n            (3) Population, worldwide economic development, energy \n        consumption, and stress on the environment are all expected to \n        increase substantially in the coming decades.\n            (4) The few energy options with the potential to meet \n        economic and environmental needs for the long-term future \n        should be pursued as part of a balanced national energy plan.\n            (5) Fusion energy is an attractive long-term energy source \n        due to virtually inexhaustible supply of fuel, its potential as \n        a substantial energy source requiring relatively little land \n        mass, and its promise of minimal environmental impact and \n        inherent safety.\n            (6) The National Research Council, the President's \n        Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, and the \n        Secretary of Energy Advisory Board have each recently reviewed \n        the Fusion Energy Sciences Program and each strongly supports \n        the fundamental science and creative innovation of the program \n        and has confirmed that progress toward the goal of producing \n        practical fusion energy has been excellent, although much \n        scientific and engineering work remains to be done.\n            (7) Each of these reviews and United States fusion \n        scientists have stressed the need for a magnetic fusion burning \n        experiment to address key scientific issues and as a necessary \n        step in the development of fusion energy.\n            (8) Further, the United States fusion research community \n        has developed a strong consensus that the first option for \n        United States involvement in a burning plasma experiment should \n        be through the international experiment known as ``ITER'' and \n        that, should the ITER experiment fail to go forward, then the \n        construction of a domestic burning plasma experiment should be \n        pursued aggressively.\n            (9) The National Research Council has also called for a \n        broadening of the Fusion Energy Sciences Program research base \n        as a means to more fully integrate the fusion science community \n        into the broader scientific community.\n            (10) The Fusion Energy Sciences Program budget is \n        inadequate to support the necessary science and innovation for \n        the present generation of experiments, and cannot accommodate \n        the cost of participation in or construction of a burning \n        plasma experiment.\n            (11) The Department of Energy's Fusion Energy Sciences \n        Advisory Committee has been recently tasked with the \n        development of a plan to demonstrate the provision of fusion \n        power to the United States electric grid within 35 years. \n        Although this effort is to be commended, Congress finds that \n        the importance of the development of fusion energy warrants \n        that every effort be made to credibly accelerate this \n        timeframe.\n\nSEC. 3. GOALS.\n\n    It shall be the goal of the United States to demonstrate electric \npower and hydrogen production for the United States energy grid \nutilizing a fusion energy device at the earliest date possible. It \nshall also be the goal of the United States to develop the scientific, \nengineering, and commercial infrastructure necessary to ensure that the \nUnited States is wholly competitive with other nations in providing \nfusion energy for its own needs and the needs of other nations.\n\nSEC. 4. PLAN FOR FUSION ENERGY SCIENCES PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Declaration of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United \nStates to conduct research, development, demonstration, and commercial \napplication activities to provide for the scientific, engineering, and \ncommercial infrastructure necessary to ensure that the United States is \ncompetitive with other nations in providing fusion energy for its own \nneeds and the needs of other nations, including by demonstrating \nelectric power or hydrogen production for the United States energy grid \nutilizing fusion energy at the earliest date possible.\n    (b) Fusion Energy Plan.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall transmit \n        to Congress a plan for carrying out the policy set forth in \n        subsection (a), including cost estimates, proposed budgets, \n        potential international partners, and specific programs for \n        implementing such policy.\n            (2) Requirements of plan.--Such plan shall also ensure \n        that--\n                    (A) existing fusion research facilities are more \n                fully utilized;\n                    (B) fusion science, technology, theory, advanced \n                computation, modeling, and simulation are strengthened;\n                    (C) new magnetic and inertial fusion research \n                facilities are selected based on scientific innovation, \n                cost effectiveness, and their potential to advance the \n                goal of practical fusion energy at the earliest date \n                possible;\n                    (D) the facilities that are selected are funded at \n                a cost-effective rate;\n                    (E) communication of scientific results and methods \n                between the fusion energy science community and the \n                broader scientific and technology communities is \n                improved;\n                    (F) inertial confinement fusion facilities are \n                utilized to the extent practicable for the purpose of \n                inertial fusion energy research and development;\n                    (G) attractive alternative inertial and magnetic \n                fusion energy approaches are more fully explored; and\n                    (H) to the extent practical, the recommendations of \n                the March 2004 Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory \n                Committee report on Workforce Planning are carried out, \n                including periodic assessment of program needs.\n            (3) Report on fusion materials and technology project.--The \n        plan required by this subsection shall also address the status \n        of, and to the degree possible, the costs and schedules for--\n                    (A) the design and implementation of international \n                or national facilities for the testing of fusion \n                materials; and\n                    (B) the design and implementation of international \n                or national facilities for the testing and development \n                of key fusion technologies.\n\nSEC. 5.
