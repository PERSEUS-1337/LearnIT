FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States market is widely recognized as one of \n        the most open markets in the world. Average United States \n        tariff rates are very low and the United States has limited, if \n        any, nontariff barriers.\n            (2) With each subsequent round of bilateral, regional, and \n        multilateral trade negotiations, tariffs have been \n        significantly reduced or eliminated for many manufactured \n        goods, leaving nontariff barriers as the most pervasive, \n        significant, and challenging barriers to United States exports \n        and market opportunities.\n            (3) Often the only leverage the United States has to obtain \n        the reduction or elimination of nontariff barriers imposed by \n        foreign countries is to negotiate the amount of tariffs the \n        United States imposes on imports from those foreign countries.\n            (4) The United States has become the world's largest net \n        debtor nation, having run up massive trade deficits since the \n        mid-1970s.\n            (5) Every year since 1976, whether in expansion or \n        recession, the United States has run a deficit in goods and \n        services trade, which weakens and detracts from America's \n        global leadership position.\n            (6) The United States trade deficit in 1993, the year \n        before the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) went \n        into force, was $135.6 billion.\n            (7) In 2015, the United States had a deficit in the balance \n        of trade in goods and services of $939.8 billion.\n            (8) In 2015, the United States had a trade deficit of $179 \n        billion with countries with which it has free trade agreements.\n            (9) Persistent deficits weaken the United States economy, \n        defense industrial base, and innovation system and increase the \n        likelihood of ownership of large segments of the United States \n        economy by foreign interests.\n\nSEC. 3. WITHDRAWAL OF TARIFF CONCESSIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--If the Department of Commerce determines pursuant \nto subsection (c) that--\n            (1) a tariff or nontariff barrier or policy or practice of \n        the government of a foreign country with respect to United \n        States exports of any product has not been reduced or \n        eliminated in accordance with the terms of a trade agreement \n        entered into between the United States and the foreign country; \n        or\n            (2) a tariff or nontariff barrier or policy or practice of \n        such government with respect to United States exports of any \n        product has been imposed or discovered,\nthe United States Trade Representative shall withdraw any modification \nof any duty that reduced or eliminated the bound or applied rate of \nduty on any product that has the same physical characteristics and uses \nas a product described in paragraph (1) or (2) until such time as the \nDepartment of Commerce submits to Congress a certification that the \nforeign government has reduced or eliminated the tariff or nontariff \nbarrier or policy or practice.\n    (b) Investigation.--\n            (1) In general.--The Department of Commerce shall initiate \n        an investigation if an interested party files a petition with \n        the Department of Commerce which alleges the elements necessary \n        for the withdrawal of the modification of an existing duty \n        under subsection (a), and which is accompanied by information \n        reasonably available to the petitioner supporting such \n        allegations.\n            (2) Interested party defined.--For purposes of paragraph \n        (1), the term ``interested party'' means--\n                    (A) a manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler in the \n                United States of a domestic product that has the same \n                physical characteristics and uses as the product for \n                which a modification of an existing duty is sought;\n                    (B) a certified union or recognized union or group \n                of workers engaged in the manufacture, production, or \n                wholesale in the United States of a domestic product \n                that has the same physical characteristics and uses as \n                the product for which a modification of an existing \n                duty is sought;\n                    (C) a trade or business association a majority of \n                whose members manufacture, produce, or wholesale in the \n                United States a domestic product that has the same \n                physical characteristics and uses as the product for \n                which a modification of an existing duty is sought; or\n                    (D) a member of the Committee on Ways and Means of \n                the House of Representatives or a member of the \n                Committee on Finance of the Senate.\n    (c) Determination by the Department of Commerce.--Not later than 45 \ndays after the date on which a petition is filed under subsection (b), \nthe Department of Commerce shall--\n            (1) determine whether the petition alleges the elements \n        necessary for the withdrawal of the modification of an existing \n        duty under subsection (a); and\n            (2) notify the petitioner of the determination under \n        paragraph (1) and the reasons for the determination.\n\nSEC. 4.
