    "content": "In their CCDF state plans, states are required to describe their treatment ofTANF families, transitioning families, and families at risk of welfare dependencewith respect to CCDF subsidy receipt. State responses to this CCDF plan provisionvaried in detail and structure. Appendix A reflects the language used by states intheir CCDF plans, with minor editing for consistency and clarity. Although all statesprovide responses to this provision, it is unclear for some states whether these threegroups receive priority relative to other families eligible for subsidies, or in whatorder these families will be served. For example, in New Hampshire, TANFfamilies, transitioning families, and at-risk families are described as having priorityover other families (with the exception of families that already have a child receivinga subsidy and need care for an additional child); however, there is no indication ofhow these three groups of families receive priority relative to each other . In addition,the information provided by a few states did not specifically address how thesegroups of families are treated by the state. In these cases, the table entry reads \"noinformation.\"  Appendix A1. State Descriptions of Treatment of TANF-relatedGroups Under CCDF Source : Table prepared by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) based on information from CCDF state plans submitted by the states to theDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS)."
