FINDING.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Approximately 2.1 million people are incarcerated in \n        the United States.\n            (2) The number of inmates held in Federal, State, and \n        private correctional facilities rose 28 percent between midyear \n        1995 and 2000.\n            (3) The offender population in jails turns over between 20 \n        and 25 times each year.\n            (4) At least 95 percent of those currently incarcerated \n        will be released from custody.\n            (5) Offender populations enter correctional facilities with \n        a higher rate of infection of chronic and communicable \n        diseases, including asthma, diabetes, hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, and \n        tuberculosis, than is present in the general population.\n            (6) The prevalence of mental illness in correctional \n        facilities is rising. Estimates are that between 14 and 20 \n        percent of jail inmates in 1996 had some type of anxiety \n        disorder. In State prison facilities, it is estimated that \n        between 22 and 30 percent have an anxiety disorder.\n            (7) The prevalence of AIDS among inmates is 3.5 times \n        higher than among the general population.\n            (8) An estimated 98,500 to 145,500 HIV-positive inmates \n        were released from prisons and jails in 1996.\n            (9) According to estimates, between 12 and 15 percent of \n        all individuals in the United States with chronic or current \n        hepatitis B infection in 1996 spent time in a correctional \n        facility that year.\n            (10) Between 1.3 and 1.4 million inmates released from \n        prison or jail in 1996 were infected with hepatitis C. The \n        prevalence of hepatitis C among inmates is between 9 and 10 \n        times higher than the estimated hepatitis C prevalence in the \n        Nation's population as a whole. In the United States, about 30 \n        percent of the total population with hepatitis C virus are \n        former prisoners or have a history of incarceration.\n            (11) In 1996, an estimated 35 percent of all those in \n        America who had tuberculosis had served time in a correctional \n        facility.\n            (12) According to estimates, substance abuse is a major \n        characteristic of incoming prisoners. Seventy-five percent of \n        State prisoners, and 80 percent of Federal prisoners, may be \n        characterized as alcohol-involved or drug-involved offenders.\n\nSEC. 3.
