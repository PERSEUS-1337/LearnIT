FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Mercury is a naturally occurring element and \n        bioaccumulative toxin that is easily absorbed through skin and \n        respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues.\n            (2) Although mercury is naturally occurring, studies have \n        shown that its concentration has increased dramatically over \n        the past 150 to 200 years due to mining and industrial \n        activities.\n            (3) Common sources of mercury released into the environment \n        include breakage of mercury-containing products like \n        fluorescent bulbs and thermometers, the manufacturing of \n        mercury-containing products, and incineration of mercury-\n        containing products.\n            (4) According to recent studies, mercury deposits are a \n        significant public health threat in many States throughout the \n        United States.\n            (5) Fetuses, infants, and young children are at the \n        greatest risk from chronic low level mercury exposure.\n            (6) A study by the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention found that approximately 8 percent of women of \n        childbearing age in the United States had mercury levels \n        exceeding the level considered safe by the Environmental \n        Protection Agency for protecting the fetus. This translates \n        into approximately 60,000 babies born each year in the United \n        States at risk of developmental harm due to mercury exposure in \n        the womb.\n            (7) A study published in the Journal of Obstetrics and \n        Gynecology found that elevated mercury exposures associated \n        with seafood could be linked to an increased risk of \n        infertility in both men and women.\n            (8) Mercury pollution is widespread. As of early 2003, 43 \n        States had issued mercury fish consumption advisories for one \n        or more freshwater or marine fish.\n            (9) Mercury is the most common pollutant triggering fish \n        consumption advisories in the United States. The number of \n        mercury advisories has increased 138 percent from 1994 to 2002. \n        In 2002, mercury advisories covered 12,000,000 lake acres and \n        470,000 river miles.\n            (10) According to the Mercury Study Report, prepared by the \n        Environmental Protection Agency and submitted to Congress in \n        1997, mercury fever thermometers contribute approximately 17 \n        tons of mercury to solid waste each year.\n            (11) Numerous mercury spills have been documented in \n        schools, often causing thousands of dollars to clean up. A \n        mercury spill in Washington, D.C., in September of 2003 cost \n        over $1,000,000 to clean up and resulted in a temporary school \n        closure of several weeks.\n            (12) Mercury-containing thermostats generally contain 3 \n        grams of mercury, which is enough mercury to poison a 60 acre \n        lake for one year.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency (in this Act referred to as the ``Administrator'') \nshall establish a program for making renewable grants to governmental \nand nonprofit agencies and organizations, and to for-profit entities, \nfor projects to--\n            (1) reduce harmful free-flowing elemental mercury and \n        mercury-added products from the environment;\n            (2) safely dispose of or recycle harmful mercury;\n            (3) educate communities and citizens about the harmful \n        effects of mercury;\n            (4) develop and carry out a plan, in accordance with \n        guidance provided by the Administrator under section 5, on how \n        to eliminate free flowing mercury and instruments containing \n        mercury from the premises of K-12 public and private schools; \n        or\n            (5) carry out a mercury thermometer exchange program.\n    (b) Procedures and Selection Criteria.--The Administrator shall \nestablish procedures for the selection of grant recipients under this \nsection, including requirements that appropriate records and \ninformation be made available to the Administrator as necessary to \nensure that grant funds are used for the purposes for which they are \nprovided. Criteria for selection shall include--\n            (1) strengths and weaknesses of the project;\n            (2) adequacy of overall project design;\n            (3) competency of proposed staff;\n            (4) suitability of applicant's available resources;\n            (5) appropriateness of the proposed project duration and \n        budget; and\n            (6) probability that the project will accomplish stated \n        objectives.\n    (c) Recycling Programs.--Funds provided through a grant provided \nunder this section may be used for a recycling program only if more \nthan 50 percent of the total material recycled under the program is \nmercury.\n    (d) Administrative Expenses.--Not more than 10 percent of the \namount appropriated for a fiscal year under subsection (e)(1) may be \nused by the Administrator for the administrative expenses of carrying \nout this section.\n    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n            (1) In general.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n        the Administrator for carrying out this section $75,000,000 for \n        each of the fiscal years 2005 through 2008.\n            (2) Set aside.--For each of the first 3 fiscal years for \n        which funds are provided under paragraph (1), at least 40 \n        percent of the amounts made available shall be reserved for \n        projects described in subsection (a)(4) or (5), unless a \n        sufficient number of qualified applications has not been \n        received.\n\nSEC. 4.
