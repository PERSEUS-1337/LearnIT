FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) Lewis and Clark were pioneering naturalists that \n        recorded dozens of species previously unknown to science while \n        ascending the Missouri River in 1804;\n            (2) the Missouri River, which is 2,321 miles long, drains \n        \\1/6\\ of the United States, is home to approximately 10,000,000 \n        people in 10 States and 28 Native American tribes, and is a \n        resource of incalculable value to the United States;\n            (3) the construction of dams, levees, and river training \n        structures in the past 150 years has aided navigation, flood \n        control, and water supply along the Missouri River, but has \n        reduced habitat for native river fish and wildlife and \n        opportunities for river-based recreation;\n            (4) river organizations, including the Missouri River Basin \n        Association, support habitat restoration, riverfront \n        revitalization, and improved operational flexibility so long as \n        these efforts do not significantly interfere with uses of the \n        Missouri River; and\n            (5) restoring a string of natural places by the year 2004 \n        would aid native river fish and wildlife, reduce flood losses, \n        enhance recreation and tourism, and celebrate the bicentennial \n        of Lewis and Clark's voyage.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) protect, restore, and enhance the fish, wildlife, and \n        plants, and the associated habitats on which they depend, of \n        the Missouri River;\n            (2) restore a string of natural places that aid native \n        river fish and wildlife, reduce flood losses, and enhance \n        recreation and tourism;\n            (3) revitalize historic riverfronts to improve quality of \n        life in riverside communities and attract recreation and \n        tourism;\n            (4) monitor the health of the Missouri River and measure \n        biological, chemical, and physical responses to changes in \n        River management;\n            (5) allow the Army Corps of Engineers increased authority \n        to restore and protect fish and wildlife habitat on the \n        Missouri River;\n            (6) protect and replenish cottonwoods, and their associated \n        riparian woodland communities, along the upper Missouri River; \n        and\n            (7) educate the public about the economic, environmental, \n        and cultural importance of the Missouri River and the \n        scientific and cultural discoveries of Lewis and Clark.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION OF MISSOURI RIVER.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``Missouri River'' means the Missouri River \nand the adjacent floodplain that extends from the mouth of the Missouri \nRiver (RM 0) to the confluence of the Jefferson, Madison, and Gallatin \nRivers (RM 2341) in Montana.\n\nSEC. 4.
