FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Alcohol is by far the drug most widely used and abused \n        by young people in the United States today, even though it is \n        illegal for youths under age 21 to purchase alcohol in all 50 \n        of the States and the District of Columbia.\n            (2) According to the 1992 National Institute on Drug Abuse \n        survey of high school students and young adults, 89.5 percent \n        of high school seniors in the class of 1990 had used alcohol at \n        least once and 30 percent had experienced a ``binge'' of 5 or \n        more drinks in a row within the past 2 weeks. Among college \n        students, 43 percent reported occasions of ``binge'' drinking, \n        including 35 percent of the females and 52 percent of the \n        males.\n            (3) The average age at which young people begin drinking is \n        13. By age 13, approximately 30 percent of boys and 22 percent \n        of girls classify themselves as drinkers. According to the 1988 \n        National High School Senior Survey, 17 percent of high school \n        seniors reported having been drunk by eighth grade, 37 percent \n        by ninth grade, 54 percent by tenth grade, and 71 percent by \n        twelfth grade. Studies demonstrate that the use of alcohol by \n        individuals before the age of 15 appears to be one of the \n        predictors of later heavy alcohol and other drug use by the \n        individuals.\n            (4) Young people are not well informed about the hazards of \n        alcohol use. Only 43 percent of high school seniors believe \n        there is great risk of harm from drinking activities such as \n        binge drinking once or twice each weekend. More than one \n        quarter of high school seniors do not view heavy, regular daily \n        (``binge'') drinking as entailing great risk. More than 40 \n        percent of 8th graders, 45 percent of 10th graders, and 51 \n        percent of 12th graders do not perceive having 5 or more drinks \n        once or twice a weekend as entailing a great risk.\n            (5) According to the Department of Health and Human \n        Services, sponsorships and promotions on college campuses by \n        alcohol producers and the use of celebrities and youth-oriented \n        musical groups in advertising create a pro-drinking \n        environment.\n            (6) Treatment costs for fetal alcohol syndrome (referred to \n        in this section as ``FAS'') and other alcohol-related birth \n        defects in the United States are estimated at nearly a third of \n        a billion dollars. FAS is one of the top 3 known causes of \n        birth defects with accompanying mental retardation and the only \n        known preventable cause among the top three. Among children \n        born to women who drink heavily, the incidence of FAS may be as \n        high as 25 per 1,000 live births. Among children born to other \n        women, the FAS incidence is between 1 to 3 infants with the \n        syndrome per 1,000 live births. The incidence of other alcohol-\n        related birth defects is estimated to be 3 times greater than \n        that of FAS.\n            (7) According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse \n        and Alcoholism, an estimated 18,000,000 persons in the United \n        States who are 18 or older currently experience problems as a \n        result of alcohol use. An estimated 4,500,000 young people are \n        dependent on alcohol or are problem drinkers.\n            (8) According to Healthy People 2000, the National Health \n        Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives--\n                    (A) nearly one-half of all deaths from motor \n                vehicle crashes are alcohol-related;\n                    (B) alcohol is implicated in nearly one-half of all \n                fatal intentional injuries such as suicides and \n                homicides; and\n                    (C) victims are intoxicated in approximately one-\n                third of all homicides, drownings, and boating deaths.\n            (9) An estimated 25 percent of all hospitalized persons \n        have alcohol-related problems.\n            (10) Alcohol advertising, especially in the broadcast \n        media, represents the single greatest source of alcohol \n        education for persons in the United States. According to a 1990 \n        study of 10- to 13-year-olds, funded by the American Automobile \n        Association Foundation for Traffic Safety, there is a \n        relationship between exposure and attention by an individual to \n        beer advertising, and expectations that the individual drink as \n        an adult.\n            (11) A major 1981 federally funded study found a \n        significant relationship between--\n                    (A) exposure of individuals to alcoholic beverage \n                advertising as youth; and\n                    (B) drinking behaviors and attitudes of the \n                individuals that can lead to certain forms of problem \n                drinking.\n            (12) Over 80 percent of 2,000 adults surveyed in 1988 for \n        the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms by the Opinion \n        Research Corporation believe that alcohol advertising \n        influences underage youth to drink alcoholic beverages. The \n        survey also found that the general public feels that the young \n        people of the United States constitute the group that is most \n        at risk from drinking alcoholic beverages.\n            (13) The alcoholic beverage industry spends approximately \n        $2,000,000,000 each year on advertising and promotions in the \n        United States.\n            (14) The 1988 Surgeon General's Workshop on Drunk Driving \n        has recommended--\n                    (A) that the level of alcoholic beverage \n                advertising be matched with an equal number of pro-\n                health and pro-safety messages; and\n                    (B) the inclusion of health warning messages in all \n                alcohol advertising.\n            (15) The National Commission on Drug-Free Schools' \n        September 1990 Final Report, ``Toward a Drug-Free Generation: A \n        Nation's Responsibility'', recommends that Congress--\n                    (A) require additional health and safety messages \n                on all alcohol products and advertising for the \n                products; and\n                    (B) consider enacting a ban on advertising and \n                promotion of alcohol if alcohol advertising still \n                targets youth and glamorizes alcohol use.\n            (16) Over two-thirds of persons surveyed in a 1989 Wall \n        Street Journal poll favor requiring warnings about the dangers \n        of drinking both on alcoholic beverage containers and in \n        alcohol advertisements. Nearly three-fourths of persons \n        surveyed in a 1990 Gallup Poll favor requiring health warning \n        messages in alcohol advertising.\n            (17) Alcohol in combination with other drugs is the leading \n        cause of emergency room drug abuse episodes.\n            (18) According to the Inspector General of the Department \n        of Health and Human Services, the average binge drinker is a 16 \n        year old male in the 10th grade who was 12 years old when he \n        took his first drink.\n            (19) A third of all students do not understand the \n        intoxicating effects of alcohol. More than 2.6 million do not \n        know a person can die from an overdose of alcohol. A projected \n        259,000 students think that wine coolers or beer cannot get a \n        person drunk, cannot make a person sick, or cannot do as much \n        harm as other alcoholic beverages.\n            (20) In 1989, chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, \n        was the 9th leading cause of death in the United States. Of \n        41,000 deaths attributed to liver disease in the United States, \n        46 percent diagnostically were associated with alcohol. Heavy \n        alcohol use is considered the most important risk factor for \n        chronic liver disease. Even among liver disease deaths not \n        coded as alcohol-related, approximately 50 percent are thought \n        to be due to alcohol use.\n            (21) Between 5 and 24 percent of hypertension cases are \n        associated with alcohol. Many cases diagnosed as essential \n        hypertension (high blood pressure having no known causes) may \n        actually have chronic alcohol ingestion as their cause.\n            (22) Alcohol abuse is strongly associated with increased \n        risk of certain kinds of cancer, especially cancer of the \n        liver, esophagus, nasopharynx, and larynx. Alcohol is also \n        associated with dietary deficiency that may increase cancer \n        risk.\n\nSEC. 3.
