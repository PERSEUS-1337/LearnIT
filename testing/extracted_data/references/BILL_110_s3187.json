FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for \n        both men and women, accounting for 28 percent of all cancer \n        deaths.\n            (2) Lung cancer kills more people annually than breast \n        cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, melanoma, \n        and kidney cancer combined.\n            (3) Since the National Cancer Act of 1971 (Public Law 92-\n        218; 85 Stat. 778), coordinated and comprehensive research has \n        raised the 5-year survival rates for breast cancer to 88 \n        percent, for prostate cancer to 99 percent, and for colon \n        cancer to 64 percent.\n            (4) However, the 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is \n        still only 15 percent and a similar coordinated and \n        comprehensive research effort is required to achieve increases \n        in lung cancer survivability rates.\n            (5) Sixty percent of lung cancer cases are now diagnosed as \n        nonsmokers or former smokers.\n            (6) Two-thirds of nonsmokers diagnosed with lung cancer are \n        women.\n            (7) Certain minority populations, such as African-American \n        males, have disproportionately high rates of lung cancer \n        incidence and mortality, notwithstanding their similar smoking \n        rate.\n            (8) Members of the baby boomer generation are entering \n        their sixties, the most common age at which people develop lung \n        cancer.\n            (9) Tobacco addiction and exposure to other lung cancer \n        carcinogens such as Agent Orange and other herbicides and \n        battlefield emissions are serious problems among military \n        personnel and war veterans.\n            (10) Significant and rapid improvements in lung cancer \n        mortality can be expected through greater use and access to \n        lung cancer screening tests for at-risk individuals.\n            (11) Additional strategies are necessary to further enhance \n        the existing tests and therapies available to diagnose and \n        treat lung cancer in the future.\n            (12) The August 2001 Report of the Lung Cancer Progress \n        Review Group of the National Cancer Institute stated that \n        funding for lung cancer research was ``far below the levels \n        characterized for other common malignancies and far out of \n        proportion to its massive health impact''.\n            (13) The Report of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group \n        identified as its ``highest priority'' the creation of \n        integrated, multidisciplinary, multi-institutional research \n        consortia organized around the problem of lung cancer rather \n        than around specific research disciplines.\n            (14) The United States must enhance its response to the \n        issues raised in the Report of the Lung Cancer Progress Review \n        Group, and this can be accomplished through the establishment \n        of a coordinated effort designed to reduce the lung cancer \n        mortality rate by 50 percent by 2015 and targeted funding to \n        support this coordinated effort.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING INVESTMENT IN LUNG CANCER \n              RESEARCH.\n\n    It is the sense of the Senate that--\n            (1) lung cancer mortality reduction should be made a \n        national public health priority; and\n            (2) a comprehensive mortality reduction program coordinated \n        by the Secretary of Health and Human Service is justified and \n        necessary to adequately address and reduce lung cancer \n        mortality.\n\nSEC. 4. LUNG CANCER MORTALITY REDUCTION PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart 1 of part C of title IV of the Public \nHealth Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285 et seq.) is amended by adding at the \nend the following:\n\n``SEC. 417E.
