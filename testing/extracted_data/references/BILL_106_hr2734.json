DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act:\n            (1) The term ``aggregation'' means the purchase or \n        acquisition of retail electricity on behalf of two or more \n        consumers.\n            (2) The term ``electric utility franchise'' means rights \n        granted to a utility company by a local government which \n        provide conditions under which the utility conducts its \n        operations and services within the boundaries of the local \n        government.\n            (3) The term ``municipal electric utility'' means a city, \n        county, irrigation district, drainage district, public utility \n        district, or other political subdivision or agency of a State \n        competent under the laws thereof to carry on the business of a \n        retail electricity distributor and/or a retail electricity \n        supplier.\n            (4) The term ``opt-out aggregation plan'' means aggregation \n        in which all customers within the jurisdiction of a local \n        government unit are automatically included unless they \n        affirmatively choose a supplier other than the supplier \n        designated by the local government unit.\n            (5) The term ``retail electric consumer'' means any person \n        who purchases or offers to purchase any retail electric supply.\n            (6) The term ``rural electric cooperative'' means an \n        enterprise or organization owned by and operated for the \n        benefit of those receiving retail electricity (usually \n        distribution and supply) and other services from the \n        cooperative.\n            (7) The term ``State'' means a State, the District of \n        Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, \n        Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n        Islands, and Indian tribes as defined in section 102(2) of the \n        Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994 (25 U.S.C. \n        479a(2)).\n            (8) The term ``State regulatory authority'' means any State \n        agency which has ratemaking authority with respect to the \n        provision of local electric energy distribution services by any \n        local distribution company.\n            (9) The term ``supplier'' means any person who produces, \n        generates, manufactures, aggregates, markets, brokers, sells, \n        or otherwise supplies electric energy.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Many States are deregulating retail sales of \n        electricity.\n            (2) Deregulation of retail sales of electricity must \n        benefit all customers, including residential and small business \n        customers.\n            (3) In States that have deregulated retail sales of \n        electricity, large industrial and commercial customers are \n        winning the best deals, and few choices are yet available to \n        residential and small business consumers.\n            (4) It is likely that most residential customers will not \n        actively choose a new electricity supplier and instead will \n        remain customers of their current electricity supplier for \n        years to come;\n            (5) All customers, especially residential and small \n        business customers, will often find it difficult and \n        frustrating to find the time and sufficient information to \n        fully evaluate competing offers from electricity suppliers.\n            (6) Aggregation into larger buying groups will enable \n        consumers to achieve greater leverage and thus better prices \n        and services in electricity markets.\n            (7) Community choice is a particular type of aggregation in \n        which a local government negotiates a contract for electric \n        energy on behalf of all citizens within its boundaries. \n        Residents or businesses in the community who prefer to choose \ntheir own electricity suppliers would be free to ``opt out''.\n            (8) All consumers taking part in community choice \n        aggregation can benefit, including large customers, who can \n        still receive price differentiation based on their larger \n        usage.\n            (9) Local governments are experienced in working with \n        technical consultants to negotiate contracts and deliver \n        services to their citizens.\n            (10) Local governments are accountable to their \n        constituents through elections, open meetings laws, fair \n        bidding laws, and conflict of interest laws.\n            (11) Because local governments exercising community choice \n        must include all electricity customers within the jurisdiction \n        who want to participate, all citizens and businesses who so \n        choose can benefit, while other types of retail electricity \n        suppliers will seek to serve the more profitable customers or \n        specific types of customers.\n            (12) Local governments can provide an electric load that \n        has diversity and may be attractive to electricity suppliers.\n            (13) In States that have deregulated retail sales of \n        electricity, citizens should be able to use traditional public \n        processes to determine whether their local governments should \n        act as nonprofit aggregators for their communities.\n            (14) In States in which they hold franchise powers for \n        electricity, local governments should be able to use their \n        franchise to exercise community choice.\n\nSEC. 4. AGGREGATION.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law, and \nsubject to legitimate and nondiscriminatory State requirements imposed \non retail electric suppliers, a group of customers or any entity, \nincluding a unit of State or local government, acting on behalf of such \ngroup may acquire retail electric energy on an aggregate basis if the \ngroup of customers is served by one or more local distribution \ncompanies that are subject to retail competition.\n\nSEC. 5. COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION.\n\n    Title VI of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is \namended by adding the following new section at the end thereof:\n\n``SEC. 609. COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION.\n\n    ``(a) Community Choice Aggregation of Electric Load.--Any State \nthat permits any group of retail electric consumers to choose among \ncompeting suppliers of electric energy shall permit any general purpose \nlocal government unit for any political subdivision of the State, or \ngroup of such general purpose units of local government acting \ntogether, to offer to act as an agent for all purchasers that are \nwithin such group of retail electric consumers and that are located \nwithin the boundaries of such political subdivision for the purpose of \npurchasing electric energy on an aggregate basis if such local \ngovernment, or group of local governments, comply with the requirements \nof subsection (b).\n    ``(b) Requirements.--\n            ``(1) Approval by vote.--A local government shall be \n        covered by the provisions of subsection (a) only if such \n        government has approved the aggregation of electric energy \n        purchases by a vote of its elected governing body or by a vote \n        of its citizens. Two or more local governments shall be covered \n        by the provisions of subsection (a) only if such governments \n        have approved the aggregation of electric energy purchases by a \n        vote of the elected governing body or by a vote of the citizens \n        of each local government.\n            ``(2) Participation not mandatory.--A local government \n        shall be covered by the provisions of subsection (a) only if \n        all retail electric consumers permitted to choose among \n        competing suppliers of electric energy that are located within \n        the boundaries of such political subdivision are offered the \n        opportunity to participate in the aggregation of purchases and \n        any such consumer choosing not to participate is permitted to \n        opt out and purchase electric energy from another agent acting \n        as an aggregator or directly from any supplier or other person.\n            ``(3) State regulatory authorities.--Each State regulatory \n        authority for a State that permits any group of retail electric \n        consumers to choose among competing suppliers of electric \n        energy shall cooperate with local governments for the purpose \n        of compliance with this subsection. Each such State regulatory \n        authority shall establish guidelines for local governments \n        acting as community choice electricity aggregators. No State \n        regulatory authority may interfere with a local government's \n        existing powers to procure competitive energy services under \n        existing Federal and State law, city charter provisions, or \n        local procurement practices.\n            ``(4) Funds for renewable energy or energy efficiency.--\n        Each State that permits any group of retail electric consumers \n        to choose among competing suppliers and that also authorizes or \n        mandates the collection of funds for renewable energy or energy \n        efficiency programs shall permit local governments that serve \nas community choice aggregators of electric energy purchases to collect \nand expend such funds in the case of consumers within the aggregated \njurisdiction if the local government has prepared and approved a plan \nfor such collection and expenditure at the local level and State \nregulators have reviewed and approved said plan as consistent with \nState energy goals and as providing an appropriate contribution to any \nstatewide or regional renewable energy or energy efficiency fund that \nbenefits the aggregated jurisdiction.\n    ``(c) Federal Power Act Jurisdiction.--No local government that \naggregates electric load as described in subsection (a) shall be \nconsidered a utility engaging in the wholesale purchase and resale of \nelectricity for purposes of the Federal Power Act. Providing \nelectricity to aggregated customers within the boundaries of a local \ngovernment as described in subsection (a) shall not be considered a \nwholesale transaction subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission under the Federal Power Act.\n    ``(d) Enforcement.--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may \nbring an action in the appropriate United States District Court against \nany State to require compliance with the provisions of subsection (a).\n    ``(e) Savings Provision.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to prohibit the aggregation of electric load by local \ngovernment units in a different manner under other authority of law.''.\n\nSEC. 6. FRANCHISES.\n\n    Any State that has deregulated retail sales of electricity shall \npermit local governments to exercise local franchise powers. A local \ngovernment that has granted a franchise to a utility at a prior time \nmay offer such franchise for competitive bidding and contract award, \nprovided such measures are authorized by consumers in a public process.\n\nSEC. 7. EXCLUSIONS.\n\n    (a) Utilities Not Participating.--For municipal electric utilities \nand rural electric cooperatives that are not participating in retail \nelectric competition, sections 4, 5, and 6 of this Act shall not apply.\n    (b) Aggregation.--For States that have adopted retail competition \nby law or regulation prior to the date of enactment of this Act, \nsections 4, 5, and 6 of this Act shall not apply to the provisions of a \nState law or regulation, and any subsequent regulation implementing \nsuch State law or regulation as such law or regulation may pertain to \nan opt-out aggregation plan as it may be undertaken by any general \npurpose local government unit for any political subdivision of the \nState including a municipal corporation, county government or township.\n\nSEC. 8. SEPARABILITY.\n\n    If any provision of this Act (or the application of that provision \nto particular persons or circumstances) is held invalid, the remainder \nof this Act (or the application of that provision to other persons or \ncircumstances) shall not be affected."
