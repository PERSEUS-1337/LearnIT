FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n(a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) children in areas with high incidences of poverty are \n        more likely to be exposed to problems created by economic \n        depreciation, poor housing, overwhelming family \n        responsibilities, inadequate parental educational background or \n        parental substance abuse and are at risk of failure;\n            (2) students from poor families are 3 times more likely to \n        drop out of school than students from more advantaged homes;\n            (3) without social intervention, at-risk children are often \n        unable to improve academic performance;\n            (4) schools are accessible, central resources in every \n        community where social and educational services can be \n        coordinated and disseminated to at-risk children and their \n        families;\n            (5) schools are most effective at serving a community when \n        the people of the community are involved in school management \n        and help design activities to fulfill the needs of children in \n        the community; and\n            (6) many schools have successfully improved the academic \n        performance and social development of at-risk children by \n        instituting an organizational and management plan that \n        incorporates parental involvement in school management and \n        incorporates mental health and social intervention services in \n        the daily academic curriculum.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to improve the overall \ndevelopment of at-risk children who reside in eligible communities as \ndefined in section 12.\n\nSEC. 3.
