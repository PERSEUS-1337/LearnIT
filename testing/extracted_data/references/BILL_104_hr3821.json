FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Cigarette smoking and tobacco use account for \n        approximately 450,000 deaths each year in the United States.\n            (2) Cigarette smoking accounts for approximately \n        $65,000,000,000 each year in lost productivity and health care \n        costs.\n            (3) Tobacco products are as addictive as cocaine and \n        heroin.\n            (4) Each day in the United States, approximately 3,000 \n        children try their first cigarette, many of whom will become \n        addicted and will die prematurely.\n            (5) The tobacco industry spends over $6,000,000,000 each \n        year to promote and advertise its products using images of \n        sexual attraction, sophistication, athletic abilities, and good \n        health.\n            (6) The present advertising and promotional themes used by \n        the tobacco industry strongly influence youth tobacco use and \n        it is in the Government's interests to prohibit tobacco \n        advertising and promotion to discourage the use of tobacco by \n        the Nation's youth.\n            (7) In spite of the well established and well known dangers \n        of tobacco products, the tobacco industry has for years denied \n        that their products cause disease or are addictive.\n            (8) Of adult smokers, 82 percent smoked their first \n        cigarette before the age of 18. Of young people who become \n        regular smokers, 70 percent regret their decision to smoke.\n            (9) Voluntary agreements with the tobacco industry, which \n        have been attempted for more than 30 years, have been shown to \n        be ineffective.\n\nSEC. 3.
