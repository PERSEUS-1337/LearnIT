FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Generic pharmaceuticals are approved by the Food and \n        Drug Administration on the basis of testing and other \n        information establishing that such pharmaceuticals are \n        therapeutically equivalent to brand-name pharmaceuticals, \n        ensuring consumers a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective \n        alternative to brand-name pharmaceuticals.\n            (2) The pharmaceutical market has become increasingly \n        competitive during the last decade because of the increasing \n        availability and accessibility of generic pharmaceuticals.\n            (3) The Congressional Budget Office estimates that--\n                    (A) the substitution of generic pharmaceuticals for \n                brand-name pharmaceuticals will save purchasers of \n                pharmaceuticals between $8,000,000,000 and \n                $10,000,000,000 each year; and\n                    (B) quality generic pharmaceuticals cost between 25 \n                percent and 60 percent less than brand-name \n                pharmaceuticals, resulting in an estimated average \n                savings of $15 to $30 on each prescription filled.\n            (4) Generic pharmaceuticals are widely accepted by both \n        consumers and the medical profession, as the market share held \n        by generic pharmaceuticals compared to brand-name \n        pharmaceuticals has more than doubled during the last decade, \n        from approximately 19 percent to 43 percent, according to the \n        Congressional Budget Office.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to reduce the cost of prescription drugs to the United \n        States Government and to beneficiaries under Federal health \n        care programs while maintaining the quality of health care by \n        encouraging the use of generic drugs rather than nongeneric \n        drugs under those programs whenever feasible; and\n            (2) to increase the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals \n        by requiring the Food and Drug Administration, where \n        appropriate, to determine that a generic pharmaceutical is the \n        therapeutic equivalent of its brand-name counterpart, and by \n        affording national uniformity to that determination.\n\n           TITLE I--ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE USE OF GENERIC DRUGS\n\nSEC. 101.
