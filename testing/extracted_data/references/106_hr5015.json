FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Lowering the student dropout rate is one of the most \n        significant challenges facing educators today. Students must \n        stay in school in order to receive the education they need to \n        succeed in the new economy and contribute fully to American \n        society.\n            (2) The ability of local educational agencies to lower the \n        student dropout rate has been inhibited by the lack of focus at \n        the Federal level and the limited availability of appropriate \n        dropout prevention-focused curriculum, instruction, \n        professional development, and administrative support services.\n            (3) According to the National Dropout Prevention Network, \n        it is at the local and community level where school \n        improvements and change occur that will eventually have an \n        impact on the graduation rate of students. The focus of these \n        efforts should be concentrated on the most successful \n        strategies that research has identified as having an impact on \n        increasing the graduation rate. These strategies encompass--\n                    (A) systemic renewal;\n                    (B) community collaboration;\n                    (C) professional development;\n                    (D) family involvement;\n                    (E) early childhood education;\n                    (F) reading and writing programs;\n                    (G) individualized instruction;\n                    (H) instructional technologies;\n                    (I) mentoring and tutoring;\n                    (J) service learning;\n                    (K) learning styles and multiple intelligences;\n                    (L) violence prevention and conflict resolution;\n                    (M) career education and workforce readiness;\n                    (N) out-of-school experiences; and\n                    (O) alternative public schooling.\n            (4) The National Dropout Prevention Network has found that \n        the strategies described in paragraph (3) have been successful \n        in all school levels from K-12 in rural, suburban, or urban \n        centers. When schools or school districts develop a program \n        improvement plan that encompasses most or all of these \n        strategies, positive outcomes will result.\n            (5) It is necessary to develop a number of model dropout \n        prevention programs to fully develop the effective strategies \n        listed above into comprehensive dropout prevention programs. \n        These model programs should be used as examples by schools \n        across the country that wish to implement similar programs. \n        Subsequently, a nationwide dropout prevention program, in order \n        to be effective, should be based on these model programs.\n            (6) Dropout prevention and recovery programs which are \n        proven to be successful in lowering dropout rates need to be \n        disseminated to school and community leaders willing to adapt \n        and support these innovative programs in their schools and \n        community.\n\nSEC. 3.
