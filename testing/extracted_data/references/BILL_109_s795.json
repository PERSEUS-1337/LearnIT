FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The National Transportation Safety Board has reported \n        that--\n                    (A) in 2002, teen drivers, which constituted only \n                6.4 percent of all drivers, were involved in 14.3 \n                percent of all fatal motor vehicle crashes;\n                    (B) motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of \n                death for Americans between 15 and 20 years of age;\n                    (C) between 1994 and 2003, almost 64,000 Americans \n                between 15 and 20 years of age died in motor vehicle \n                crashes, an average of 122 per week; and\n                    (D) in 2003--\n                            (i) 3,657 American drivers between 15 and \n                        20 years of age were killed in motor vehicle \n                        crashes;\n                            (ii) 300,000 Americans between 15 and 20 \n                        years of age were injured in motor vehicle \n                        crashes; and\n                            (iii) 7,884 American drivers between 15 and \n                        20 years of age were involved in fatal crashes, \n                        resulting in 9,088 total fatalities, a 5 \n                        percent increase since 1993.\n            (2) Though only 20 percent of driving by young drivers \n        occurs at night, over 50 percent of the motor vehicle crash \n        fatalities involving young drivers occur at night.\n            (3) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has \n        reported that--\n                    (A) 6,300,000 motor vehicle crashes claimed the \n                lives of nearly 43,000 Americans in 2003 and injured \n                almost 3,000,000 more Americans;\n                    (B) teen drivers between 16 and 20 years of age \n                have a fatality rate that is 4 times the rate for \n                drivers between 25 and 70 years of age; and\n                    (C) drivers who are 16 years of age have a motor \n                vehicle crash rate that is almost ten times the crash \n                rate for drivers aged between 30 and 60 years of age.\n            (4) According to the Insurance Institute for Highway \n        Safety, the chance of a crash by a 16- or 17-year-old driver is \n        doubled if there are 2 peers in the vehicle and quadrupled with \n        3 or more peers in the vehicle.\n            (5) In 1997, the first full year of its graduated driver \n        licensing system, Florida experienced a 9 percent reduction in \n        fatal and injurious crashes among young drivers between the \n        ages of 15 and 18, compared with 1995, according to the \n        Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n            (6) The Journal of the American Medical Association reports \n        that crashes involving 16-year-old drivers decreased between \n        1995 and 1999 by 25 percent in Michigan and 27 percent in North \n        Carolina. Comprehensive graduated driver licensing systems were \n        implemented in 1997 in these States.\n            (7) In California, according to the Automobile Club of \n        Southern California, teenage passenger deaths and injuries \n        resulting from crashes involving 16-year-old drivers declined \n        by 40 percent from 1998 to 2000, the first 3 years of \n        California's graduated driver licensing program. The number of \n        at-fault collisions involving 16-year-old drivers decreased by \n        24 percent during the same period.\n            (8) The National Transportation Safety Board reports that \n        39 States and the District of Columbia have implemented 3-stage \n        graduated driver licensing systems. Many States have not yet \n        implemented these and other basic safety features of graduated \n        driver licensing laws to protect the lives of teenage and \n        novice drivers.\n            (9) A 2001 Harris Poll indicates that--\n                    (A) 95 percent of Americans support a requirement \n                of 30 to 50 hours of practice driving with an adult;\n                    (B) 92 percent of Americans support a 6-month \n                learner's permit period; and\n                    (C) 74 percent of Americans support limiting the \n                number of teen passengers in a car with a teen driver \n                and supervised driving during high-risk driving \n                periods, such as night.\n\nSEC. 3.
