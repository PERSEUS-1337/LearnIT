    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Outdoor Sports Protection Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) millions of Americans of all ages enjoy recreational \n        fishing, sport shooting, and hunting;\n            (2) those millions of anglers, sport shooters, and hunters \n        are the primary source of funding for Federal and State \n        wildlife and habitat conservation and management;\n            (3) lead and other types of traditional fishing, shooting, \n        and hunting implements have been used by Americans for hundreds \n        of years;\n            (4) alternative forms of sinkers and fishing lures are \n        considerably more expensive than those made of traditional \n        materials; consequently, a ban on traditional fishing \n        implements would decrease fishing participation and impose \n        significant additional costs on millions of Americans who fish;\n            (5) alternative forms of ammunition and ammunition \n        components are considerably more expensive than those made of \n        traditional materials, and can be difficult if not impossible \n        to obtain; consequently, a ban on traditional ammunition would \n        decrease participation in the shooting sports and impose \n        significant costs on the millions of American hunters and sport \n        shooters;\n            (6) any reduction in participation in fishing, hunting, and \n        the shooting sports would greatly affect funding for Federal \n        and State wildlife and habitat conservation; and\n            (7) voluntary programs by hunters to reduce lead use have \n        largely been successful, and in the absence of more definitive \n        evidence of harm to the environment the Federal Government \n        should not take steps to restrict the use of traditional \n        hunting and fishing implements.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Traditional hunting and fishing implement.--The term \n        ``traditional hunting and fishing implement'' means any--\n                    (A) firearm;\n                    (B) ammunition;\n                    (C) ammunition component;\n                    (D) fishing lure;\n                    (E) fishing sinker or weight; and\n                    (F) fishing line;\n        that contains lead, zinc, copper, or brass.\n            (2) Federal public land.--\n                    (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph \n                (B), the term ``Federal public land'' means any land or \n                water that is--\n                            (i) owned by the United States; and\n                            (ii) managed by the Department of the \n                        Interior or the Department of Agriculture for \n                        purposes that include the conservation of \n                        natural resources.\n                    (B) Exclusion.--The term ``Federal public land'' \n                does not include any land or water held in trust for \n                the benefit of--\n                            (i) a federally recognized Indian tribe; or\n                            (ii) a member of a federally recognized \n                        Indian tribe.\n\nSEC. 4.
