Effective date.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since 2006, metal theft has been on the rise, largely \n        due to a surge in the global demand for scrap metal and a \n        historic increase in the price of metal commodities.\n            (2) Theft of metal components is jeopardizing the integrity \n        of critical infrastructure in the United States through theft \n        of metal in transportation, electrical, and telecommunications \n        networks.\n            (3) Theft of manhole covers, storm water grates, highway \n        guard rails, railroad tracks, automobile components, and street \n        lamps pose a significant public safety risk.\n            (4) Many State laws call on secondary metal recyclers to \n        help deter this crime and assist law enforcement by documenting \n        transactions and collecting information in order to identify \n        the sellers of scrap metal and the material they are selling. \n        These laws have been a significant deterrent to the problem of \n        metal theft.\n            (5) Although many States have enacted metal theft laws, \n        metal theft is a nationwide crime that crosses state lines.\n            (6) An overarching Federal law is necessary to deter metal \n        theft across the country.\n            (7) Combating the problem of metal theft will require \n        improved communications between metal businesses and law \n        enforcement agencies.\n            (8) The secondary metal recycling industry should be \n        commended for educating the public and law enforcement to the \n        problems related to metal theft, issuing ``Do Not Buy'' lists, \n        partnering with the National Crime Prevention Council, and \n        creating a Theft Alert System.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that Federal, State, and local \ngovernment agencies should work with representatives of the secondary \nmetal recycling industry to develop and improve effective \ncountermeasures to combat the theft and sale of stolen secondary metal.\n\nSEC. 4. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to protect consumers, businesses, critical \n        infrastructure, and State and local governments from the \n        problem of secondary metal theft;\n            (2) to regulate interstate commerce by limiting trafficking \n        in stolen secondary metal sold for the purpose of recycling or \n        reuse;\n            (3) to permit legitimate secondary metal transactions to \n        continue to take place; and\n            (4) to establish a system to document secondary metal \n        transactions between sellers and buyers while addressing the \n        growing problem of secondary metal theft.\n\nSEC. 5. PURCHASE TRANSACTION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Do-not-buy List.--Unless the seller establishes by written \ndocumentation that the seller is the owner, or an employee, agent, or \nother person authorized to sell on behalf of the owner, it is unlawful \nfor a secondary metal recycling agent to purchase for recycling any \nsecondary metal that is--\n            (1) marked with name, logo, or initials of a railroad, an \n        electric, gas, or water company, a telephone company, cable \n        company, or a public utility or that has been altered to \n        remove, conceal, or obliterate such a name, logo, or initials \n        through burning or cutting of wire sheathing or other means;\n            (2) marked with the name of a city, county, or State \n        government entity;\n            (3) a street light pole or fixture;\n            (4) a road or bridge guard rail;\n            (5) a highway or street sign;\n            (6) a water meter cover;\n            (7) a storm water grate;\n            (8) unused or undamaged building construction or utility \n        material;\n            (9) an historical marker;\n            (10) a grave marker or cemetery urn or vase;\n            (11) a utility access cover; or\n            (12) a bulk container for beer with a capacity of 7.75 \n        gallons or more.\n    (b) Record Keeping.--\n            (1) In general.--A secondary metal recycling agent shall \n        maintain a written or electronic record of each secondary metal \n        purchase.
