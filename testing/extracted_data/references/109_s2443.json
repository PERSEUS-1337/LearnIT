After disaggregation each \n        item shall be treated as a separate bill to be considered as \n        provided in subsection (b). The remainder of the bill not so \n        disaggregated shall constitute a separate bill and shall be \n        considered with the other disaggregated bills pursuant to \n        subsection (b).\n            (2) Form.--A bill that is required to be disaggregated into \n        separate bills pursuant to paragraph (1)--\n                    (A) shall be disaggregated without substantive \n                revision; and\n                    (B) shall bear the designation of the measure of \n                which it was an item prior to such disaggregation, \n                together with such other designation as may be \n                necessary to distinguish such measure from other \n                measures disaggregated pursuant to paragraph (1) with \n                respect to the same measure.\n    (b) Procedure.--The new bills resulting from the disaggregation \ndescribed in subsection (a)(1) shall be immediately placed on the \nappropriate calendar in the House of origination, and upon passage, \nplaced on the appropriate calendar in the other House.
