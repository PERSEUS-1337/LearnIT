CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds and declares that:\n            (1) Adequate credit is necessary for the revitalization and \n        growth for all sectors of our economy.\n            (2) Financial institutions are subject to layers of \n        unnecessary regulations, some of which, impose large costs \n        without increasing the safety and soundness of our financial \n        system.\n            (3) The regulatory burden amounts to a tax on our financial \n        systems that has been estimated by the Federal Financial \n        Institutions Examination Council to be as high as \n        $17,000,000,000.\n            (4) This regulatory burden cost is draining capital from \n        financial institutions and significantly contributing to the \n        lack of available credit for small business.\n            (5) The lack of available credit for small businesses \n        hampers the growth of small businesses and is directly \n        contributing to the high rate of unemployment in the United \n        States.\n            (6) The overwhelming majority of new jobs are created by \n        small businesses in the United States.\n            (7) The President should be given the authority to provide \n        financial institutions with relief from this regulatory burden \n        in order to provide immediate credit relief to all sectors of \n        the economy, especially credit worthy small businesses and to \n        sustain economic growth.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to authorize the President to increase the availability \n        of credit,\n            (2) to enhance the economic recovery, and\n            (3) to provide sustained noninflationary economic growth,\nthrough the immediate suspension of laws, rules, regulations, and \nguidelines that impose unnecessarily burdensome costs on insured \ndepository institutions.\n\nSEC. 4.
