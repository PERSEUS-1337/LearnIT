Review of status and future of production agriculture.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS, POLICY, AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A sound and prosperous economy in the United States is \n        dependent on American agriculture and related industries, \n        including producers, processors, handlers, manufacturers, \n        marketers, transporters, and the banking and credit industry.\n            (2) American agriculture and related industries account for \n        over 21,000,000 jobs and approximately 16 percent, or over \n        $41,000,000,000,000, of the gross domestic product.\n            (3) Because of the combined effort of American agriculture \n        and related industries, consumers in the United States enjoy a \n        dependable supply of food and fiber at fair prices.\n            (4) The future of American agriculture is dependent on the \n        continued viability of the American agricultural producer, the \n        underpinning of the national economy.\n            (5) Agricultural producers must receive a fair return on \n        their productivity and investment in an industry characterized \n        by continued subsidized foreign competition and wide \n        fluctuations in production and prices due to weather and \n        related factors.\n            (6) One of the essential elements of a sound agricultural \n        economy is the ability of the United States to compete in the \n        world market.\n            (7) Exports of United States agricultural commodities are \n        expected to reach nearly $50,000,000,000 in 1995 and contribute \n        about $20,000,000,000 to the United States balance of trade.\n            (8) Agricultural exports account for over 1,000,000 \n        American jobs.\n            (9) Commodity Credit Corporation outlays for farm programs \n        have declined from a high of approximately $26,000,000,000 for \n        fiscal year 1986 to less than $9,000,000,000 for fiscal year \n        1995, a reduction of over 65 percent that is unique among the \n        many mandatory spending programs of the Federal Government.\n            (10) According to the Congressional Budget Office, farm \n        program outlays are projected to remain below the outlay level \n        for fiscal year 1995 for the next 5 years and continue to \n        decline by nearly 8 percent, even if no changes are made in \n        current law for existing farm programs.\n    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that--\n            (1) continued Federal Government support is necessary to \n        provide stability for American agricultural producers to--\n                    (A) enable the producers to continue to provide \n                consumers with a steady and dependable supply of food \n                and fiber at fair prices;\n                    (B) enhance farmer and rancher profitability;\n                    (C) encourage young farmers to stay on the farm;\n                    (D) maintain the competitiveness of the United \n                States in the world market; and\n                    (E) otherwise preserve the underpinnings of a sound \n                agricultural economy; and\n            (2) reductions in farm program spending should be made in a \n        fair and equitable manner in order to meet the objective of \n        achieving a balanced budget for the Federal Government in a \n        manner consistent with paragraph (1).\n    (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish agricultural \nprice support and production adjustment programs for the 1996 through \n2002 crop years that provide a structure for a sound agricultural \neconomy in a manner consistent with subsection (b).\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ENDING THE FEDERAL DEFICIT.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the continuation of significant Federal budgetary \n        deficits harms the economic well-being of the United States and \n        is detrimental to the development of sound, long-term \n        agricultural policy;\n            (2) agricultural price support and production adjustment \n        programs are necessary for the continued economic health of \n        United States agriculture, which must compete in international \n        markets against subsidized foreign competition; and\n            (3) agricultural price support and production adjustment \n        programs should be--\n                    (A) implemented, to the maximum extent practicable, \n                in a manner that is consistent with the primary goal of \n                the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n                1996 (H. Con. Res. 67, agreed to June 29, 1995) to end \n                Federal budget deficits; and\n                    (B) modified, as necessary, to ensure that the \n                programs comply with applicable budget reconciliation \n                instructions in the concurrent resolution that are \n                designed to end Federal budget deficits, in a manner \n                consistent with section 306 of the concurrent \n                resolution.\n\nSEC. 4.
