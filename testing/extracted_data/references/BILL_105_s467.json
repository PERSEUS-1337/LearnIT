REASONS FOR ADVERSE ACTIONS.\n\n    An insurer that takes an action that adversely affects a subject of \nabuse, shall advise the subject of abuse applicant or insured of the \nspecific reasons for the action in writing. Reference to general \nunderwriting practices or guidelines does not constitute a specific \nreason.\n\nSEC. 6. LIFE INSURANCE.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit a life insurer \nfrom declining to issue a life insurance policy if the applicant or \nprospective owner of the policy is or would be designated as a \nbeneficiary of the policy, and if--\n            (1) the applicant or prospective owner of the policy lacks \n        an insurable interest in the insured; or\n            (2) the applicant or prospective owner of the policy is \n        known, on the basis of police or court records, to have \n        committed an act of abuse against the proposed insured.\n\nSEC. 7.

ENFORCEMENT.\n\n    (a) Federal Trade Commission.--The Federal Trade Commission shall \nhave the power to examine and investigate any insurer to determine \nwhether such insurer has been or is engaged in any act or practice \nprohibited by this Act. If the Federal Trade Commission determines an \ninsurer has been or is engaged in any act or practice prohibited by \nthis Act, the Commission may take action against such insurer by the \nissuance of a cease and desist order as if the insurer was in violation \nof section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Such cease and desist \norder may include any individual relief warranted under the \ncircumstances, including temporary, preliminary, and permanent \ninjunctive and compensatory relief.\n    (b) Private Cause of Action.--An applicant or insured who believes \nthat the applicant or insured has been adversely affected by an act or \npractice of an insurer in violation of this Act may maintain an action \nagainst the insurer in a Federal or State court of original \njurisdiction. Upon proof of such conduct by a preponderance of the \nevidence, the court may award appropriate relief, including temporary, \npreliminary, and permanent injunctive relief and compensatory and \npunitive damages, as well as the costs of suit and reasonable fees for \nthe aggrieved individual's attorneys and expert witnesses. With respect \nto compensatory damages, the aggrieved individual may elect, at any \ntime prior to the rendering of final judgment, to recover in lieu of \nactual damages, an award of statutory damages in the amount of $5,000 \nfor each violation.\n\nSEC. 9.
