FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Federal regulations advance many important goals, \n        including protecting the environment and the health and safety \n        of all Americans.\n            (2) For regulations to effectively protect the public and \n        promote the public interest, the fact of their existence and \n        what they mean must be available to the persons and entities \n        willing to investigate what the law and regulations require.\n            (3) Fairness also requires that a person should be able to \n        learn of regulations and of their meanings before they can be \n        sanctioned for violating them.\n            (4) Fairness also should prevent a person from being \n        sanctioned for violating a regulation if an official has misled \n        the person as to what the regulation prohibits or requires and \n        the person has reasonably relied upon such misleading \n        information.\n            (5) The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment gives \n        Americans a right to have access to regulations and the \n        opportunity to learn their meanings before such regulations can \n        be the basis for depriving them of liberty or property.\n            (6) Effective procedures for protecting this right can \n        improve the effectiveness of regulation, foster the sense that \n        regulations are fairly enforced, and ensure that the right to \n        due process actually benefits Americans.\n            (7) Ensuring that agencies give Americans access to \n        regulations, the opportunity to learn their meanings, and \n        access to accurate information about them before any sanction \n        can be imposed will encourage agencies to make regulatory \n        requirements clearly known, will encourage people and entities \n        to learn what regulations require of them, and will foster \n        legality, fairness, and justice in the enforcement of Federal \n        regulations.\n\nSEC. 3. BAN ON IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS BY AGENCIES IN CERTAIN \n              CIRCUMSTANCES.\n\n    Section 558 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding at \nthe end the following new subsection:\n    ``(d)(1) No sanction shall be imposed on a person by an agency for \na violation of a rule if the agency finds any one of the following:\n            ``(A) The rule was not--\n                    ``(i) printed in the Code of Federal Regulations;\n                    ``(ii) printed in the Federal Register;\n                    ``(iii) known to the person; or\n                    ``(iv) knowable to a person who has engaged in a \n                reasonable, good faith investigation of the rules \n                applicable to the conduct that allegedly violated the \n                rule.\n            ``(B) The rule failed to give the person fair warning of \n        the conduct that the rule prohibits or requires.\n            ``(C) With respect only to a retrospective sanction, the \n        person acted in reasonable reliance upon written \n        representations about what the rule prohibits or requires which \n        were issued by the agency or an official with actual or \n        apparent authority to interpret, administer, or enforce the \n        rule.\n    ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, an agency shall find that a \nrule gives fair warning of the conduct that the rule prohibits or \nrequires if a reasonable person, acting in good faith, would be able to \nidentify, with reasonable certainty, the standards with which the rule \nrequires the person's conduct to conform.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
