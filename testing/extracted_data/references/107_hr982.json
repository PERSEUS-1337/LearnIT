FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On June 10, 1999, the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization (NATO) military air operation in the former \n        Yugoslavia concluded with the withdrawal of all Serbian police, \n        paramilitary, and military forces from Kosovo, a province of \n        Serbia.\n            (2) On June 9, 1999, the NATO-led international security \n        force for Kosovo, KFOR, and the Governments of the Federal \n        Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia concluded a \n        Military Technical Agreement which, among other things, created \n        a five kilometer (three mile) Ground Safety Zone (GSZ) \n        extending from the boundary of Kosovo into southern Serbia in \n        which forces, except regular police, of the Federal Republic of \n        Yugoslavia or Serbia were excluded from entering without the \n        express permission of the commander of KFOR.\n            (3) During the winter of 1999-2000, incidents involving the \n        infiltration from Kosovo into southern Serbia within the GSZ of \n        ethnic Albanian guerrilla forces, designated as the Liberation \n        Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac (UCPMB), were reported \n        by KFOR.\n            (4) The declared objective of the UCPMB is the liberation \n        of the ethnic Albanian population of southern Serbia from the \n        authority of the Governments of Serbia and the Federal Republic \n        of Yugoslavia.\n            (5) The tactics utilized by the UCPMB include the \n        assassination of Serbian police operating legally within the \n        GSZ and the intimidation of Serbian residents in order to \n        induce them to leave the region.\n            (6) On December 17, 2000, United States and Russian \n        Federation troops serving in KFOR who were patrolling the \n        boundary with Serbia in order to interdict the smuggling of \n        arms came under attack by ethnic Albanians attempting to \n        infiltrate into the GSZ from Kosovo.\n            (7) The Government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of \n        Macedonia (Macedonia), a coalition that includes \n        representatives of the ethnic Albanian minority in Macedonia, \n        has taken steps acknowledged and applauded by the international \n        community as well as leaders of the Albanians in Kosovo to \n        establish normal relations with Kosovo.\n            (8) On February 26, 2001, fighting erupted along the border \n        between Serbia and Macedonia in the Macedonian village of \n        Tanusevci between the Macedonian Army and ethnic Albanians.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY.\n\n    It shall be the policy of the United States Government--\n            (1) to promote a dialog between legitimate representatives \n        of the Albanian community of southern Serbia and the \n        authorities of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic \n        of Yugoslavia aimed at addressing the concerns of both the \n        ethnic Albanian residents of the region and those of the \n        Serbian authorities;\n            (2) to address the deteriorating security situation in the \n        Presevo valley of southern Serbia in conjunction with the North \n        Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the NATO-led international \n        security force for Kosovo (KFOR), and the Serbian authorities;\n            (3) to urge the authorities of the Federal Republic of \n        Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia to work with the \n        Government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia \n        (Macedonia) to find agreement on a complete demarcation of the \n        border between Serbia and Macedonia;\n            (4) to support efforts of the Federal Republic of \n        Yugoslavia, Republic of Serbia and the Government of Macedonia \n        to maintain security along the agreed upon border;\n            (5) to support the establishment of an international \n        observation and monitoring presence along the Serbian-\n        Macedonian border should such presence be requested by the \n        concerned parties; and\n            (6) to oppose any modification of the political status of \n        the Province of Kosovo unless and until--\n                    (A) all ethnically motivated violence by Kosovo \n                Albanians against Serbian residents of Kosovo has \n                subsided; and\n                    (B) all assistance by citizens or residents of \n                Kosovo to parties using violent means to further \n                separatist aims in southern Serbia or Macedonia has \n                ceased.\n\nSEC. 4.
