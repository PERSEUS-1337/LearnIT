FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--\n            (1) Current circumstances.--Congress finds the following:\n                    (A) Immunizations are among the most cost-effective \n                means of preventing disease.\n                    (B) Although Federal support for childhood \n                immunizations has been in existence since 1962, the \n                full potential of immunizations remains to be achieved. \n                Enactment and enforcement of school immunization \n                requirements have resulted in excellent immunization \n                levels (96 percent or greater) in school children. \n                However, approximately 80 percent of vaccine doses \n                should be received before the second birthday in order \n                to protect children during their most vulnerable \n                periods. Many children do not receive their basic \n                immunizations by that time, and in some inner cities as \n                few as 10 percent of 2-year-olds have received a \n                complete series. This low level of immunizations has \n                been reflected in recent years by outbreaks of measles \n                among inadequately immunized preschool children.\n                    (C) The childhood immunization services delivery \n                infrastructure is both public and private. There is \n                considerable evidence to suggest that the private \n                infrastructure has been eroded over the past decade as \n                a result of the significantly increased cost of \n                privately purchased vaccines.\n                    (D) Prices for privately purchased vaccines exceed \n                the prices paid for like vaccines in some other \n                industrialized nations by over 2500 percent.\n                    (E) High vaccine costs, coupled with the growing \n                number of uninsured and underinsured families, has \n                resulted in private physicians increasingly referring \n                their private-pay patients to overburdened public \n                clinics for vaccinations.\n                    (F) Eleven States now have programs that provide \n                vaccines without charge to both public and private \n                health care providers. Other States that have sought to \n                establish such programs have been denied additional \n                discounted vaccines by manufacturers.\n                    (G) There is no evidence to suggest that a \n                negotiated price that takes into account the reasonable \n                cost of production, marketing, research and \n                development, and distribution will not fairly \n                compensate vaccine manufacturers. Indeed, a recent \n                report by the Congressional Office of Technology \n                Assessment supports the proposition that negotiated \n                rates can assure fair compensation while holding down \n                costs.\n                    (H) The Secretary of Health and Human Services has \n                experience negotiating vaccine purchase through the \n                Federal contract system.\n                    (I) The National Vaccine Injury Compensation \n                Program is an essential element in a comprehensive \n                immunization program and should be applied to \n                additional vaccines recommended for universal use in \n                children.\n            (2) Needed actions.--With respect to actions necessary to \n        ensure the full immunization of children at the earliest \n        possible age, Congress finds the following:\n                    (A) The Federal Government should purchase and \n                provide free of charge to health care providers \n                vaccines recommended for universal use in children. \n                This action will not only remove financial barriers to \n                immunization that impede children from being vaccinated \n                at the appropriate time, but will also facilitate the \n                development of an immunization tracking system.\n                    (B) The Federal Government and the States should \n                develop linked registries to track the immunization \n                status of the Nation's children. The registry system \n                should have the capability to notify parents of \n                inadequately immunized children of the need to protect \n                their children with specific vaccines.\n                    (C) The coordinated national information and \n                education outreach initiative operated through the \n                Department of Health and Human Services should be \n                sustained to bring needed information to parents and \n                health care providers and focus their attention on the \n                importance of achieving the full and timely \n                immunization of children at the earliest appropriate \n                age.\n                    (D) Private and public health insurers should be \n                encouraged to provide adequate reimbursement for the \n                administration of childhood vaccines.\n                    (E) Volunteer community activities to promote the \n                full immunization of children at the earliest \n                appropriate age should be encouraged.\n                    (F) The National Vaccine Injury Compensation \n                Program should be extended and improved. Vaccine \n                information materials should be simplified to ensure \n                that parents can understand the benefits and risks of \n                vaccines.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to ensure that all \nchildren in the United States are fully immunized against vaccine \npreventable infectious diseases at the earliest appropriate age.\n\nSEC. 3.
