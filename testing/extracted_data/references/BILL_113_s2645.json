FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Overdoses from opioids have increased dramatically in \n        the United States.\n            (2) Deaths from drug overdose, largely from prescription \n        pain relievers, have tripled among men and increased five-fold \n        among women over the past decade.\n            (3) Nationwide, drug overdoses now claim more lives than \n        car accidents.\n            (4) Opioid addiction is a chronic disease that, untreated, \n        places a large burden on the healthcare system. Roughly 475,000 \n        emergency room visits each year are attributable to the misuse \n        and abuse of opioid pain medication.\n            (5) Effective medication-assisted treatment for opioid \n        addiction can decrease overdose deaths, be cost-effective, \n        reduce transmissions of HIV and viral hepatitis, and reduce \n        other social harms such as criminal activity.\n            (6) Effective medication-assisted treatment programs for \n        opioid addiction should include multiple components, including \n        medications, cognitive and behavioral supports and \n        interventions, and drug testing.\n            (7) Effective medication-assisted treatment programs for \n        opioid addiction may use a team of staff members, in addition \n        to a prescribing provider, to deliver comprehensive care.\n            (8) Access to medication-assisted treatments, including \n        office-based buprenorphine opioid treatment, remains limited in \n        part due to current practice regulations and an insufficient \n        number of providers.\n            (9) More than 10 years of experience in the United States \n        with office-based buprenorphine opioid treatment has informed \n        best practices for delivering successful, high quality care.\n\nSEC. 3. EXPANSION OF PATIENT LIMITS UNDER WAIVER.\n\n    Section 303(g)(2)(B) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n823(g)(2)(B)) is amended--\n            (1) in clause (i), by striking ``physician'' and inserting \n        ``practitioner'';\n            (2) in clause (iii)--\n                    (A) by striking ``30'' and inserting ``100''; and\n                    (B) by striking ``, unless, not sooner'' and all \n                that follows through the end and inserting a period; \n                and\n            (3) by inserting at the end the following new clause:\n                    ``(iv) Not earlier than 1 year after the date on \n                which a qualifying practitioner obtained an initial \n                waiver pursuant to clause (iii), the qualifying \n                practitioner may submit a second notification to the \n                Secretary of the need and intent of the qualifying \n                practitioner to treat an unlimited number of patients, \n                if the qualifying practitioner--\n                            ``(I)(aa) satisfies the requirements of \n                        item (aa), (bb), (cc), or (dd) of subparagraph \n                        (G)(ii)(I); and\n                            ``(bb) agrees to fully participate in the \n                        Prescription Drug Monitoring Program of the \n                        State in which the qualifying practitioner is \n                        licensed, pursuant to applicable State \n                        guidelines; or\n                            ``(II)(aa) satisfies the requirements of \n                        item (ee), (ff), or (gg) of subparagraph \n                        (G)(ii)(I);\n                            ``(bb) agrees to fully participate in the \n                        Prescription Drug Monitoring Program of the \n                        State in which the qualifying practitioner is \n                        licensed, pursuant to applicable State \n                        guidelines;\n                            ``(cc) practices in a qualified practice \n                        setting; and\n                            ``(dd) has completed not less than 24 hours \n                        of training (through classroom situations, \n                        seminars at professional society meetings, \n                        electronic communications, or otherwise) with \n                        respect to the treatment and management of \n                        opiate-dependent patients for substance use \n                        disorders provided by the American Society of \n                        Addiction Medicine, the American Academy of \n                        Addiction Psychiatry, the American Medical \n                        Association, the American Osteopathic \n                        Association, the American Psychiatric \n                        Association, or any other organization that the \n                        Secretary determines is appropriate for \n                        purposes of this subclause.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
