    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Child Care Consolidation and \nInvestment Act of 1995''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) fragmentation of the Federal Government's major child \n        care assistance programs has left gaps for many parents moving \n        from welfare to work;\n            (2) child care problems have prevented 34 percent of poor \n        mothers between the ages 21 and 29 from working;\n            (3) \\2/3\\ of all families receiving assistance under the \n        Aid to Families with Dependent Children program have at least \n        one preschool age child and need child care in order to work;\n            (4) there already exists an unmet need for child care \n        assistance--37 States now have waiting lists that can run as \n        high as 35,000 individuals;\n            (5) child care directly affects an individual's ability to \n        stay in the work force;\n            (6) welfare reform that places work at its center will \n        increase the demand for child care and require an additional \n        investment of resources;\n            (7) child care consumes $260 per month or about 27 percent \n        of income for average working poor families, leaving them with \n        less income than families eligible for assistance under the Aid \n        to Families with Dependent Children program;\n            (8) quality must be a central feature of the child care \n        policy of the United States;\n            (9) only 1 in 7 day care centers offer good quality care;\n            (10) 40 percent of day care centers serving infants and \n        toddlers do not meet basic sanitary conditions, have safety \n        problems, and do not encourage learning; and\n            (11) only 9 percent of family and relative day care is \n        considered good quality care.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) eliminate program fragmentation and create a seamless \n        system of high quality child care that allows for continuity of \n        care for children as parents move from welfare to job training \n        to work;\n            (2) provide for parental choice among high quality child \n        care programs; and\n            (3) increase the availability of high quality affordable \n        child care in order to promote self sufficiency and support \n        working families.\n\nSEC. 4.
