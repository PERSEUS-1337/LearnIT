FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.\n\n    Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) Congress does not intend, and has never intended, to \n        permit foreign nationals to make political contributions or \n        donations to any candidate for local, State, or Federal public \n        office in the United States or to any political party in the \n        United States, directly or indirectly, or to support or \n        participate in the activities of political committees \n        established pursuant to the Federal Election Campaign Act of \n        1971;\n            (2) to this end, section 319 of the Federal Election \n        Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 441e) makes it ``unlawful for a \n        foreign national directly or through another person to make any \n        contribution of money or other thing of value . . . in \n        connection with'' any election to political office or \n        proceeding to select a political candidate;\n            (3) despite this statutory prohibition, its applicability \n        to certain donations by foreign nationals to accounts of \n        political parties has recently been questioned;\n            (4) on October 9, 1998, the United States District Court \n        for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed portions of a \n        criminal indictment against Yah Lin Trie, in United States v. \n        Yah Lin Trie, based on a judicial determination that the \n        prohibition on political contributions by foreign nationals \n        established by section 319 of the Federal Election Campaign Act \n        of 1971 does not clearly prohibit all political contributions \n        by foreign nationals, particularly, donations by foreign \n        nationals to United States political party accounts not made \n        ``in connection with'' an election or primary; and\n            (5) it is the intent of Congress and this Act to reaffirm \n        that foreign nationals may not make any donation of money or \n        other thing of value to any United States candidate, political \n        committee or party account, directly or indirectly and whether \n        or not made ``in connection with'' an election or primary.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF CERTAIN ELECTION-RELATED ACTIVITIES BY FOREIGN \n              NATIONALS.\n\n    Section 319 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. \n441e) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (h);\n            (2) by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:\n    ``(a) It shall be unlawful for a foreign national directly or \nthrough any other person to make any contribution or donation, or to \npromise expressly or impliedly to make any such contribution or \ndonation, to any candidate for political office, any political \ncommittee, or any organization or account created or controlled by any \nUnited States political party or candidate, including but not limited \nto contributions or donations made in connection with any election to \nany political office or in connection with any primary election, \nconvention, or caucus held to select candidates for any political \noffice.''; and\n            (3) by inserting after subsection (a) the following new \n        subsections:\n    ``(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to solicit, accept, or \nreceive any contribution or donation prohibited under subsection (a).\n    ``(c) It shall be unlawful for any person organized under or \ncreated by the laws of the United States or of any State or other place \nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States to make any \ncontribution to any candidate for political office, or to make any \ncontribution or donation to any political committee or to any \norganization or account created or controlled by any United States \npolitical party, unless such contribution or donation (as the case may \nbe) is derived solely from funds generated from such person's own \nbusiness activities in the United States.\n    ``(d) A foreign national shall not direct, dictate, control, or \ndirectly or indirectly participate in the decision-making process of \nany person organized under or created by the laws of the United States \nor any State or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United \nStates with regard to--\n            ``(1) any decisionmaking concerning the administration of a \n        political committee;\n            ``(2) the making of any contributions or expenditures to or \n        on behalf of any candidate for political office; or\n            ``(3) the making of any contributions, donations, or \n        expenditures to or on behalf of any political committee, or to \n        or on behalf of any organization or account created or \n        controlled by any United States political party.\n    ``(e) Nothing in this Act may be construed to prohibit any \nindividual eligible to vote in an election for Federal office from \nmaking contributions, donations, or expenditures in support of a \ncandidate for such an election (including voluntary contributions or \nexpenditures made through a separate segregated fund established by the \nindividual's employer or labor organization) or otherwise participating \nin any campaign for such an election in the same manner and to the same \nextent as any other individual eligible to vote in an election for such \noffice.\n    ``(f) As used in this section, the term `donation' means money or \nany other thing of value (other than a contribution) which is given to \na candidate for public office, political committee, or organization or \naccount created or controlled by any United States political party.''."
