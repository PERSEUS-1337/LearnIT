FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION ALLOCATION AND ALLOTMENT OF \n              SPECTRUM.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Commission shall ensure that spectrum \nallocation and assignment produce a balance between radio frequency \nbands available for--\n            (1) exclusive licensing through an auction; and\n            (2) unlicensed operations.\n    (b) Rulemaking.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Commission shall--\n            (1) promulgate rules to implement subsection (a), including \n        establishing a process that will achieve the mandate under \n        subsection (a) in the future allocation and assignment of radio \n        frequency bands; and\n            (2) consider whether to adopt rules that permit unlicensed \n        operations in spectrum assigned by auction until the licensee \n        brings the spectrum into use by initiating commercial service.\n    (c) Inclusion in Service Rules.--The Commission shall include in \nthe service rules of an auction for spectrum any rules promulgated \nunder subsection (b).\n    (d) Inclusion in Reports.--The Commission shall ensure that each \nreport submitted to Congress under section 1006 of the Bipartisan \nBudget Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-74; 129 Stat. 584) reflects the \nrulemaking required under this section.\n\nSEC. 4. NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR UNLICENSED SPECTRUM.\n\n    (a) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States \nto--\n            (1) maximize the utility of the spectrum resources of the \n        United States;\n            (2) advance innovation and investment in wireless broadband \n        services; and\n            (3) promote a balanced spectrum policy that makes adequate \n        spectrum resources available for both licensed and unlicensed \n        technologies.\n    (b) National Strategy.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Commission, in consultation with the \nAssistant Secretary, shall develop a national strategy for making \nadditional radio frequency bands available for unlicensed operations.\n    (c) Considerations.--The strategy developed under subsection (b) \nshall include--\n            (1) identification of proposed radio frequency bands to be \n        cleared of incumbent users to permit use by devices conducting \n        unlicensed operations;\n            (2) consideration of a balanced approach that ensures that \n        consumers have access to additional low-, mid-, and high-band \n        radio frequency spectrum to conduct unlicensed operations;\n            (3) consideration of rules to permit spectrum sharing to \n        make available additional radio frequency ranges for unlicensed \n        operations, including--\n                    (A) expanding utilization of the spectrum sharing \n                model implemented by the Commission for the spectrum \n                between 3550 and 3650 megahertz;\n                    (B) allowing underlay unlicensed operations in \n                spectrum allocated for other services in a manner that \n                does not cause harmful interference to licensees; and\n                    (C) any other spectrum sharing approach that the \n                Commission finds will--\n                            (i) expand opportunities for unlicensed \n                        operations in a spectrum band; or\n                            (ii) otherwise improve spectrum \n                        utilization;\n            (4) examination of additional ways to improve the accuracy \n        and efficacy of existing and planned databases or spectrum \n        access systems designed to promote spectrum sharing and access \n        to spectrum for unlicensed operations; and\n            (5) consideration of the extent to which additional bands \n        used for unlicensed operations may be harmonized to achieve \n        greater economies of scale.\n    (d) Report Required.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to the \n        appropriate committees of Congress a report that describes the \n        strategy developed under subsection (b), including any \n        recommendations for legislative change.\n            (2) Publication on commission website.--Not later than the \n        date on which the Commission submits the report under paragraph \n        (1), the Commission shall make the report publicly available on \n        the website of the Commission.\n\nSEC. 5.
