FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Small businesses in underserved areas have for \n        generations been unable to access affordable credit.\n            (2) The financial crisis of 2008 only served to exacerbate \n        efforts by entrepreneurs to access capital for the purpose of \n        creating jobs and improving economic outcomes in the community.\n            (3) The Create Jobs for USA campaign by Starbucks Coffee \n        Company and Opportunity Finance Network, through community \n        development financial institutions, will provide loans to \n        underserved small businesses and microenterprises to create and \n        sustain jobs throughout America. This will allow Americans to \n        help Americans create and sustain jobs, but will not be enough \n        to help our Nation's small businesses.\n            (4) Small business investments revitalize communities by \n        creating jobs but also contribute to the local tax base, which \n        helps finance investments in schools, hospitals, \n        infrastructure, and public safety.\n            (5) The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, \n        an agency of the Federal Government located within the United \n        States Department of the Treasury, has reported that in 2010 \n        alone, community development financial institutions awardees \n        originated loans or investments totaling more than $1 billion, \n        and financed almost 18,000 affordable housing units; more than \n        5,200 business and microenterprise loans; and created or \n        maintained over 25,000 jobs and leveraged $1.5 billion in \n        private investment.\n            (6) The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund \n        awardees have almost tripled jobs created since 2007, making \n        almost 14,000 loans to small businesses on average each year, \n        representing an average investment of close to $1 billion \n        annually.\n            (7) The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund \n        is well placed to complement the Create Jobs for USA campaign \n        through careful, targeted investments in community development \n        financial institutions for the purposes of improving economic \n        outcomes for underserved families across the country.\n\nSEC. 3.
