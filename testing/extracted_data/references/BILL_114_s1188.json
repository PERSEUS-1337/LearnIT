FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The terrorist organization known as the Islamic State \n        of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) poses a grave threat to the \n        people and territorial integrity of Iraq and Syria, as well as \n        regional stability, and to the national security interests of \n        the United States and its allies and partners.\n            (2) The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant holds \n        significant territory in Iraq and Syria, has stated its \n        intention to seize more territory, and has demonstrated the \n        capability to do so.\n            (3) Leaders of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \n        have stated that they intend to conduct terrorist attacks \n        internationally, including against the United States, its \n        citizens, and its interests.\n            (4) The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has committed \n        despicable acts of violence and mass executions against \n        Muslims, regardless of sect, who do not subscribe to its \n        depraved, violent, and oppressive ideology, and has threatened \n        genocide and committed vicious acts of violence against \n        religious and ethnic minority groups, including Iraqi \n        Christian, Yezidi, and Turkmen populations.\n            (5) The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has targeted \n        innocent women and girls with horrific acts of violence, \n        including abduction, enslavement, torture, rape, and forced \n        marriage.\n            (6) According to United States intelligence estimates, \n        approximately 20,000 to 30,000 Islamic State of Iraq and the \n        Levant fighters operate in Iraq and Syria, an estimated 3,000 \n        of whom are believed to hold passports from western countries.\n            (7) The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant finances its \n        operations primarily through looting, smuggling, taxes, oil \n        sales, kidnapping, and human trafficking.\n            (8) President Barack Obama articulated five lines of effort \n        in the campaign to counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the \n        Levant, including supporting regional military partners, \n        stopping the flow of foreign fighters, cutting off the access \n        of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant to financing, \n        addressing urgent humanitarian needs, and exposing the true \n        nature of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\n            (9) As a result of advances by the Islamic State of Iraq \n        and the Levant in Iraq and Syria, approximately half of the \n        nearly 2,000,000 refugees and internally displaced people from \n        Syria and Iraq have taken refuge in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region \n        in northern Iraq.\n            (10) The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) is the \n        democratically elected government of the Iraqi Kurdistan \n        Region, and Iraqi Kurds have been a reliable, stable, and \n        capable partner of the United States, particularly in support \n        of United States military and civilian personnel during \n        Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn.\n            (11) The Iraqi constitution guarantees the right of Iraqi \n        regions, such as the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, to maintain \n        ``internal security forces for the region such as police, \n        security forces, and guards of the region''.\n            (12) The Kurdish Peshmerga forces are officially organized \n        under the Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs and commanded by the \n        Minister of Peshmerga Affairs, who reports to the President of \n        the Kurdistan Regional Government.\n            (13) The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has \n        positioned its forces along a 650-mile border spanning five \n        Iraqi provinces and engaged in attacks on Peshmerga forces \n        defending the border.\n            (14) The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has employed \n        captured armored vehicles, long-range artillery, and heavy \n        weapons in attacking Kurdish forces along the border.\n            (15) Kurdish Peshmerga forces have successfully retaken key \n        areas of Iraq formerly controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq \n        and the Levant, including Mount Sinjar, Mosul Dam, and Kirkuk.\n            (16) The United States and its allies have provided the \n        resupply of various arms (including Hellfire missiles, anti-\n        tank weapons, helmets and body armor, and ammunition) and \n        training to Peshmerga forces since June 2014.\n            (17) Such resupply efforts, to comply with United States \n        law, must be approved and coordinated through the Government of \n        Iraq.\n            (18) Masrour Barzani, the Chancellor of the Kurdistan \n        Region Security Council, described Peshmerga forces as \n        ``overstretched'' in the fight against the Islamic State of \n        Iraq and the Levant, and Bayan Sami Abdul Rahman, the \n        representative of the Kurdistan Regional Government to the \n        United States, has expressed concern about ``shortfalls'' in \n        equipment.\n            (19) According to the Kurdistan Regional Government, more \n        than 1,000 Kurdish Peshmerga and Kurdish security forces have \n        been killed, and more than 5,000 have been wounded.\n            (20) A strong Peshmerga force is essential to countering \n        the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant to Iraq, \n        the region, and United States interests.\n\nSEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) poses \n        an acute threat to the people and territorial integrity of \n        Iraq, including the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, and the security \n        and stability of the Middle East and the world;\n            (2) defeating the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is \n        critical to maintaining a unified Iraq in which all faiths, \n        sects, and ethnicities are afforded equal protection and full \n        integration into the Government and society of Iraq; and\n            (3) any outstanding issues between the Government of Iraq \n        and the Kurdistan Regional Government should be resolved by the \n        two parties expeditiously to allow for a resumption of normal \n        relations.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to directly provide Kurdistan \nRegional Government military and security forces associated with the \nGovernment of Iraq with defense articles, defense services, and related \ntraining, on an emergency and temporary basis, to more effectively \npartner with the United States and other international coalition \nmembers to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).\n\nSEC. 4.
