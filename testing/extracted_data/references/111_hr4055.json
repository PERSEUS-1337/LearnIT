    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Honest Opportunity Probation with \nEnforcement (HOPE) Initiative Act of 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Crime continues to inflict a severe cost on victims and \n        communities across the country.\n            (2) Criminal apprehension and punishment similarly impose \n        substantial costs on taxpayers, with States spending over \n        $50,000,000,000 on corrections in fiscal year 2008, accounting \n        for 1 in every 15 State general fund dollars.\n            (3) A substantial amount of crime, and a substantial share \n        of prison occupancy, is directly tied to illicit drug \n        consumption. A relatively small group of chronic drug users \n        consumes the vast majority of cocaine, heroin, and \n        methamphetamine in the United States, and approximately three-\n        quarters of this group pass through the criminal justice system \n        at some point. Consequently, reducing drug consumption in the \n        United States requires effectively addressing the drug habits \n        of supervised offenders.\n            (4) One in 100 adults is behind bars, and 1 in 31 is under \n        some form of criminal justice supervision, including probation \n        and parole. Of the 7,300,000 individuals in the United States \n        who are under criminal justice supervision, the majority \n        (4,300,000) are serving a term of probation in their \n        communities, in lieu of serving time behind bars.\n            (5) The failure of individuals serving terms of probation \n        to successfully complete such terms is a major contributor to \n        prison admissions. In 2007, more than 250,000 such individuals \n        were admitted to prison. Consequently, controlling drug use by \n        individuals who are serving a period of probation reduces both \n        national drug consumption and crime rates, and reduces taxpayer \n        burdens.\n            (6) Innovations in offender supervision prove that swift, \n        certain, and graduated sanctions for noncompliance can reduce \n        drug use, new crimes, and revocation to incarceration.\n            (7) Hawaii's Opportunity Probation with Enforcement (HOPE) \n        initiative, an offender supervision program to reduce probation \n        violations by drug and other high-risk offenders using a \n        structured sanctions model, has been shown to be highly \n        successful at reducing drug use, crime, and recidivism.\n            (8) According to an article in the Journal of the American \n        Medical Association in August of 2009, if the HOPE initiative \n        was replicated effectively in multiple jurisdictions, the \n        program might have broader benefits beyond assisting \n        probationer participants at risk for heavy drug use, such as \n        helping to shrink the market for illegal drugs and the profits \n        of drug trafficking organizations.\n\nSEC. 3. HOPE INITIATIVE GRANTS.\n\n    (a) Program Established.--\n            (1) In general.--The Attorney General may establish a \n        competitive demonstration grant program to award grants to \n        State, tribal, and local courts to establish probation programs \n        that reduce drug use, crime, and recidivism by requiring swift, \n        predictable, and graduated sanctions for noncompliance with the \n        conditions of probation, as determined by the Attorney General.\n            (2) Number and selection of grants.--\n                    (A) Number.--The Attorney General shall have the \n                discretion to award not more than 20 grants under this \n                section.\n                    (B) Selection.--The Attorney General shall ensure \n                that such grants are awarded in a manner that promotes \n                the strongest proposals, evaluation designs, and \n                geographic diversity of the demonstration programs \n                under this section.\n    (b) Application.--To be eligible for a grant under this section, a \nState, tribal, or local court shall, in addition to any other \nrequirements required by the Attorney General, submit to the Attorney \nGeneral an application that--\n            (1) describes the program to be assisted under this section \n        and the need for such program;\n            (2) describes a long-term strategy and detailed \n        implementation plan for such program, including how the entity \n        plans to pay for the program after the Federal funding is \n        discontinued;\n            (3) certifies that all government entities affected by the \n        program have been appropriately consulted in the development of \n        the program and that there will be appropriate coordination \n        with all such entities in the implementation of the program;\n            (4) identifies the key partners that will be included in \n        the program, including the Chief Judge of the court of the \n        relevant jurisdiction and other participating judges in such \n        jurisdiction, State court administrator, probation and parole \n        administrators, jail and prison administrators, prosecutors, \n        public defenders and defense attorneys, and sheriff or police \n        administrators;
