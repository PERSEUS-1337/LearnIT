FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress hereby finds the following:\n            (1) Innovation in financial services and products is \n        outpacing the ability of regulatory bodies to monitor and \n        control the stability of the international financial system.\n            (2) The rapid growth and integration of international \n        capital markets has resulted in a volume of financial \n        transactions that exceeds the resources of any single country \n        and any single regulatory body.\n            (3) Although most countries have regulatory bodies that \n        govern the operation of each such country's financial markets \n        and participants, the globalization of the financial markets \n        requires better efforts to coordinate international regulation \n        and supervision.\n            (4) Financial regulators in the United States pursue \n        separate strategies for dealing with international financial \n        issues, including derivative financial instruments, often with \n        inadequate communication among themselves and their foreign \n        counterparts.\n            (5) Given the increased globalization of financial markets, \n        it is imperative that regulators establish an effective system \n        of crisis management to deal with any shock to international \n        financial markets.\n            (6) As market participants continue to globalize their \n        operations, financial regulatory bodies must develop a \n        coordinated approach to enforcement actions.\n            (7) Large differences in the operations of the world's \n        major clearing and settlement systems, in terms of both \n        efficiency and risk, pose a threat to the stability of the \n        international financial system.\n            (8) Because financial assets directed through so-called \n        ``off-shore tax havens'' are growing, such off-shore tax havens \n        need to be identified and their role in the international \n        financial system, the reasons for their growth, and the effect \n        of their unrestricted growth on the international financial \n        system need to be fully examined.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide for the \nUnited States to play a leadership role in--\n            (1) ensuring a stable and efficient international financial \n        system; and\n            (2) enhancing cooperation among financial regulatory bodies \n        around the world.\n\nSEC. 3. COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION OF FINANCIAL \n              REGULATION.\n\n    There is hereby established the Commission on International \nCoordination of Financial Regulation, an advisory committee under the \nFederal Advisory Committee Act, hereafter in this Act referred to as \nthe ``Commission''.\n\nSEC. 4.
