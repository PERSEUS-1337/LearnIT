    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National MS and Parkinson's Disease \nRegistries Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Multiple sclerosis (referred to in this section as \n        ``MS'') is a progressive, disabling disease that affects the \n        brain and the spinal cord causing loss of myelin, damage to \n        axons, and cerebral atrophy.\n            (2) MS is a prime-of-life disease with an average age of \n        onset at 30 to 35 years of age.\n            (3) More than 10,000 individuals in the United States are \n        diagnosed with MS annually, and it is thought that more than \n        400,000 individuals in the United States have MS.\n            (4) Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive \n        neurological disease. The primary pathologic feature of \n        Parkinson's disease is degeneration and premature death of \n        dopamine-producing brain cells.\n            (5) Parkinson's is the second-most common neurodegenerative \n        disease in the United States.\n            (6) It is estimated that more than 1,000,000 Americans are \n        currently fighting Parkinson's disease, and 60,000 Americans \n        are newly diagnosed every year.\n            (7) Although estimates exist, there is no confirmed data \n        regarding prevalence or diagnosed cases of Parkinson's disease \n        or MS.\n            (8) The causes of Parkinson's disease and MS are not well \n        understood.\n            (9) There is no known cure for Parkinson's disease or MS.\n            (10) Studies have found relationships between both MS and \n        Parkinson's disease and environmental and genetic factors, but \n        those relationships are not well understood.\n            (11) Better data are needed to understand the economic \n        impact of Parkinson's disease, MS, and other neurological \n        diseases.\n            (12) There are several drugs currently approved by the Food \n        and Drug Administration for the treatment of MS, which have \n        shown modest success in reducing relapses, slowing progression \n        of disability, and limiting the accumulation of brain lesions.\n            (13) Currently, state-of-the-art treatment for Parkinson's \n        disease is based on a 40-year-old pharmaceutical therapy, which \n        only treats some of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. \n        Deep brain stimulation surgery is available for certain \n        patients and treats some symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\n            (14) No therapies exist that will slow or stop progression \n        of Parkinson's disease. There is no effective, lasting therapy \n        for all features of Parkinson's disease.\n            (15) Central nervous system drugs, including therapies for \n        MS, Parkinson's disease, and other neurological diseases, are \n        the slowest in the drug development pipeline, taking an average \n        of 15 years post discovery for new therapies to reach the \n        market.\n            (16) Several small and uncoordinated MS and Parkinson's \n        disease registries, surveillance systems, and databases exist \n        in the United States and throughout the world.\n            (17) A single national system to collect and store \n        information on the incidence and prevalence of MS, Parkinson's \n        disease, or other neurological diseases in the United States \n        does not exist.\n            (18) The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry \n        (ATSDR) has established a series of small pilot studies, \n        beginning in fiscal year 2006, to evaluate the feasibility of \n        various methodologies to create an MS surveillance system at \n        the national level.\n            (19) The national surveillance system methodology resulting \n        from the MS pilot studies should be expanded upon and developed \n        into a national surveillance system for Parkinson's disease.\n            (20) The establishment of separate, coordinated national \n        surveillance systems for Parkinson's disease and MS will help--\n                    (A) to identify the incidence and prevalence of \n                these diseases in the United States;\n                    (B) to collect demographic and other data important \n                to the study of MS and Parkinson's disease;\n                    (C) to produce epidemiologically sound data that \n                can be used to compare with cluster information, data \n                sets of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n                environmental exposure data, and other information;\n                    (D) to promote a better understanding of causes, \n                prevention, and treatment of disease;\n                    (E) to better understand public and private \n                resource impact;\n                    (F) to collect information that is important for \n                research into genetic and environmental risk factors;\n                    (G) to enhance biomedical and clinical research by \n                providing a basis for population comparisons;\n                    (H) to enhance efforts to develop better diagnosis \n                and progression biomarkers for MS and Parkinson's \n                disease; and\n                    (I) to enhance efforts to find treatments and a \n                cure for MS and Parkinson's disease.\n\nSEC. 3. SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS.\n\n    Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n280g et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating the second and third sections 399R \n        (added by section 2 of Public Law 110-373 and section 3 of \n        Public Law 110-374) as sections 399S and 399T, respectively; \n        and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 399U.
