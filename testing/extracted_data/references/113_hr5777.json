    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This title may be cited as the ``Cryptocurrency Protocol Protection \nand Moratorium Act'' (also, ``CryptPMA'').\n\nSEC. 2. MORATORIUM.\n\n    (a) Neither the Federal Government nor any State or political \nsubdivision thereof shall impose any statutory restrictions or \nregulations specifically identifying and governing the creation, use, \nexploitation, possession or transfer of any algorithmic protocols \ngoverning the operation of any virtual, non-physical, algorithm or \ncomputer source code-based medium for exchange (collectively, \n``cryptocurrency'' as defined herein) for a period beginning June 1, \n2015, and extending five years after the enactment of this Act (such \nperiod, the ``moratorium period''), except for statutes already enacted \nand effective prior to the date of enactment of this Act, and further \nsuspending the enactment and effectiveness of any and all pending \nstatutes and regulations until the end of the aforementioned moratorium \nperiod, except as otherwise provided in this section.\n    (b) Nothing in this Act shall prevent, impair or impede the \noperation of any government agency, authority or instrumentality, \nwhether of the Federal Government or of any State or political \nsubdivision thereof, to enforce currently existing criminal, civil or \ntaxation statutes and regulations.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) ``Algorithm'' is defined as a procedure for solving a \nmathematical problem in a finite number of steps performed by a \ncomputer.\n    (b) ``Algorithmic chain'' is a series or chain of bits of data \ncomprising a unique string of data which is the basis for the \ncryptographic proof of a valid transfer or transaction of \ncryptocurrencies. The algorithmic chain for a cryptocurrency is \ncommonly referred to as a ``blockchain''.\n    (c) The ``cryptographic proof'' for each transaction or transfer is \nbased on one unique algorithmic chain, distinct from all previously \nexisting algorithms and neither replicable nor reusable yet sharing \nwith all other units at least one common source code element in the \nalgorithmic chain (or ``blockchain'') in the transferor's existing \nbitcoin or bitcoins.\n    (d) ``Protocol'' refers to procedures or guidelines governing the \ncreation, development and operation of a cryptocurrency.\n    (e) ``Service'' is defined as the Internal Revenue Service.\n    (f) The phrase ``using the Internet or other electronic, non-\nphysical medium'' means by placement of material in a computer server-\nbased file archive so that it is publicly accessible, on, through, or \nover the Internet, using hypertext transfer protocol, file transfer \nprotocol, or other similar protocols.\n    (g) ``Cryptocurrency'' is a popular term encompassing code-based \nprotocols supporting an electronic, non-physical media for the exchange \nof value, and for the sake of both clarity and the avoidance of \nconfusion in the mind of the public, based on the prior use of this \nterm by the Internal Revenue Service in its initial guidance (see \nNotice 2014-21, released March 26, 2014) this term is used herein. \nHowever, it is believed ``cryptocurrency'' encompasses the same \nprotocols as those covered by terms such as ``digital currency'', \n``virtual currency'' or ``electronic currency''.\n\nSEC. 4. DECLARATION OF MORATORIUM.\n\n    (a) In General.--It is the sense of Congress that no new statutes, \nregulations or advisory opinions be passed, implemented, enforced or \nissued governing the creation, use, possession or taxation of \ncryptocurrencies, the protocols governing each and the data, codes, \nalgorithms or other calculations comprising each, until the expiration \nof the moratorium as provided in this Act.\n    (b) Public Interest.--It is further the sense of Congress that the \ndevelopment and use of any media for exchange which possesses the \ncharacteristic of cryptographic proof of and for a transaction of \ncryptocurrency without the need for or reliance upon third-party \nintermediaries or verification is a circumstance that is likely to \nresult in economic and other efficiencies for the American people and \nother participants in the domestic economy, and as such may be crucial \nto overall economic growth, will enhance the economic well-being of the \nAmerican people and will otherwise be in the public interest.\n\nSEC. 5. DECLARATION OF NEUTRAL TAX TREATMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--It is the sense of Congress that the production, \npossession or use of cryptocurrency, whether in trade, commerce or \npersonal non-commercial transfers, should not be disfavored or \ndiscouraged by the Federal tax code or other Federal or State statute \nor regulation.\n    (b) Tax Treatment.--It is the sense of Congress that the current \nguidance just promulgated and released by the Service in its Notice \n2014-21 is advisory, subject to public comment and not in final form \npending the expiration of the comment period. As such, Congress \nbelieves that the current guidance is less than optimal for the \nAmerican people and economy, and directs the Service to issue or revise \ninterim regulations consistent with the following.\n    (c) Treatment as Currency.--It is the sense of Congress that \nvirtual currencies should be treated as currency instead of property in \norder to foster an equitable tax treatment and prevent a tax treatment \nthat would discourage the use of any cryptocurrency. Tax treatment of \ncryptocurrency as property does not account for the substantial \nilliquidity and highly limited acceptance and use of cryptocurrency, \nand substantially and unfairly discourages taxpayers engaging in a \ntrade or business from using cryptocurrency in commerce. This \ncircumstance is likely to discourage economic activity and stifle \ninnovation and growth. At present, a taxpayer accepting cryptocurrency \nfor goods or services will be taxed on the fair market value of the \ncryptocurrency despite the fact that exchange rates (from \ncryptocurrency to conventional currency) are both highly volatile and \npublished or available only on a small number of proto-exchanges in the \nearly stages of development, acceptance and awareness by cryptocurrency \nusers. As a result, current tax treatment will measure income on the \nbasis of an illiquid and likely inaccurate fair market value that \nexceeds the taxpayer's true fair market value and hence income, \nresulting in the risk of a consistent overtaxation or overpayment that \nwill act as a strong deterrent to or penalty for accepting \ncryptocurrency in payment. Such tax treatment is inconsistent with the \ntax treatment of secured notes for payment in trade or commerce, which \nrecognizes a discount from the face value of the note due to the \nilliquid nature of the payment. (Note: See IRS Pub. 525 at 4.)\n    (d) Revenue in Trade or Business; Taxation Upon Monetizing Event.--\nIt is the sense of Congress that taxpayers accepting cryptocurrency in \ntrade or commerce should be deemed to realize actual income only when \ncryptocurrency is monetized through conversion or exchange into dollars \nor any official government currency, and that fair market value should \nbe calculated as net proceeds from the conversion. (Note: This \ntreatment seeks to achieve the most accurate and fair measure of actual \nincome received, as distinguished from theoretical income in the form \nof cryptocurrency which, until its conversion to dollars, remains under \nsubstantial risk of diminution from illiquidity or other conversion \nrisks or inefficiencies. This treatment is consistent with tax \ntreatment of statutory stock options where the taxable event is not the \nreceipt or exercise of the option, but the sale of the underlying stock \nfor proceeds in cash. The goal here is to have income taxed when the \nincome is actual instead of theoretical and subject to substantial if \nnot total risk of loss through liquidity problems, exchange problems or \nother barriers to monetization.) Accordingly, as it is the further \nsense of Congress that income on cryptocurrency received in trade or \nbusiness should be defined as the net proceeds from conversion of the \nreceived cryptocurrency into dollars, the Service is hereby directed to \nrevise or issue interim regulations consistent herewith.\n    (e) Revenue From Mining or Creation of Cryptocurrency.--It is the \nsense of Congress that the Service's guidance that taxpayers should \nhave the fair market value of the cryptocurrency they successfully \n``mine'' or produce included in gross income is inequitable, overstates \nactual income by overstating fair market value by not accounting for \nthe liquidity risk or the risk that substantial effort may yield no \nproduction, and strongly and unfairly penalizes or discourages such \nincome producing efforts and deters economic growth, activity and \ninnovation. Accordingly, as it is the further sense of Congress that \nmined produced cryptocurrency should be taxed as income only when \nactual income is realized by a transfer and conversion of proceeds into \ndollars, the Service is hereby directed to revise or issue interim \nregulations consistent herewith.\n\nSEC. 6. SEVERABILITY.\n\n    If any provision of this title, or any amendment made by this \ntitle, or the application of that provision to any person or \ncircumstance, is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to violate \nany provision of the Constitution of the United States, then the other \nprovisions of that title, and the application of that provision to \nother persons and circumstances, shall not be affected."
