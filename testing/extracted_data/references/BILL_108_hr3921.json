FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) From 1951 until 1992, the United States conducted over \n        900 nuclear weapons tests at the Nevada Test Site.\n            (2) Of those tests, 100 exploded above ground and \n        approximately one-fourth of those were bigger than the bomb \n        dropped on Hiroshima, Japan.\n            (3) The remaining 804 tests were detonated underground, yet \n        many of these tests also released significant amounts of \n        radioactive fallout into the atmosphere. The Shot Baneberry, \n        detonated in 1970, was buried 900 feet below ground but \n        radioactive debris erupted 10,000 feet into the air.\n            (4) Public health researchers studied the implications of \n        radiation fallout and weapons testing in 1961 and discovered \n        significant negative health effects.\n            (5) These research findings were not released until 1979. \n        In the meantime, American citizens were never warned about the \n        likelihood of contamination in areas downwind of the blasts nor \n        were they alerted to adverse health effects associated with \n        radiation exposure.\n            (6) During the 1980s, public pressure forced the Federal \n        Government to address surprisingly high rates of cancer and \n        other illnesses among people exposed to radioactive fallout, \n        commonly known as ``downwinders,'' which led to the passage of \n        the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in 1990.\n            (7) To date, only one comprehensive radiation exposure \n        study of an isotope, iodine-131, has been conducted and \n        released. Iodine-131 is only one of more than 150 radionuclides \n        released by the tests to which the American people were \n        exposed.\n            (8) This same radioactive fallout study, conducted by the \n        National Cancer Institute, shows that exposure was not limited \n        to residents of Nevada and Utah. Extensive radiation exposure \n        has been documented in all of the contiguous 48 States, with \n        some counties in the Midwest and the eastern United States \n        receiving more fallout than some areas directly downwind of the \n        Nevada Test Site.\n            (9) The United States has engaged in a moratorium on \n        nuclear weapons testing since 1992. However, the United States \n        might in the future decide to resume nuclear weapons testing.\n            (10) Before any resumption of nuclear weapons testing, the \n        American public deserves much greater accountability from the \n        Federal Government with respect to the health and safety \n        aspects of nuclear weapons testing.\n            (11) Therefore, the Federal Government must ensure public \n        safety in the event of future nuclear weapons tests through a \n        thorough analysis of the environmental effects of testing, \n        public notification, comprehensive and independent test \n        monitoring, and extensive health research efforts.\n\nSEC. 3.
