FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The grazing of livestock on Federal lands in Arizona is \n        an increasingly difficult undertaking for grazing permittees \n        and lessees due to growing conflicts with other legitimate uses \n        of the same lands, such as environmental protection and \n        burgeoning recreational use.\n            (2) Sustained drought in the arid Southwest, foreign \n        competition, changing domestic markets, industry restructuring, \n        and individual ranch situations have combined to result in \n        grazing permits and leases becoming stranded investments for \n        many grazing permittees and lessees in Arizona.\n            (3) Attempts to resolve grazing conflicts with other \n        multiple uses of Federal lands often require extensive range \n        developments and monitoring that greatly increase costs to both \n        grazing permittees and lessees and taxpayers, far out of \n        proportion to the benefit received.\n            (4) Certain grazing allotments on Federal lands in Arizona \n        have, or are likely to become, unsuitable for livestock \n        production as a result of the combined effect of the \n        aforementioned factors.\n            (5) The cost of the Federal grazing program in Arizona \n        greatly exceeds revenues to the Federal treasury from grazing \n        fee receipts.\n            (6) Many grazing permittees and lessees in Arizona have \n        indicated their willingness to end livestock grazing on their \n        Federal grazing allotments in exchange for a one-time payment \n        to reasonably compensate them for the effort and investment \n        that they have made in such allotments.\n            (7) A broad coalition of ranchers and environmental and \n        conservation groups in Arizona have agreed that a voluntary \n        program to buyout grazing permits and leases would provide the \n        best solution to the aforementioned problems.\n            (8) Compensating grazing permittees and lessees to end \n        livestock grazing on Federal lands would help recapitalize an \n        ailing sector of rural Arizona by providing economic options to \n        grazing permittees and lessees that do not presently exist, \n        thus allowing them to restructure their grazing operations or \n        start new businesses.\n            (9) Reasonable compensation will help alleviate the need \n        for grazing permittees and lessees to sell or subdivide their \n        private lands.\n            (10) A voluntary buyout program in Arizona would resolve \n        growing conflicts between livestock grazing and other multiple \n        uses in Arizona, and would also be fiscally prudent and \n        socially just.\n            (11) The operation of a voluntary buyout program in Arizona \n        would provide Congress with critical information concerning the \n        possible expansion of such a program nation-wide.\n\nSEC. 3. ARIZONA VOLUNTARY GRAZING PERMIT AND LEASE BUYOUT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) The term ``Secretary concerned'' means the Secretary of \n        Agriculture, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of \n        Energy, or the Secretary of Defense, as appropriate, who has \n        administrative jurisdiction over the Federal lands and the \n        grazing permit or lease at issue.\n            (2) The terms ``grazing permit or lease'' and ``grazing \n        permit and lease'' mean any document authorizing the use, for a \n        term of at least five years, of Federal lands in Arizona for \n        the purpose of grazing domestic livestock.\n            (3) The terms ``permittee or lessee'' and ``permittees and \n        lessees'' refer to a livestock operator who holds, or livestock \n        operators who hold, a valid term grazing permit or lease.\n            (4) The term ``grazing allotment'' means a designated \n        portion of Federal land upon which domestic livestock are \n        permitted to graze by a term grazing permit or lease.\n            (5) The term ``animal unit month'' means the amount of \n        forage needed to sustain one animal unit for one month. Animal \n        unit is defined by the Secretary concerned issuing the permit \n        or lease.\n            (6) The term ``range developments'' means structures, \n        fences and other permanent fixtures placed on Federal lands for \n        the furtherance of the purpose of grazing domestic livestock, \n        and specifically not including rolling stock, livestock and \n        diversions of water from Federal lands onto non-Federal lands.\n    (b) Waiver of Existing Grazing Permit or Lease.--A permittee or \nlessee may at any time waive to the Secretary concerned a valid \nexisting grazing permit or lease authorizing livestock grazing on \nFederal land in Arizona.\n    (c) Cancellation of Waived Grazing Permit or Lease.--The Secretary \nconcerned shall cancel grazing permits or leases waived under \nsubsection (b) and permanently retire the associated grazing allotments \nfrom domestic livestock grazing use, notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law.\n    (d) Compensation.--A permittee or lessee who waives a permit or \nlease to the Secretary concerned under subsection (b) shall be \ncompensated at $175 per animal unit month based on the average over the \nlast 10 years of the numbers of animal unit months permitted to the \npermittee or lessee or the predecessors of the permittee or lessee, not \nincluding suspended animal unit months. In the case of an ephemeral \ngrazing permit or lease, the permittee or lessee shall be compensated \nfor the average over the last 10 years of the actual animal unit months \nof grazing use.

The Secretary concerned shall not take into \nconsideration such non-use or reduced use of a grazing allotment when \nconsidering a request for the renewal of the grazing permit or lease.\n    (i) Relation to Eminent Domain.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to authorize the use of eminent domain for the purpose of \nacquiring a grazing permit or lease.\n    (j) Relation to Other Valid Existing Rights.--Nothing in this \nsection shall affect the allocation, ownership, interest, or control, \nin existence as of the date of the enactment of this Act, of any water, \nwater right, or any other valid existing right held by the United \nStates, an Indian tribe, State or local government, or private \nindividual, partnership, or corporation."
