REQUIREMENT RELATING TO GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) without the cooperation of other countries, the United \n        States cannot reverse global climate change to ensure the \n        recovery of species that are listed as threatened or endangered \n        species on the list of threatened species or the list of \n        endangered species published under section 4(c)(1) of the \n        Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(c)(1));
