FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) While the Nurse Reinvestment Act (Public Law 107-205) \n        helped to increase applications to schools of nursing by 60 \n        percent, schools of nursing have been unable to accommodate the \n        influx of interested students because they have an insufficient \n        number of nurse educators. It is estimated that--\n                    (A) in the 2003-2004 school year--\n                            (i) 61.5 percent of schools of nursing had \n                        from 1 to 15 vacant faculty positions; and\n                            (ii) an additional 30.9 percent of schools \n                        of nursing needed additional faculty, but \n                        lacked the resources needed to add more \n                        positions; and\n                    (B) 18,105 eligible candidates were denied \n                admission to schools of nursing in 2003, primarily due \n                to an insufficient number of faculty members.\n            (2) A growing number of nurses with doctoral degrees are \n        choosing careers outside of education. Over the last few years, \n        there has been a 12 percent increase in doctoral nursing \n        graduates seeking employment outside the education profession.\n            (3) The average age of nurse faculty at retirement is 62.5 \n        years. With the average age of doctorally-prepared faculty \n        currently 53.5 years, a wave of retirements is expected within \n        the next 10 years.\n            (4) Master's and doctoral programs in nursing are not \n        producing a large enough pool of potential nurse educators to \n        meet the projected demand for nurses over the next 10 years. In \n        the 2003-2004 school year, graduations from master's programs \n        in nursing were down 2.5 percent or 251 graduates, and \n        graduations from doctoral programs decreased by 9.9 percent or \n        44 graduates.\n            (5) According to the February 2004 Monthly Labor Review of \n        the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 1,000,000 new and \n        replacement nurses will be needed by 2012.\n\nSEC. 3. CAPITATION GRANTS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF NURSING FACULTY AND \n              STUDENTS.\n\n    (a) Grants.--Part D of title VIII of the Public Health Service Act \n(42 U.S.C. 296p) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 832.
