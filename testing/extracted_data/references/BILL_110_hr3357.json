FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The United States is facing a continuing crisis in \n        writing in schools and in the workplace.\n            (2) Nationwide reports show that nearly \\1/3\\ of high \n        school graduates are not ready for college-level English \n        composition courses.\n            (3) Writing is a threshold skill for both employment and \n        promotion; deficiencies in writing skills have resulted in \n        annual private-sector costs for providing writing training as \n        high as $3,100,000,000.\n            (4) Writing is a central feature in State and local \n        educational standards in all disciplines.\n            (5) Since 1973, the only national program to address the \n        writing problem in the Nation's schools has been the National \n        Writing Project's network of collaborative university-school \n        programs.\n            (6) Evaluations of the National Writing Project document \n        significant gains in student performance in writing and \n        effective classroom practices.\n            (7) The National Writing Project has become a model for \n        programs to improve teaching in such other fields as \n        mathematics, science, history, civics and government, \n        geography, reading and literature, technology, performing arts, \n        and foreign languages.\n            (8) Each year, more that 135,000 teachers directly benefit \n        from National Writing Project programs in nearly 200 sites \n        located in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto \n        Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nSEC. 2.
