FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Nearly 8,700,000 children in the United States have no \n        health insurance, including an increase of over 600,000 in the \n        past year.\n            (2) The American Medical Association rates adolescents aged \n        13 to 18 as the group of Americans with the poorest health \n        indicators.\n            (3) More than 70 percent of children who need psychiatric \n        treatment do not receive services.\n            (4) School-based health centers are located in over 1,700 \n        schools in 43 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto \n        Rico.\n            (5) School-based health centers ensure access to health \n        care by providing care regardless of a child's ability to pay.\n            (6) Forty-five percent of children and adolescents treated \n        at school-based health centers have no insurance.\n            (7) Forty-four percent of children and adolescents treated \n        at school-based health centers are enrolled in Medicaid, SCHIP, \n        or other public coverage.\n            (8) School-based health centers promote access to providers \n        for many children and adolescents who otherwise would have \n        difficulty seeing a provider.\n            (9) School-based health centers effectively provide \n        primary, preventative, and mental health services to children \n        and adolescents.\n            (10) School-based health centers effectively utilize \n        resources by often leveraging State and local government funds, \n        private contributions, and Medicaid, SCHIP, and private \n        insurance payments.\n            (11) For school-based health centers' target demographic \n        (students with public insurance or who are uninsured), data \n        show that school-based health centers decrease school absences.\n            (12) School-based health centers identify students at risk \n        for health and behavioral problems, thus reducing obstacles to \n        the learning process.\n            (13) School-based health centers administer medication to \n        students with chronic illness, which reduces absences as well \n        as disciplinary action for students with behavioral health \n        problems.\n            (14) Empirical analyses show that school-based health \n        centers reduce Medicaid costs by providing cost-effective and \n        timely care.\n            (15) School-based health centers encourage parental \n        involvement to increase family participation in school- and \n        education-oriented activities.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to fund the development \nand operation of school-based health clinics--\n            (1) to provide comprehensive and accessible primary health \n        care services to medically underserved children, youth, and \n        families;\n            (2) to improve the physical health, emotional well-being, \n        and academic performance of medically underserved children, \n        youth, and families; and\n            (3) to work in collaboration with the school to integrate \n        health into the overall school environment.\n\nSEC. 3.
