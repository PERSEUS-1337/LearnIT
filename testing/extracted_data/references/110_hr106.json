    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) During the initial months after Virginia was settled, \n        the Rappahannocks had 3 encounters with Captain John Smith. The \n        first occurred when the Rappahannock weroance (headman) \n        traveled to Quiyocohannock (a principal town across the James \n        River from Jamestown) where he met with the Englishman to \n        determine if Smith had been the ``great man'' who had \n        previously sailed into the Rappahannock River, killed a \n        Rappahannock weroance, and kidnapped Rappahannock people. He \n        determined that Smith was too short to be that ``great man''. \n        On a second meeting, during John Smith's captivity (December \n        16, 1607 until January 8, 1608), Smith was taken to the \n        Rappahannock principal village to show the people that Smith \n        was not the great man. A third meeting took place during \n        Smith's exploration of the Chesapeake Bay (July 1608 until \n        September 1608), when Smith was prevailed upon to make peace \n        between the Rappahannock and the Moraughtacund Indians. The \n        Moraughtacunds had stolen 3 women from the Rappahannock King. \n        In the settlement, Smith had the 2 tribes meet on the spot of \n        their first fight. When it was established that both sides \n        wanted peace, Smith told the Rappahannock King to select which \n        of the 3 women he wanted; the Moraughtacund King got second \n        choice; Mosco, a Wighcocomoco (on the Potomac River) guide, was \n        given the third woman.\n            (2) In 1645, Captain William Claiborne tried unsuccessfully \n        to establish treaty relations with the Rappahannocks. The \n        Rappahannocks had not participated in the Pamunkey-led uprising \n        in 1644, and the English wanted to ``treat with the \n        Rappahannocks or any other Indians not in amity with \n        Opechancanough, concerning serving the county against the \n        Pamunkeys''.\n            (3) In April 1651, the Rappahannocks conveyed their first \n        tract of land to an English settler, Colonel Morre Fauntleroy. \n        The deed was signed by Accopatough, weroance of the \n        Rappahannock Indians.\n            (4) In September 1653, Lancaster County signed a treaty \n        with Rappahannock Indians. The terms of the treaty gave \n        Rappahannocks the rights of the Englishmen in the county court, \n        and it tried to make the Rappahannock more accountable to \n        English law.\n            (5) In September 1653, Lancaster County defined and marked \n        the bounds of its Indian settlements. According to the \n        Lancaster clerk of court, ``the tribe called the great \n        Rappahannocks lived on the Rappahannock Creek just across the \n        river above Tappahannock''.\n            (6) In September 1656, (Old) Rappahannock County (modern-\n        day Richmond and Essex Counties) signed a treaty with \n        Rappahannock Indians. The treaty mirrored the Lancaster County \n        treaty from 1653, and added 2 points: Rappahannocks were to be \n        rewarded, in Roanoke, for returning English fugitives and the \n        English encouraged the Rappahannocks to send their children to \n        live among the English as servants, who the English promised \n        would be treated well.\n            (7) In 1658, the Virginia assembly revised a 1652 Act \n        stating that ``there be no grants of land to any Englishman \n        whatsoever de futuro until the Indians be first served with the \n        proportion of 50 acres of land for each bowman''.\n            (8) In 1669, the colony conducted a census of Virginia \n        Indians. At that time, the majority of the Rappahannocks were \n        residing at their hunting village on the north side of the \n        Mattaponi River. At the time of the visit, census takers were \n        counting only the tribes along the rivers. This explains the \n        low number of 30 Rappahannock bowmen counted on the river. The \n        Rappahannocks used this hunting village on the north side of \n        the Mattaponi River as their primary residence until they were \n        removed in 1684.\n            (9) In May 1677, the Treaty of Middle Plantation was signed \n        with England. The Pamunkey Queen Cockacoeske signed on behalf \n        of the Rappahannocks ``who were supposed to be her \n        tributaries''. However, before the treaty could be ratified, \n        the Queen of Pamunkey complained to the Virginia Colonial \n        Council ``that she was having trouble with Rappahannocks and \n        Chickahominies, supposedly tributaries of hers''.\n            (10) In November 1682, the Virginia Colonial Council \n        established a reservation for the Rappahannock Indians of 3,474 \n        acres ``about the town where they dwelt''. The Rappahannocks \n        ``town'' was their hunting village on the north side of the \n        Mattaponi River, where they had lived throughout the 1670's. \n        The acreage allotment was based on the 1658 Indian land act \n        (seen above), which translated into a bowman population of 70, \n        or an approximate total Rappahannock population of 350.\n            (11) In 1683, following raids by Iroquoian warriors on both \n        Indian and English Settlements, the Virginia Colonial Council \n        ordered the Rappahannocks to leave their reservation and unite \n        with the Nanzatico Indians at Nanzatico Indian Town, which was \n        located across and 30 miles up the Rappahannock River.\n            (12) Between 1687 and 1699, the Rappahannocks migrated out \n        of Nanzatico, returning to the south side of the Rappahannock \n        River at Portobacco Indian Town.\n            (13) In 1706, by order of Essex County, Lieutenant Richard \n        Covington ``escorted'' the Portobaccos and Rappahannocks out of \n        Portobacco Indian Town, out of Essex County, and into King and \n        Queen County where they settled along the ridgeline between the \n        Rappahannock and Mattaponi Rivers, the site of their ancient \n        hunting village and Mattaponi Rivers, the site of their ancient \n        hunting village and 1682 reservation.\n            (14) During the 1760s 3 Rappahannock girls were raised on \n        Thomas Nelson's ``Bleak Hill'' Plantation in King William \n        County. One girl married a Saunders man, one married a Johnson \n        man, and the third had 2 children, Edmund and Carter Nelson, \n        fathered by Thomas Cary Nelson. In the 19th century, these \n        Saunders, Johnson, and Nelson families are among the core \n        Rappahannock families from which the modern tribe traces its \n        descent.\n            (15) In 1819 and 1820, Edward Bird, John Bird and his \n        unnamed wife, Carter Nelson, Edmund Nelson, and Carter Spurlock \n        (all Rappahannock ancestors) were listed on the tax roles of \n        King and Queen County. They are taxed at the county poor rate. \n        Edmund Bird is added to the list in 1821. This is significant \n        documentation because the overwhelming majority of pre-1864 \n        records for King and Queen County were destroyed by fire.\n            (16) Beginning in 1819, and continuing through the 1880s, \n        there was a solid Rappahannock presence in the membership at \n        Upper Essex Baptist Church. This is the first instance of \n        conversion to Christianity by at least some Rappahannocks. \n        Twenty-six identifiable and traceable Rappahannock surnames \n        appear on the pre-1863 membership list; 28 were listed on the \n        1863 membership roster; that number had declined to 12 in 1878 \n        and had risen only slightly to 14 by 1888. One reason for the \n        decline: in 1870, a Methodist circuit rider, Joseph Mastin, \n        secured funds to purchase land and construct St. Stephens \n        Baptist church for the Rappahannocks living nearby in Caroline \n        County. Mastin documented from 1850 to 1870. St. Stephens was \n        the dominant tribal church until the Rappahannock Indian \n        Baptist Church was established in 1964. At both, the core \n        Rappahannock family names of Bird, Clarke, Fortune, Johnson, \n        Nelson, Parker, and Richardson predominate.\n            (17) During the early 1900s, James Mooney, noted \n        anthropologist, maintained correspondence with the \n        Rappahannocks, surveying them and instructing them on how to \n        formalize their tribal government.\n            (18) In November 1920, Speck visited the Rappahannocks and \n        assisted them in organizing the fight for their sovereign \n        rights. In 1921, the Rappahannocks were granted a charter from \n        the Commonwealth of Virginia formalizing their tribal \n        government. Speck began a professional relationship with the \n        Tribe that would last more than 30 years and document \n        Rappahannock history and traditions as never done before.\n            (19) In April 1921, Rappahannock Chief George Nelson asked \n        the Governor of Virginia, Westmoreland Davis, to forward a \n        proclamation to the President of the United States. A list of \n        tribal members and a handwritten copy of the proclamation \n        itself were appended. The letter concerned Indian freedom of \n        speech and assembly nationwide. Chief Nelson testified also \n        before Congress requesting acknowledgement of the Rappahannocks \n        civil and sovereign rights, quoting Isaiah 40:31; ``They that \n        wait upon the Lord shall renew their Strength; they shall mount \n        up with wings as Eagles; They shall run, and not be weary; and \n        they shall walk, and not faint''.\n            (20) In 1922, the Rappahannocks established a formal school \n        at Lloyds, Essex County, Virginia. Prior to that time, \n        Rappahannock children were taught by a tribal member in Central \n        Point, Caroline County, Virginia.\n            (21) In December 1923, Rappahannock Chief George Nelson \n        testified before the United States Congress appealing for a \n        $50,000 appropriation to establish an Indian school in \n        Virginia.\n            (22) In 1930, the Rappahannocks were engaged in an ongoing \n        dispute with the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States \n        Census Bureau about their classification in the 1930 Federal \n        census. In January 1930, Rappahannock Chief Otho S. Nelson \n        wrote to the Chief Statistician of the United States Census \n        Bureau asking that the 218 enrolled Rappahannocks be listed as \n        Indians. In February, Leon Truesdell replied to Nelson saying \n        that ``special instructions'' were being given about \n        classifying Indians. That April, Nelson wrote to William M. \n        Steuart at the Census Bureau asking about the enumerators' \n        failure to classify his people as Indians. Nelson said that \n        enumerators had not asked the question about race when they \n        interviewed his people. In a follow-up letter to Truesdell, \n        Nelson reported that the enumerators were ``flatly denying'' \n        his people's request to be listed as Indians. Furthermore, the \n        race question was completely avoided during interviews. The \n        Rappahannocks had talked with Caroline and Essex County \n        enumerators, and with John M.W. Green already, without success. \n        Nelson asked Truesdell to list people as Indian if he sent a \n        list of members. The matter was settled by William Steuart who \n        concluded that the Bureaus rule was that people of Indian \n        descent could only be classified as ``Indian'' if Indian \n        ``blood'' predominated and ``Indian'' identity was accepted in \n        the local community. The Virginia Vital Statistics Bureau \n        classed all nonreservation Indians as ``negro'', and it failed \n        to see why ``an exception should be made'' for the \n        Rappahannocks. Therefore, in 1925, the Indian Rights \n        Association took on the Rappahannock case to assist them in \n        fighting for their recognition and rights as an Indian Tribe.\n            (23) During the World War II, the Pamunkeys, Mattaponis, \n        Chickahominies, and Rappahannocks fought the draft boards about \n        their racial identity. The Virginia Vital Statistics Bureau \n        insisted that certain Indian draftees be inducted into Negro \n        units. In the end, 3 Rappahannocks were convicted of violating \n        the Federal draft laws. After spending time in a Federal \n        prison, they were granted conscientious objector status and \n        served out the remainder of the war working in military \n        hospitals.\n            (24) In 1943, Frank Speck noted that there were \n        approximately 25 communities of Indians left in the Eastern \n        United States that were entitled to Indian classification. The \n        Rappahannocks were included in this group.\n            (25) In the 1940s, Leon Truesdell, Chief Statistician, \n        United States Bureau of the Census, listed 118 members in the \n        Rappahannock tribe in the Indian population of Virginia.\n            (26) In April 25, 1940, the United Stated Department of the \n        Interior, Office of Indian Affairs, included the Rappahannocks \n        in their list of Tribes by State and Agency.\n            (27) In 1948, the Smithsonian Institution Annual Report \n        included an article by William Harlen Gilbert titled, \n        ``Surviving Indian Groups of the Eastern United States''. The \n        Rappahannock Tribe was included and described in this article.\n            (28) In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Rappahannocks \n        operated a school at Indian Neck. The State agreed to pay a \n        tribal teacher to teach 10 students bused by King and Queen \n        County to Sharon Indian School in King William County, \n        Virginia. In 1965, Rappahannock students entered Marriott High \n        School (a white public school) by Executive order of the \n        Governor of Virginia. In 1972, the Rappahannocks worked with \n        the Coalition of Eastern Native Americans to fight for Federal \n        recognition. In 1979, the Coalition established a pottery and \n        artisans company, operating with other Virginia tribes. In \n        1980, the Rappahannocks received funding through the \n        Administration for Native Americans, to develop an economic \n        program for the Tribe.\n            (29) In 1983, the Rappahannocks received State recognition. \n        This Bill acknowledges the perseverance of our people and their \n        long struggle to maintain their community, tribal culture, and \n        traditions, to take their rightful place in the history of the \n        United States.\n            (30) Thomasina E. Jordan is commended for her tireless \n        effort and work to gain federal recognition for Virginia \n        Indians. Thomasina E. Jordan laid the foundation to make \n        federal recognition a possibility. The Virginia Indians stand \n        on her shoulders.\n\nSEC. 2.
