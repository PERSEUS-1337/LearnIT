FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) approximately 40 percent of the total quantity of \n        energy consumed in the United States is used in heating and air \n        conditioning buildings and industrial process heat;\n            (2) thermal energy is an essential, but often overlooked, \n        segment of the national energy mix;\n            (3) district energy systems use 1 or more central plants to \n        provide thermal energy or combined heat and power to multiple \n        buildings that range in size from campus applications to \n        systems heating entire towns or cities;\n            (4) district energy systems provide several advantages that \n        support secure, affordable, renewable, and sustainable energy \n        for the United States, including--\n                    (A) fuel flexibility to reduce fossil fuel \n                consumption and greenhouse gas emissions;\n                    (B) use of local fuels that keep jobs and energy \n                dollars in local economies;\n                    (C) stable, predictable energy costs for businesses \n                and industry; and\n                    (D) reduction in reliance on fossil fuels;\n            (5) district energy systems provide infrastructure to \n        produce and distribute thermal energy and use electric energy \n        from sources of industrial surplus heat and from renewable \n        sources, such as biomass, geothermal, and solar;\n            (6) as of 2009, the United States had approximately 2,500 \n        operating district energy systems;\n            (7) combined heat and power systems increase energy \n        efficiency of power plants by capturing thermal energy and \n        using the thermal energy to provide heating and cooling, more \n        than doubling the efficiency of conventional power plants; and\n            (8) according to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, if the \n        United States was able to increase combined heat and power from \n        approximately 9 percent of total electric generation capacity \n        on the date of enactment of this Act to 20 percent by 2030, the \n        increase would--\n                    (A) save as much energy as half of all household \n                energy consumption;\n                    (B) create approximately 1,000,000 new jobs;\n                    (C) avoid more than 800,000,000 metric tons of \n                carbon dioxide emissions annually, which is equivalent \n                to taking \\1/2\\ of all United States passenger vehicles \n                off the road; and\n                    (D) save hundreds of millions of barrels of oil \n                equivalent.\n\nSEC. 3.
