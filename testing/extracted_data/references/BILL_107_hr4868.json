SHORT TITLE, FINDINGS, AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Minority National \nSecurity Scholarship Act of 2002''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The security of the United States will continue to \n        depend on the ability of the United States to understand, \n        shape, and react to political, economic, and social \n        developments around the world.\n            (2) Ethno-national conflicts continue to rage around the \n        world, and such conflicts are often accompanied by the \n        proliferation of weapons, human rights violations, economic and \n        commercial decline, trafficking in women and children, the \n        drafting of children into military service, and threats to \n        American citizens and business interests.\n            (3) International terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda \n        have established footholds in a number of countries, including \n        both allies and adversaries of the United States, and attempt \n        to use such footholds as bases from which to launch terrorist \n        attacks on the United States and American interests abroad.\n            (4) The future national security and economic well-being of \n        the United States will depend substantially on the ability of \n        its citizens to understand, influence, and respond to ethno-\n        national conflicts and the social and political factors that \n        cause others to support international terrorist groups. \n        American economic interests will also depend on the ability of \n        U.S. citizens to communicate and compete by knowing the \n        languages and cultures of other countries.\n            (5) The Federal Government has an interest in ensuring that \n        the employees of its departments and agencies with national \n        security responsibilities are prepared to meet the challenges \n        of this changing international environment.\n            (6) The Federal Government also has an interest in taking \n        actions to alleviate the problem of American undergraduate and \n        graduate students being inadequately prepared to meet the \n        challenges posed by increasing global interaction among \n        nations.\n            (7) American colleges and universities must place a new \n        emphasis on improving the teaching of foreign languages, area \n        studies, and other international fields, particularly of those \n        far-flung regions and newly independent countries that have \n        previously not been the focus of study in American institutions \n        of higher learning, to help meet those challenges.\n            (8) By virtue of their intimate understanding of foreign \n        languages, cultures, and locations, members of minority groups \n        have the potential to offer the Federal Government their \n        insights into political, economic, and social developments \n        abroad, and the Federal Government should take whatever steps \n        are necessary to encourage members of minority groups to use \n        their skills to promote United States national security by \n        making a career in the foreign affairs, security, or \n        intelligence agencies of the Federal Government. Furthermore, \n        if the United States is to penetrate terrorist organizations \n        like al-Qaeda or hostile adversaries of any kind in hopes of \n        preventing future attacks on the United States or on American \n        interests, the Federal Government must take full advantage of \n        the diversity of the American citizenry.\n    (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To provide the necessary resources, accountability, and \n        flexibility to meet the national security education needs of \n        the United States.\n            (2) To increase the quantity, diversity, and quality of the \n        teaching and learning of subjects in the fields of foreign \n        languages, area studies, and other international fields that \n        are critical to the Nation's interest.\n            (3) To produce an increased pool of applicants for work in \n        the departments and agencies of the United States Government \n        with responsibilities for issues affecting national security.\n            (4) To expand, in conjunction with other Federal programs, \n        the international experience, knowledge base, and perspectives \n        on which the United States citizenry, Government employees, and \n        leaders rely.\n            (5) To provide enhanced opportunities for members of \n        minority groups to serve their country and contribute to United \n        States national security by contributing to the work of the \n        foreign affairs, security, or intelligence agencies of the \n        Federal Government.\n\nSEC. 2. SCHOLARSHIP, FELLOWSHIP, AND GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Program Required.--The Secretary of Education shall establish a \nprogram to--\n            (1) award scholarships to minority undergraduate students \n        who are United States citizens in order to enable such students \n        to study, for at least one academic semester, in foreign \n        countries that are critical countries (as determined under \n        section 3(4)(A));\n            (2) award fellowships to minority graduate students who--\n                    (A) are United States citizens to enable such \n                students to pursue education in the United States in \n                the disciplines of foreign languages, area studies, and \n                other international fields that are critical areas of \n                those disciplines (as determined under section \n                3(4)(B)); and\n                    (B) pursuant to subsection (d), enter into an \n                agreement to work for an agency or office of the \n                Federal Government or in the field of education in the \n                area of study for which the fellowship was awarded; and\n            (3) award grants to institutions of higher education to \n        enable such institutions to establish, operate, or improve \n        programs in foreign languages, area studies, and other \n        international fields that are critical areas of those \n        disciplines (as determined under section 3(4)(C)) and that will \n        primarily serve students who are members of minority groups.\n    (b) Funding Allocations.--Of the amounts available to carry out the \nprograms under subsection (a) for any fiscal year, the Secretary of \nEducation shall have a goal of allocating--\n            (1) \\1/3\\ of such amount for the awarding of scholarships \n        pursuant to subsection (a)(1);\n            (2) \\1/3\\ of such amount for the awarding of fellowships \n        pursuant to subsection (a)(2); and\n            (3) \\1/3\\ of such amount for the awarding of grants \n        pursuant to subsection (a)(3).\n    (c) Contract Authority.--The Secretary of Education may enter into \none or more contracts, with private national organizations having an \nexpertise in foreign languages, area studies, and other international \nfields, for the awarding of the scholarships, fellowships, and grants \ndescribed in subsection (a) in accordance with the provisions of this \nAct. The Secretary of Education may enter into such contracts without \nregard to section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5) or any \nother provision of law that requires the use of competitive procedures.\n    (d) Service Agreement.--In awarding a scholarship or fellowship \nunder the program, the Secretary of Education or contract organization \nreferred to in subsection (c), as the case may be, shall require a \nrecipient of any fellowship, or of scholarships that provide assistance \nfor periods that aggregate 12 months or more, to enter into an \nagreement that, in return for such assistance, the recipient--\n            (1) will maintain satisfactory academic progress, as \n        determined in accordance with regulations issued by the \n        Secretary of Education, and agrees that failure to maintain \n        such progress shall constitute grounds upon which the Secretary \n        or contract organization referred to in subsection (c) may \n        terminate such assistance;\n            (2) will, upon completion of such recipient's baccalaureate \n        degree or education under the program, as the case may be, and \n        in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, work \n        for the Federal Government or in the field of education in the \n        area of study for which the scholarship or fellowship was \n        awarded for a period specified by the Secretary, which period \n        for the recipients of scholarships shall be no more than the \n        same period for which scholarship assistance was provided and \n        for the recipients of fellowships shall be not less than one \n        and not more than three times the period for which the \n        fellowship assistance was provided; and\n            (3) if the recipient fails to meet either of the \n        obligations set forth in paragraph (1) or (2), will reimburse \n        the United States Government for the amount of the assistance \n        provided the recipient under the program, together with \n        interest at a rate determined in accordance with regulations \n        issued by the Secretary.\n    (e) Distribution of Assistance.--In selecting the recipients for \nawards of scholarships, fellowships, or grants pursuant to this Act, \nthe Secretary of Education or a contract organization referred to in \nsubsection (c), as the case may be, shall take into consideration:\n            (1) the extent to which the selections will result in there \n        being an equitable geographic distribution of such \n        scholarships, fellowships, or grants (as the case may be) among \n        the various regions of the United States, and\n            (2) the extent to which the distribution of scholarships \n        and fellowships to individuals reflects the cultural, racial, \n        and ethnic diversity of the minority population of the United \n        States.\n    (f) Merit Review.--The Secretary of Education shall award \nscholarships, fellowships, and grants under the program based upon a \nmerit review process.\n\n SEC. 3.
