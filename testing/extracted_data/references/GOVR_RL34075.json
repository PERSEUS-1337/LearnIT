The editorial further said that while the government and population of Pakistan appreciate the assistance received from the United States, \"the pundits in the U.S. who believe that they can use the leverage of U.S. official aid to paralyse Pakistan's economy are sadly mistaken as they have an exaggerated sense of the importance of these official flows.\"  04/18/07 \u2014The president of the Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry noted that Pakistan's economy doubled in the past five years to $135 billion, and that foreign direct investment increased from less than $1 billion three years ago to more than $3.5 billion in the 2005-06 fiscal year.

The commission recommended that the State Department designate Pakistan as a \"country of particular concern.\" On the same day, the Capital Development Authority in Islamabad allocated property for six of the seven mosques that were razed in January 2007.
