FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has \n        reported that--\n                    (A) motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of \n                death of Americans between 15 and 20 years of age;\n                    (B) in the 10-year period ending in 2007, 86,981 \n                Americans died in motor vehicle crashes involving \n                drivers between 15 and 20 years of age, an average of \n                167 deaths per week;\n                    (C) drivers between 16 and 20 years of age have a \n                fatality rate that is 4 times higher than the rate for \n                drivers between 25 and 70 years of age; and\n                    (D) teenage drivers who are 16 years of age have a \n                motor vehicle crash rate that is almost 10 times higher \n                than the crash rate for drivers between 30 and 60 years \n                of age.\n            (2) According to the American Automobile Association--\n                    (A) teenage drivers comprise slightly more than \\1/\n                3\\ of all fatalities in motor vehicle crashes in which \n                they are involved; and\n                    (B) nearly \\2/3\\ of all fatalities in those crashes \n                are other drivers, passengers, and pedestrians.\n            (3) According to the Insurance Institute for Highway \n        Safety, the chance of a crash by a 16- or 17-year-old driver is \n        doubled if there are 2 peers in the vehicle and quadrupled if \n        there are 3 or more peers in the vehicle.\n            (4) According to the National Highway Traffic Safety \n        Administration, the cognitive distraction caused by hands-free \n        and hand-held cellular phones is significant enough to degrade \n        a driver's performance, particularly teenage drivers between 15 \n        and 20 years of age.\n            (5) Although only 20 percent of driving by teenage drivers \n        occurs at night, more than 50 percent of the motor vehicle \n        crash fatalities involving teenage drivers occur at night.\n            (6) According to the Insurance Institute for Highway \n        Safety, in 1997, the first full year of Florida's graduated \n        driver licensing system, the number of fatal and injurious \n        crashes among teenage drivers between 15 and 18 years of age \n        was 9 percent lower than in 1995.\n            (7) The Journal of the American Medical Association reports \n        that crashes involving 16-year-old drivers decreased between \n        1995 and 1999 by 25 percent in Michigan and by 27 percent in \n        North Carolina. Comprehensive graduated driver licensing \n        systems were implemented in 1997 in these States.\n            (8) According to the Automobile Club of Southern \n        California, between 1998 and 2000, the first 3 years of \n        California's graduated driver licensing program--\n                    (A) teenage passenger deaths and injuries resulting \n                from crashes in California involving 16-year-old \n                drivers declined by 40 percent; and\n                    (B) the number of at-fault collisions in California \n                involving 16-year-old drivers declined by 24 percent.\n            (9) The National Transportation Safety Board reports that--\n                    (A) more than 40 States and the District of \n                Columbia have implemented 3-stage graduated driver \n                licensing systems; and\n                    (B) many States have not yet implemented other \n                basic safety features of graduated driver licensing \n                laws to protect the lives of teenage and novice \n                drivers.\n            (10) A 2001 Harris Poll indicates that--\n                    (A) 95 percent of Americans support a requirement \n                of 30 to 50 hours of practice driving with and adult;\n                    (B) 92 percent of Americans support a 6-month \n                learner's permit period; and\n                    (C) 74 percent of Americans support limiting the \n                number of teenage passengers in a car with a teenage \n                driver and supervised driving during high-risk driving \n                periods, such as night.\n\nSEC. 3.
