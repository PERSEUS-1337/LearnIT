FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Although asbestos is hazardous, the risk of asbestos-\n        related disease depends upon exposure to airborne asbestos \n        fibers.\n            (2) Data available to the Environmental Protection Agency \n        suggest that average airborne asbestos levels in buildings are \n        very low. Accordingly, the health risk to most building \n        occupants also appears to be very low.\n            (3) The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that \n        only 20 percent of all buildings (including public and \n        commercial buildings, residential apartment buildings of 10 \n        units or more, and Federal buildings) contain friable asbestos-\n        containing material.\n            (4) The Environmental Protection Agency has found that \n        removal of asbestos is often not the best course of action to \n        reduce asbestos exposure. In fact, by releasing asbestos-\n        containing material fibers into the air, an improper or \n        unnecessary removal can create a dangerous situation where none \n        previously existed and could result in a net increase in human \n        exposures and risks.\n            (5) The Environmental Protection Agency requires asbestos \n        removal only to prevent significant public exposure to airborne \n        asbestos fibers during building demolition or renovation \n        activities.\n            (6) Many lending institutions require the removal of \n        asbestos, regardless of its condition, from commercial \n        buildings before approving loans secured by those buildings \n        because of the potential liability for the health of the \n        occupants or property damages for failure to remove the \n        asbestos.\n            (7) The Environmental Protection Agency recommends a pro-\n        active, in-place management program whenever intact asbestos-\n        containing material is discovered.\n            (8) The American Medical Association's Council on \n        Scientific Affairs has stated that ``it is better that society \n        use its limited financial resources in learning how to live \n        safely with [asbestos] than in attempting to remove it totally \n        from the environment.''\n            (9) The September 1991 report of the Health Effects \n        Institute's Asbestos Literature Review Panel stated that \n        ``there does not appear to be sufficient risk to the health of \n        general occupants to justify arbitrarily removing intact \n        asbestos-containing material from well-maintained buildings''. \n        The report also acknowledged that ``because custodial and \n        maintenance workers may be transiently exposed to higher levels \n        of asbestos, their added life-time risk of cancer may be \n        appreciably higher.''\n\nSEC. 3. EFFECT OF ASBESTOS INSPECTION ON LENDING INSTITUTIONS.\n\n    (a) Liability Immunity.--A lending institution that makes a loan or \nother extension of credit secured by a mortgage or other lien on a \ncommercial building shall not be liable, from the time the loan or \nother extension of credit is made until it is renegotiated or a \nsuperseding loan or other extension of credit is made, under any \nFederal, State, or local law to any person for injuries, costs, \ndamages, expenses, loss, or other obligation (including claims for \nindemnification or contribution and claims by third parties for death, \npersonal injury, illness or loss of or damage to property or economic \nloss) which results from the presence of asbestos-containing material \nin the building in any case in which--\n            (1) the building was constructed during the 5-year period \n        ending on the date that the loan or other extension of credit \n        is made, and the building's construction manager certifies that \n        the building contains no asbestos-containing material; or\n            (2) the building--\n                    (A) is one for which an asbestos inspection was \n                conducted in accordance with section 6 after January 1, \n                1989, and during the 5-year period ending on the date \n                that the loan or other extension of credit is made (as \n                demonstrated by appropriate documentation);\n                    (B) has not been significantly rebuilt or renovated \n                in the area that contains asbestos-containing material \n                since that inspection was completed;\n                    (C) is one in which that portion of asbestos-\n                containing material which the management planner \n                recommended for removal has been removed in accordance \n                with the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the \n                regulations promulgated pursuant to section 7(a); and\n                    (D) is one in which an operations and maintenance \n                program is currently being conducted in accordance with \n                section 8 and the regulations promulgated pursuant to \n                section 7(a) for remaining asbestos-containing \n                materials which the management planner recommended be \n                handled in place.\n    (b) Limitation.--The immunity from liability provided in subsection \n(a) shall not apply if--\n            (1) the lending institution requires removal of asbestos-\n        containing material that the management planner has recommended \n        be handled in place; or\n            (2) the lending institution requires an asbestos inspection \n        of the building despite the fact that--\n                    (A) the loan applicant demonstrates, with \n                appropriate documentation, that the conditions in \n                subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) have been satisfied; or\n                    (B) the loan applicant demonstrates, with \n                appropriate documentation, that all asbestos-containing \n                material has been removed from the building.\n    (c) Exclusion.--The immunity from liability provided in subsection \n(a) shall not apply to a subsidiary of a lending institution in any \ncase in which the lending institution makes a loan or other extension \nof credit secured by a mortgage or other lien on a commercial building, \nand the subsidiary is the person to which the loan or other extension \nof credit is made. For purposes of this subsection, the term \n``subsidiary'' means any company that is owned or controlled, directly \nor indirectly, by a lending institution.\n    (d) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect upon the \npromulgation of regulations by the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency pursuant to section 7(a).\n\nSEC. 4. LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF FORECLOSURE.\n\n    In the case of a lending institution that is immune from liability \nwith respect to a commercial building under section 3 and acquires \ntitle to such building through foreclosure or other exercise of rights \nunder a security interest, the immunity from liability shall continue \nin effect so long as the lending institution maintains the operations \nand maintenance program for the building in accordance with the \nregulations promulgated pursuant to section 7(a), the Environmental \nProtection Agency asbestos guidance documents, and this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. CONSTRUCTION OF ACT.\n\n    The requirement by a lending institution that a loan applicant \nconduct an asbestos inspection in accordance with this Act of a \nbuilding to be secured by a loan, and the conducting of an operations \nand maintenance program in the building after foreclosure or other \nexercise of rights under a security interest, shall not be construed as \nparticipation in the management of the building by the lending \ninstitution and shall be considered to be an activity carried out by \nthe lending institution solely to protect the institution's security \ninterest.\n\nSEC. 6. ASBESTOS INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--For purposes of this Act, an asbestos inspection \nof a commercial building, if the loan applicant chooses to obtain one, \nshall be conducted by a qualified management planner for the purpose of \ndetermining whether asbestos-containing material is present in the \nbuilding. If an inspection reveals the presence of asbestos-containing \nmaterial, the management planner shall recommend specific response \nactions for each individual area of the building where such material is \nfound. The recommendations shall be made in accordance with the \nregulations promulgated pursuant to section 7(a) and with the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency asbestos guidance documents.\n    (b) Management Planner Qualifications.--For purposes of this Act, a \nqualified management planner is a person who meets all of the following \nrequirements:\n            (1) The person must be accredited, pursuant to title II of \n        the Toxic Substances Control Act, as an inspector and \n        management planner for asbestos-containing material in a public \n        or commercial building.\n            (2) The person must not own or control or be under the \n        control of (A) any entity which carries out response actions \n        for asbestos-containing material from buildings, (B) any owner \n        or manager of the building being inspected, or (C) any lending \n        institution making a loan or other extension of credit secured \n        by a mortgage or other lien on the building being inspected. \n        For purposes of this paragraph, a person controls an entity if \n        the person, directly or indirectly, owns any amount of the \n        voting stock or other type of ownership interest in the entity.\n    (c) Accreditation of Management Planners for Public and Commercial \nBuildings.--Section 206 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. \n2646) is amended as follows:\n            (1) Paragraph (2) of subsection (a) is amended by inserting \n        before the comma the following: ``or for a public or commercial \n        building''.\n            (2) Clause (ii) of subsection (a)(1)(A) is amended by \n        inserting before the period the following: ``or for public or \n        commercial buildings''.\n\nSEC. 7. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Asbestos Inspection and Management Standards for Public and \nCommercial Buildings.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency shall promulgate regulations governing the inspection \nand management of asbestos in public and commercial buildings for \npurposes of this Act only.

The owner or operator shall ensure that \n        access to any remaining asbestos-containing material located in \n        inaccessible areas, such as in spaces between floors or walls \n        of the building, is permitted only to persons who have been \n        notified of the presence of the asbestos-containing material.\n            (3) After the inspection referred to in section 3(a)(2)(A), \n        a report on the inspection shall be kept on file in the \n        building. Such report shall include an accounting of remaining \n        asbestos-containing material, any such material recommended for \n        removal, and any removal that has taken place since the \n        previous inspection. Such report shall be available in the \n        building, in the administrative offices or other appropriate \n        place for inspection by tenants and employees in the building, \n        maintenance workers of the building, and building contractors. \n        The inspection report shall be updated after each subsequent \n        inspection pursuant to paragraph (1) and after any change in \n        condition of asbestos-containing material being managed in \n        place.\n            (4) After each inspection pursuant to paragraph (1), the \n        owner of the building shall notify maintenance workers of the \n        building, either in writing or by posting notice, that an \n        inspection has occurred and that an inspection report is \n        available for inspection.\n\nSEC. 9. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAW.\n\n    (a) Clean Air Act.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed or \ninterpreted to preempt, supersede, or otherwise affect any requirement \nto remove asbestos from a building pursuant to section 112 of the Clean \nAir Act (42 U.S.C. 7412), as implemented through regulations known as \nthe national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (40 C.F.R. \n61).\n    (b) Limited Requirements.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed \nor interpreted as a general requirement for inspections or operations \nand maintenance programs in public and commercial buildings. The \nrequirements of sections 6, 7, and 8 are established solely to enable \nlending institutions to satisfy the conditions of this Act for purposes \nof obtaining immunity from liability under section 3.\n\nSEC. 10.
