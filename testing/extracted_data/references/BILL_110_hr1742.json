FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the publication of the original study and comprehensive \n        list of recommendations in America Burning, written in 1974, \n        requested advances in fire prevention through the installation \n        of automatic sprinkler systems in existing buildings have yet \n        to be fully implemented;\n            (2) fire departments responded to approximately 1,600,000 \n        fires in 2005;\n            (3) there were 3,675 civilian deaths and 17,925 civilian \n        injuries resulting from fire in the United States in 2005;\n            (4) 87 firefighters were killed in 2005;\n            (5) fire caused $10,672,000,000 in direct property damage \n        in 2005, and sprinklers are responsible for a 70 percent \n        reduction in property damage from fires in public assembly, \n        educational, residential, commercial, industrial and \n        manufacturing buildings;\n            (6) fire departments respond to a fire every 20 seconds, a \n        fire breaks out in a structure every 61 seconds and in a \n        residential structure every 79 seconds in the United States;\n            (7) the Station Nightclub in West Warwick, Rhode Island, \n        did not contain an automated sprinkler system and burned down, \n        killing 100 people on February 20, 2003;\n            (8) due to an automated sprinkler system, not a single \n        person was injured from a fire beginning in the Fine Line Music \n        Cafe in Minneapolis after the use of pyrotechnics on February \n        17, 2003;\n            (9) the National Fire Protection Association has no record \n        of a fire killing more than 2 people in a completely \n        sprinklered public assembly, educational, institutional or \n        residential building where the system was properly installed \n        and fully operational;\n            (10) sprinkler systems dramatically improve the chances of \n        survival of those who cannot save themselves, specifically \n        older adults, young children and people with disabilities;\n            (11) the financial cost of upgrading fire counter-measures \n        in buildings built prior to fire safety codes is prohibitive \n        for most property owners;\n            (12) many State and local governments lack any requirements \n        for existing structures to contain automatic sprinkler systems;\n            (13) under the present straight-line method of \n        depreciation, there is a disincentive for building safety \n        improvements due to an extremely low rate of return on \n        investment; and\n            (14) the Nation is in need of incentives for the voluntary \n        installation and retrofitting of buildings with automated \n        sprinkler systems to save the lives of countless individuals \n        and responding firefighters as well as drastically reduce the \n        costs from property damage.\n\nSEC. 3.
