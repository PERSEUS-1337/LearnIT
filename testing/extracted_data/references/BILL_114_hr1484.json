FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Federal Government controls over 80 percent of all \n        of the land within the State of Nevada, which is a greater \n        percentage than any other State.\n            (2) The paucity of State land and privately controlled land \n        in Nevada severely constrains the size and diversity of \n        Nevada's economy.\n            (3) The Federal Government promised all new States, in \n        their statehood enabling Act contracts, that it would dispose \n        of federally controlled public lands within the borders of \n        those States.\n            (4) The Federal Government has honored this promise with 38 \n        States.\n            (5) The Federal Government has failed to honor this promise \n        with, and continues to control significant percentages of the \n        land within, the States of Alaska, Arizona, California, \n        Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, and \n        Washington.\n            (6) The United States Supreme Court has declared that \n        statehood enabling Act contracts are ``solemn compacts'' with \n        enforceable rights and obligations.\n            (7) Nevada could generate significant net revenue for the \n        benefit of its lands and people if it were afforded the \n        opportunity to manage an expanded State-controlled land \n        portfolio.\n            (8) A transfer of federally administered land to Nevada can \n        be accomplished in phases.\n\nSEC. 3.
