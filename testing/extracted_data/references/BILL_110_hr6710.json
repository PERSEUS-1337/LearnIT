FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Every Middle Eastern country that possesses significant \n        petroleum resources has long held those resources as national \n        assets.\n            (2) Several developments indicate that the historical \n        precedent of a nationalized Iraqi oil sector could be undercut \n        by United States interests. The Bush Administration has \n        aggressively pressured the Iraqi government to privatize its \n        oil resources and a United States oil company has secured an \n        oil contract with the Kurdistan Regional Government and a \n        former Administration official is reported to be seeking an oil \n        contract with the Kurdistan Regional Government.\n            (3) President George W. Bush released a list of benchmarks \n        in August 2006 by which to judge success in Iraq. These \n        benchmarks included the passage of a ``hydrocarbon act''. The \n        Administration has characterized the bill as a national revenue \n        sharing plan.\n            (4) Hunt Oil Company, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, has \n        signed a production sharing agreement for petroleum \n        exploration, signaling that the war with Iraq has made access \n        to Iraqi oil a reality for United States oil companies.\n            (5) The CEO of the Hunt Oil Company is a major campaign \n        contributor for President Bush, including a $35 million \n        contribution to the Bush Presidential Library. He has twice \n        been appointed to a seat on the President's Foreign \n        Intelligence Advisory Board. At the invitation of the then \n        Halliburton CEO, Richard Cheney, he served on the Halliburton \n        Board of Directors.\n            (6) The Hunt Oil deal is now part of an internal \n        investigation by the Department of State.\n            (7) News reports indicate that former Assistant Secretary \n        of Defense, Richard Perle, has been pursuing oil-drilling \n        contracts with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. Mr. Perle \n        served as chairman of the Defense Policy Advisory Committee \n        during the run up to the war in Iraq. He was an influential \n        advisor to the Department of Defense between 2001 and 2003 and \n        is credited with being an early advocate of invading Iraq and \n        as an Iraq war architect. Mr. Perle resigned from his \n        chairmanship on March 28, 2003, just after the United States \n        invasion of Iraq, amid controversy that there existed the \n        potential for his business interests to profit from the war in \n        Iraq.\n            (8) The Department of State recently led a team of United \n        States advisers who helped the Iraq Oil Ministry negotiate \n        technical service contracts to help with oil production. A \n        lobbyist representing efforts oil-friendly policies has called \n        these contracts ``a chance to get a foot in the door with \n        regards to future Iraqi [oil] production''.\n            (9) The Hunt Oil deal, the reported actions by Richard \n        Perle and speculation by United States oil interests undercuts \n        the stated United States policy of ``revenue sharing''.\n            (10) Certain Iraqis and analysts have concluded that the \n        ``hydrocarbon act'' is in fact a privatization scheme to ensure \n        control of Iraq oil by foreign oil companies.\n            (11) Certain Iraqis and analysts have concluded that the \n        ``hydrocarbon act'' is in fact a privatization scheme to ensure \n        control of Iraq oil by foreign oil companies.\n\nSEC. 3.
