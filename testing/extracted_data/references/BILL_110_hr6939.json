FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Title 38, United States Code, authorizes the Secretary \n        of Veterans Affairs to furnish hospital and domiciliary care, \n        medical services, nursing home care, and related services to \n        eligible and enrolled veterans, but such services can only be \n        provided to the extent that appropriated resources and \n        facilities are available for such purposes.\n            (2) For 19 out of the past 21 fiscal years, Congress has \n        not appropriated funds for medical care provided by the \n        Department of Veterans Affairs before the commencement of the \n        new fiscal year, causing the Department great challenges in \n        planning and managing health care for enrolled veterans, to the \n        detriment of those veterans.\n            (3) The cumulative effects of insufficient, late and \n        unpredictable health care funding endanger the viability of the \n        system and the specialized health care resources the Department \n        has developed to maintain and improve the health of the \n        Nation's sick and disabled veterans.\n            (4) Approved appropriation levels for the health care \n        programs of the Department have too often proven insufficient \n        over the past decade, requiring the Secretary of Veterans \n        Affairs to ration health care services and Congress to approve \n        supplemental appropriations.\n            (5) Providing sufficient, timely, and predictable funding \n        would ensure the government meets its obligation to provide \n        health care to sick and disabled veterans and ensure that all \n        veterans enrolled for care in the Department of Veterans \n        Affairs health care system have ready access to timely, quality \n        services.\n            (6) Providing sufficient, timely, and predictable funding \n        to the veterans health care system would eliminate year-to-year \n        uncertainty on funding levels that has prevented the Department \n        of Veterans Affairs from being able to adequately plan for and \n        meet the needs of veterans who are enrolled in the Department \n        health care system.\n\nSEC. 2.
