SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Motherhood \nMonitoring and Prevention Research Act of 1999''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The total maternal mortality has not declined in the \n        United States since 1982.\n            (2) The four-fold increase in risk of maternal death among \n        black women compared to white women is one of the largest \n        racial disparities among the public health indicators.\n            (3) United States vital statistics data indicate that \n        between 1987 and 1996 at least 3,086 women died as a \n        consequence of pregnancy or its complications in the United \n        States.\n            (4) Misclassification on death certificates causes these \n        data to underestimate maternal mortality, and the true number \n        of maternal deaths is estimated to be 1.3 to 3 times higher \n        than that reported in vital statistics records, indicating a \n        need for improved surveillance and public monitoring of this \n        outcome.\n            (5) Early diagnosis and effective treatment of pregnancy \n        complications are critical to reduce maternal mortality.\n            (6) Underserved populations many times live in \n        socioeconomic conditions that lack the support systems and \n        financial resources necessary to ensure quality health care for \n        expectant mothers and infant newborns.\n            (7) By investing in public health surveillance and \n        prevention research to monitor and identify causes of maternal \n        mortality and in maternal health programs to promote maternal \n        health, the risk of maternal mortality and morbidity can be \n        reduced in the United States.\n\nSEC. 2.
