FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On August 24, 1997, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n        Staff assured Congress in writing that the acquisition of an \n        intercontinental ballistic missile capability by a rogue nation \n        without the detection of the United States intelligence \n        community would be an ``unlikely event''.\n            (2) The United States intelligence community did not detect \n        the August 31, 1998 launching of an intercontinental multistage \n        rocket by the Government of the People's Democratic Republic of \n        Korea.\n            (3) On May 11, 1998 and May 13, 1998, the Government of \n        India broke a 24-year voluntary moratorium by conducting 5 \n        underground nuclear tests.\n            (4) The Secretary of Defense predicted thereafter that \n        these tests by the Government of India could induce other \n        nations to obtain nuclear weapons technologies.\n            (5) On May 28, 1998, the Government of Pakistan announced \n        that for the first time, it had conducted 5 underground nuclear \n        tests and acknowledged ongoing efforts to place nuclear \n        warheads on missiles capable of striking any target in India.\n            (6) The Director of Central Intelligence has accepted the \n        June 2, 1998, findings of an independent investigation \n        revealing that the Central Intelligence Agency lacked adequate \n        analytical capabilities to detect the explosions in India \n        despite satellite-generated evidence to the contrary and \n        repeated declarations by representatives of the Government of \n        India of an intent to improve India's nuclear arsenal.\n            (7) Written assessments by the United States Air Force and \n        the Central Intelligence Agency conflicted on the issue of \n        whether the May 10, 1996 transmission to the Government of \n        China of a private industry report exploring the potential \n        causes of an earlier rocket crash contained information that \n        may advance the capabilities of China to launch missiles \n        equipped with nuclear warheads.\n            (8) The President did not receive or review the Air Force \n        assessment prior to his February 18, 1998, approval of a \n        license for the export of a commercial satellite to China.\n            (9) A March 11, 1998, report by the National Air \n        Intelligence Center concluded that Chinese strategic missiles \n        equipped with nuclear warheads pose a threat to the United \n        States.\n\nSEC. 3.
