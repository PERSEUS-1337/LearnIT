    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Space Exploration Act of 2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is in the national interest of the United States to \n        have a vigorous, outward-looking program of space exploration, \n        encompassing both robotic spacecraft missions and human space \n        flight.\n            (2) The United States has achieved major accomplishments in \n        its human space flight program over the last 4 decades, \n        including the first crewed lunar landing, the first reusable \n        crewed Space Shuttle, and the first truly international Space \n        Station.\n            (3) There currently is no commitment to the accomplishment \n        of any challenging goals in human space flight after the \n        completion of the International Space Station.\n            (4) While a significant amount of scientific research can \n        and should be accomplished by robotic means, a comprehensive \n        plan of scientific exploration of the solar system and search \n        for life beyond Earth will require both robotic spacecraft \n        missions and human space flight to achieve its goals.\n            (5) Properly coordinated, the Nation's human space flight \n        program does not compete with robotic exploration but instead \n        complements it and provides additional capabilities for \n        scientific research.\n            (6) The successful repair and servicing of the Hubble Space \n        Telescope demonstrates the potential for the productive \n        participation of the human space flight program in advancing \n        the goals of scientific exploration.\n            (7) There have been numerous commissions and study panels \n        over the last 30 years that have articulated goals for the \n        future of human space flight, and additional studies to \n        establish goals are not needed at this time.\n            (8) While there are significant technical and programmatic \n        hurdles to be overcome in carrying out human space flight \n        activities beyond low Earth orbit, the main hurdle to be \n        overcome is the lack of a national commitment to such \n        activities.\n            (9) In the absence of a commitment to specific and \n        challenging human space flight goals, programs to develop \n        generic technological capabilities for human space flight are \n        likely to be unfocused, inefficient, and short-lived.\n            (10) It is in the national interest of the United States to \n        commit to a challenging set of incremental goals for the \n        Nation's human space flight program in order to facilitate the \n        scientific exploration of the solar system and aid in the \n        search for life beyond Earth and to commit to the attainment of \n        those goals.\n            (11) While the ultimate goal of human space flight in the \n        inner solar system is the exploration of the planet Mars, there \n        are other important goals for exploration of the inner solar \n        system that will advance our scientific understanding and allow \n        the United States to develop and demonstrate capabilities that \n        will be needed for the scientific exploration and eventual \n        settlement of Mars.\n            (12) A bold and sustained human space flight initiative of \n        scientific exploration should contain progressively more \n        challenging objectives, including missions to the Earth-Sun \n        libration points, Earth-orbit crossing asteroids, the lunar \n        surface, the satellites of Mars, and the surface of Mars.\n            (13) A human space flight initiative with incremental goals \n        and milestones will allow a continuing series of \n        accomplishments to be achieved throughout the duration of the \n        initiative, permit the ``lessons learned'' and capabilities \n        acquired from previous implementation steps to be incorporated \n        into subsequent phases of the initiative, and allow adjustments \n        to be made to the implementation of the initiative as new \n        opportunities or challenges arise.\n            (14) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n        should develop a roadmap and implementation plan for a \n        progressive program of human space flight beyond low Earth \n        orbit in support of the scientific exploration of the solar \n        system and the search for life beyond Earth.\n            (15) Existing and planned investments in the Space Shuttle, \n        International Space Station, and the Space Launch Initiative \n        should be leveraged to help advance the goals of the human \n        space flight initiative while avoiding duplication of effort.\n            (16) The President should ensure that sufficient resources \n        are provided to the National Aeronautics and Space \n        Administration and that appropriate financial management \n        controls are in place to ensure that the implementation plan \n        can be carried out in a timely and cost-effective manner.\n            (17) The United States captured the imagination of the \n        peoples of the world and inspired a generation of young people \n        to enter careers in science and engineering when it \n        successfully landed humans on the surface of the Moon in the \n        years 1969 through 1972.\n            (18) A bold and sustained human space exploration \n        initiative has the potential to inspire a new generation of \n        young people in the same way as the Apollo program did.\n            (19) Properly constructed, a bold and sustained human space \n        exploration initiative has the potential to engage the \n        international community in peaceful cooperation in space.\n            (20) Completion of the International Space Station with a \n        full crew complement of 7 astronauts and robust research \n        capabilities is essential if the United States is to carry out \n        successfully a comprehensive initiative of scientific \n        exploration of the solar system that involves human space \n        flight.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION.\n\n    For purposes of this Act the term ``Administrator'' means the \nAdministrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n SEC. 4.
