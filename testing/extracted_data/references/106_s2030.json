FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) By the end of 2000, 10,400,000 children in Sub-Saharan \n        Africa will have lost their mother, or both parents, to \n        Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).\n            (2) In the next decade, 40,000,000 children will become \n        orphans as a result of the AIDS pandemic, most of them located \n        in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n            (3) Over the next 20 years, AIDS threatens to reduce \n        substantially economic progress in the nations of Sub-Saharan \n        Africa.\n            (4) Success or failure in fighting the AIDS pandemic will \n        effect the spread of the disease to India, Asia, and the states \n        of the former Soviet Union.\n            (5) By 2005, more than 100,000,000 people worldwide will \n        have been infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the \n        precursor to AIDS.\n            (6) Effective assistance for children orphaned by AIDS, and \n        for those caring for such children, must strengthen the \n        surviving families.\n            (7) The development and expansion of sustainable \n        microfinance institutions that provide access to credit, \n        savings, and other financial services to the very poor, \n        especially women, are critical components in a global strategy \n        to address the devastating economic and social effects of AIDS.\n            (8) Microfinance programs are particularly effective in \n        helping those left to care for AIDS orphans by providing the \n        caregivers the means of pursuing a livelihood.\n            (9) Microfinance programs have been shown to be \n        particularly effective in permitting individuals with AIDS to \n        have access to services and credit not otherwise available to \n        such individuals, including health insurance, life insurance, \n        counseling, and group support.\n            (10) Food aid can be a critical component in mitigating the \n        impact of AIDS on communities by addressing the nutritional \n        needs of individuals with AIDS and assisting households left \n        destitute by AIDS, and as a part of a larger, comprehensive \n        effort to strengthen and restore sustainable livelihood \n        strategies for households and communities affected by AIDS.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to make microfinance programs an important component of \n        United States policy in fighting the effects of the Acquired \n        Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic worldwide; and\n            (2) to encourage targeted use of food and food-related \n        assistance for humanitarian purposes and for sustainable \n        development in communities affected by AIDS.\n\nSEC. 4. MICROCREDIT PROGRAMS.\n\n    Chapter 1 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \nU.S.C. 2151 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 131.
