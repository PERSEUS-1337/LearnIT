SHORT TITLE; REFERENCE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer Freedom \nProtection Act''.\n    (b) References.--Each amendment to or repeal of a section or other \nprovision of law that is made by this Act shall be considered to be an \namendment to or repeal of, respectively, that provision of the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), unless another \npublic law is specified as being the subject of the amendment or \nrepeal.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Food and Drug Administration has only authorized \n        three health claims for dietary supplements since enactment of \n        the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 despite the \n        publication of tens of thousands of peer reviewed scientific \n        journal articles on the effect of nutrients on disease and \n        health-related conditions.\n            (2) Scientific information on the nutrient-disease \n        relationship contained in peer reviewed scientific journals is \n        indispensable to the exercise of informed choice in the food \n        and dietary supplement marketplaces.\n            (3) The Food and Drug Administration's failure to authorize \n        health claims has violated the first amendment rights of health \n        claimants and American consumers alike and is injurious to \n        public health because it denies consumers access to information \n        necessary to exercise informed choice at the point of sale.\n            (4) Contrary to the will of Congress, on repeated occasions \n        the Food and Drug Administration has denied and suppressed \n        health claims that would otherwise convey to consumers \n        important information on the association between nutrients and \n        diseases.\n            (5) Contrary to the will of Congress, the Food and Drug \n        Administration's treatment of dietary supplements and its \n        implementation of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of \n        1990 and the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of \n        1997 health claims provisions has hindered, rather than \n        fostered, the dissemination of truthful and nonmisleading \n        information about the nutrient-disease relationship.\n            (6) The Food and Drug Administration has failed to \n        implement faithfully and fully the first amendment mandate in \n        Pearson v. Shalala, 164 F.3d 650 (D.C. Cir. 1999), and \n        continues to suppress, rather than authorize, health claims.\n\nSEC. 3. FOOD AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENT CLAIMS.\n\n    (a) Conforming Amendments.--Section 403 (21 U.S.C. 343) is \namended--\n            (1) in paragraph (r)(1), by inserting ``or a dietary \n        supplement'' after ``food'' but before ``intended'' and by \n        inserting ``or dietary supplement'' after ``food'' but before \n        ``which'';\n            (2) in paragraph (r)(1)(A), by inserting ``or dietary \n        supplement'' after ``food'';\n            (3) in paragraph (r)(1)(B), by inserting ``or dietary \n        supplement'' after ``food'' and by adding at the end of the \n        paragraph the following: ``For purposes of this subparagraph, a \n        claim that characterizes such a relationship includes claims to \n        diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent any disease or \n        health-related condition.'';\n            (4) in paragraph (r)(2)(G), by inserting ``or dietary \n        supplement'' after ``food'';\n            (5) in paragraph (r)(2)(G)(iii), by inserting ``or dietary \n        supplement'' after ``food'';\n            (6) by striking subclause (iv) of subparagraph (r)(2)(G);\n            (7) by striking paragraph (r)(2)(H);\n            (8) in paragraph (r)(3)(A)(ii), by inserting ``or dietary \n        supplement'' after ``food'' but before ``for'';\n            (9) in paragraph (r)(3)(C), by inserting ``or dietary \n        supplement'' after ``food'';\n            (10) in paragraph (r)(3)(C)(iii), by inserting ``or dietary \n        supplement'' after ``food'';\n            (11) by striking subclause (iv) of paragraph (r)(3)(C);\n            (12) by striking subclause (A)(i) of paragraph (r)(4);\n            (13) by striking subclause (D) of paragraph (r)(5); and\n            (14) by striking subparagraph (7) of paragraph (r).\n    (b) Health Claims in General.--Section 403 (21 U.S.C. 343) is \namended in paragraph (r)(3) by amending clause (B) to read as follows:\n    ``(B)(i) The Secretary shall promulgate no later than 100 days \nafter the Secretary receives a claim of the type described in \nsubparagraph (1)(B) regulations authorizing the claim in a form that \naccurately reflects the degree of scientific evidence supporting the \nclaim unless the Secretary determines based on all publicly available \nscientific evidence that no scientific evidence supports the claim and \nthat the claim is inherently misleading. The Secretary may require that \nthe claim be accompanied by a disclaimer disclosing the absence of \nconclusive evidence, the presence of conflicting evidence, or such \nother information about the claim as is needed to avoid a misleading \nconnotation.\n    ``(ii) If within 100 days after the Secretary receives a claim, the \nSecretary promulgates neither regulations authorizing the claim nor a \nfinal decision denying the claim, the claim shall be deemed authorized \nand shall be accompanied by the following disclaimer until such time as \nthe Secretary complies with the requirements of subparagraph (3)(B)(i): \n`The Food and Drug Administration has not evaluated the scientific \nevidence concerning this claim.'.\n    ``(iii) If the Secretary denies a claim of the type described in \nsubparagraph (1)(B) and the claimant informs the Secretary in writing \nthat the claimant objects to the Secretary's denial, no later than 30 \ndays after the Secretary receives the objection, the Secretary shall \nfile a petition to review the order with the United States Court of \nAppeals for the D.C. Circuit, naming the claimant as a defendant and \nseeking a declaratory judgment on whether the Secretary's denial \ncomplies with subparagraph (3)(B)(i) and the first amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution. For purposes of subparagraph (3)(B) the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has exclusive \njurisdiction and venue. If the United States Court of Appeals for the \nD.C. Circuit declares the Secretary's denial invalid, the Court shall \norder the Secretary to pay the claimant from funds appropriated by \nCongress to the Food and Drug Administration no later than 60 days \nafter the Court's decision is filed with the Clerk of the Court the \nactual costs and fees incurred by the claimant for participating in the \nproceedings before the United States Court of Appeals, exclusive of all \nother recompense to which the claimant would otherwise be entitled \nunder Federal law.''.\n    (c) Health Claims Based on Government Statements.--Section 403 (21 \nU.S.C. 343) is amended by striking subclauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph \n(r)(3)(C) and inserting the following:\n            ``(i) the claim is a verbatim quotation of a statement \n        published by a scientific body of the United States Government \n        about the relationship between a nutrient, including a dietary \n        supplement, and a disease or health-related condition and \n        includes a citation to the author, the title of the \n        publication, the date of publication, and the page on which the \n        statement appears, provided that the claimant submits to the \n        Secretary a written notice of the exact words used in the claim \n        and of the citation at least 30 days before first introducing \n        the food or dietary supplement into interstate commerce with \n        the claim; or\n            ``(ii) the claim paraphrases in a nonmisleading manner a \n        statement published by a scientific body of the United States \n        Government about the relationship between a nutrient and a \n        disease or health-related condition and includes a citation to \n        the author, the title of the publication, the date of \n        publication, and the page on which the statement appears, \n        provided that the claimant submits to the Secretary a written \n        notice of the exact words used in the claim and of the citation \n        at least 30 days before first introducing the food or dietary \n        supplement into interstate commerce with the claim; and''.\n    (d) Disclaimers for Health Claims Based on Government Statements.--\nSection 403 (21 U.S.C. 343) is amended by adding at the end of \nsubclause (iii) of paragraph (r)(3)(C) the following: ``The Secretary \nmay not deny authorization of a claim made in compliance with the \nprovisions of subclause (i) or (ii) of clause (C) but may require that \nthe claim be accompanied by a disclaimer disclosing the absence of \nconclusive evidence, the presence of conflicting evidence, or such \nother information about the claim as is needed to avoid a misleading \nconnotation.
