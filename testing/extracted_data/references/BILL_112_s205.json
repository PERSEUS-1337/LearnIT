FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States is an Arctic nation with--\n                    (A) an approximately 700-mile border with the \n                Arctic Ocean;\n                    (B) more than 100,000,000 acres of land above the \n                Arctic Circle; and\n                    (C) an even broader area defined as Arctic by \n                temperature, which includes the Bering Sea and Aleutian \n                Islands;\n            (2) the Arctic region of the United States--\n                    (A) is home to an indigenous population that has \n                subsisted for millennia on the abundance of marine \n                mammals, fish, and wildlife in the Arctic region, many \n                of which are unique to the region;\n                    (B) is known to the indigenous population as \n                Inuvikput or the ``place where we live''; and\n                    (C) has produced more than 16,000,000,000 barrels \n                of oil and, according to the United States Geological \n                Survey, may hold an additional 30,000,000,000 barrels \n                of oil and 220,000,000,000,000 cubic feet of natural \n                gas, making the region of fundamental importance to the \n                national interest of the United States;\n            (3) temperatures in the United States Arctic region have \n        warmed by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius over the past half-century, a \n        rate of increase that is twice the global average;\n            (4) the Arctic ice pack is rapidly diminishing and \n        thinning, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n        Administration estimates the Arctic Ocean may be ice-free \n        during summer months in as few as 30 years;\n            (5) those changes to the Arctic region are having a \n        significant impact on the indigenous people of the Arctic, the \n        communities and ecosystems of the people, as well as the marine \n        mammals, fish, and wildlife on which the people depend; and\n            (6) those changes are opening new portions of the United \n        States Arctic continental shelf to possible development for \n        offshore oil and gas, commercial fishing, marine shipping, and \n        tourism.\n\nSEC. 3.
