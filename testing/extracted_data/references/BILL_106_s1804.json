FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States Department of Commerce, through its \n        Office of Technology Policy, has reported in June, 1999, that \n        the United States will require more than 1.3 million new \n        highly-skilled core information technology workers by the year \n        2006.\n            (2) The need for computer scientists, computer engineers, \n        and systems analysts by 2006 is projected to be more than \n        double the number of such scientists, engineers, and analysts \n        in 1996.\n            (3) The supply of new graduates qualified for the positions \n        described in paragraph (2) is anticipated to be well short of \n        half the number needed.\n            (4) The lack of qualified workers is due in part to a lack \n        of sufficient numbers of students pursuing advanced degrees in \n        mathematics, science, and engineering technology.\n            (5) The number of degrees in technical science and \n        engineering fields awarded by United States institutions of \n        higher learning have declined since 1990.\n            (6) Foreign national students in the United States were \n        awarded 47 percent of Doctorate degrees in engineering, 38 \n        percent of Master's degrees, and 46 percent of Doctorate \n        degrees in computer science in 1996.\n            (7) The United States is a leader in the global development \n        of technology related enterprises.\n            (8) If the United States cannot meet the needs of industry \n        to allow continued expansion and innovation in the 21st \n        century, American companies will locate in those countries \n        which do have the technical base to meet those needs and this \n        will be counterproductive to the American economy.\n            (9) Section 8 of Article I of the Constitution grants \n        Congress the power ``To regulate Commerce with foreign nations \n        and among the several States.''.\n            (10) In order to maintain a strong domestic economy and \n        provide for the national defense, it is critical that the \n        United States maintain its leadership position in technology.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide incentives \nand opportunities for the United States' improving the mathematics, \nscience, engineering, and technology resources in order to maintain the \nUnited States leadership in technology, and to permit United States \ncompanies to continue the technology-related expansion of the United \nStates' domestic economy and international economic presence.\n\nSEC. 3. PROGRAM ESTABLISHED.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with \nthe Director of the Office of Science Technology and the Director of \nthe National Science Foundation, shall establish and administer a \nprogram under this Act to strengthen the scientific, mathematical, \nengineering, and technology resources of the United States in order to \nensure the United States continued global leadership in technology-\nrelated commerce.\n    (b) Grants.--The program shall include grants of financial \nassistance, awarded on a competitive basis, to support the advancement \nand improvement of mathematics, science, engineering, and technology \ncompetencies and resources to assure continued growth, leadership, and \ncompetitiveness of United States based companies in interstate and \ninternational commerce.\n    (c) Recipients.--The Secretary may award grants under subsection \n(b) to business enterprises, organizations supporting mathematics, \nscientific, engineering, technology research and advancement, teachers, \nschools, school districts, or institutions of higher learning.\n    (d) Criteria.--The Secretary shall award grants for programs that \ncan demonstrate an economically beneficial return on investment and \nachievement in the advancement of science, math, engineering, and \ntechnology competencies and resources.\n\nSEC. 4. TEMPORARY SKILLED PERSONNEL IN MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE, \n              ENGINEERING, AND TECHNOLOGY.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding clauses (iii), (iv), and (v) of \nsection 214(g)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n1184(g)(1)(A)), the total number of aliens who may be issued visas or \notherwise provided nonimmigrant status during fiscal years 2000 through \n2006 under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of that Act (8 U.S.C. \n1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b)) shall not be subject to numerical limitation, and \nshall be subject to numerical limitations after 2006 as provided by \nlaw.\n    (b) Certain Applications Given Preference.--In processing \napplications for visas or other nonimmigrant status under the \nImmigration and Nationality Act, as modified by subsection (a), the \nSecretary of State shall give preferential consideration to \napplications from foreign national students who are graduates of post-\nsecondary schools in the United States with advanced degrees in \nmathematics, science, engineering, or technology.\n    (c) Funding for Grants.--\n            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding section 286(s) of such Act \n        (8 U.S.C. 1356(s)), for fiscal years 2000 through 2006 51.3 \n        percent of the amounts deposited into the H-1B Nonimmigrant \n        Petitioner Account established by paragraph (1) of that section \n        shall be available to the Secretary of Commerce until expended \n        under section 3 of this Act.\n            (2) Job training.--For fiscal years 2000 through 2006, \n        section 286(s)(2) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1356(s)(2)) shall be \n        applied by substituting ``5 percent'' for ``56.3 percent''."
