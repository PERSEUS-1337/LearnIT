    "title": "AB 1484",
    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\n(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(1) California is home to a large number of military personnel, including 150,000 active duty personnel.\n(2) Military families are a unique population with unique circumstances. The children of military families face constant transition, including family mobility and parental deployment.\n(3) Military families move more than twice as often as civilian families. Forty percent of officers and 60 percent of enlisted personnel move during the school year. Thus, the lower the rank of the military family member, the more often the family moves.\n(4) During a time of war, military families endure the strains of long-term separation as one or both parents may be deployed overseas.\n(5) During parental deployment children are often anxious, stressed, and confused. Child care providers and preschools can be places where stability and routine can provide security. The routine helps to cushion the impact of parental deployment.\n(6) Early education can be a determining factor in the early academic success of a pupil from a military family by providing educational enrichment, as well as a stable and nurturing learning environment.\n(b) Given these special circumstances, it is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to ensure that military families have access to the child care development services that their children need.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 8209.5 is added to the Education Code, to read:\n8209.5.\n(a) For purposes of determining eligibility for services offered pursuant to this chapter, the income of an individual who is on federal active duty, state active duty, active duty for special work, or Active Guard and Reserve duty in the military shall not include the amount of the basic allowance for housing pursuant to Section 403 of Title 37 of the United States Code provided to the individual that is equal to the lowest rate of the allowance for the military housing area in which the individual resides.\n(b) This section does not affect the priorities for federal and state subsidized child development services established pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 8263.\nSECTION 1.\nSection 35035.5 is added to the\nEducation Code\n, to read:\n35035.5.\n(a)The superintendent of a school district shall not transfer or assign a certificated employee with the primary responsibility of being the classroom teacher of record to a schoolsite if the transfer or assignment would result in the reduction of the average effective teacher experience factor at the schoolsite to less than 90 percent of the average effective teaching experience factor in the school district for schools of the same type.\n(b)The applicable effective teaching experience factor shall be determined by months, subject to the following conditions:\n(1)The maximum number of months that may be counted for a single certificated employee is 60 months.\n(2)At the discretion of the governing board of the school district, a certificated instructional employee with the highest rating on a multiple positive-rating level performance scale may be counted for up to 60 months, regardless of his or her length of service in the school district.\n(3)Months during an evaluation cycle in which a probationary or permanent certificated instructional employee received a final evaluation rating of unsatisfactory shall not be counted.\n(4)Months during which a certificated employee was assigned primarily noninstructional duties shall not be counted.\n(c)Notwithstanding any other law, the state board shall waive any part of this section or any regulation adopted by the state board that implements this section upon the request of the governing board of a school district if the governing board of the school district does all of the following:\n(1)Demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the state board, that the certificated employee subject to transfer or assignment has the appropriate credential necessary to teach a specific course, grade level, or program of study, there is a critical shortage for certificated employees with such a credential in the local labor market, and the placement would enable the schoolsite to achieve its stated goals on behalf of all pupils, including identified subgroups, as identified for that schoolsite in the school district\u2019s local control and accountability plan adopted pursuant to Section 52060.\n(2)Provides written documentation that the exclusive representative of certificated employees has been consulted.\n(3)Provides written documentation that the principal of the schoolsite has approved of the proposed transfer or assignment, and is aware of the related staff development, mentoring, and evaluation workload the transfer or assignment would necessitate.\n(d)The prohibition in this section applies to the exercise of authority by any administrator or other certificated school employee responsible for certificated employee assignment decisions, notwithstanding subdivision (e) or (f) of Section 35035.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 37037 is added to the\nEducation Code\n, to read:\n37037.\n(a)A pupil shall not knowingly be assigned to a classroom where the teacher of record received an unsatisfactory performance rating in the most recent evaluation and assessment of the employee\u2019s job performance unless the employee is actively participating in a California Peer Assistance and Review Program established pursuant to Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 44500) of Chapter 3 of Part 25 or all of the following conditions are met:\n(1)The teacher of record is receiving the assistance required by subdivision (b) of Section 44664 and is being supported with the assistance and guidance of a certificated employee who possesses a valid certification for the same level and type of credential required for the subject matter and grade level being taught.\n(2)The effective teaching experience factor calculated pursuant to Section 35035.5 of the employee providing assistance and guidance is not less than the average effective teaching experience factor in the school district for schools of the same type.\n(3)The employee providing assistance and guidance to the teacher of record has not received an unsatisfactory performance rating in the three most recent evaluation cycles.\n(b)Any provision of this section may be waived on an individual basis by a vote of the local governing board of the school district if a parent or guardian of a pupil has been notified in writing in the home language of the pupil and the parent or guardian has approved the submission of the waiver request in writing before the proposed assignment.\nSEC. 3.\nIf the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code."
