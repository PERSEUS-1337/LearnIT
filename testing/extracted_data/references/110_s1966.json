FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On May 30, 2007, President George W. Bush announced his \n        intent to double the commitment of the United States to fight \n        global HIV/AIDS with a new $30,000,000,000, 5-year proposal to \n        reauthorize the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \n        Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003.\n            (2) With the enactment of the President's fiscal year 2008 \n        budget, the United States Government will have committed \n        $18,000,000,000 to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS \n        Relief (PEPFAR), which exceeds the original 5-year, \n        $15,000,000,000 commitment.\n            (3) After 3 years of PEPFAR implementation, the American \n        people have supported treatment of 1,100,000 people in the 15 \n        focus countries, including more than 1,000,000 people in \n        Africa.\n            (4) PEPFAR is on track to meet its 5-year goals to support \n        treatment for 2,000,000 people, prevention of 7,000,000 new \n        infections, and care for 10,000,000 people, including orphans \n        and vulnerable children.\n            (5) The success of PEPFAR is rooted in support for country-\n        owned strategies and programs with commitment of resources and \n        dedication to results, achieved through the power of \n        partnerships with governments, with nongovernmental, faith-\n        based, and community-based organizations, and with the private \n        sector.\n            (6) United States efforts to address global HIV/AIDS will \n        be multiplied by engaging in partnerships with countries \n        dedicating to fighting their HIV epidemics and with \n        multilateral partners, such as the Global Fund, which can help \n        leverage international resources and build upon the efforts of \n        the United States to combat global HIV/AIDS. In his \n        announcement of his intent to double the commitment of the \n        United States to fight global HIV/AIDS, President Bush \n        reiterated his call for developed and developing countries, in \n        particular middle-income countries where projections suggest \n        many new infections will occur, to increase their contributions \n        to fighting AIDS. HIV/AIDS is a global crisis that requires a \n        global response. The United States currently provides as many \n        resources for global HIV/AIDS as all other developed country \n        governments combined. But only together can we turn the tide \n        against the global epidemic.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to expand PEPFAR, \nincluding the expansion of life-saving treatment, comprehensive \nprevention programs, and care for those in need, including orphans and \nvulnerable children, in the next 5-year period as a signal of the \ncommitment of the United States to support, strengthen, and expand \nUnited States and global efforts to address these health crises in \npartnership with others.\n\nSEC. 5. UNITED STATES FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION IN THE GLOBAL FUND.\n\n    (a) Authority To Increase Proportional Support.--Section 202(d) of \nthe Act (22 U.S.C. 7622(d)) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing new paragraph:\n            ``(5) Authority to increase proportional support.--\n                    ``(A) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n                findings:\n                            ``(i) The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \n                        Tuberculosis and Malaria is an innovative \n                        financing mechanism to combat the three \n                        diseases, and it has made progress in many \n                        areas.\n                            ``(ii) The United States Government is the \n                        largest supporter of the Fund, both in terms of \n                        resources and technical support.\n                            ``(iii) The United States made the founding \n                        contribution to the Funds, remains committed to \n                        the original vision for the Fund, and is fully \n                        committed to its success.\n                    ``(B) Authority.--The President may increase \n                proportional support for the Fund, within the amount \n                authorized to be appropriated by this Act, if \n                benchmarks for performance, accountability, and \n                transparency are satisfactorily met, and if the Fund \n                remains committed to its founding principles.
