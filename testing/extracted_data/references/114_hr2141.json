    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``International Insurance Standards \nTransparency and Policyholder Protection Act of 2015''.\n\nSEC. 2. CONSULTATION CONCERNING NEGOTIATIONS WITH RESPECT TO \n              INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The State-based system for insurance regulation in the \n        United States has served American consumers well for more than \n        150 years.\n            (2) Protecting policyholders by guaranteeing an insurer's \n        ability to pay claims has been the hallmark of the successful \n        U.S. system and should be the paramount objective of domestic \n        prudential regulation and emerging international standards.\n            (3) The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \n        Protection Act (Public Law 111-203) reaffirmed the State-based \n        insurance regulatory system, while giving the Board of \n        Governors of the Federal Reserve System authority to regulate \n        certain non-bank entities on a consolidated basis, including \n        insurers that have been designated systemically important \n        financial institutions or that include an insured depository \n        institution and are regulated by the States at the insurance \n        entity level.\n            (4) United States regulators participating in discussions \n        or negotiations regarding international insurance regulatory \n        frameworks should support standards designed solely for the \n        protection of policyholders.\n            (5) The Federal Insurance Office should seek advice and \n        recommendations from a diverse group of outside experts in \n        performing the duties and authorities of the Office to ensure \n        policy holders are protected.\n    (b) Negotiating Objectives for International Insurance Regulatory \nFrameworks.--The negotiating objectives of the United States regarding \ninternational insurance regulatory frameworks are as follows:\n            (1) To seek standards, requirements, and rules focused \n        solely on protection of policy holders, as reflected in the \n        United States solvency regime.\n            (2) To promote a principles-based approach to insurance \n        supervision, in which capital adequacy is assessed using risk-\n        based capital requirements combined with qualitative risk \n        assessment and management tools on a legal entity basis, rather \n        than a quantitative global capital standard for insurance \n        groups.\n            (3) To seek the most efficient and least disruptive \n        approaches to enhancing regulatory assessment of the capital \n        adequacy of insurance groups, including tools that are already \n        in place, such as supervisory colleges, as well as the \n        evaluation of the capitalization of an insurance group using \n        the existing internal model of the group, where appropriate, \n        which captures the risks associated with each unique line of \n        business and geographic mix of the group.\n            (4) To negotiate an international insurance regulatory \n        framework that recognizes United States prudential measures as \n        equivalent to foreign measures.\n    (c) Prohibitions and Focus on Policy Holder Protection.--With \nrespect to negotiations related to any international insurance \nregulatory framework:\n            (1) Inappropriate bank capital standards.--United States \n        representatives shall not agree to, accept, or establish, and \n        shall use their voice and vote to oppose, any international \n        standard that applies to--\n                    (A) insurers, capital standards, and rules designed \n                for banks; or\n                    (B) any insurer that has not been designated a \n                systemically important financial institution under \n                United States law or a global systemically important \n                insurer by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, \n                capital standards and rules designed for systemically \n                important bank or non-bank financial institutions.\n            (2) Focus on policyholder protection.--\n                    (A) In general.--United States representatives \n                shall not agree to, accept, or establish, and shall use \n                their voice and vote to oppose, any capital standard or \n                rule applicable to United States insurance entities or \n                groups unless that standard is designed solely to help \n                ensure that sufficient funds are available to pay \n                claims to an insurer's policyholders in the event of \n                the liquidation of that entity.\n                    (B) Enhanced capital standards.--The limitation \n                under subparagraph (A) does not apply to enhanced \n                capital standards applicable to insurance entities or \n                groups designated under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank \n                Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (12 \n                U.S.C. 5323).\n    (d) Notice and Consultation.--\n

 under subsection (c) and with existing Federal and \n                State laws or regulations or policy related to \n                prudential regulation of insurance;\n                    (B) during the negotiations of such a regulatory \n                framework, including prior to significant decisions \n                points in the negotiations and prior to development of \n                interim drafts, and before agreeing to, accepting, or \n                establishing such framework, consult with the covered \n                congressional committees and the Federal Advisory
