SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SERVICE OF UNITED STATES ARMED \n              FORCES IN IRAQ AND POLITICAL RECONCILIATION IN IRAQ.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) the men and women of the United States Armed Forces \n        have served honorably and expertly in Operation Iraqi Freedom;\n            (2) political reconciliation in the Republic of Iraq is the \n        key component in providing stability in Iraq;\n            (3) political reconciliation cannot occur in the Republic \n        of Iraq without robust diplomatic efforts by the United States \n        and the international community;\n            (4) the overwhelming presence of the United States Armed \n        Forces in Iraq has neither encouraged nor precipitated the \n        political, religious, ethnic, and tribal leaders in Iraq to \n        achieve political and diplomatic solutions in providing \n        security and stability for their own nation;\n            (5) a defined schedule for redeployment of the United \n        States Armed Forces from Iraq, which is the only real remaining \n        political leverage available to the United States, is the \n        quickest, safest, and most responsible way to bring the Armed \n        Forces home;\n            (6) a defined schedule for redeployment requires the people \n        and government of Iraq to take responsibility for their future \n        and will help engage the international community to assist the \n        people and government of Iraq in making political progress; and\n            (7) continuous and extended deployments of the United \n        States Armed Forces have compromised United States military \n        readiness around the globe and reduced the ability of the \n        United States to respond to other international commitments, \n        notably Afghanistan.\n\nSEC. 3.
