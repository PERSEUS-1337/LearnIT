PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote global public \nhealth and America's national security by ensuring that innovations \ndeveloped at federally-funded institutions are available in eligible \ndeveloping countries at the lowest possible cost.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is in the national interest of the United States \n        that people around the world live healthier lives, and that \n        they perceive the United States in a more favorable light.\n            (2) The United States Government funds a major portion of \n        all academic research.\n            (3) Congress funds universities and Federal research \n        laboratories as institutions dedicated to the creation and \n        dissemination of knowledge in the public interest.\n            (4) The Federal Government's investment in science and \n        technology fuels a thriving pharmaceutical industry and rising \n        longevity and quality of life in the United States. In 2000, a \n        Senate Joint Economic Committee Report found that public \n        research was instrumental in developing 15 of the 21 drugs \n        considered by experts to have had the highest therapeutic \n        impact on society.\n            (5) Millions of people with HIV/AIDS in developing \n        countries need antiretroviral drugs. More than 40,000,000 \n        people worldwide have HIV and 95 percent of them live in \n        developing countries. Malaria, tuberculosis, and other \n        infectious diseases kill millions of people a year in \n        developing nations.\n            (6) The World Health Organization (``WHO'') has estimated \n        that \\1/3\\ of the world's population lacks regular access to \n        essential medicines, including antiretroviral drugs. The WHO \n        reported that just by improving access to existing medicines \n        roughly 10,000,000 lives could be saved around the world every \n        year.\n            (7) To help address the access to medicines crisis, the \n        World Health Organization's 2006 Commission on Intellectual \n        Property Rights, Innovation, and Public Health recommended that \n        universities adopt licensing practices designed to increase \n        access to medicines in developing countries.\n            (8) The Department of State has reported to Congress under \n        the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief that, ``[I]n \n        every case generics prices present an opportunity for cost \n        savings; in some cases, the branded price per pack of a drug is \n        up to 11 times the cost of the approved generic version.''.\n            (9) Since sales of the patented, brand-name versions of \n        such medicines are minimal or non-existent in many impoverished \n        regions of the world, allowing generic versions of those \n        medicines will have minimal impact on the sales of brand-name, \n        patented versions in such regions, or the licensing revenues of \n        publicly funded research institutions, while saving an untold \n        number of lives.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Associated medical product.--The term ``associated \n        medical product'', when used in relation to a subject \n        invention, means any medical product of which the manufacture, \n        use, sale, offering for sale, import, or export relies upon or \n        is covered by the rights guaranteed by title in that invention.\n            (2) Associated rights.--The term ``associated rights,'' \n        when used in relation to a subject invention, means--\n                    (A) all patent and marketing rights, possessed by a \n                current or former holder of title in that invention, or \n                licensee of rights guaranteed by such title, that are \n                reasonably necessary to make, use, sell, offer to sell, \n                import, export, or test any associated medical product \n                ever made, used, sold, offered for sale, imported, or \n                exported by that party; and\n                    (B) the right to rely on biological, chemical, \n                biochemical, toxicological, pharmacological, metabolic, \n                formulation, clinical, analytical, stability, and other \n                information and data for purposes of regulatory \n                approval of any associated medical product.\n            (3) Drug.--The term ``drug'' has the meaning given such \n        term in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act \n        (21 U.S.C. 321).\n            (4) Eligible country.--The term ``eligible country'' means \n        any country of which the economy is classified by the World \n        Bank as ``low-income'', or ``lower-middle-income''.\n            (5) Fair royalty.--The term ``fair royalty'', when used in \n        relation to a subject invention, means--\n                    (A) for a country classified by the World Bank as \n                ``low-income'' at the time of the sales on which \n                royalties are due, 2 percent of a licensee's net sales \n                of associated medical products in such country; and\n                    (B) for a country classified by the World Bank as \n                ``lower-middle-income'' at the time of sales on which \n                royalties are due, 5 percent of a licensee's net sales \n                of associated medical products in such country.\n            (6) Invention.--The term ``invention'' means any invention \n        or discovery which is or may be patentable or otherwise \n        protectable under title 35, United States Code, or any novel \n        variety of plant which is or may be protectable under the Plant \n        Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321 et seq.).\n            (7) Medical device.--The term ``medical device'' means a \n        device, as defined in section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, \n        and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(h)), and includes any device \n        component of any combination product, as that term is used in \n        section 503(g) of such Act (21 U.S.C. 353(g)).\n            (8) Medical product.--The term ``medical product'' means \n        any drug, treatment, prophylaxis, vaccine, or medical device.\n            (9) Neglected research.--The term ``neglected research'' \n        means any use of a subjected invention or the associated rights \n        in an effort to develop medical products for a rare disease or \n        condition, as defined in section 526(a)(2) of the Federal Food, \n        Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360bb(a)(2)).\n            (10) Subject institution.--The term ``subject institution'' \n        means any institution of higher education (as such term is \n        defined in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n        (20 U.S.C. 1001(a)) or research that receives federal financial \n        assistance, including Federal laboratories as defined in \n        section 12(d) of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act \n        of 1980 (15 U.S.C. 3710a(d)).\n            (11) Subject invention.--The term ``subject invention'' \n        means any invention--\n                    (A) conceived or first actually reduced to practice \n                by a subject institution, or its employees in the \n                course of their employment, on or after the effective \n                date of this Act; or\n                    (B) in which a subject institution holds title, \n                provided the invention was first conceived or reduced \n                to practice on or after the effective date of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4. ACCESS TO LIFESAVING MEDICINES DEVELOPED AT GOVERNMENT FUNDED \n              INSTITUTIONS.\n\n    (a) Grant of License.--\n            (1) In general.--As a condition of receiving Federal \n        assistance, any subject institution that conceives, reduced to \n        practice, or holds title in a subject invention shall be \n        required to grant irrevocable, perpetual, nonexclusive licenses \n        to the invention and any associated rights the institution may \n        own or ever acquire, to any party requesting such a license \n        pursuant to subsection (g).\n            (2) Purpose of license.--The licenses described under \n        paragraph (1) shall be for the sole purpose of--\n                    (A) supplying medical products in accordance with \n                subsection (e); or\n                    (B) conducting neglected research anywhere in the \n                world, royalty-free.\n    (b) Incorporation Into Title.--The open-licensing requirement \ncreated by subsection (a) and all licenses granted thereunder shall be \npart of the subject institution's title in a subject invention.
