    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Economic Recovery Adjustment Act of \n2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the deterioration of financial firms in 2008 and the \n        resulting crisis of confidence in the financial markets have \n        required broad intervention by the Federal Government in the \n        financial sector;\n            (2) the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, \n        signed by President Bush on October 3, 2008, included a \n        $700,000,000,000 Troubled Asset Relief Program (or ``TARP'') \n        for the express purpose of ``providing stability to and \n        preventing disruption in the economy and financial system'';\n            (3) the investment and commercial banks and other financial \n        institutions that have received taxpayer-funded bailouts \n        perform public functions supporting the operation of the \n        economy, in addition to their private profit-making functions;\n            (4) reports of billions of dollars in compensation and \n        obligations to executives have eroded public confidence in the \n        TARP, and have caused increasing opposition to other bailout \n        proposals, thereby impeding the Government's ability to address \n        the financial crisis;\n            (5) participation in the TARP and any other Federal \n        Government bailout program should be conditioned on a fair \n        restructuring of executive compensation obligations;\n            (6) taxpayer dollars should not support unreasonable \n        compensation to executives, particularly when in the absence of \n        taxpayer support, such compensation would be reduced as part of \n        a bankruptcy restructuring or liquidation; and\n            (7) establishing a due process forum will allow the \n        Government to ensure that executive compensation relying on \n        taxpayer funds is fair and reasonable, and that all sides enjoy \n        an opportunity to be heard.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act, the following definitions shall apply:\n            (1) Assisted entity.--The term ``assisted entity'' means \n        any recipient or applicant for assistance under the TARP.\n            (2) Panel.--The term ``Panel'' means the Temporary Economic \n        Recovery Oversight Panel established under section 7.\n            (3) Executive compensation.--The term ``executive \n        compensation'' means wages, salary, deferred compensation, \n        benefits, retirement arrangements, options, bonuses, office \n        fixtures, goods, or other property, travel, or entertainment, \n        vacation expenses, and any other form of compensation, \n        obligation, or expense that is not routinely provided to all \n        other employees of the assisted entity.\n            (4) Office.--The term ``Office'' means the Office of the \n        Taxpayer Advocate, established under section 4.\n            (5) TARP.--The terms ``TARP'' and ``TARP funds'' mean the \n        Troubled Asset Relief Program established under section 101 of \n        the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and funds \n        received thereunder, respectively, or pursuant to any successor \n        program.\n            (6) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means Secretary of \n        the Treasury.\n\nSEC. 4.
