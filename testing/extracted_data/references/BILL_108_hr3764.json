PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide assistance to \nStates for preparatory services, education and training programs, \nsupport service assistance, and referral services to displaced \nhomemakers, single parents, and individuals pursuing nontraditional \noccupations. Such assistance will create workforce pathways for \nindividuals in transition and help meet the employment needs of a high \nskilled, high wage information technology economy.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A high quality, productive, and diverse workforce is \n        necessary to compete in the global economy.\n            (2) There are approximately 15,000,000 displaced homemakers \n        and single parents in the United States for whom the pathway to \n        employment and economic independence requires education and \n        training services.\n            (3) The education and training needs of displaced \n        homemakers, single parents, and individuals pursuing \n        nontraditional occupations are not sufficiently met through \n        existing systems.\n            (4) Displaced homemakers and single parents represent an \n        untapped resource to enter unfilled positions in the \n        information technology sector.\n            (5) Employment in information technology and high skill, \n        high wage nontraditional careers offers wages and advancement \n        opportunities to help families achieve economic independence.\n            (6) Vocational education programs continue to be highly \n        sex-segregated resulting in a dearth of female students filling \n        the pipeline for jobs in the growing high-skill high-wage labor \n        market, especially in the areas of technology and the skilled \n        trades.\n\nSEC. 3.
