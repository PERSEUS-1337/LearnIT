SENSE OF THE SENATE RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF CHARITABLE \n              DEDUCTIONS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n            (1) The deduction for charitable contributions has been an \n        important and effective part of the tax code for almost 100 \n        years.\n            (2) The deduction for charitable contributions is unique as \n        it is the only provision that encourages taxpayers to give away \n        a portion of their income for the benefit of others.\n            (3) In 2012, nonprofit organizations provided 11,400,000 \n        jobs, accounting for 10.3 percent of the country's private-\n        sector workforce.\n            (4) In 2014, total charitable giving was estimated to be \n        $358,380,000,000 (a 7.1-percent increase from 2013) and \n        accounted for 2.1 percent of the gross domestic product.\n    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n            (1) encouraging charitable giving should be a goal of tax \n        reform; and\n            (2) Congress should ensure that the value and scope of the \n        deduction for charitable contributions is not diminished during \n        a comprehensive rewrite of the tax code.\n\nSEC. 3.
