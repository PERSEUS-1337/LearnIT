APPEALS PROCESS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1902(a)(39) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(39)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``shall exclude'' and inserting ``shall--\n                    ``(A) exclude'';\n            (2) by adding ``and'' after the semicolon at the end; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n                    ``(B) establish and codify a process whereby a \n                provider to whom payments have been suspended, in whole \n                or part, on the basis of credible allegations of fraud \n                against such provider may appeal any decision \n                (including a decision not to terminate or modify a \n                payment suspension that is already in place) by the \n                State agency that no good cause exists under the \n                regulations of the Secretary to terminate, modify, or \n                refrain from imposing such suspension of payment;''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--\n            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the amendments \n        made by this section shall take effect on the date that is 1 \n        year after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n            (2) Delay permitted if state legislation required.--In the \n        case of a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social \n        Security Act which the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n        determines requires State legislation (other than legislation \n        appropriating funds) in order for the plan to meet the \n        additional requirements imposed by this section, the State plan \n        shall not be regarded as failing to comply with the \n        requirements of such title solely on the basis of the failure \n        of the plan to meet such additional requirements before the 1st \n        day of the 1st calendar quarter beginning after the close of \n        the 1st regular session of the State legislature that ends \n        after the 1-year period beginning with the date of the \n        enactment of this section. For purposes of the preceding \n        sentence, in the case of a State that has a 2-year legislative \n        session, each year of the session is deemed to be a separate \n        regular session of the State legislature."
