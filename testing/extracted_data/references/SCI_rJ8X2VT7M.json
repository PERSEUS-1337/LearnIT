    "content": "This paper introduces an information theoretic co-training objective for unsupervised learning.   We consider the problem of predicting the future. Rather than predict future sensations (image pixels or sound waves) we predict ``hypotheses'' to be confirmed by future sensations. More formally, we assume a population distribution on pairs $(x,y)$ where we can think of $x$ as a past sensation and $y$ as a future sensation. We train both a predictor model $P_\\Phi(z|x)$ and a confirmation model $P_\\Psi(z|y)$ where we view $z$ as hypotheses (when predicted) or facts (when confirmed). For a population distribution on pairs $(x,y)$ we focus on the problem of measuring the mutual information between $x$ and $y$. By the data processing inequality this mutual information is at least as large as the mutual information between $x$ and $z$ under the distribution on triples $(x,z,y)$ defined by the confirmation model $P_\\Psi(z|y)$. The information theoretic training objective for $P_\\Phi(z|x)$ and $P_\\Psi(z|y)$ can be viewed as a form of co-training where we want the prediction from $x$ to match the confirmation from $y$. We give experiments on applications to learning phonetics on the TIMIT dataset."
