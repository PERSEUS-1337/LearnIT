FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The greatness of America is measured in many ways but \n        nowhere is it better reflected than in the costs paid by the \n        men and women who voluntarily assumed the risk of defending the \n        freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and who, without \n        reluctance or mental reservation, made the supreme sacrifice \n        for their country.\n            (2) It is altogether fitting and proper for the friends and \n        families of those fallen in battle to be able to mourn their \n        loss in peace and take comfort and pride in the consolation \n        that comes from the certain knowledge that they laid so costly \n        a sacrifice on the altar of freedom.\n            (3) That to secure this temporary but hallowed moment of \n        peace, reflection, and healing, it is appropriate to place \n        reasonable restrictions on those individuals and groups who \n        seek to use the occasion of a funeral, burial, or memorial \n        service of a veteran to stage a public demonstration intended \n        to turn a private gathering of private persons into a public \n        spectacle for the unconscionable purpose of attracting public \n        attention and gratuitously inflicting unnecessary emotional \n        pain on the deceased veteran's families and friends.\n            (4) Funerals, memorial services, and bereavement ceremonies \n        are special events warranting special respect for the deceased \n        and due regard for the emotional well-being of the bereaved \n        whose memories of the final moments before their loved one is \n        laid to rest may be permanently stained were the occasion \n        allowed to be exploited by others for the purpose of attracting \n        public attention by the intentional infliction of emotional \n        distress on the loved ones of the deceased.\n            (5) The First Amendment that veterans risked their lives to \n        defend and preserve is broad and strong enough to protect \n        vigorous and robust public debate on public issues and generous \n        enough to accommodate the natural desire and need of relatives \n        and loved ones to be free to mourn their loss in peace.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON DEMONSTRATIONS WHERE FUNERALS, MEMORIAL \n              SERVICES, AND CEREMONIES FOR VETERANS ARE HELD.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 2413 of title 38, United States Code, is \namended to read as follows:\n``Sec. 2413.
