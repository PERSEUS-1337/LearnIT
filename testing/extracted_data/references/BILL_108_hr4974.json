FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) On September 11, 2001, in New York City, firefighters, \n        paramedics, emergency medical technicians, police officers, \n        laborers, survivors, and others risked their lives far and \n        beyond what was expected of them. They took upon themselves a \n        burden that weighed so heavily that they still carry the \n        repercussions almost three years later.\n            (2) It is not only necessary but obligatory upon our Nation \n        to address the health consequences from the environmental \n        exposures these individuals experienced after the World Trade \n        Centers disaster, which are, as demonstrated by extensive \n        research, directly associated with significant adverse effects \n        on health.\n            (3) The dust from the disaster produced bronchial \n        hyperactivity, persistent cough, and increased risk of asthma, \n        as well as plausible causes of observed increase in the number \n        of infants with lower birthweights.\n            (4) Substantial research has in addition demonstrated that \n        these individuals have an increased future risk of \n        mesothelioma, especially those exposed to asbestos.\n            (5) According to the National Institutes of Health, the \n        attacks have confirmed a ``positive relationship between the \n        intensity of their exposure to airborne pollutants and the \n        severity of their pulmonary symptoms.''.\n            (6) In an article published September 5, 2003, the Agency \n        for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry stated that ``The \n        effects of 9/11 are still being felt today by all New Yorkers, \n        and all Americans.''. In that article, Dr. Frieden stated that \n        ``Hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life were \n        in the vicinity of the twin towers when they collapsed, and \n        were exposed to a combination of smoke, dust, and debris.''.\n            (7) Research has proved that the smoke and debris have been \n        detrimental in that they have caused various health ailments \n        such as respiratory problems, birth defects, and cancer.\n            (8) Out of 10,116 firefighters, 332 have displayed \n        persistent cough accompanied by other respiratory symptoms \n        severe enough to require up to four weeks leave of absence. \n        Among the firefighters without a cough, many were diagnosed \n        with bronchial hyperactivity.\n            (9) Of iron workers that were involved in cleaning and \n        recovery, approximately 1/3 have a chronic cough, 24 percent \n        have reported a new onset of phlegm production, and more than \n        17 percent have complained of a new onset of wheeze.\n            (10) One of the greater health risks has been exposure to \n        asbestos, which was found in the rubble in concentrations as \n        high as 20 percent. This material may cause lung cancer and \n        malignant mesothelioma.\n            (11) Researchers studied 187 pregnant women, and discovered \n        that, for women within a half mile of ground zero who inhaled \n        the soot, pulverized glass, and other toxins, the effects were \n        detrimental enough to result in the delivery of infants who \n        averaged a half-pound lighter than infants of unexposed \n        mothers, a condition known as smaller-for-gestational-age \n        (``SGA'').\n            (12) In the Journal of the American Medical Association, \n        researchers of Mount Sinai Medical Center explained the \n        pollutants as a toxic cocktail, with a potential for long-term \n        adverse health effects. Other studies have associated the \n        pollutants with a direct connection to heart disease and an \n        array of chronic disorders. One example is the condition known \n        as the World Trade Center cough; firefighters and other rescue \n        workers have complained of this persistent respiratory illness.\n            (13) According to Inter Press Service, 2.5 years after the \n        attacks laborers are still suffering from severe breathing \n        problems, skin rashes, nausea, depression, or anxiety.\n            (14) Of emergency respondents, 80 percent have reported of \n        having at least one respiratory symptom, such as sore throat, \n        chest tightness, or cough and wheezing. One half complained of \n        having problems one year later.\n            (15) Dr. Rafael de la Hoz noted that, of about 150 day \n        workers examined at Mount Sinai Medical Center, about 75 \n        percent are suffering from upper airway diseases, and some have \n        reported aggravated asthma or bronchial disease, back and \n        musculoskeletal pain, or psychological problems such as post \n        traumatic stress syndrome.\n\nSEC. 2.
