FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) innovations in health care, deriving from scientific \n        investigation of the highest quality, offer substantial \n        benefits to the well-being of children and savings in health \n        care costs;\n            (2) findings in pediatric research not only promote and \n        maintain health throughout a child's lifespan, but also \n        contribute significantly to new insights and discoveries that \n        will aid in the prevention and treatment of illnesses and \n        conditions among adults;\n            (3) the rapidly expanding knowledge base in biology and \n        medicine is offering greater opportunities than ever for \n        pediatric physician-scientists and basic researchers to harness \n        this knowledge to the benefit of children and society;\n            (4) the relatively smaller number of children compared as \n        to adults and the relative rarity of many of their diseases and \n        conditions has resulted in comparatively fewer resources being \n        devoted to pediatric research and a lesser focus on children's \n        needs;\n            (5) substantially more of the support for children's health \n        research is provided through the Federal Government than is the \n        case for adults because of these market forces;\n            (6) a new commitment to invest in children's research today \n        will make a real difference for children tomorrow;\n            (7) the commitment to invest in children's research should \n        include not only added investment that is devoted to pediatric \n        research but should also focus on ensuring the existence of a \n        future supply of pediatric physician-scientists;\n            (8) the supply of pediatric physician-scientists is \n        threatened by market demands which provide little room for \n        support for research training for new pediatric physician-\n        scientists;\n            (9) over 60 percent of the pediatric departments in the \n        United States have no National Institutes of Health training \n        grant support; and\n            (10) improvements in the level of training grant support is \n        essential to ensuring the existence of future generations of \n        pediatric clinical investigators who are responsible for moving \n        research discoveries from the laboratories to the patients, and \n        who are therefore critical to clinical research.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF A PEDIATRIC RESEARCH INITIATIVE.\n\n    Part A of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 281 \net seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 404F. PEDIATRIC RESEARCH INITIATIVE.\n\n    ``(a) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish within the \nOffice of the Director of NIH a Pediatric Research Initiative (referred \nto in this section as the `Initiative'). The Initiative shall be headed \nby the Director of NIH.\n    ``(b) Purpose.--The purpose of the Initiative is to provide funds \nto enable the Director of NIH to encourage--\n            ``(1) increased support for pediatric biomedical research \n        within the National Institutes of Health to ensure that the \n        expanding opportunities for advancement in scientific \n        investigations and care for children are realized;\n            ``(2) enhanced collaborative efforts among the Institutes \n        to support multidisciplinary research in the areas that the \n        Director deems most promising; and\n            ``(3) the development of adequate pediatric clinical trials \n        and pediatric use information to promote the safer and more \n        effective use of prescription drugs in the pediatric \n        population.\n    ``(c) Duties.--In carrying out subsection (b), the Director of NIH \nshall--\n            ``(1) consult with the Institute of Child Health and Human \n        Development and the other Institutes, in considering their \n        requests for new or expanded pediatric research efforts, and \n        consult with other advisors as the Director determines \n        appropriate;\n            ``(2) have broad discretion in the allocation of any \n        Initiative assistance among the Institutes, among types of \n        grants, and between basic and clinical research so long as \n        the--\n                    ``(A) assistance is directly related to the \n                illnesses and conditions of children; and\n                    ``(B) assistance is extramural in nature; and\n            ``(3) be responsible for the oversight of any newly \n        appropriated Initiative funds and annually report to Congress \n        and the public on the extent of the total extramural support \n        for pediatric research across the NIH, including the specific \n        support and research awards allocated through the Initiative.\n    ``(d) Authorization.--To carry out this section, there is \nauthorized to be appropriated in the aggregate, $50,000,000 for each of \nthe fiscal years 2000 through 2002.\n    ``(e) Transfer of Funds.--The Director of NIH may transfer amounts \nappropriated under this section to any of the Institutes for a fiscal \nyear to carry out the purposes of the Initiative under this section.''.\n\nSEC. 4. INVESTMENT IN TOMORROW'S PEDIATRIC RESEARCHERS.\n\n    Subpart 7 of part C of title IV of the Public Health Service Act \n(42 U.S.C. 285g et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 452E. INVESTMENT IN TOMORROW'S PEDIATRIC RESEARCHERS.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall make available within the \nNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development enhanced \nsupport for extramural activities relating to the training and career \ndevelopment of pediatric researchers.\n    ``(b) Purpose.--The purpose of support provided under subsection \n(a) shall be to ensure the future supply of researchers dedicated to \nthe care and research needs of children by providing for--\n            ``(1) an increase in the number and size of institutional \n        training grants to medical school pediatric departments and \n        children's hospitals; and\n            ``(2) an increase in the number of career development \n        awards for pediatricians building careers in pediatric basic \n        and clinical research.\n    ``(c) Authorization.--To carry out this section, there is \nauthorized to be appropriated, $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, \n$15,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, and $20,000,000 for fiscal year \n2002.''."
