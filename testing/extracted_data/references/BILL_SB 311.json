The school district has a high level of children who live in poverty, children who are English language learners, children who are part of a minority group, and children who are exposed to violence in their community. The school district is particularly focused on significantly increasing pupil achievement and parent engagement and this act will achieve this by offering preschool services to children and families in the school district.\nSEC. 3.\nThis act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:\nThe start of\na\nthe 2015\u201316 school year begins in August. This act will prevent needless hours and paperwork to certify eligibility past the August start date. Therefore, in order to eliminate the barriers for families to access state preschool and to remove the paperwork burden on families and agencies in time for the new school year, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately."
