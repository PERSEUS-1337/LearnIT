Principles for risk assessments\n    ``(a)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), each agency shall design and \nconduct risk assessments in accordance with this subchapter for each \nproposed and final major rule , or that results in a significant \nsubstitution risk, in a manner that promotes rational and informed risk \nmanagement decisions and informed public input into and understanding \nof the process of making agency decisions.\n    ``(2) If a risk assessment under this subchapter is otherwise \nrequired by this section, but the agency determines that--\n            ``(A) a final rule subject to this subchapter is \n        substantially similar to the proposed rule with respect to the \n        risk being addressed;\n            ``(B) a risk assessment for the proposed rule has been \n        carried out in a manner consistent with this subchapter; and\n            ``(C) a new risk assessment for the final rule is not \n        required in order to respond to comments received during the \n        period for comment on the proposed rule,\nthe agency may publish such determination along with the final rule in \nlieu of preparing a new risk assessment for the final rule.\n    ``(b) Each agency shall consider in each risk assessment reliable \nand reasonably available scientific information and shall describe the \nbasis for selecting such scientific information.\n    ``(c)(1) Each agency may use reasonable assumptions to the extent \nthat relevant and reliable scientific information, including site-\nspecific or substance-specific information, is not reasonably \navailable.\n    ``(2) When a risk assessment involves a choice of assumptions, the \nagency shall--\n            ``(A) identify the assumption and its scientific or policy \n        basis, including the extent to which the assumption has been \n        validated by, or conflicts with, empirical data;\n            ``(B) explain the basis for any choices among assumptions \n        and, where applicable, the basis for combining multiple \n        assumptions; and\n            ``(C) describe reasonable alternative assumptions that were \n        considered but not selected by the agency for use in the risk \n        assessment, how such alternative assumptions would have changed \n        the conclusions of the risk assessment, and the rationale for \n        not using such alternatives.\n    ``(d) Each agency shall provide appropriate opportunity for public \ncomment and participation during the development of a risk assessment.\n    ``(e) Each risk assessment supporting a major rule under this \nsubchapter shall include, as appropriate, each of the following:\n            ``(1) A description of the hazard of concern.\n            ``(2) A description of the populations or natural resources \n        that are the subject of the risk assessment.\n            ``(3) An explanation of the exposure scenarios used in the \n        risk assessment, including an estimate of the corresponding \n        population at risk and the likelihood of such exposure \n        scenarios.\n            ``(4) A description of the nature and severity of the harm \n        that could reasonably occur as a result of exposure to the \n        hazard.\n            ``(5) A description of the major uncertainties in each \n        component of the risk assessment and their influence on the \n        results of the assessment.\n    ``(f) To the extent scientifically appropriate, each agency shall--\n            ``(1) express the overall estimate of risk as a reasonable \n        range or probability distribution that reflects variabilities, \n        uncertainties, and lack of data in the analysis;\n            ``(2) provide the range and distribution of risks and the \n        corresponding exposure scenarios, identifying the range and \n        distribution and likelihood of risk to the general population \n        and, as appropriate, to more highly exposed or sensitive \n        subpopulations, including the most plausible estimates of the \n        risks; and\n            ``(3) where quantitative estimates are not available, \n        describe the qualitative factors influencing the range, \n        distribution, and likelihood of possible risks.\n    ``(g) When scientific information that permits relevant comparisons \nof risk is reasonably available, each agency shall use the information \nto place the nature and magnitude of a risk to health, safety, or the \nenvironment being analyzed in relationship to other reasonably \ncomparable risks familiar to and routinely encountered by the general \npublic. Such comparisons should consider relevant distinctions among \nrisks, such as the voluntary or involuntary nature of risks.\n    ``(h) When scientifically appropriate information on significant \nsubstitution risks to health, safety, or the environment is reasonably \navailable to the agency, the agency shall describe such risks in the \nrisk assessment.\n``Sec. 625. Deadlines for rule making\n    ``(a) All deadlines in statutes or imposed by a court of the United \nStates, that require an agency to propose or promulgate any major rule \nto which section 624(a) applies, during the 2-year period beginning on \nthe effective date of this section shall be suspended until the earlier \nof--\n            ``(1) the date on which the requirements of this subchapter \n        are satisfied; or\n            ``(2) the date occurring 6 months after the date of the \n        applicable deadline.\n    ``(b) In any case in which the failure to promulgate a major rule \nto which section 624(a) applies by a deadline occurring during the 2-\nyear period beginning on the effective date of this section would \ncreate an obligation to regulate through individual adjudications, the \ndeadline shall be suspended until the earlier of--\n            ``(1) the date on which the requirements of this subchapter \n        are satisfied; or\n            ``(2) the date occurring 6 months after the date of the \n        applicable deadline.\n``Sec. 626.

Any risk assessment shall be part of the \nwhole rule making record for purposes of judicial review of the rule \nand shall be considered by a court in determining whether the final \nrule is arbitrary or capricious unless the agency can demonstrate that \nthe assessment would not be material to the outcome of the rule.\n    ``(e) If an agency fails to perform the risk assessment, a court \nshall remand or invalidate the rule.''.\n    (b) Presidential Authority.--Nothing in this Act shall limit the \nexercise by the President of the authority and responsibility that the \nPresident otherwise possesses under the Constitution and other laws of \nthe United States with respect to regulatory policies, procedures, and \nprograms of departments, agencies, and offices.\n    (c) Technical and Conforming Amendments.--\n            (1) Part I of title 5, United States Code, is amended by \n        striking the chapter heading and table of sections for chapter \n        6 and inserting the following:\n\n           ``CHAPTER 6--THE ANALYSIS OF REGULATORY FUNCTIONS\n\n           ``SUBCHAPTER I--ANALYSIS OF REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY\n\n``Sec.\n``601.
