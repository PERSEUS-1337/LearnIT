    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Texas Band of Kickapoo Act \nAmendments''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Texas Band of Kickapoo is a subgroup of the \n        Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma whose ancestors were forced to \n        migrate from their ancestral lands in the Midwestern United \n        States to lands now within the boundaries of Mexico and the \n        States of Oklahoma and Texas.\n            (2) The migratory nature of the Kickapoos, which required \n        their frequent travel between Oklahoma, Texas, and Mexico, \n        resulted in lack of clarity in their rights of citizenship and \n        their eligibility for Federal services which could be provided \n        only to Kickapoos when they were on or near the reservation of \n        the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma in McLoud, Oklahoma.\n            (3) Although members of the Texas Band of Kickapoo lived \n        primarily in Texas under conditions posing serious threats to \n        their health, they owned no land in Texas and, therefore, were \n        unable to obtain Federal services which the United States \n        provides to other Indians who are members of federally \n        recognized Indian tribes because of their status as Indians.\n            (4) In 1983, the Texas Band of Kickapoo Act (25 U.S.C. \n        1300b-11 et seq.) was enacted to confirm the United States \n        citizenship of Kickapoos residing in Texas and their \n        eligibility for Federal services.\n            (5) Although many Kickapoos meet the requirements for \n        United States citizenship, some lack written records to prove \n        that they do and have not been made aware that their right to \n        apply for collective citizenship under the Texas Band of \n        Kickapoo Act has expired. Amendment of the Immigration and \n        Nationality Act is necessary to establish modified \n        naturalization procedures to address the Kickapoos' eligibility \n        for citizenship.\n            (6) The Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma acquired land in \n        Maverick County, Texas, in order to provide for the delivery of \n        Federal services to its tribal members in Texas, known as the \n        Texas Band or subgroup of the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma, and \n        in turn, in 1986 such land was acquired in trust by the United \n        States by trust deed ``for the benefit of the Texas Band of \n        Kickapoo, a subgroup of the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma''.\n            (7) In 1989, some members of the Texas Band chose to form a \n        separate governmental entity now known as the Kickapoo \n        Traditional Tribe of Texas, while the remaining Texas Kickapoos \n        continue to be a subgroup of and have membership in the \n        Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma.\n            (8) Since the early 1990s, disputes have arisen over \n        whether beneficial ownership of the trust land in Maverick \n        County, Texas, resides with the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma or \n        with the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas. For some tribal \n        members, lack of clarity regarding ownership of the trust \n        property has resulted in eviction from their homes and \n        inability to receive services, contrary to the intent and goals \n        of the Texas Band of Kickapoo Act.\n            (9) Both tribes require a land base in Texas to be able to \n        provide services and housing for their respective tribal \n        members. Only the Congress can clarify the beneficial ownership \n        of Kickapoo reservation lands to ensure that both tribes have \n        an appropriate land base in Maverick County, Texas.\n            (10) The respective members of the Kickapoo Tribe of \n        Oklahoma and the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas deserve to \n        have their United States citizenship confirmed and their \n        ability to cross the borders of the United States clarified, \n        and to receive all of the Federal services which the United \n        States provides to Indians because of their status as Indians.\n            (11) Beneficial title to land already held in trust by the \n        United States pursuant to authority granted in the Texas Band \n        of Kickapoo Act should be transferred from the Kickapoo Tribe \n        of Oklahoma to the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas, and \n        replacement land in the State of Texas should be accepted into \n        trust by the United States to provide a home for those Texas \n        Kickapoos who continue to be members of the Kickapoo Tribe of \n        Oklahoma.\n\nSEC. 3.
