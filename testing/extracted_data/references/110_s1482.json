    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``State Child Well-Being Research Act \nof 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The well-being of children is a paramount concern for \n        our Nation and for every State, and most programs for children \n        and families are managed at the State or local level.\n            (2) Child well-being varies over time and across social, \n        economic, and geographic groups, and can be affected by changes \n        in the circumstances of families, by the economy, by the social \n        and cultural environment, and by public policies and programs \n        at the Federal, State, and local level.\n            (3) States, including small States, need information about \n        child well-being that is specific to their State and that is \n        up-to-date, cost-effective, and consistent across States and \n        over time.\n            (4) Regular collection of child well-being information at \n        the State level is essential so that Federal and State \n        officials can track child well-being over time.\n            (5) Information on child well-being is necessary for all \n        States, particularly small States that do not have State-level \n        data in other federally supported databases. Information is \n        needed on the well-being of all children, not just children \n        participating in Federal programs.\n            (6) Telephone surveys of parents represent a relatively \n        cost-effective strategy for obtaining information on child \n        well-being at the State level for all States, including small \n        States, and can be conducted alone or in mixed mode strategy \n        with other survey techniques.\n            (7) Data from telephone surveys of the population are \n        currently used to monitor progress toward many important \n        national goals, including immunization of preschool children \n        with the National Immunization Survey, and the identification \n        of health care issues of children with special needs with the \n        National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs.\n            (8) A State-level telephone survey, alone or in combination \n        with other techniques, can provide information on a range of \n        topics, including children's social and emotional development, \n        education, health, safety, family income, family employment, \n        and child care. Information addressing marriage and family \n        structure can also be obtained for families with children. \n        Information obtained from such a survey would not be available \n        solely for children or families participating in programs but \n        would be representative of the entire State population and \n        consequently, would not only inform welfare policymaking, but \n        policymaking on a range of other important issues, such as \n        child care, child welfare, child health, family formation, and \n        education.\n\nSEC. 3.
