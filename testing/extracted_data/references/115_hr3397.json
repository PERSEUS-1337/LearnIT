FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The National Science Foundation has made the largest \n        financial investment in STEM education of all Federal agencies, \n        and plays a very powerful role in helping to set research and \n        policy agendas.\n            (2) Studies have found that children who engage in \n        scientific activities from an early age develop positive \n        attitudes toward science and are more likely to pursue STEM \n        expertise and careers later on.\n            (3) However, the majority of current research focuses on \n        increasing STEM opportunities for students in middle school and \n        older.\n            (4) Women remain widely underrepresented in the STEM \n        workforce and this gender disparity extends down through all \n        levels of education. Strategic funding of programs is needed in \n        order to understand and address the root cause of this gap.\n\nSEC. 3.
