FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Black carbon is a particulate pollutant that \n        contributes significantly to warming of the Earth's climate \n        system by converting solar radiation to heat, which is released \n        into the atmosphere. Black carbon has a particularly \n        detrimental impact on the Arctic by reducing surface \n        reflectivity and accelerating melting when it settles on snow \n        or ice surfaces. The atmospheric residence of black carbon is \n        less than 2 weeks, making this pollutant an important candidate \n        for immediate policy action to mitigate adverse climate \n        effects.\n            (2) Through various clean air programs, the United States \n        has reduced much of its black carbon pollution, though more \n        could be done by governments to help spur technological \n        innovation and energy technology deployment in countries where \n        major black carbon pollution still occurs through industrial \n        activities, agriculture and forestry practices, and residential \n        cooking with high pollution fuels.\n            (3) Black carbon is a serious threat to public health and \n        reductions in black carbon will produce immediate public health \n        benefits.\n            (4) Black carbon is a component of particulate matter \n        regulated under the Clean Air Act, however it is not explicitly \n        regulated as a global warming agent under United States law or \n        by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or \n        other international instruments.\n            (5) United States foreign policies and assistance programs, \n        as well as directions to multilateral lending organizations \n        such as the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and \n        other regional development banks, possess the potential to \n        significantly reduce black carbon pollution globally.\n            (6) Taking immediate cost-effective and technologically \n        feasible action to protect the Arctic, especially by \n        significantly reducing black carbon pollution, will protect an \n        ecosystem under imminent threat due to global warming.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to immediately identify cost-effective ways to reduce \n        black carbon pollution, both in the United States and \n        internationally, to stem and reverse the melting of Arctic Sea \n        ice, as well as contribute to reducing the rate of global \n        warming; and\n            (2) to establish the United States as a leader in \n        protecting the Arctic environment.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act:\n            (1) The term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of \n        the Environmental Protection Agency.\n            (2) The term ``black carbon'' means the strongly light \n        absorbing component of carbonaceous aerosols.\n            (3) The term ``organic carbon'' means the components of \n        carbonaceous aerosols that are not strongly light-absorbing.\n            (4) The term ``person'' means any individual, corporation, \n        partnership, trust, association, or any other private entity, \n        or any officer, employee, agent, department, or instrumentality \n        of the Federal Government or of any State, municipality, or \n        political subdivision of a State, or of any foreign government, \n        any State, municipality, or political subdivision of a State, \n        or any other entity subject to the jurisdiction of the United \n        States.\n\nSEC. 5.
