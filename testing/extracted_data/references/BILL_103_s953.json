VOLUNTARY SEPARATION FOR REASON OF OBJECTION TO MILITARY \n              POLICY ON HOMOSEXUALS.\n\n    ``(a) Generally.--A member of the armed forces may request \nseparation from the armed forces under this section and, if found \neligible for separation under this section by the Secretary of the \nmilitary department concerned, such member shall be separated from \nmilitary service as provided for in this section.\n    ``(b) Eligibility.--A member is eligible for separation under this \nsection if such member--\n            ``(1) became a member of the armed forces on or before the \n        date on which the policy of the Department of Defense that was \n        in effect on May 11, 1993, that homosexuality is incompatible \n        with military service, was changed to a policy under which \n        homosexuality is not incompatible with military service;\n            ``(2) has not incurred or accepted any new or additional \n        military service obligation on or after the date of such change \n        in such policy;\n            ``(3) is not eligible to retire from the armed forces;\n            ``(4) has not previously been approved for separation from \n        the armed forces under any other section of law; and\n            ``(5) has religious, moral, or personal morale objections \n        to such change in such policy, and has filed within one year \n        after the date of such change in such policy a written request \n        to the Secretary concerned with voluntary separation under this \n        section because of such religious, moral, or personal morale \n        objections to such change in such policy.\n    ``(c) Administration.--The Secretary concerned shall determine, \nunder such regulations as are deemed appropriate by such Secretary, if \na member who requests separation under this section is eligible for \nseparation under this section. In determining if such a member has met \nthe requirements of subsection (b)(5), a written request for voluntary \nseparation by such member that asserts the request is made because the \nmember has religious, moral, or personal morale objections to such \nchange in such policy will generally be sufficient to establish that \nsuch member has met the requirements of that subsection. However, the \nSecretary may consider such other information as he deems appropriate \nin determining if such member's request for separation is because of \nsuch objections, including any information that such member previously \nhas sought separation or relief from any military service obligation \nfor any other reason, information concerning whether such member has \npreviously expressed any opinion about such member's religious, moral, \nor personal morale objections to such change in such policy, or any \ninformation that such member has expressed a desire or intent to be \nseparated or relieved from any military service obligation for any \nother reason.\n    ``(d)(1) Active Duty Benefits.--A member who is separated under \nthis section and who--\n            ``(A) has served on active duty for more than six years on \n        the date of the policy change described in subsection (b)(1);\n            ``(B) has served on active duty for not more than twenty \n        years on the date of such separation;\n            ``(C) has served at least five years of continuous active \n        duty immediately preceding the date of such separation; and\n            ``(D) if a Reserve, is on an active duty list,\nshall be entitled to the benefits payable to either a member \nvoluntarily separated under section 1174a(b) or a member voluntarily \nseparated under section 1175, at the discretion of the member being \nseparated under this section.\n    ``(2) Reserve Benefits.--A member of the Selected Reserve, as \ndefined in section 4412 of the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102-484), who is separated from the armed \nforces under this section and who has completed at least six years of \nservice computed under section 1332 on the date of the policy change \ndescribed in subsection (b)(1) shall be entitled to either--\n            ``(A) the benefits provided to member involuntarily \n        discharged or transferred under section 4418 of the National \n        Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102-\n        484); or\n            ``(B) if such member also has completed at least fifteen \n        years of service computed under section 1332, to the rights and \n        benefits provided to members found eligible for such rights and \n        benefits under section 1331a of title 10, United States Code,\nat the discretion of the member being separated under this section.\n    ``(3) Election of Benefits.--A member separated under this section \nmay not receive benefits under both paragraphs (1) and (2) of this \nsubsection. If such a member is eligible for benefits under both \nparagraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, such member will elect which \nbenefits he shall receive.\n    ``(e)(1) Date of Separation Generally.--The Secretary concerned may \ndetermine the date upon which a member entitled to be separated under \nthis section is to be separated. However, except as provided in \nparagraphs (2) and (3), such date of separation shall not be later than \none hundred and eighty days after receipt by the Secretary concerned of \nsuch member's request to be separated under this section.\n    ``(2) Requirement for Reimbursement.--Notwithstanding the one \nhundred and eighty-day period established by paragraph (1), the date of \nseparation for a member entitled to be separated under this section who \nhas any military service obligation for which, because of contract, \nagreement, or law, such member is liable for reimbursement to the \nUnited States if such military service obligation is not fully served, \nmay not be prior to the earlier of--\n            ``(A) the date on which the member fully reimburses the \n        United States for any such military service obligation as \n        required by such contract, agreement, or law; or\n            ``(B) the date on which the member completes such military \n        service obligation.\n    ``(3) Readiness Extension.--Notwithstanding the one hundred and \neighty-day period established by paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned \nmay delay the date of separation of an individual member entitled to be \nseparated under this section if the Secretary determines that the \nseparation of such member within that one hundred and eighty-day period \nwould create a direct and serious negative impact on the readiness of \nthe military department concerned. However, a delay under this \nparagraph may not extend a date of separation more than two years \nbeyond that which would otherwise be required by paragraph (1).''.\n    Sec. 2. Effective Date.--This section shall take effect only if \nthat policy of the Department of Defense that was in effect on May 11, \n1993, that homosexuality is incompatible with military service is \nchanged to a policy under which homosexuality is not incompatible with \nmilitary service, but shall be effective on the date of any such change \nin such policy."
