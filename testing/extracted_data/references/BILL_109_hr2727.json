FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Women's pelvic floor disorders are a group of common \n        conditions that cause considerable disability and pain.\n            (2) Such disorders include bladder and bowel dysfunction, \n        including incontinence. Another such disorder is pelvic organ \n        prolapse, which involves a downward shift of uterine or vaginal \n        structures from their normal positions. Often these conditions \n        coexist.\n            (3) Women's pelvic floor disorders are extremely common and \n        are barriers to healthy living.\n            (4) Women often suffer from a broad overlap of all pelvic \n        floor disorders, usually experiencing several disorders \n        simultaneously.\n            (5) Thirty percent of American women will suffer from a \n        form of urinary incontinence.\n            (6) Eleven percent of women in the United States have \n        surgery for urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse \n        during their lifetime, and close to one third will have a \n        second surgery. Many more women are treated with nonsurgical \n        techniques or remain untreated.\n            (7) Of the 3 million vaginal deliveries that occur each \n        year in the United States, 900,000 women will develop \n        symptomatic urinary incontinence and a smaller number will \n        develop pelvic organ prolapse and bowel incontinence.\n            (8) An estimated $26.3 billion is spent annually to either \n        treat or compensate for urinary incontinence.\n            (9) Many health care providers are not prepared to evaluate \n        urinary pelvic floor disorders, including incontinence, and are \n        unaware of treatment options.\n            (10) To address the public health threat posed by women's \n        pelvic floor disorders, there is a need for the establishment \n        of awareness and education programs directed at the public and \n        primary-care providers, including the authorization of research \n        focused on urinary incontinence and other pelvic floor \n        disorders. Such programs will greatly help promote better care \n        and treatment to those women afflicted with these disorders.\n\nSEC. 3. EDUCATION REGARDING WOMEN'S PELVIC FLOOR DISORDERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Part P of title III of the Public Health Service \nAct (42 U.S.C. 280g et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing section:\n\n``SEC. 399O.

Activities \nunder such program shall be carried out directly by the Secretary and \nthrough awards of grants or contracts to States, political subdivisions \nof States, and other public or nonprofit private entities.\n    ``(b) Certain Information.--The Secretary shall ensure that \neducation under subsection (a) includes, at a minimum--\n            ``(1) information describing the prevalence of pelvic floor \n        disorders in women; and\n            ``(2) information regarding treatment options for such \n        disorders.\n    ``(c) Use of Internet.--The Secretary shall ensure that the means \nthrough which education under subsection (a) is provided includes the \nposting of information on the Internet site of the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention. The Secretary shall ensure that, in the case of \nhealth professionals, such means includes means in addition to the \nposting of information on such site.\n    ``(d) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of carrying \nout this section, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as \nmay be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2006 through 2010.''.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the \nDirector of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should \nestablish a national registry for surgical treatment of pelvic floor \ndisorders, especially procedures using new technology.\n\nSEC. 4.
