FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Palestinian Authority's practice of paying salaries \n        to terrorists serving in Israeli prisons, as well as to the \n        families of deceased terrorists, is an incentive to commit acts \n        of terror.\n            (2) The United States does not provide direct budgetary \n        support to the Palestinian Authority. The United States does \n        pay certain debts held by the Palestinian Authority and fund \n        programs which the Palestinian Authority would otherwise be \n        responsible for.\n            (3) The United States Government supports community-based \n        programs in the West Bank and Gaza that provide for basic human \n        needs, such as food, water, health, shelter, protection, \n        education and livelihoods, and that promote peace and \n        development.\n            (4) Since fiscal year 2015, annual appropriations \n        legislation has provided for the reduction of Economic Support \n        Fund aid for the Palestinian Authority ``by an amount the \n        Secretary determines is equivalent to the amount expended by \n        the Palestinian Authority as payments for acts of terrorism by \n        individuals who are imprisoned after being fairly tried and \n        convicted for acts of terrorism and by individuals who died \n        committing acts of terrorism during the previous calendar \n        year''.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    Congress--\n            (1) calls on the Palestinian Authority to stop these \n        payments and repeal the laws authorizing them;\n            (2) calls on all donor countries providing budgetary \n        assistance to the Palestinian Authority to cease direct \n        budgetary support until the Palestinian Authority stops all \n        payments incentivizing terror;\n            (3) supports the creation of a general welfare system, \n        available to all Palestinian citizens within the jurisdictional \n        control of the Palestinian Authority;\n            (4) urges the United States Permanent Representative to the \n        United Nations to use that position to highlight the issue of \n        Palestinian Authority payments for acts of terrorism and to \n        urge other member nations of the Security Council and the \n        General Assembly to join the United States in calling on the \n        Palestinian Authority to end this system immediately; and\n            (5) urges the Department of State to use its bilateral and \n        multilateral engagements with all governments and organizations \n        committed to the cause of peace to highlight the issue of \n        Palestinian Authority payments for acts of terrorism and join \n        the United States in calling on the Palestinian Authority to \n        end this system immediately.\n\nSEC. 4.
