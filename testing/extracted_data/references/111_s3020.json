DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act--\n            (1) the terms ``Administration'' and ``Administrator'' mean \n        the Small Business Administration and the Administrator \n        thereof, respectively;\n            (2) the terms ``HUBZone'' and ``HUBZone small business \n        concern'' and ``HUBZone map'' have the meanings given those \n        terms in section 3(p) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n        632(p)), as amended by this Act; and\n            (3) the term ``recertification'' means a determination by \n        the Administrator that a business concern that was previously \n        determined to be a qualified HUBZone small business concern is \n        a qualified HUBZone small business concern under section \n        3(p)(5) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(p)(5)).\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to reform and improve the \nHUBZone program of the Administration.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the HUBZone program was established under the HUBZone \n        Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-135; 111 Stat. 2627) to stimulate \n        economic development through increased employment and capital \n        investment by providing Federal contracting preferences to \n        small business concerns in those areas, including inner cities \n        and rural counties, that have low household incomes, high \n        unemployment, and suffered from a lack of investment; and\n            (2) according to the Government Accountability Office, the \n        weakness in the oversight of the HUBZone program by the \n        Administration has exposed the Government to fraud and abuse.\n\nSEC. 4. HUBZONE IMPROVEMENTS.\n\n    The Administrator shall--\n            (1) ensure the HUBZone map--\n                    (A) is accurate and up-to-date; and\n                    (B) revised as new data is made available to \n                maintain the accuracy and currency of the HUBZone map;\n            (2) implement policies for ensuring that only HUBZone small \n        business concerns determined to be qualified under section \n        3(p)(5) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(p)(5)) are \n        participating in the HUBZone program, including through the \n        appropriate use of technology to control costs and maximize, \n        among other benefits, uniformity, completeness, simplicity, and \n        efficiency;\n            (3) submit to the Committee on Small Business and \n        Entrepreneurship of the Senate and the Committee on Small \n        Business of the House of Representatives a report regarding any \n        application to be designated as a HUBZone small business \n        concern or for recertification for which the Administrator has \n        not made a determination as of the date that is 60 days after \n        the date on which the application was submitted or initiated, \n        which shall include a plan and timetable for ensuring the \n        timely processing of the applications; and\n            (4) develop measures and implement plans to assess the \n        effectiveness of the HUBZone program that--\n                    (A) require the identification of a baseline point \n                in time to allow the assessment of economic development \n                under the HUBZone program, including creating \n                additional jobs; and\n                    (B) take into account--\n                            (i) the economic characteristics of the \n                        HUBZone; and\n                            (ii) contracts being counted under multiple \n                        socioeconomic subcategories.\n\nSEC. 5.
