DEFINITION OF FEDERAL AGENCY.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``Federal agency'' has the meaning given the \nterm ``agency'' in section 551(1) of title 5, United States Code.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) science and the scientific process should inform and \n        guide public policy decisions on a wide range of issues, \n        including improvement of public health, protection of the \n        environment, and protection of national security;\n            (2) the public must be able to trust the science and \n        scientific process informing public policy decisions;\n            (3) science, the scientific process, and the communication \n        of science should be free from politics, ideology, and \n        financial conflicts of interest; and\n            (4) policies and procedures that ensure the integrity of \n        the conduct and communication of publicly funded science are \n        critical to ensuring public trust.\n\nSEC. 4. PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS.\n\n    Except as provided in section 552(b) of title 5, United States \nCode, and consistent with privacy and classification standards, the \nhead of each Federal agency that funds or conducts scientific research \nshall--\n            (1) promote and maximize the communication and open \n        exchange of data and findings to other agencies, policymakers, \n        and the public of research conducted by a scientist or engineer \n        employed or contracted by a Federal agency that funds or \n        conducts scientific research; and\n            (2) prevent the suppression or distortion of the data and \n        findings described in paragraph (1).\n\nSEC. 5.
