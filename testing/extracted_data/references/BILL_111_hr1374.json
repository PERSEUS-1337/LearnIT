FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The number of older Americans who are abused, \n        neglected, or exploited is increasing, and a large percentage \n        of elder abuse cases are not reported to Federal and State law \n        enforcement authorities.\n            (2) The number of Americans aged 65 and older is projected \n        to increase exponentially in the coming years, and many of \n        these valued citizens will begin to constitute a vulnerable \n        population at increased risk of abuse and exploitation in \n        domestic and community-based settings.\n            (3) The projected increase in the number of Americans aged \n        65 and over is expected to result in a corresponding increase \n        in the number of cases of elder abuse, which suggests an urgent \n        need for comprehensive consideration of means by which such \n        abuse can be prevented, reported, and prosecuted by Federal and \n        State authorities.\n            (4) Violent, physical, and sexual assaults upon older \n        Americans are particularly abhorrent and should be prosecuted \n        vigorously by Federal and State law enforcement authorities. \n        Such acts should be deterred by appropriate penalties including \n        enhanced penalties and the elimination of parole for \n        individuals convicted of violent sexual offenses against the \n        elderly.\n\nSEC. 3. NO PAROLE FOR SEXUAL OFFENSES COMMITTED AGAINST THE ELDERLY OR \n              FOR SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS.\n\n    (a) In General.--For each fiscal year after the expiration of the \nperiod specified in subsection (b)(1) in which a State receives funds \nfor a program referred to in subsection (b)(2), the State shall have in \neffect throughout the State laws and policies that prohibit parole for \nany individual who is--\n            (1) convicted of a criminal sexual offense against a victim \n        who is elderly, which shall include any such offense under \n        State law for conduct that would constitute an offense under \n        chapter 109A of title 18, United States Code, had the conduct \n        occurred in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction \n        of the United States or in a Federal prison; or\n            (2) a sexually violent predator.\n    (b) Compliance and Ineligibility.--\n            (1) Compliance date.--Each State shall have not more than 3 \n        years from the date of enactment of this Act to comply with \n        subsection (a), except that--\n                    (A) the Attorney General may grant an additional 2 \n                years to a State that is making good faith efforts to \n                comply with such subsection; and\n                    (B) the Attorney General shall waive the \n                requirements of subsection (a) if compliance with such \n                subsection by a State would be unconstitutional under \n                the constitution of such State.\n            (2) Ineligibility for funds.--For any fiscal year after the \n        expiration of the period specified in paragraph (1), a State \n        that fails to comply with subsection (a) shall not receive 10 \n        percent of the funds that would otherwise be allocated for that \n        fiscal year to the State under subpart 1 of part E of title I \n        of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 \n        U.S.C. 3750 et seq.), whether characterized as the Edward Byrne \n        Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Programs, \n        the Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants Program, the \n        Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, or \n        otherwise.\n    (c) Reallocation.--Amounts not allocated under a program referred \nto in subsection (b)(2) to a State for failure to fully comply with \nsubsection (a) shall be reallocated under that program to States that \nhave not failed to comply with such subsection.\n    (d) Definition.--For the purposes of this section, the term \n``sexually violent predator'' means a person who has been convicted of \na sexually violent offense and who suffers from a mental abnormality or \npersonality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in \npredatory sexually violent offenses.\n\nSEC. 4.
