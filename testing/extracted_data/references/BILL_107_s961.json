FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the Institute of Medicine, it is estimated \n        that 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 American women have received breast \n        implants over the last 35 years. Because there has never been a \n        patient registry for breast implant recipients it is impossible \n        to more accurately determine the number of women who have \n        received breast implants. Yet, the American Society of Plastic \n        Surgeons estimates that in 1999 alone 82,975 women had breast \n        reconstruction following mastectomies and another 167,318 \n        American women received breast implants for cosmetic purposes.\n            (2) From 1985 until January 2000, FDA received 127,770 \n        adverse reaction reports for silicone gel-filled breast \n        implants and 65,720 adverse reaction reports for saline-filled \n        implants.\n            (3) Women need complete and accurate information about the \n        potential health risks and advantages of breast implants so \n        that women can make informed decisions.\n            (4) Silicone breast implants have never been approved by \n        the Food and Drug Administration; saline breast implants, which \n        consist of a saline solution injected into a silicone envelope, \n        were approved by the agency in 2000 despite alarmingly high \n        complication and reoperation rates. After three years, 43 \n        percent of the augmentation patients and 73 percent of the \n        reconstruction patients experienced local complications and 40 \n        percent of the reconstruction patients were forced to undergo \n        additional surgery for local complications and device failure.\n            (5) In 1998, the Food and Drug Administration opened a \n        criminal investigation following allegations that one of the \n        breast implant manufacturers was manipulating research data in \n        breast implant studies. When the Food and Drug Administration's \n        General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel convened in March \n        2000 to consider market approval for saline implants, it was \n        not informed of the investigation. Although the manufacturer's \n        saline breast implant was approved by the Food and Drug \n        Administration in May 2000, the investigation remains open.\n            (6) According to a 1997 Mayo Clinic study, within 5 years \n        of receiving such implants, 1 in 4 women required additional \n        surgery.\n            (7) In 2000, research sponsored by the Food and Drug \n        Administration found that even among women who had not sought \n        medical treatment for implant problems, almost 70 percent had \n        at least one ruptured implant after 10 to 15 years. Silicone \n        was found to be migrating away from the implants in 21 percent \n        of those women. The FDA researchers concluded that ``the \n        relationship of free silicone to development or progression of \n        disease is unknown''.\n            (8) A 1993 study by Dr. Suzanne S. Teuber et al., \n        University of California, published in The Journal of \n        Autoimmunity, investigated the influence of silicone breast \n        implants on the expression of anticollagen antibodies and found \n        a statistically significant incidence of anticollagen \n        antibodies in women with implants. The researchers concluded \n        that silicone breast implants should not be considered a benign \n        or immunologically inert material; serious implications may \n        result from their use.\n            (9) The Institute of Medicine's 1999 study of silicone \n        breast implant safety found that local complications with \n        silicone breast implants were the primary safety issue, that \n        they have not been well studied, and that information on these \n        complications is crucial for women deciding whether or not they \n        want breast implant surgery. Concern remains that exposure to \n        silicone breast implants may result in currently undefined \n        connective tissue or autoimmune diseases.\n            (10) A 2001 National Cancer Institute study found breast \n        implant recipients suffer from higher rates of lung and brain \n        cancer than other plastic surgery patients.\n            (11) A 1999 case report by Dr. Suzanne S. Teuber et al., \n        University of California, published in The Journal of \n        Rheumatology, found evidence of silicone migration in women \n        with ruptured or leaking silicone breast implants. These \n        patients experienced severe local inflammation and \n        complications resulting from silicone migration to the axilla, \n        arm or abdominal wall. Researchers concluded that once silicone \n        gel leaves the implant, it is not biologically inert and in \n        some persons can elicit profound pathologic responses.\n            (12) According to many reports, including a study published \n        in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, the presence \n        of a silicone breast implant may create difficulties in \n        obtaining accurate and thorough mammograms because as much as \n        40 percent of the breast tissue can be masked by the implant. \n        This delays the early detection of breast cancer in women.\n            (13) According to a 2000 Food and Drug Administration \n        publication, women of childbearing age who want to breast feed \n        should be aware of the negative impact of breast implants on \n        breast feeding. It is not known if a small amount of silicone \n        may pass from the silicone shell of an implant into breast \n        milk. If this occurs, it is not known what effect it may have \n        on the nursing infant.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to promote research to \nidentify and evaluate the health effects of breast implants, to ensure \nthat women receive accurate information about such implants and to \nencourage the Food and Drug Administration to conclude its criminal \ninvestigation based on the allegations of wrong-doing by one of the \nimplant manufacturers which ultimately may affect their products and \nthe health of American women.\n    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed \nto affect any rule or regulation promulgated under the authority of the \nFederal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S. 301 et seq.) that is in \neffect on the date of enactment of this Act relating to the \navailability of silicone breast implant for reconstruction after \nmastectomy, correction of congenital deformities, or replacement for \nruptured silicone implants for augmentation.\n\nSEC. 3. EXPANSION AND INTENSIFICATION OF ACTIVITIES REGARDING SILICONE \n              BREAST IMPLANTS AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.\n\n    (a) Status of Existing Research.--The Director of the National \nInstitutes of Health shall report to all appropriate committees of \nCongress on the status of the existing breast implant research funded \nby such Institutes within 90 days after the date of the enactment of \nthis Act.\n    (b) Amendment to Public Health Service Act.--Part H of title IV of \nthe Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 289 et seq.) is amended by \nadding at the end of the following:\n\n``SEC. 498C.
