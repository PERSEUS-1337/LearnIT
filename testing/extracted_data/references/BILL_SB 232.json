If the Superintendent finds, based on the report required in paragraph (2), that the county superintendent of schools failed to appropriately take into account particular types of indicators of financial distress, or failed to take appropriate remedial actions in the qualifying school district, the Superintendent shall further investigate whether the county superintendent of schools failed to take into account those indicators, or similarly failed to take appropriate actions in other school districts with negative or qualified certifications, and shall provide an additional report on the fiscal oversight practices of the county superintendent of schools to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of each house of the Legislature and the Department of Finance."
