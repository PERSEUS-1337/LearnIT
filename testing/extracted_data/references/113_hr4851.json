FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Chinese Government does not grant United States \n        officials, journalists, and other citizens access to the \n        People's Republic of China on a reciprocal basis to the access \n        the United States Government grants Chinese officials, \n        journalists, and citizens.\n            (2) The Chinese Government imposes greater restrictions on \n        travel to Tibetan areas than to other areas of the People's \n        Republic of China.\n            (3) Officials of the People's Republic of China have stated \n        that Tibet is open to foreign visitors.\n            (4) The Chinese Government is promoting tourism in Tibetan \n        areas, and has announced plans to make tourism a ``pillar \n        industry'' for the region.\n            (5) The Chinese Government requires foreigners to obtain \n        permission from the Tibet Foreign and Overseas Affairs Office \n        or from the Tibet Tourism Bureau to enter the Tibet Autonomous \n        Region, a restriction that is not imposed on travel to any \n        other provincial-level jurisdiction in the People's Republic of \n        China.\n            (6) The Department of State reports that the Tibet Foreign \n        and Overseas Affairs Office denied more than 10 requests for \n        United States diplomatic access to the Tibet Autonomous Region \n        between May 2011 and December 2012, and that when such requests \n        are granted, diplomatic personnel are closely supervised and \n        given few opportunities to meet local residents not approved by \n        authorities.\n            (7) The Chinese Government restricted United States \n        consular access after an October 28, 2013, bus crash in the \n        Tibet Autonomous Region, in which at least two Americans died \n        and more than a dozen others, all from Walnut, California, were \n        injured.\n            (8) The Chinese Government has failed to respond positively \n        to the United States Government's request to open a consulate \n        in Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region.\n            (9) The Department of State reports that the Chinese \n        government regularly denies requests by American diplomats, \n        foreign journalists, and observers to visit Tibetan areas, and \n        that those permitted to visit are subject to ``highly \n        structured, government-organized tours'' that limit \n        independent, objective reporting.\n            (10) The Department of State reports that foreign diplomats \n        who were permitted to travel in Tibetan areas outside the Tibet \n        Autonomous Region were ``repeatedly approached by local police \n        and sometimes forced to leave without reasonable explanation''.\n            (11) The Department of State reports that permission is not \n        always granted to foreign tourists, and that when granted, \n        Lhasa, Rikaze (Shigatse), and Shannan (Lhoka) are usually the \n        only places in the Tibet Autonomous Region open to foreigners.\n            (12) Foreign visitors also face restrictions in their \n        ability to travel freely in Tibetan areas outside the Tibet \n        Autonomous Region.\n            (13) Foreign visitors to Tibetan areas are explicitly \n        limited to tours that are tightly managed by authorities.\n            (14) Restrictions on journalists' access to Tibetan areas \n        conflict with government regulations, adopted in 2008, lifting \n        requirements that foreign journalists get permission of local \n        authorities to travel in the country and interview Chinese \n        citizens.\n            (15) The United States Government generally allows \n        journalists and other citizens of the People's Republic of \n        China to travel freely within the United States. The United \n        States Government requires Chinese diplomats to notify the \n        Department of State of their travel plans, and in certain \n        situations, the United States Government requires Chinese \n        diplomats to obtain approval from the Department of State \n        before travel. However, where approval is required, it is \n        almost always granted expeditiously.\n            (16) The United States regularly grants visas to Chinese \n        officials, scholars, and others who travel to the United States \n        to discuss, promote and display the Chinese Government's \n        perspective on the situation in Tibetan areas, even as the \n        Chinese Government restricts the ability of United States \n        citizens to travel to Tibetan areas to gain their own \n        perspective.\n            (17) Chinese diplomats based in the United States generally \n        avail themselves of the freedom to travel to United States \n        cities and lobby city councils, mayors, and governors to \n        refrain from passing resolutions, issuing proclamations, or \n        making statements of concern on Tibet.\n            (18) The Chinese Government characterizes statements made \n        by United States officials about the situation in Tibetan areas \n        as inappropriate interference in the internal affairs of China.\n\nSEC. 3.

INADMISSIBILITY OF CERTAIN ALIENS.\n\n    (a) Ineligibility for Visas.--An alien is ineligible to receive a \nvisa to enter the United States and ineligible to be admitted to the \nUnited States if such alien is on the list required by--\n            (1) subsection (a)(2) of section 4, and if the Secretary of \n        State determines that the requirements for specific official \n        permission for foreigners to travel to the Tibet Autonomous \n        Region remain in effect, or that the current permission system \n        has been replaced by a requirement that has the same effect of \n        requiring foreign travelers to gain a level of permission to \n        enter the Tibet Autonomous Region that is not required for \n        travel to other province-level entities in the People's \n        Republic of China;\n            (2) subsections (a)(3) and (a)(4) of section 4, and if the \n        Secretary of State determines that restrictions on travel by \n        United States officials, journalists, and citizens to areas \n        designated as ``Tibetan autonomous'' in the provinces of \n        Sichuan, Qinghai, Yunnan, and Gansu of the People's Republic of \n        China are greater than any restrictions on travel by United \n        States officials, journalists, and citizens to areas in such \n        provinces that are not so designated; or\n            (3) subsections (a)(5) and (a)(6) of section 4, and if the \n        Secretary of State determines that the requirement for a \n        specific permission to enter Tibet pertaining to travel by \n        foreigners to the Tibet Autonomous Region remain in effect, or \n        that the requirement has been replaced by a regulation that has \n        the same effect of requiring foreign travelers to gain a level \n        of permission to enter the Tibet Autonomous Region that is not \n        required for travel to other province-level entities in the \n        People's Republic of China, and if the Secretary of State \n        determines that restrictions on travel by United States \n        officials and citizens to areas designated as ``Tibetan \n        Autonomous'' in the provinces of Sichuan, Qinghai, Yunnan, and \n        Gansu of the People's Republic of China are greater than any \n        restrictions on travel by United States officials and citizens \n        to areas in such provinces that are not so designated.\n    (b) Current Visas Revoked.--The Secretary of State shall revoke, in \naccordance with section 221(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n(8 U.S.C. 1201(i)), the visa or other documentation of any alien who \nwould be ineligible to receive such a visa or documentation under \nsubsection (a).\n    (c) Waiver for National Interests.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of State may waive the \n        application of subsection (a) or (b) in the case of an alien if \n        the Secretary determines that such a waiver--\n                    (A) is necessary to permit the United States to \n                comply with the Agreement between the United Nations \n                and the United States of America regarding the \n                Headquarters of the United Nations, signed June 26, \n                1947, and entered into force November 21, 1947, or \n                other applicable international obligations of the \n                United States; or\n                    (B) is in the national security interests of the \n                United States.\n            (2) Notification.--Upon granting a waiver under paragraph \n        (1), the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate \n        congressional committees a document detailing the evidence and \n        justification for the necessity of such waiver, including, if \n        such waiver is granted pursuant to subparagraph (B) of such \n        paragraph, how such waiver relates to the national security \n        interests of the United States.\n\nSEC. 6. VISA POLICY.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) reciprocity forms the basis of diplomatic law and the \n        practice of mutual exchanges between countries;\n            (2) a country should give equivalent consular access to the \n        nationals of another country in a reciprocal manner to the \n        consular access granted by such other country to its own \n        citizens; and\n            (3) the Secretary of State, when granting diplomats from \n        the People's Republic of China access to parts of the United \n        States, should take into account the extent to which the \n        Government of the People's Republic of China grants United \n        States diplomats access to parts of the People's Republic of \n        China, including the level of access afforded to such diplomats \n        to Tibetan areas."
