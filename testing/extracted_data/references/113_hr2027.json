Once the Secretary makes a \n                determination that a hospital has such a negative \n                operating margin for a cost reporting period, the \n                Secretary may not reverse such determination for such \n                period. A hospital that is treated as being in \n                financial distress under this subparagraph for a cost \n                reporting period shall continue to be so treated for \n                all subsequent cost reporting periods as being in \n                financial distress without regard to changes in the \n                hospital's operating margin.''."
