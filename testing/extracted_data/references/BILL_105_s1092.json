FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) King Cove, Alaska is a community in the westernmost \n        region of the Alaska Peninsula with a population of roughly 800 \n        full-time residents and an additional 400 to 600 workers who \n        are transported in and out of the community a number of times a \n        year to work in the local fish processing plant and on fishing \n        vessels;\n            (2) the majority of the full-time residents are indigenous \n        Native peoples of Aleut ancestry that have resided in the \n        region for over 5,000 years;\n            (3) the only mode of access to or from King Cove is via \n        small aircraft or fishing boat, and the weather patterns are so \n        severe and unpredictable that King Cove is one of the worst \n        places in all of the United States to access by either of these \n        modes of transportation;\n            (4) the State of Alaska has initiated the King Cove to Cold \n        Bay Transportation Improvement Assessment to confirm the need \n        for transportation improvements for King Cove and to identify \n        alternative methods of improving transportation access with \n        comprehensive environmental and economic review of each \n        alternative;\n            (5) the State of Alaska has identified a road between King \n        Cove and Cold Bay as one of the alternatives to be evaluated in \n        the transportation planning process but for a road to be a \n        viable option for the State of Alaska, the Congress must grant \n        a legislative easement within the Izembek National Wildlife \n        Refuge (``Refuge'') across approximately seven miles of \n        wilderness land owned by the Federal Government;\n            (6) there are fourteen miles of roads within the wilderness \n        boundary of the Refuge which are currently traveled by \n        vehicles;\n            (7) any road constructed in accordance with such easement \n        would be an unpaved, one-lane road sufficient in width to \n        satisfy State law; and\n            (8) the combined communities of King Cove and Cold Bay have \n        approximately 250 vehicles.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a surface transportation \neasement across Federal lands within the Refuge and to transfer 664 \nacres of high value habitat lands adjacent to the Refuge in fee simple \nfrom the King Cove Corporation to the Federal Government as new \nwilderness lands within the Refuge in exchange for redesignating a \nnarrow corridor of land within the Refuge as nonwilderness lands.\n\nSEC. 4.

Upon transfer to the United States, such \nlands shall be managed in accordance with section 1302(i) of the Alaska \nNational Interest Lands Conservation Act, shall be included within the \nRefuge, and shall be managed as wilderness.\n\nSEC. 5.
