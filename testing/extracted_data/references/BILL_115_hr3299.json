FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the contractual doctrine of valid when made which, as \n        applied to lending agreements, provides that a loan that is \n        valid at inception cannot become usurious upon subsequent sale \n        or transfer to another person;\n            (2) this important and longstanding principle derives from \n        the common law and its application has been a cornerstone of \n        United States banking law for nearly 200 years, as provided in \n        the case Nichols v. Fearson, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 103, 106 (1833), \n        where the Supreme Court famously declared: ``Yet the rule of \n        law is everywhere acknowledged, that a contract free from usury \n        in its inception, shall not be invalidated by any subsequent \n        usurious transactions upon it.'';\n            (3) in 2016, the Solicitor General, in consultation with \n        all Federal banking regulators, filed an amicus brief in the \n        case of Midland Funding, LLC v. Madden, 136 S. Ct. 2505 (2016) \n        (mem.), denying cert. to 786 F.3d 246 (2d Cir. 2015), that \n        described the United States Court of Appeals for the Second \n        Circuit in that case ``incorrect'' with an ``analysis \n        reflect[ing] a misunderstanding'' of section 85 of the National \n        Bank Act and Supreme Court precedent, because it contradicted \n        the contractual doctrine of valid when made;\n            (4) the valid-when-made doctrine, by bringing certainty to \n        the legal treatment of all valid loans that are transferred, \n        greatly enhances liquidity in the credit markets by widening \n        the potential pool of loan buyers and reducing the cost of \n        credit to borrowers at the time of origination;\n            (5) a joint academic study from professors at Stanford, \n        Fordham, and Columbia universities concluded that the Madden v. \n        Midland decision has already disproportionately affected low- \n        and moderate-income individuals in the United States with lower \n        FICO scores; and\n            (6) if the valid-when-made doctrine is not reaffirmed soon \n        by Congress, the lack of access to safe and affordable \n        financial services will force households in the United States \n        with the fewest resources to seek financial products that are \n        nontransparent, fail to inform consumers about the terms of \n        credit available, and do not comply with State and Federal laws \n        (including regulations).\n\nSEC. 3. RATE OF INTEREST AFTER TRANSFER OF LOAN.\n\n    (a) Amendment to the Revised Statutes.--Section 5197 of the Revised \nStatutes (12 U.S.C. 85) is amended by adding at the end the following: \n``A loan that is valid when made as to its maximum rate of interest in \naccordance with this section shall remain valid with respect to such \nrate regardless of whether the loan is subsequently sold, assigned, or \notherwise transferred to a third party, and may be enforced by such \nthird party notwithstanding any State law to the contrary.''.\n    (b) Amendment to the Home Owners' Loan Act.--Section 4(g) of the \nHome Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1463(g)) is amended by adding at the \nend the following:\n    ``(3) A loan that is valid when made as to its maximum rate of \ninterest in accordance with this subsection shall remain valid with \nrespect to such rate regardless of whether the loan is subsequently \nsold, assigned, or otherwise transferred to a third party, and may be \nenforced by such third party notwithstanding any State law to the \ncontrary.''.\n    (c) Amendment to the Federal Credit Union Act.--Section 205(g) of \nthe Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1785(g)) is amended by adding \nat the end the following:\n    ``(3) A loan that is valid when made as to its maximum rate of \ninterest in accordance with this subsection shall remain valid with \nrespect to such rate regardless of whether the loan is subsequently \nsold, assigned, or otherwise transferred to a third party, and may be \nenforced by such third party notwithstanding any State law to the \ncontrary.''.\n    (d) Amendment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.--Section 27 of \nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831d) is amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n    ``(c) A loan that is valid when made as to its maximum rate of \ninterest in accordance with this section shall remain valid with \nrespect to such rate regardless of whether the loan is subsequently \nsold, assigned, or otherwise transferred to a third party, and may be \nenforced by such third party notwithstanding any State law to the \ncontrary.''.\n\nSEC. 4. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n    Nothing in this Act may be construed as limiting the authority or \njurisdiction of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, or \nthe National Credit Union Administration.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives February 14, 2018.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,\n\n                                                                 Clerk."
