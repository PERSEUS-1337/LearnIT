BROADBAND POLICY.\n\n    ``It is the policy of the United States--\n            ``(1) to maintain the freedom to use for lawful purposes \n        broadband telecommunications networks, including the Internet, \n        without unreasonable interference from or discrimination by \n        network operators, as has been the policy and history of the \n        Internet and the basis of user expectations since its \n        inception;\n            ``(2) to ensure that the Internet remains a vital force in \n        the United States economy, thereby enabling the Nation to \n        preserve its global leadership in online commerce and \n        technological innovation;\n            ``(3) to preserve and promote the open and interconnected \n        nature of broadband networks that enable consumers to reach, \n        and service providers to offer, lawful content, applications, \n        and services of their choosing, using their selection of \n        devices, as long as such devices do not harm the network; and\n            ``(4) to safeguard the open marketplace of ideas on the \n        Internet by adopting and enforcing baseline protections to \n        guard against unreasonable discriminatory favoritism for, or \n        degradation of, content by network operators based upon its \n        source, ownership, or destination on the Internet.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
