FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Cellular and molecular processes may be used, mimicked, \n        or redesigned to develop new products, processes, and systems \n        that improve societal well-being, strengthen national security, \n        and contribute to the economy.\n            (2) Engineering biology relies on scientists and engineers \n        with a diverse and unique set of skills combining the \n        biological, physical, and information sciences and engineering.\n            (3) Long-term research and development is necessary to \n        create breakthroughs in engineering biology. Such research and \n        development requires government investment as the benefits are \n        too distant or uncertain for industry to support alone.\n            (4) The Federal Government can play an important role by \n        facilitating the development of tools and technologies to \n        further advance engineering biology, including multiple user \n        facilities that the Federal Government is uniquely able to \n        support.\n            (5) Since other countries are investing significant \n        resources in engineering biology, the United States is at risk \n        of losing its competitive lead in this emerging area if it does \n        not invest the necessary resources and have a national \n        strategy.\n            (6) A National Engineering Biology Initiative can serve to \n        establish new research directions and technology goals, improve \n        interagency coordination and planning processes, drive \n        technology transfer, and help ensure optimal returns on the \n        Federal investment.\n\nSEC. 3.
