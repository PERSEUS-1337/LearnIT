PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to provide women with increased \naccess to preventive and life-saving cancer screening, including \nclinical breast exams and cervical, ovarian, uterine, vaginal, and \nvulvar cancer screening, provided by leading women's health care \nproviders who--\n            (1) serve populations most at risk; and\n            (2) play an outsized role in the prevention and detection \n        of cancer in order to serve the goal of reducing health care \n        disparities among low-income women and women of color, decrease \n        health care spending, and expand health literacy, access, and \n        education about the benefits of regular preventive cancer \n        screening for women.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in \n        women under the age of 54, and the American Cancer Society \n        recommends that women in their 20s and 30s have a clinical \n        breast exam at least every 3 years.\n            (2) Ovarian cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer \n        of the female reproductive system, but it accounts for only \n        about 3 percent of all cancers in women.\n            (3) The cancers that most frequently impact women include \n        breast, uterine, ovarian, and cervical cancer, and there were \n        314,257 new cases of these cancers in 2013.\n            (4) Rates of incidence and death for gynecologic cancers by \n        race and ethnicity show that, while for some cancers, like \n        ovarian cancer, the rates of incidence and death are similar \n        among all races, for other cancers, like cervical cancer, women \n        of color have a disproportionate rate of incidence. While the \n        incidence of uterine cancer is higher for White women than for \n        women of color, rates of death for uterine cancer are 2 times \n        higher for Black women than for White women.\n            (5) Prevention and cancer screening are the best approaches \n        to protecting women from cancer and ensuring early detection \n        and life-saving treatment. Many deaths from breast and cervical \n        cancers could be avoided if cancer screening rates increased \n        among women at risk. Deaths from these cancers occur \n        disproportionately among women who are uninsured or \n        underinsured.\n            (6) Due to enhanced screening, cervical cancer, which used \n        to be the leading cause of cancer death for women in the United \n        States, is now a much more preventable and treatable cancer.\n            (7) Increased access to education, information, and \n        preventive cancer screening increase women's ability to survive \n        cancer.\n            (8) Women's health care providers that are primarily \n        engaged in family planning services, such as Planned Parenthood \n        health centers, provide necessary screening tests, education, \n        and information to women, especially women of color who face \n        the highest risks of breast cancer and other gynecologic \n        cancers.\n\nSEC. 4.
