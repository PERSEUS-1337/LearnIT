FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Haiti is the most impoverished nation in the Western \n        Hemisphere.\n            (2) The United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS states \n        that Haiti accounts for 90 percent of the HIV/AIDS infections \n        and case rates in the Caribbean.\n            (3) HIV infections and AIDS have approached epidemic \n        proportions in Haiti. More than 300,000 infected people have \n        been identified and deaths from HIV/AIDS have left \n        approximately 200,000 children orphaned, while more than 12,000 \n        children in Haiti are living with HIV/AIDS.\n            (4) The infant and maternal mortality rate in Haiti \n        continues to rise and only 1 in every 10,000 Haitians has \n        access to a physician.\n            (5) The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria \n        has approved the control mechanisms of the Government of Haiti, \n        which include measures to address transparency and for \n        disbursement of grants from the Global Fund.\n            (6) The President has included Haiti in the list of 15 \n        countries that qualify for United States assistance to combat \n        HIV/AIDS under the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \n        Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003.\n            (7) The people of Haiti have a constitutional and \n        fundamental human right to health and government has the \n        obligation to fulfill these rights to the level of resources \n        available.\n            (8) The legal minimum daily wage in Haiti is approximately \n        $.96 but many Haitians work in the informal economy or in \n        subsistence agriculture for $.40 or less a day.\n            (9) 76 percent of Haiti's children under the age of five \n        are underweight or suffer from wasting or stunting.\n            (10) Only 46 percent of the population has access to safe \n        water and only 28 percent of the population to sanitation \n        services.\n            (11) 63 percent of Haitians are undernourished. As stated \n        by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food: \n        ``Despite the fact that global wealth and resources [are] \n        sufficient to provide food for everyone, some 100,000 people \n        [die] every day of hunger or hunger-related diseases \n        [throughout the world].''.\n            (12) The infant mortality rate in Haiti is approximately 76 \n        deaths for each 1,000 live female births and 81 deaths for each \n        1,000 live male births.\n            (13) Life expectancy at birth in Haiti is approximately 51 \n        years.\n            (14) Approximately 80 percent of Haiti's population lives \n        in abject poverty.\n            (15) Unemployment and underemployment is widespread in \n        Haiti as evidenced by the fact that more than two-thirds of the \n        labor force are without formal jobs.\n            (16)(A) The Office of Technical Assistance within the \n        Bureau of International Affairs of the Department of the \n        Treasury has provided advisers to governments in Central and \n        Eastern Europe and the independent states of the former Soviet \n        Union to assist in the transition from command to market \n        economies.\n            (B) In the typical mission, a Treasury Department \n        ``resident advisor'' provides assistance to a senior finance \n        ministry or central bank counterpart in one of several areas: \n        tax policy and administration, government debt issuance and \n        management, financial institutions policy and regulation, \n        budget policy and management, and the prevention, detection, \n        and prosecution of financial crimes. These resident advisers \n        are supported by short-term experts and technicians.\n            (17) More recently, the Department of the Treasury has \n        addressed challenges in other parts of the world by assisting \n        the South African Department of Finance in restructuring its \n        budget office and process, working in the Haitian Finance \n        Ministry to improve apportionment and budget execution, and \n        helping to resolve the banking crisis in Indonesia.\n\nSEC. 102. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to strengthen United States leadership \nand the effectiveness of the United States response to infectious \ndiseases in Haiti and Haiti's struggling health sector while assisting \nwith the rebuilding of physical infrastructure by--\n            (1) establishing a comprehensive, integrated strategy to \n        develop Haiti's health infrastructure, combat HIV/AIDS and \n        other infectious diseases, and improve coordination among \n        relevant Federal departments and agencies and between the \n        United States and the Government of Haiti, nongovernmental \n        organizations, and other international organizations;\n            (2) providing increased resources for United States \n        efforts, particularly for technical assistance and training, to \n        combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in Haiti;\n            (3) encouraging the expansion of the international \n        community to reengage with the Government of Haiti and expand \n        private sector efforts and public-private sector partnerships \n        to establish a functional health sector in Haiti;\n            (4) assisting and securing a system of basic water, \n        sanitation, and other physical infrastructure; and\n            (5) encouraging a continued exchange of knowledge and \n        professionalism between the Government of Haiti and the United \n        States Department of the Treasury through the Department's \n        Office of Technical Assistance within the Bureau of \n        International Affairs, including by providing Department of the \n        Treasury advisers to work to explain such concepts as budgeting \n        and the decision making process, tax policy as a means of \n        financing the annual government budget, treasury bill markets \n        to replace central bank monetization of deficits, and the \n        banking as a system of intermediation rather than financial \n        accounting.\n\nSEC. 103.
