FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) At the Federal, State, and local levels, government \n        funding supports well-intentioned voter hotlines that are not \n        fully utilized because of a lack of access to information on \n        such programs by the public at-large. All 50 states and the \n        District of Columbia have at least one voter hotline in \n        addition to an unprecedented amount of privately funded voter \n        hotlines, all with different telephone numbers. The \n        multiplicity of resources makes it difficult for voters to \n        identify the correct hotline for their needs, which may result \n        in voters who have immediate or urgent needs abandoning their \n        effort to vote.\n            (2) The Department of Justice has declared that a national \n        telephone number or hotline on voting information is an \n        important tool to facilitate the voting process, and has \n        established a hotline through which individuals may obtain this \n        kind of information. Notwithstanding the existence of the \n        hotline, voting irregularities were still rampant, as evidenced \n        by a number of problems that occurred during the 2008 election \n        cycle, including the following:\n                    (A) Virginia voters who registered through the \n                Department of Motor Vehicles or via third party groups \n                reported never receiving a registration card. In other \n                cases, they arrived at their polling places only to \n                find their names missing from the voter rolls. Some \n                voters did not fill out their registration paperwork \n                correctly, but were not notified of this until well \n                after the registration deadline of October 6. There \n                were reports in one location all seven voting machines \n                in the building had failed and that there were no paper \n                ballots available. Voters at that polling place waited \n                in line for an extraordinary 7 hours and 15 minutes to \n                vote.\n                    (B) St. Louis voters who had submitted change of \n                address forms several weeks prior to Election Day found \n                that these forms had not been processed by Election \n                Day.\n                    (C) On December 2, the New York Post reported that \n                more than 3,500 voter registration forms were shipped \n                to the New York City Board of Elections on September \n                10, only to sit in a box until November 6, 2 days after \n                the election. Of these voters, those who cast \n                provisional ballots had their votes counted, but it is \n                unclear how many other voters were turned away at the \n                polls.\n                    (D) Pennsylvania voters in cities reported not \n                receiving absentee ballots by Election Day. This caused \n                additional problems at polling places on Election Day, \n                as some of those who feared their votes would go \n                uncounted took time away from family obligations, work, \n                or struggled with a disability to get to their polling \n                place. Upon arrival, they were told they would be \n                unable to vote in person since they had already \n                requested an absentee ballot.\n                    (E) Voters at poorly prepared poll locations in Los \n                Angeles County and elsewhere in California began \n                reporting ballot shortages in the early afternoon on \n                Election Day. Many people who went to the wrong polling \n                place were incorrectly instructed to vote provisionally \n                instead of being sent to the correct location. At one \n                polling place, provisional ballots were handed out \n                because so many voters were unaware that their poll \n                location had changed and had gone to the wrong \n                location. In other places, voters were not offered \n                provisional ballots even when they were warranted, for \n                example, when paper ballots were requested or when \n                regular ballots were running out. In all, nearly \n                1,000,000 people voted by provisional ballot in \n                California.\n                    (F) Wait times of 6 hours were reported for early \n                voting in Franklin County, Ohio, leading to people \n                leaving the line without voting. Wait times of between \n                2 and 10 hours were reported during early voting at \n                multiple Georgia locations.\n            (3) The fifteenth amendment to the Constitution protects \n        the right of citizens to vote, yet every election cycle, the \n        voting rights of thousands of citizens are denied or abridged \n        due to factors ranging from misinformation to wholesale \n        intimidation. For example:\n                    (A) In the 2004 presidential election, voters \n                reported receiving calls telling them to report to the \n                polls to vote the day after Election Day, that the \n                polling location had changed, and that they would only \n                be allowed to vote if they brought four separate forms \n                of identification to the poll. In 2008, in southern \n                Virginia and at George Mason University in the northern \n                part of the state, official-looking fliers ``informed'' \n                voters that, because of projected high turnout, \n                Democrats should wait and vote on November 5, 2008, the \n                day after the election. North Carolina voters \n                complained of misleading calls that provided inaccurate \n                information regarding absentee ballot deadlines.\n                    (B) Michigan poll workers were often unaware that \n                Michigan voters who did not have a government-issued \n                photo ID could vote after signing an affidavit.\n                    (C) In 2008, fliers distributed and posted in a \n                west Philadelphia neighborhood claimed that any \n                violation as simple as an unpaid parking ticket would \n                render citizens ineligible to vote and subject to \n                arrest at the polls. A flier disseminated on the campus \n                of Drexel University in Philadelphia warned that \n                undercover officers would be present at the polls, \n                looking for voters with outstanding warrants or parking \n                violations.\n                    (D) In Virginia, Michigan and Colorado, students \n                were told that if they registered to vote where they \n                went to school (instead of at their parents' address) \n                they could lose their healthcare, financial aid, and \n                jeopardize their parent's taxes, all false claims.\n                    (E) In 2008, the non-profit group Minnesota \n                Majority, pretending to be from the Secretary of \n                State's office, made calls to voters questioning their \n                registrations in a supposed attempt to uncover voting \n                irregularities.\n                    (F) Twelve Ohio counties released sample paper \n                ballots that split the presidential contest over two \n                columns for the November election. A study found that \n                this particular layout often confuses voters and causes \n                them to double-vote, which ultimately disqualifies the \n                ballot.\n\nSEC. 3.
