FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The United States is currently facing critical \n        workforce shortages in all areas of hospital operations, \n        including both clinical and nonclinical operations.\n            (2) As its workforce ages, the Veterans Health \n        Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs is facing \n        a loss of staff through retirement at a time of staffing \n        shortages across all areas of hospital operations.\n            (3) The demand for health professionals will grow as the \n        ``Baby Boom'' generation retires and adds to an already \n        burgeoning population of elderly requiring more extensive \n        health services.\n            (4) There are not enough nurses and health care providers \n        to care for veterans who are on the Department of Veterans \n        Affairs waiting lists. During the current nationwide nursing \n        shortage, the Department of Veterans Affairs must replace up to \n        5.3 percent of its registered nurses each year just to keep \n        pace with the loss from nurses who retire.\n            (5) The number of nurses retiring in the next 10 years is \n        expected to far exceed the number of new nurses joining the \n        workforce, resulting in a nationwide nursing shortage.\n            (6) This shortage will certainly affect health care \n        facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which, like \n        many other health care facilities, are already seeing a \n        shrinking pool of highly trained nurses.\n            (7) Nursing care is vital to providing the best patient \n        care possible and, as the nursing shortage worsens, care for \n        veterans who have sacrificed much for the liberties and \n        freedoms enjoyed by the American people will suffer.\n            (8) In order to meet the increasing demand from veterans in \n        need of health care, the Department of Veterans Affairs must be \n        aggressive in its efforts to recruit and retain its nursing \n        staff.\n            (9) The failure to maintain adequate staffing levels can \n        harm veterans under the Department's care. There is a clear \n        link between nurse-to-patient ratios and patient successes. For \n        every additional patient over four in a nurse's workload, the \n        risk of death increases by 7 percent for surgical patients. \n        Unfortunately, many Department of Veterans Affairs' facilities \n        do not meet the threshold safe ratio of four medical/surgical \n        patients per nurse. Some facilities have six, seven, or eight \n        surgical patients per nurse.\n            (10) There are acute shortages plaguing other critical \n        healthcare staff including pharmacists, radiology, and \n        laboratory technologists and other ancillary professionals.\n            (11) Thirty-one percent of medical technologists of the \n        Department of Veterans Affairs are eligible for or nearing \n        retirement.\n            (12) Nearly 20 percent of the pharmacy technicians of the \n        Department of Veterans Affairs have between 20 and 34 years of \n        Government service.\n            (13) One-quarter of the nursing assistants of the \n        Department of Veterans Affairs have between 20 and 34 years of \n        Government service and, therefore, are eligible for or nearing \n        retirement.\n            (14) The lack of allied health care workers and hospital \n        support staff on the weekends hurts direct patient care. \n        Without support staff, nurses are forced to devote less time on \n        direct patient care in order to transport patients, clean the \n        wards, and perform other duties typically done by nursing \n        assistants, housekeepers, and other ancillary staff. Providing \n        a premium pay for regular weekend shifts will help maintain \n        adequate levels of support staff on the weekends.\n            (15) Ongoing education is important to maintain high \n        standards of professionalism in nursing care. The Department of \n        Veterans Affairs should encourage the professional development \n        of its nursing staff through ongoing educational programs and \n        through funding opportunities to support nurses in achieving a \n        baccalaureate or masters degree in nursing.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To clarify that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and \n        labor organizations representing health care employees can work \n        together to improve patient care by allowing the Secretary the \n        option of negotiation with exclusive employee representatives \n        over safe staffing levels to ensure that veterans are provided \n        with high quality care.\n            (2) To improve the consistency, legitimacy, and fairness in \n        the nurse pay and promotion system of the Veterans Health \n        Administration by allowing the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n        and labor organizations to negotiate the process by which \n        nurses and other health care professionals are promoted.\n            (3) To provide for additional pay for Saturday tours of \n        duty for additional health care workers in the Veterans Health \n        Administration.\n            (4) To provide for a program to be conducted by the \n        Secretary of Veterans Affairs to assess the benefits of \n        establishing a nurse preceptor program.\n\nSEC. 3.

IMPROVEMENTS TO THE RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT OF HEALTH CARE \n              PROFESSIONALS.\n\n    Section 7403 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by adding \nat the end the following new subsections:\n    ``(h) Nothing in this section, or in subsection (b), (c), and (d) \nof section 7422 of this title, shall limit the right or ability of any \nlabor organization representing employees in the Veterans Health \nAdministration to engage in collective bargaining with respect to the \npromotion processes established pursuant to this section.\n    ``(i) In a case in which a registered nurse has accomplished the \nperformance elements for promotion to the next grade, the lack of a \nspecific type of educational degree shall not be an impediment to \npromotion, and in such a case the registered nurse shall not be denied \na promotion on that basis.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
