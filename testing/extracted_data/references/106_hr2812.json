FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) there is a need for the development and expansion of \n        organizations that provide private equity capital to smaller \n        businesses in areas in which equity-type capital is scarce, \n        such as inner cities and rural areas, in order to create and \n        retain jobs for low-income residents of those areas;\n            (2) to invest successfully in smaller businesses, \n        particularly in inner cities and rural areas, requires highly \n        specialized investment and management skills;\n            (3) there is a shortage of professionals who possess such \n        skills and there are few training grounds for individuals to \n        obtain those skills;\n            (4) providing assistance to organizations that provide \n        specialized technical assistance and training to individuals \n        and organizations seeking to enter or expand in this segment of \n        the market would stimulate small business development and \n        entrepreneurship in economically distressed communities; and\n            (5) assistance from the Federal Government could act as a \n        catalyst to attract investment from the private sector and \n        would help to develop a specialized venture capital industry \n        focused on creating jobs, increasing business ownership, and \n        generating wealth in low-income communities.\n\nSEC. 3. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT VENTURE CAPITAL ACTIVITIES.\n\n    The Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating section 32 as section 33; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 31 the following:\n\n``SEC. 32.
