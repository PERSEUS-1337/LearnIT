FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) An educated citizenry is fundamental both for a \n        democratic society and for a productive economy.\n            (2) In today's world a high school education is only the \n        foundation of the lifelong learning process which will permit \n        individuals and nations to prosper in the highly changing \n        international economy of the 21st century. A college education \n        remains an excellent investment both for students and for \n        America.\n            (3) The right of every American to a free, publicly \n        financed education through high school and the responsibility \n        of State and local governments to provide this education is \n        recognized by the basic laws of every State and Commonwealth \n        within the United States. Approximately, 90 percent of all \n        Americans receive their basic education through the locally \n        governed and managed public schools.\n            (4) Postsecondary education, in contrast, is delivered \n        through a diverse system of public and private institutions. \n        Students, families, the Federal Government, States, and the \n        private sector provide the funds for this education through a \n        system which is neither rational nor adequate. A new \n        partnership is necessary which redefines and makes more \n        rational the respective roles of students, families, \n        government, nonprofit, and the private sector in ensuring \n        financial access to the high quality educational opportunities \n        which students are academically prepared to undertake.\n            (5) At the same time that the need for postsecondary \n        education is becoming universal, the cost of this education has \n        increased, causing financial strain for all but the most \n        affluent American families to afford.\n            (6) The interstate mobility of the modern workforce and the \n        integrated nature of the American economy make it appropriate \n        for the national government to expand its contribution to the \n        financing of postsecondary education so that it is a more equal \n        partner with State governments and families in financing \n        postsecondary education.\n            (7) It is therefore important that adequate financial \n        resources are available to assure that every high school \n        graduate has access to the postsecondary training which his or \n        her efforts have qualified them for academically.\n            (8) As the Federal contribution increases, however, it will \n        be necessary to ensure that future increases in the cost of \n        attendance for students, including tuition charges, is \n        constrained so that Federal assistance is directed to the \n        students rather than to the institutions or to State \n        governments. The principle must be that additional Federal \n        support is intended to supplement public resources for \n        education not to substitute Federal dollars for existing State \n        expenditures.\n            (9) It is appropriate that the Federal Government in \n        exchange for the financial assistance provided, require that \n        students meet appropriate academic standards both for initial \n        eligibility and for continuing support.\n\nSEC. 3.
