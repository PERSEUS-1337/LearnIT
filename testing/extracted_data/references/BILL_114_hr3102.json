RISK-BASED SCREENING OF EMPLOYEES AT AIRPORTS.\n\n    ``(a) Screening Model.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date \n        of the enactment of this section, the Administrator shall \n        establish a risk-based, intelligence-driven model for the \n        screening of employees at airports based on level of access and \n        employment positions at domestic airports. Such screening model \n        shall--\n                    ``(A) ensure that only those individuals authorized \n                to have access to the secure areas of a domestic \n                airport are permitted such access;\n                    ``(B) ensure that an individual is immediately \n                denied entry to a secure area when such individual's \n                access authorization for such secure area is withdrawn; \n                and\n                    ``(C) provide a means to differentiate between \n                individuals authorized to have access to an entire \n                secure area and individuals authorized access to only a \n                particular portion of a secure area.\n            ``(2) Factors.--The Administrator shall consider the \n        following factors when establishing the screening model \n        described in paragraph (1):\n                    ``(A) Whether and how often employees at airports \n                require employment-related access to Secure \n                Identification Display Areas, Airport Operations Areas, \n                or secure areas.\n                    ``(B) The ability of each airport operator to \n                reduce employee entry and exit points to a mutually \n                agreed-upon minimum number of such entry and exit \n                points necessary to maintain airport operations.\n                    ``(C) In consultation with airport operators, the \n                ability of the Administration to create a randomization \n                plan for screening at the defined operational minimum \n                entry and exit points at airports which maximizes the \n                deterrent effect of screening efforts.\n    ``(b) Disqualifying Offenses.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date \n        of the enactment of this section, the Administrator, in \n        consultation with the Director of the Federal Bureau of \n        Investigation, labor organizations representing aviation, \n        ground, and cabin crew workers, and the Aviation Security \n        Advisory Committee, shall conduct an aviation security risk-\n        based review of the disqualifying criminal offenses codified in \n        sections 1542.209 and 1544.229 of title 49, Code of Federal \n        Regulations, to determine the appropriateness of such offenses \n        as a basis for denying to an employee a credential that allows \n        unescorted access to Secure Identification Display Areas of \n        airports. Such review shall consider the following:\n                    ``(A) The adequacy of codified disqualifying \n                offenses to address the current aviation security \n                threat environment, particularly the terrorism insider \n                threat.\n                    ``(B) If such codified disqualifying offenses \n                should be tailored to address the current aviation \n                security threat environment, particularly the terrorism \n                insider threat, by excluding or including other \n                offenses.\n                    ``(C) The potential security benefits, drawbacks, \n                and challenges associated with identifying patterns of \n                misdemeanors or of other non-disqualifying offenses \n                that could jeopardize aviation security.\n                    ``(D) The feasibility of integrating similar \n                departmental eligibility requirements for access to \n                Secure Identification Display Areas of airports.\n                    ``(E) If the 10-year look-back period for \n                disqualifying offenses is appropriate, in light of the \n                current aviation security threat environment, \n                particularly the terrorism insider threat.\n            ``(2) Waiver.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n        the enactment of this section, the Administrator shall provide \n        an adequate redress process for an employee who is subject to \n        an adverse employment decision, including removal or suspension \n        of such employee, due to a disqualifying offense referred to in \n        paragraph (1), that is consistent with the appeals and waiver \n        process established for applicants for commercial motor vehicle \n        hazardous materials endorsements and transportation workers at \n        ports under section 70105(c) of title 46, United States Code.\n            ``(3) Notice.--Any changes to the Secure Identification \n        Display area badge program, such as changes considered pursuant \n        to subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), and (E) of paragraph (1) shall \n        be subject to notice of proposed rulemaking.\n            ``(4) Briefing to congress.--Upon completion of the \n        aviation security risk-based review required under paragraph \n        (1), the Administrator shall brief the Committee on Homeland \n        Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \n        Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on \n        Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate on the \n        results of such review.\n    ``(c) Credentialing.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \nenactment of this section, the Administrator, in consultation with the \nAviation Security Advisory Committee, shall review the auditing \nprocedures for all airport-issued identification media. Such review \nshall determine the following:\n            ``(1) The efficacy of the auditing program requirements at \n        domestic airports to ensure the integrity, accountability, and \n        control of airport-issued identification media.\n            ``(2) The feasibility of including biometrics standards for \n        all airport-issued identification media used for identity \n        verification and badge verification.\n            ``(3) The feasibility of integrating other departmental \n        programs' eligibility requirements for access to secure areas \n        of airports.\n    ``(d) Vetting.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date \n        of the enactment of this section, the Administrator shall--\n                    ``(A) establish a program to allow airport badging \n                offices to utilize the employment eligibility \n                confirmation system established under section 404 of \n                the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n                Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1324a note;
