    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear Weapons Complex Conversion \nAct of 2000''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Russian nuclear weapons complex is still at its \n        Cold War size. Little information about this complex is shared, \n        and 10 of its most sensitive cities remain closed. These cities \n        house 750,000 people and employ approximately 150,000 people in \n        nuclear military facilities. Although the Russian Federation \n        Ministry of Atomic Energy has announced the need to \n        significantly downsize its workforce, perhaps by as much as 50 \n        percent, it has been very slow in accomplishing this goal. \n        Information on the extent of any progress is very closely held. \n        The major impediments to downsizing have been economic and \n        social conditions in Russia.\n            (2) The United States, on the other hand, has significantly \n        downsized its nuclear weapons complex in an open and \n        transparent manner. As a result, an enormous asymmetry now \n        exists between the United States and Russia in nuclear weapon \n        production capacities and in transparency of such capacities. \n        It is in the national security interest of the United States to \n        assist the Russian Federation in accomplishing significant \n        reductions in its nuclear military complex and in helping it to \n        protect its nuclear weapons, nuclear materials, and nuclear \n        secrets during such reductions. Such assistance will accomplish \n        critical nonproliferation objectives and provide essential \n        support towards future arms reduction agreements. Without a \n        significant, transparent reduction in nuclear weapons \n        production capacity, the Russian Federation's ability to \n        quickly reconstitute its arsenal remains inconsistent with \n        current and contemplated arms control agreements.\n            (3) Several current programs address portions of the \n        downsizing and nuclear security concerns. The Nuclear Cities \n        Initiative was established to assist Russia in creating job \n        opportunities for employees who are not required to support \n        realistic Russian nuclear security requirements. Its focus has \n        been on creating commercial ventures that can provide self-\n        sustaining jobs in three of the closed cities. The current \n        scope and funding of the program are not commensurate with the \n        scale of the threats to the United States sought to be \n        addressed by the program.\n            (4) To effectively address threats to United States \n        national security interests, progress with respect to the \n        nuclear cities must be expanded and accelerated. The Nuclear \n        Cities Initiative has laid the groundwork for an immediate \n        increase in investment and potential for immediate risk \n        reduction in the cities of Sarov, Snezhinsk, and Seversk, which \n        house four key Russian nuclear facilities. Furthermore, the \n        Nuclear Cities Initiative has made considerable progress with \n        the limited funding available. However, to gain sufficient \n        advocacy for additional support, the program must demonstrate--\n                    (A) rapid progress in conversion and restructuring; \n                and\n                    (B) an ability for the United States to track \n                progress against verifiable milestones that support a \n                Russian nuclear complex consistent with their future \n                national security requirements.\n            (5) Reductions in the nuclear weapons-grade material stocks \n        in the United States and Russia enhance prospects for future \n        arms control agreements and reduce concerns that these \n        materials could lead to proliferation risks. Confidence in both \n        nations will be enhanced by knowledge of the extent of each \n        nation's stockpiles of weapons-grade materials. The United \n        States already makes this information public.\n            (6) Many current programs contribute to the goals stated \n        herein. However, the lack of programmatic coordination within \n        and among United States Government agencies impedes the \n        capability of the United States to make rapid progress. A \n        formal single point of coordination is essential to ensure that \n        all United States programs directed at cooperative threat \n        reduction, nuclear materials reduction and protection, and the \n        downsizing, transparency, and nonproliferation of the nuclear \n        weapons complex effectively mitigate the risks inherent in the \n        Russian Federation's military complex.\n            (7) Specialists in the United States and the former Soviet \n        Union trained in nonproliferation studies can significantly \n        assist in the downsizing process while minimizing the threat \n        presented by potential proliferation of weapons materials or \n        expertise.\n\nSEC. 3. EXPANSION AND ENHANCEMENT OF NUCLEAR CITIES INITIATIVE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy shall, in accordance with \nthe provisions of this section, take appropriate actions to expand and \nenhance the activities under the Nuclear Cities Initiative in order \nto--\n            (1) assist the Russian Federation in the downsizing of the \n        Russian Nuclear Complex;
