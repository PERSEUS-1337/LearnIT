FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) each year, in both Jammu and Kashmir and the Punjab, \n        the Government of India detains thousands of persons under \n        special or preventive detention laws without informing them of \n        the charges against them;\n            (2) most of these detainees are political prisoners, \n        including prisoners of conscience;\n            (3) they are often detained for several months and \n        sometimes even more than a year;\n            (4) detainees are not permitted any contact with lawyers or \n        family members unless they are remanded to judicial custody and \n        transferred to prison, and only then if the family on its own \n        is able to locate the detainee;\n            (5) in most cases, these persons are detained under the \n        Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act of 1987, \n        the National Security Act of 1980, and the Jammu and Kashmir \n        Public Safety Act of 1978;\n            (6) the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) \n        Act of 1987 authorizes administrative detention without formal \n        charge or trial for up to 1 year for investigation of suspected \n        ``terrorist'' or broadly defined ``disruptive'' activities;\n            (7) the 1-year period of permissible detention before trial \n        violates Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and \n        Political Rights, to which India is a party;\n            (8) Article 9 of the International Covenant provides, \n        ``Anyone arrested or detained on a criminal charge shall be \n        brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorized by \n        law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial \n        within a reasonable time or to release.'';\n            (9) under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities \n        (Prevention) Act of 1987, all proceedings before a designate \n        court must be conducted in secret ``at any place other \n        than...[the court's]...ordinary place of sitting'';\n            (10) section 16(2) of the Terrorist and Disruptive \n        Activities (Prevention) Act of 1987 permits the designated \n        court to keep the ``identity and address of any witness \n        secret'';\n            (11) under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities \n        (Prevention) Act of 1987, a confession to a senior police \n        officer can be admitted as evidence if there is reason to \n        believe it was made voluntarily;\n            (12) the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) \n        Act of 1987 amends India's criminal code, which prohibits such \n        confessions, and substantially increases the risk of torture;\n            (13) the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) \n        Act of 1987 reverses the presumption of innocence, placing the \n        burden on the accused to prove that he or she is not guilty;\n            (14) the National Security Act of 1980 permits the \n        detention of persons without charge or trial for up to 1 year \n        in order to prevent them from acting in a manner prejudicial to \n        the security of the state, the maintenance of public order, the \n        maintenance of supplies and services essential to the \n        community, or relations with a foreign power;\n            (15) the National Security Act of 1980 was amended to \n        permit 2 years detention in the Punjab;\n            (16) under this Act, India may detain any person engaged in \n        behavior ``prejudicial to the defense of India, the relations \n        of India with foreign powers, or the security of India'';\n            (17) the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act of 1978 \n        empowers India to detain persons without trial for up to 1 year \n        for a broad range of activities, including ``promoting, \n        propagating, or attempting to create, feelings of enmity or \n        hatred or disharmony on grounds of religion, race, community, \n        or region'';\n            (18) the Armed Forces (Punjab and Chandigarh) Special \n        Powers Act of 1983 and the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) \n        Special Powers Act of 1990 empower Indian security forces to \n        search homes without warrant, to make arrests without warrant, \n        to destroy the ``hideouts'' of suspected terrorists, and to \n        shoot to kill with immunity from prosecution;\n            (19) Indian security forces routinely employ methods of \n        torture, beatings, and threats to induce detainees to sign \n        statements of confession and to identify suspected militants;\n            (20) the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) \n        Act of 1987, the National Security Act of 1980, the Jammu and \n        Kashmir Public Safety Act of 1978, the Armed Forces (Punjab and \n        Chandigarh) Special Powers Act of 1983, and the Armed Forces \n        (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act of 1990 facilitate human \n        rights abuses by suspending ordinary safeguards against \n        arbitrary arrest, incommunicado detention, and torture; and\n            (21) these 5 laws are incompatible with the principles of a \n        modern democracy.\n\nSEC. 3. REDUCTION OF DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE FOR INDIA UNLESS CERTAIN \n              LAWS REPEALED.\n\n    (a) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment \nof this Act, the President shall report to the Congress whether the \nGovernment of India has repealed all the laws specified in subsection \n(d).\n    (b) Reduction of Assistance.--If the President reports to Congress, \neither pursuant to subsection (a) or at any other time, that the \nGovernment of India has not repealed all the laws specified in \nsubsection (d), all development assistance for India under chapter 1 of \npart I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 shall be terminated except \nfor assistance to continue the Immunodiagnostic Development Project, \nthe Child Survival Health Support Project, and the Private and \nVoluntary Organizations for Health II Project.\n    (c) Resumption of Assistance.--Assistance terminated pursuant to \nsubsection (b) may be resumed only if the President reports to Congress \nthat the Government of India has repealed all the laws specified in \nsubsection (d).\n    (d) Special and Preventive Detention Laws.--The laws referred to in \nsubsections (a), (b), and (c) are the Terrorist and Disruptive \nActivities (Prevention) Act of 1987, the National Security Act of 1980, \nthe Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act of 1978, the Armed Forces \n(Punjab and Chandigarh) Special Powers Act of 1983, and the Armed \nForces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act of 1990."
