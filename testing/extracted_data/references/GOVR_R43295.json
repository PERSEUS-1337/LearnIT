Other BEA indicators include items such as personal income and outlays, and corporate profits. These indicators together comprise what are known as BEA's \" National Economic Accounts ,\" or \"National Income and Product Accounts\" (NIPA). Gross Domestic Product is a comprehensive measure of U.S. economic output. It measures the value of the goods and services produced by the U.S. economy in a given time period and includes total spending by consumers total investment by businesses total spending by government net exports (exports minus imports) Current GDP News Release Historical and Detailed NIPA Interactive Tables A Primer on GDP and the National Income and Product Accounts Personal income is a measure of income received by individuals from wages, salaries, dividends, interest, and other forms. Personal outlays consist of personal consumption of goods and services and also include transfer payments. The components include disposable income (total personal income minus personal current taxes) transfer receipts (payments by governments and businesses to individuals and nonprofit institutions serving individuals) consumption expenditures (goods and services purchased by persons) savings Current Personal Income and Outlays News Release Historical and Detailed NIPA Interactive Tables The Census Bureau reports on household income data that are collected from several major surveys and programs. Guidance on the differences between these sources of income data can be found on the bureau's website. Two of these data sources are described below. The Census Bureau's annual American Community Survey (ACS) collects income data from a sample of the U.S. population, including median household data, data on income distribution, and the poverty rate. Data can cover one or five years. One-year estimates are more current but use a smaller sample size. Five-year estimates are less current but use larger sample sizes and are considered more reliable. The following are examples of commonly requested ACS data: U.S. Median Income in the Past 12 Months from the 2017 ACS 1-Year EstimatesU.S. Income Distribution for Households and Families in the Past 12 Months from the 2017 ACS 1-Year Estimates Another program, the Current Population Survey (CPS), is a survey conducted by the Census for Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and provides estimates on income, poverty, and health insurance coverage. Inflation is the overall increase in the prices of goods and services in the economy. A frequently cited measure of inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is a BLS program that tracks changes in the prices paid by urban consumers for a representative basket of goods and services. The information provided by BLS goes beyond just CPI and includes producer prices, import/export prices, and employment cost trends. Overview of BLS Statistics on Inflation and Prices The Consumer Price Index program produces monthly data on changes in the prices paid by urban consumers for a representative basket of goods and services. Current CPI News ReleaseCurrent CPI Tables (from the current news release) Historical CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)CPI Databases The Producer Price Indexes (PPIs) measure the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. Current PPI News ReleaseCurrent PPI Tables (from the current news release) Historical and Detailed Tables The International Price Program (IPP) produces Import/Export Price Indexes (MXP), which contain data on changes in the prices of nonmilitary goods and services traded between the United States and the rest of the world. Current MXP ReleaseCurrent MXP Tables (from the current news release) Historical and Detailed Tables Employment Cost Trends (ECT) produce quarterly indexes measuring change over time in labor costs and quarterly data measuring level of average costs per hour worked. Current ECT News ReleaseCurrent ECT Tables (from the current news release) Historical and Detailed Tables Few economic indicators are as closely watched as measures of employment. In its monthly news release, BLS provides national totals of the number of employed and unemployed. This release includes the results from both a household survey and a business establishment survey. These data are presented as both seasonally and not seasonally adjusted. Current Monthly News Release\u2014Employment SituationEmployment Statistics Tables (from the current news release) Historical Labor Force Data (household survey) Historical Establishment-Based Data BLS also provides tables showing different characteristics of employed and unemployed persons, and persons not in the labor force. These statistics are available on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. Historical data are also available.  Labor Force Statistics Tables\u2014Survey of HouseholdsLabor Force Statistics Tables\u2014Survey of Business Establishments Labor productivity relates output to the labor hours used in the production of that output. Two BLS programs produce labor productivity and costs (LPC) measures for sectors of the U.S. economy. Current News Release\u2014Productivity and CostsLPC Tables The value of a U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies is determined in foreign exchange markets, and its value affects prices and economic activity in the United States. The Federal Reserve provides a brief overview on how the foreign exchange value of the dollar relates to Federal Reserve policy. Measures the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar versus various currencies and indices.

Real gross domestic product (GDP). Other important indicators include reports on personal income and employment. Several agencies release data, including the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Bureau of the Census, and the Office of Management and Budget. The frequencies with which data are released vary by agency and type of economic indicator. See \" Economic Indicator Release Dates \" (in \" Related Resources \") for details. A change in the trend of the economy (from expansion to recession, for example) is often announced only after several months of data are released. A recession is a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales. A recession begins just after the economy reaches a peak of activity and ends as the economy reaches its trough. Between trough and peak, the economy is in an expansion. Expansion is the normal state of the economy; most recessions are brief and they have been rare in recent decades. Recessions are dated by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a private research institute.  A popular definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, but recessions are not officially defined by the NBER using this definition.
