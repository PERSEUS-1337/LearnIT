Managed care rates to Medi-Cal managed care health plans shall be increased by a proportionately equal amount for increased payments for hospital services for the 2015\u201316 fiscal year.\n(iv) Commencing July 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, the department shall increase each diagnosis-related group payment claim amount based, at a minimum, on increases in the medical component of the California Consumer Price Index. Commencing July 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, managed care rates to Medi-Cal managed care health plans shall be increased by a proportionately equal amount for increased payments for hospital services.\n(B) The diagnosis-related group-based payments shall apply to all claims, except claims for psychiatric inpatient days, rehabilitation inpatient days, managed care inpatient days, and swing bed stays for long-term care services, provided, however, that psychiatric and rehabilitation inpatient days shall be excluded regardless of whether the stay was in a distinct-part unit. The department may exclude or include other claims and services as may be determined during the development of the payment methodology.\n(C) Implementation of the new payment methodology shall be coordinated with the development and implementation of the replacement Medicaid Management Information System pursuant to the contract entered into pursuant to Section 14104.3, effective on May 3, 2010.\n(2) The department shall evaluate alternative diagnosis-related group algorithms for the new Medi-Cal reimbursement system for the hospitals to which paragraph (1) applies.
