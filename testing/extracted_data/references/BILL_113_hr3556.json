FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Nonhuman primates, such as chimpanzees, gorillas, \n        orangutans, macaques, and numerous other species, often face \n        abusive and cruel captive conditions in other countries.\n            (2) There is growing evidence that, absent a suitable \n        humane alternative, these primates will remain or be placed in \n        other cruel captive conditions and face inhumane deaths in \n        areas outside the United States.\n            (3) Regulations of the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention allow importation of nonhuman primates only for \n        scientific, educational, or exhibition purposes and not for \n        humane lifetime shelter and care in appropriate primate \n        sanctuaries.\n            (4) Many of these animals could be obtained by certified \n        primate sanctuaries in the United States and provided with \n        shelter and care for the remainder of their natural lives in a \n        species-appropriate, humane environment if allowed by law to be \n        imported for such purpose.\n\nSEC. 3.
