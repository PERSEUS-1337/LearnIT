All points of order against \n                the motion are waived. Such a motion shall not be in \n                order after the House has disposed of a motion to \n                proceed on the joint resolution. The previous question \n                shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its \n                adoption without intervening motion. The motion shall \n                not be debatable.

All points of \n                order against the joint resolution and against its \n                consideration are waived. The previous question shall \n                be considered as ordered on the joint resolution to its \n                passage without intervening motion, except 20 hours of \n                debate equally divided and controlled by the proponent \n                and an opponent. A motion to reconsider the vote on \n                passage of the joint resolution shall not be in order. \n                No amendment to, or motion to recommit, a joint \n                resolution of disapproval shall be in order.\n                    (C) Appeals.--All appeals from the decisions of the \n                Chair relating to the application of the Rules of the \n                House of Representatives to the procedure relating to a \n                joint resolution of disapproval shall be decided \n                without debate.\n            (7) Floor consideration in the senate.--\n                    (A) In general.--Notwithstanding Rule XXII of the \n                Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in order at any \n                time after the committee authorized to consider a joint \n                resolution of disapproval reports it to the Senate or \n                has been discharged from its consideration (even though \n                a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed \n                to) to move to proceed to the consideration of the \n                joint resolution, and all points of order against the \n                joint resolution (and against consideration of the \n                joint resolution) are waived. The motion to proceed is \n                not debatable. The motion is not subject to a motion to \n                postpone. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the \n                motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in \n                order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of \n                the joint resolution is agreed to, the joint resolution \n                shall remain the unfinished business until disposed of.\n                    (B) Debate.--Debate in the Senate on a joint \n                resolution of disapproval, and all debatable motions \n                and appeals in connection with such a resolution, shall \n                be limited to not more than 20 hours, to be equally \n                divided between, and controlled by, the majority leader \n                and the minority leader or their designees. A motion to \n                further limit debate is in order and not debatable. An \n                amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to \n                proceed to the consideration of other business, or a \n                motion to recommit the joint resolution of disapproval \n                is not in order.\n                    (C) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage shall \n                occur immediately following the conclusion of the \n                debate on a joint resolution of disapproval, and a \n                single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if \n                requested in accordance with the rules of the Senate.\n                    (D) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals \n                from the decisions of the Chair relating to the \n                application of the rules of the Senate to the procedure \n                relating to a joint resolution of disapproval shall be \n                decided without debate.\n                    (E) Consideration of veto messages.--Debate in the \n                Senate of any veto message with respect to a joint \n                resolution of disapproval, including all debatable \n                motions and appeals in connection with such a joint \n                resolution, shall be limited to 10 hours, to be equally \n                divided between, and controlled by, the majority leader \n                and the minority leader or their designees.\n            (8) Rules relating to senate and house of \n        representatives.--\n                    (A) Coordination with action by other house.--If, \n                before the passage by one House of a joint resolution \n                of disapproval of that House, that House receives from \n                the other House a joint resolution of disapproval, then \n                the following procedures shall apply:\n                            (i) The joint resolution of the other House \n                        shall not be referred to a committee.\n                            (ii) With respect to a joint resolution of \n                        the House receiving the resolution--\n                                    (I) the procedure in that House \n                                shall be the same as if no joint \n                                resolution had been received from the \n                                other House; but\n                                    (II) the vote on passage shall be \n                                on the joint resolution of the other \n                                House.\n                    (B) Treatment of joint resolution of other house.--\n                If one House fails to introduce or consider a joint \n                resolution of disapproval under this section, the joint \n                resolution of disapproval of the other House shall be \n                entitled to expedited floor procedures under this \n                section.\n                    (C) Treatment of companion measures.--If, following \n                passage of a joint resolution of disapproval in the \n                Senate, the Senate then receives the companion measure \n                from the House of Representatives, the companion \n                measure shall not be debatable.\n            (9) Rules of the house of representatives and the senate.--\n        This subsection is enacted by Congress--\n                    (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the \n                Senate and the House of Representatives, respectively, \n                and as such is deemed a part of the rules of each \n                House, respectively, but applicable only with respect \n                to the procedure to be followed in that House in the \n                case of a joint resolution, and it supersedes other \n                rules only to the extent that it is inconsistent with \n                such rules; and\n                    (B) with full recognition of the constitutional \n                right of either House to change the rules (so far as \n                relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, \n                in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the \n                case of any other rule of that House.\n    (d) Limitation on Funding for Implementation of Agreement.--No \nfunds authorized to be appropriated for the Department of State that \nremain available for obligation as of the date of the enactment of this \nAct may be obligated or expended to implement an agreement described in \nsubsection (a)(2), including for the waiver, suspension, or other \nreduction of any sanctions with respect to Iran pursuant to such an \nagreement, if--\n            (1) the President fails to submit the agreement to Congress \n        as required by subsection (a); or\n            (2) a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted into law \n        pursuant to subsection (b).\n    (e) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section or any action \ntaken pursuant to this section shall be construed as approval of any \nwaiver, suspension, or other reduction of any sanctions with respect to \nIran in connection with any agreement relating to Iran's nuclear \nprogram.\n\nSEC. 4.
