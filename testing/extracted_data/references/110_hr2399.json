    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Alien Smuggling and Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Alien smuggling by land, air and sea is a transnational \n        crime that violates the integrity of United States borders, \n        compromises our Nation's sovereignty, places the country at \n        risk of terrorist activity, and contravenes the rule of law.\n            (2) Aggressive enforcement activity against alien smuggling \n        is needed to protect our borders and ensure the security of our \n        Nation. The border security and anti-smuggling efforts of the \n        men and women on the Nation's front line of defense are to be \n        commended. Special recognition is due the Department of \n        Homeland Security through the United States Border Patrol, \n        United States Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, and \n        Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Department of \n        Justice through the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n            (3) The law enforcement community must be given the \n        statutory tools necessary to address this security threat. Only \n        through effective alien smuggling statutes can the Justice \n        Department, through the United States Attorneys' Offices and \n        the Domestic Security Section of the Criminal Division, \n        prosecute these cases successfully.\n            (4) Alien smuggling has a destabilizing effect on border \n        communities. State and local law enforcement, medical \n        personnel, social service providers, and the faith community \n        play important roles in combating smuggling and responding to \n        its effects.\n            (5) Existing penalties for alien smuggling are insufficient \n        to provide appropriate punishment for alien smugglers.\n            (6) Existing alien smuggling laws often fail to reach the \n        conduct of alien smugglers, transporters, recruiters, guides, \n        and boat captains.\n            (7) Existing laws concerning failure to heave to are \n        insufficient to appropriately punish boat operators and crew \n        who engage in the reckless transportation of aliens on the high \n        seas and seek to evade capture.\n            (8) Much of the conduct in alien smuggling rings occurs \n        outside of the United States. Extraterritorial jurisdiction is \n        needed to ensure that smuggling rings can be brought to justice \n        for recruiting, sending, and facilitating the movement of those \n        who seek to enter the United States without lawful authority.\n            (9) Alien smuggling can include unsafe or recklessly \n        dangerous conditions that expose individuals to particularly \n        high risk of injury or death.\n\nSEC. 3. CHECKS AGAINST TERRORIST WATCHLIST.\n\n    The Department of Homeland Security shall, to the extent \npracticable, check against all available terrorist watchlists those \nalien smugglers and smuggled individuals who are interdicted at the \nland, air, and sea borders of the United States.\n\nSEC. 4. STRENGTHENING PROSECUTION AND PUNISHMENT OF ALIEN SMUGGLERS.\n\n    Section 274(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n1324(a)) is amended--\n            (1) by amending the subsection heading to read as follows: \n        ``Smuggling of Unlawful and Terrorist Aliens.--'';\n            (2) by redesignating clause (iv) of paragraph (1)(B) as \n        clause (vii);\n            (3) in paragraph (1), by striking ``(1)(A)'' and all that \n        follows through clause (iii) of subparagraph (B) and inserting \n        the following:\n    ``(1)(A) Whoever, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that \nan individual is an alien who lacks lawful authority to come to, enter, \nor reside in the United States, knowingly--\n            ``(i) brings that individual to the United States in any \n        manner whatsover regardless of any future official action which \n        may be taken with respect to such alien;\n            ``(ii) recruits, encourages, or induces that individual to \n        come to, enter, or reside in the United States;\n            ``(iii) transports or moves that individual in the United \n        States, in furtherance of their unlawful presence;

and\n            ``(v) if the offense results in serious bodily injury (as \n        defined in section 1365 of title 18, United States Code) or \n        places in jeopardy the life of any person, be fined under title \n        18, United States Code or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or \n        both;\n            ``(vi) if the offense involved an individual who the \n        defendant knew was engaged in or intended to engage in \n        terrorist activity (as defined in section 212(a)(3)(B)), be \n        fined under title 18, United States Code or imprisoned not more \n        than 30 years, or both;
