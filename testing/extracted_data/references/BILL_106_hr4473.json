FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There is a growing gap, commonly referred to as the \n        digital divide, between individuals who have access to \n        computers and the Internet and individuals who do not have such \n        access.\n            (2) Households with incomes of $75,000 or greater are more \n        than 20 times more likely to have access to the Internet, and \n        more than 9 times more likely to have a computer at home, than \n        households with the lowest income levels.\n            (3) Although 58.9 percent of Americans earning over $75,000 \n        annually frequently use the Internet, only 16 percent of \n        Americans earning between $5,000 and $10,000 annually use the \n        Internet.\n            (4) Black and Hispanic households are \\2/5\\ as likely to \n        have home Internet access as white households.\n            (5) The digital divide is an emergency that will \n        detrimentally affect the economy and society of the Nation \n        absent immediate corrective action.\n            (6) The e-rate program of the Federal Communications \n        Commission ensures that schools and libraries receive \n        telecommunications services at a discounted rate. Although \n        tremendously successful, this program is insufficient because \n        there is twice the demand for funding as there is funding \n        available.\n            (7) According to statistics by the Department of Education, \n        there is a dire need for additional computers in some schools. \n        Schools with the highest concentrations of poverty had an \n        average of 16 students per instructional computer with Internet \n        access, compared to 7 students for each such computer in \n        schools with the lowest concentrations of poverty.\n            (8) The computer industry is the fastest growing industry \n        in our country. There is a documented shortage of information \n        technology workers. Increasingly, workers in all fields of \n        employment will need to be computer literate. Ensuring that \n        classrooms have computers that are used effectively to teach \n        students will help meet this need.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION \n              ADMINISTRATION ORGANIZATION ACT.\n\n    The National Telecommunications and Information Administration \nOrganization Act (47 U.S.C. 901 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating part C as part D; and\n            (2) by inserting after part B the following new part:\n\n              ``PART C--COMPUTERS IN OUR COMMUNITY PROGRAM\n\n``SEC. 131.
