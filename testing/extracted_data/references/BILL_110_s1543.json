FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) domestic geothermal resources have the potential to \n        provide vast amounts of clean, renewable, and reliable energy \n        to the United States;\n            (2) Federal policies and programs are critical to achieving \n        the potential of those resources;\n            (3) Federal tax policies should be modified to \n        appropriately support the longer lead-times of geothermal \n        facilities and address the high risks of geothermal exploration \n        and development;\n            (4) sustained and expanded research programs are needed--\n                    (A) to support the goal of increased energy \n                production from geothermal resources; and\n                    (B) to develop the technologies that will enable \n                commercial production of energy from more geothermal \n                resources;\n            (5) a comprehensive national resource assessment is needed \n        to support policymakers and industry needs;\n            (6) a national exploration and development technology and \n        information center should be established to support the \n        achievement of increased geothermal energy production; and\n            (7) implementation and completion of geothermal and other \n        renewable initiatives on public land in the United States is \n        critical, consistent with the principles and requirements of \n        the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. \n        1701 et seq.) and other applicable law.\n\nSEC. 3.
