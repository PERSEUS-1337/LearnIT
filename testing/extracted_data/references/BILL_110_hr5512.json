FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) International demand along with market speculation for \n        commodity metals has, over the past several years, increased \n        the cost of producing circulating coins in the United States.\n            (2) In a July 30, 2007, letter to the Congress, the \n        Secretary of the Treasury, with support of the Administration's \n        Office of Management and Budget, requested that legislation be \n        put forward to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to make \n        changes to the composition of circulating coins.\n            (3) The United States Mint has studied alternative metals \n        for use in circulating coins, as noticed in its 2004 annual \n        report.\n            (4) In 1943, the United States Mint produced zinc-coated \n        steel pennies in response to war-time demands for copper.\n            (5) The United States Mint gained further experience \n        changing the metal content of pennies in 1982, when it began \n        producing copper-coated zinc pennies as a result of rising \n        copper prices.\n            (6) The Royal Canadian Mint has produced for several years \n        a copper-coated steel 1-cent coin that is similar to the United \n        States penny at a significantly lower cost than the cost to \n        produce the United States penny.\n            (7) Given the current cost to make a penny and volume of \n        pennies minted, by simply reducing penny production costs to \n        face value, the United States will save more than $500,000,000 \n        in the next 10 years alone.\n            (8) Reducing the cost to produce a nickel to face value \n        will save the United States an additional $60,000,000 per year.\n            (9) Commodity metal prices are often cyclical in nature, \n        and can be inflated by speculation, so it is important that a \n        solid trend in the rising price of a commodity metal be \n        established before any change in the metal content of a coin is \n        made.\n\nSEC. 3. IMMEDIATE REDUCTION IN THE COST OF PRODUCING 1-CENT COINS \n              THROUGH THE USE OF STEEL PENNIES.\n\n    Subsection (c) of section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, is \namended to read as follows:\n    ``(c) Composition of 1-Cent and 5-Cent Coins.--\n            ``(1) 1-cent coin.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), \n                beginning 270 days after the date of the enactment of \n                the Coin Modernization and Taxpayer Savings Act of \n                2008, the 1-cent coin shall--\n                            ``(i) be produced primarily of steel; and\n                            ``(ii) meet such other specifications as \n                        the Secretary may determine to be appropriate, \n                        including any change in the weight from that \n                        specified in subsection (a)(6).\n                    ``(B) Treatment.--The 1-cent coin shall be treated \n                to impart a copper color to the appearance of the coins \n                so that the appearance is similar to 1-cent coins \n                produced of a copper-zinc alloy.\n                    ``(C) Exception for lincoln bicentennial numismatic \n                pennies.--No provision of this paragraph shall apply \n                with respect to 1-cent coins described in section 304 \n                of the Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005 that are issued \n                for numismatic purposes.\n            ``(2) Alternative 1-cent coin composition.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--If, before the end of the 90-day \n                period beginning on the date of the enactment of the \n                Coin Modernization and Taxpayer Savings Act of 2008, \n                the Secretary determines that, with the addition of any \n                other element to any alloy of zinc and copper of which \n                1-cent coins could have been composed as of the day \n                before such date of enactment, there is a way--\n                            ``(i) to produce 1-cent coins of the same \n                        diameter, general composition, and general \n                        weight as 1-cent coins produced in accordance \n                        with this subsection as of the day before such \n                        date of enactment; and\n                            ``(ii) to achieve the goals of paragraph \n                        (1) by reducing the unit cost to produce the 1-\n                        cent coin to less than 1 cent while retaining \n                        such coin's ease of use and ensuring ease of \n                        co-circulation with 1-cent coins of the \n                        diameter and weight already circulating as of \n                        such date of enactment for ordinary commerce,\n                the Secretary may add any such element and continue \n                production of 1-cent coins of the same diameter, \n                general composition, and general weight as 1-cent coins \n                produced in accordance with this subsection as of the \n                day before such date of enactment instead of complying \n                with paragraph (1).\n                    ``(B) Effective period.--This paragraph shall only \n                apply if the change to the new composition and the \n                subsequent drop in the production cost of the 1-cent \n                coin referred to in subparagraph (A) can be achieved \n                before the end of the 270-day period referred to in \n                paragraph (1).\n                    ``(C) Report to the congress.--Any determination \n                and action by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) \n                shall be promptly reported to the Congress.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
