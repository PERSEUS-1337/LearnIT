RENEWABLE HYDROGEN TRANSPORTATION DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) reductions in local air pollution, greenhouse gas \n        emissions, and oil imports resulting from the introduction of \n        vehicles with gasoline-powered internal combustion hybrid \n        electric engines will be only temporary, as improved fuel \n        economy of the hybrid vehicles is offset by increases in \n        vehicle miles traveled;\n            (2) direct substitution of farm-based renewable fuels for \n        gasoline in gasoline-powered internal combustion hybrid \n        electric engines will result in further reductions in local air \n        pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and oil imports;\n            (3) for permanent reductions in criteria pollutants, \n        greenhouse gas emissions, and oil imports, Congress should \n        establish as a national goal the development of renewable \n        hydrogen as a clean effective energy carrier;\n            (4) the development of vehicles powered by hydrogen derived \n        from domestic renewable resources such as ethanol, energy \n        crops, agricultural waste, landfill gas, municipal solid waste, \n        wind power, and solar electricity, will--\n                    (A) substantially and permanently reduce local air \n                pollution and greenhouse gas emissions;\n                    (B) improve the energy security of the United \n                States; and\n                    (C) create domestic jobs;\n            (5) notwithstanding paragraph (4), as of the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the fuel cell technology required to \n        make the most efficient use of renewable hydrogen is too costly \n        and has not achieved the reliability necessary for consumer \n        acceptance in the near term;\n            (6) in the near term (before affordable and reliable fuel \n        cell vehicles are developed), hydrogen-powered internal \n        combustion engine hybrid electric vehicles have been developed \n        that can achieve more than 90 percent of the environmental \n        benefits and 100 percent of the oil import reduction benefits \n        of fuel cell vehicles;\n            (7) in addition to robust research and development for fuel \n        cell vehicles, a program to develop and demonstrate renewable \n        hydrogen production and distribution technology is justified;\n            (8) reforming ethanol at a vehicle fueling station may be \n        the least costly method of producing renewable hydrogen;\n            (9) a low cost renewable hydrogen vehicle demonstration \n        program that will yield valuable information regarding an \n        interim transition strategy of using hydrogen-powered internal \n        combustion engine hybrid electric vehicles to pave the way for \n        fuel cell vehicles once fuel cell vehicles become affordable \n        and reliable can be implemented in 1 year; and\n            (10) the introduction of commercial hydrogen internal \n        combustion engine hybrid electric vehicles can provide the \n        economic incentives to help stimulate development of hydrogen \n        fueling systems at existing gasoline fueling stations to \n        convert ethanol to hydrogen onsite, thereby significantly \n        accelerating the adoption of super-clean renewable hydrogen as \n        an alternative to gasoline made from imported crude oil.\n    (b) Program.--Section 9007 of the Farm Security and Rural \nInvestment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 8107) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following:\n    ``(c) Demonstration Program.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary of Energy, in coordination \n        with the Secretary, shall conduct a 3-year program to develop \n        and demonstrate the cost-effective operation of a fleet of at \n        least 10 direct hydrogen passenger vehicles based on existing \n        commercial technology under which the hydrogen is derived from \n        ethanol or other domestic low-cost transportable renewable \n        feedstocks.\n            ``(2) Goals.--The goals of the program shall include--\n                    ``(A) demonstrating the cost-effective conversion \n                of ethanol or other low-cost transportable renewable \n                feedstocks to pure hydrogen suitable for eventual use \n                in proton exchange membrane fuel cell vehicles at 1 or \n                more local fueling stations, including hydrogen \n                compression and storage necessary to fill vehicle tanks \n                to their operational pressure, using existing \n                commercial reforming technology or modest modifications \n                of existing technology to reform ethanol or other low-\n                cost transportable renewable feedstocks into hydrogen;\n                    ``(B) converting 10 or more commercially available \n                internal combustion engine hybrid electric passenger \n                vehicles to operate on hydrogen;\n                    ``(C) installing and operating an ethanol reformer \n                or reformer of another low-cost transportable renewable \n                feedstock (including onsite hydrogen compression, \n                storage, and dispensing) at the facilities of a fleet \n                operator not later than 1 year after commencement of \n                the program;\n                    ``(D) operating the 10 or more hydrogen internal \n                combustion engine hybrid electric vehicles for a period \n                of 2 years; and\n                    ``(E) collecting emissions and fuel economy data on \n                the 10 hydrogen-powered vehicles over various operating \n                conditions and weather conditions.\n            ``(3) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized \n        to be appropriated to carry out this subsection $5,000,000.''."
