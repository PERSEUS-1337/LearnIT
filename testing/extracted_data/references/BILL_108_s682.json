FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Department of Energy's Genomes to Life initiative \n        involves the emerging fields of systems biology and proteomics, \n        which address the ability to understand the composition and \n        function of the biochemical networks and pathways that carry \n        out the essential processes of living organisms.\n            (2) The Genomes to Life initiative builds on the Department \n        of Energy's integral role in the Human Genome Project, which \n        has led to the mapping, sequencing and identification of \n        genetic material. Genomes to Life will go beyond mapping to \n        develop an understanding of how genetic components interact to \n        perform cellular activities vital to life.\n            (3) The ability of the United States to respond to the \n        national security, energy and environmental challenges of the \n        21st century will be driven by science and technology. An \n        integrated and predictive understanding of biological systems \n        will enable the United States to develop new technologies \n        related to the detection of biological and chemical agents, \n        energy production, carbon sequestration, bioremediation and \n        other Department of Energy statutory missions. These advances \n        will also enhance the strength of U.S. science, technology, and \n        medicine generally.\n            (4) The fundamental intellectual challenges inherent in the \n        Genomes to Life initiative are considerable, and require public \n        support for basic and applied research and development. \n        Significant advances in areas such as the characterization of \n        multiprotein complexes and gene regulatory networks will be \n        required before biologically-based solutions and technologies \n        will be useful in national security applications, as well as to \n        the energy, medical and agricultural industries.\n            (5) The development of new scientific instruments will also \n        be required to advance Genomes to Life research. Such \n        instruments are likely to be large and costly. Specialized \n        facilities are also likely to be required in order to advance \n        the field and to realize its promise. Such facilities will be \n        sufficiently expensive that they will have to be located and \n        constructed on a centralized basis, similar to a number of \n        unique facilities already managed by the Department of Energy.\n            (6) Contributions from individual researchers as well as \n        multidisciplinary research teams will be required to advance \n        systems biology and proteomics.\n            (7) The Department of Energy's Office of Science is well \n        suited to manage systems biology and proteomics research for \n        the Department. Through its support of research and development \n        pursuant to the Department's statutory authorities, the Office \n        of Science is the principal federal supporter of the research \n        and development in the physical and computational sciences. The \n        Office is also a significant source of federal support for \n        research in genomics and the life sciences. The Office supports \n        research and development by individual investigators and \n        multidisciplinary teams, and manages special user facilities \n        that serve investigators in both university and industry.\n\nSEC. 3.
