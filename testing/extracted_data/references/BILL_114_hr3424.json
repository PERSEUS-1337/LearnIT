TERMS OF MOVING TO WORK AGREEMENTS.\n\n    The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may not enter into \nor extend any Moving to Work agreement for any public housing agency \nfor participation in the demonstration established under section 204 of \nthe Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, \nand Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996 (Public Law 104-134; \n110 Stat. 1321), unless such agreement is subject to the following \nterms and conditions for the entire duration of such agreement:\n            (1) Evaluation of major policy changes.--A public housing \n        agency may not newly establish any rent policy that raises rent \n        burdens for a significant portion of participating families, \n        any time limitation on the term of housing assistance, or any \n        policy that conditions receipt of housing assistance from \n        program funds on employment status, unless--\n                    (A) the policy change will be subject to a detailed \n                evaluation using a rigorous research methodology which \n                includes, at least in part, random assignment to \n                treatment and control groups to compare the impact on \n                assisted families (including families that cease to \n                receive assistance during the term of the evaluation) \n                to similar families not subject to such policy change; \n                and\n                    (B) the Secretary determines that adequate Federal \n                or other resources are available to undertake the \n                required evaluation.\n            (2) Use of tenant-based rental assistance funds.--A public \n        housing agency may use funds appropriated for renewal of \n        tenant-based rental assistance only for payments to or on \n        behalf of eligible families that assist such families with \n        housing costs, except that up to 10 percent of such funds may \n        be used for other eligible purposes, subject to such \n        requirements as the Secretary shall establish.\n            (3) Determination of tenant-based rental assistance \n        funding.--A public housing agency shall receive funding for \n        renewal of tenant-based rental assistance determined using the \n        same formula applied to public housing agencies that do not \n        participate in the demonstration, except that up to 10 percent \n        of such funds may be renewed by adjusting the prior year's \n        funding by an inflation factor determined by the Secretary.\n            (4) Prohibition of reduction in number of families \n        assisted.--A public housing agency shall provide ongoing \n        housing assistance resulting in average cost burdens no higher \n        than those of families assisted under sections 8 and 9 of the \n        United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f, 1437g) to \n        substantially the same number of eligible low-income families \n        as the agency could assist if it expended the full amount of \n        funding it receives under such sections 8 and 9 pursuant to the \n        requirements of such sections.\n            (5) Housing choice.--If the Secretary determines that a \n        disproportionately low share of families assisted by a public \n        housing agency using funds appropriated pursuant to sections 8 \n        and 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 lives in \n        neighborhoods with low crime, high-performing schools, or other \n        indicators of high opportunity, the public housing agency shall \n        develop and implement a plan to expand families' access to such \n        neighborhoods.\n            (6) Determination of public housing operating funding.--A \n        public housing agency shall receive funding for operation and \n        management of public housing determined using the same formula \n        applied to public housing agencies that do not participate in \n        the demonstration, except that, for an agency that currently \n        receives such funding under an alternative formula established \n        by its Moving to Work agreement, the Secretary shall phase in \n        the requirements of this paragraph in a manner sufficient so as \n        to avoid reducing funding by more than 10 percent per year.\n            (7) Retained provisions.--The Secretary shall not waive any \n        of the following provisions of the United States Housing Act of \n        1937:\n                    (A) Subsections (a)(2)(A) and (b)(1) of section 16 \n                (42 U.S.C. 1437n;
