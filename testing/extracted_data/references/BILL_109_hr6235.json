FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) With respect to the Office of Women's Health within the \n        Food and Drug Administration:\n                    (A) When first established, the Office reported \n                directly to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.\n                    (B) In the current organization of the Food and \n                Drug Administration (``FDA''), the Office of Women's \n                Health is located at the second level reporting within \n                the Office of the Commissioner and is within the Office \n                of Science and Health Coordination.\n            (2) With respect to the regulation by the FDA of silicone \n        breast implants:\n                    (A) In a draft guidance issued in January 2004, the \n                FDA asked manufacturers of such implants--\n                            (i) to describe the rates of implant \n                        rupture over the lifetime of the product;\n                            (ii) to describe the incidence of gel \n                        migration resulting from ruptures; and\n                            (iii) to characterize the health \n                        consequences of ruptures and associated \n                        migration.\n                    (B) The manufacturers of silicone breast implants \n                have not complied with that draft guidance for the \n                specific implants in their premarket-approval \n                applications.\n                    (C) A study released by FDA researchers in 2000 \n                reviewed silicone breast implants that were an average \n                age of 17 years and concluded that 69 percent of the \n                women had ruptures in one or more silicone breast \n                implants, and 21 percent experienced gel migration \n                outside the implant. Implant manufacturers have not \n                established whether the implants in their premarket-\n                approval applications would have similar or different \n                failure rates and leakage after 17 years.\n                    (D) In April 2005, a study published in the \n                American Journal of Surgical Pathology focusing on gel \n                migration found that 90 percent of the women studied \n                who had silicone implants showed silicone droplets in \n                their lymph nodes. The study also showed that 95 \n                percent of these women had abnormal cells in their \n                lymph nodes, compared with only 33 percent of women who \n                had breast cancer surgery without the addition of \n                silicone implants.\n                    (E) In 2003, the U.S. government entered into a \n                settlement with breast implant manufacturers for \n                reimbursement for medical expenses paid by the Federal \n                Government for women harmed by silicone gel breast \n                implants.\n                    (F) FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations \n                (``OCI'') has investigated whether one manufacturer of \n                breast implants submitted inaccurate data on ruptures \n                in its application. The FDA OCI also is investigating \n                allegations regarding whether that same manufacturer \n                failed to ensure that their implants were used in \n                compliance with FDA restrictions for the Adjunct Study.\n            (3) With respect to the applications submitted to the FDA \n        by Barr Laboratories for approval of the contraceptive drug \n        marketed as Plan B:\n                    (A) The FDA rejected the first Plan B application \n                in May 2004 because of concerns that easier access to \n                Plan B might result in increased promiscuity among \n                women under 16, despite studies disproving this \n                contention.\n                    (B) The FDA said it would not approve the Plan B \n                application unless it included an age-based sales \n                distinction. In response, Barr Laboratories submitted a \n                new application to provide over-the-counter sales of \n                plan B to women 16 years and older. More than one-year \n                later, FDA expressed concern that the age-based sales \n                distinction would present regulatory concerns, even \n                though the amended application was the result of FDA's \n                recommendations.\n                    (C) According to court documents released on August \n                3, 2006, the director of FDA's Office of New Drugs \n                learned early in 2004 that the then-FDA Commissioner \n                had decided against approval of Plan B before FDA staff \n                could complete their analysis.\n                    (D) In another sworn deposition contained in the \n                same court documents, one FDA official was told in \n                January 2004 by the FDA Deputy Commissioner that Plan B \n                needed to be rejected to ``appease the administration's \n                constituents''.\n                    (E) In a letter and congressional testimony on \n                August 1, the FDA Commissioner recommended that the \n                appropriate age range for over-the-counter Plan B is 18 \n                and older. This recommendation was established \n                arbitrarily and acknowledged by FDA as not supported by \n                scientific data.\n                    (F) A former FDA Commissioner testified in a sworn \n                statement that he delayed approving over-the-counter \n                sales of Plan B to determine how to restrict sales to \n                young teens.\n                    (G) A study in the Journal of Obstetrics & \n                Gynecology concluded that young women are able to use \n                Plan B ``effectively and safely without health care \n                provider intervention''.\n                    (H) In November 2005, the Governmental \n                Accountability Office found that the May 2004 decision \n                to deny OTC status to Plan B emergency contraception \n                ``was unusual'' in that the decision was made at a much \n                higher level within FDA than is usual practice, that \n                the decision overruled recommendations by several \n                levels of professional staff, and that the decision to \n                limit OTC access to only those over a certain age was \n                made prior to the completion of the regular review \n                process.\n\nSEC. 3. OFFICE OF WOMEN'S HEALTH WITHIN FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION.\n\n    Section 903 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n392) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsections (f) and (g) as subsections \n        (g) and (h), respectively;\n            (2) in subsection (g) (as so redesignated), in paragraph \n        (1), by striking ``subsection (f)'' and inserting ``subsection \n        (g)''; and\n            (3) by inserting after subsection (e) the following \n        subsection:\n    ``(f) Office of Women's Health.--\n            ``(1) In general.--There is established within the Office \n        of the Commissioner an office to be known as the Office of \n        Women's Health (referred to in this subsection as the \n        `Office'). The Office shall be headed by a director, who shall \n        report directly to the Commissioner.\n            ``(2) Duties.--With respect to activities of the Food and \n        Drug Administration that relate to women's health, the Director \n        of the Office shall--\n                    ``(A) assess the level of agency activity;\n                    ``(B) set short-range and long-range goals; and\n                    ``(C) be responsible for activities related to \n                prevention, research, education and training, service \n                delivery, and policy development.''.\n\nSEC. 4. SCIENCE ON BREAST IMPLANTS.\n\n    Subchapter A of chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct (21 U.S.C. 351 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 515 \nthe following section:\n\n``SEC. 515A.
