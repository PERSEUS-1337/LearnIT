FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that\n            (1)(A) mercury is a potent neurotoxin of significant \n        ecological and public health concern;\n            (B) exposure to mercury occurs largely by consumption of \n        contaminated fish;\n            (C) children and women of childbearing age who consume \n        large quantities of fish are at high risk of adverse effects;\n            (D) it is estimated that more than 630,000 children born \n        each year in the United States are exposed to levels of mercury \n        in the womb that are high enough to impair neurological \n        development; and\n            (E) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have \n        found that 8 percent of women in the United States of \n        childbearing age have blood mercury levels in excess of values \n        determined to be safe by the Environmental Protection Agency;\n            (2)(A) as of 2006, 3,080 fish consumption advisories due to \n        mercury contamination have been issued for 48 States, including \n        23 statewide advisories for freshwater and 12 statewide \n        advisories for coastal waters;\n            (B) that is a 26 percent increase over the number of \n        advisories issued in 2004;\n            (C) those advisories represent more than 22,000 square \n        miles of lakes and 882,000 miles of rivers;\n            (D) however, fish and shellfish are an important source of \n        dietary protein, and a healthy fishing resource is important to \n        the economy of the United States; and\n            (E) the extent of fish consumption advisories underscores \n        the extensive human and ecological health risk posed by mercury \n        pollution;\n            (3)(A) in many locations, the primary route for mercury \n        input to aquatic ecosystems is atmospheric emissions, \n        transport, and deposition;\n            (B) the cycling of mercury in the environment and resulting \n        accumulation in biota are not fully understood; and\n            (C) computer models and other assessment tools provide \n        varying effectiveness in predicting mercury concentrations in \n        fish, and no broad-scale data sets exist to test model \n        predictions;\n            (4)(A) on September 14 through 17, 2003, the Environmental \n        Protection Agency cosponsored a Society of Environmental \n        Toxicology and Chemistry workshop involving more than 30 \n        international experts to formulate a system to quantify and \n        document mercury changes in the various environment fields \n        resulting from anticipated reductions in mercury emissions in \n        the United States; and\n            (B) the resulting plan proposes a holistic, multimedia, \n        long-term mercury monitoring program that is documented in 2 \n        sources--\n                    (i) on January 1, 2005, the article entitled \n                ``Monitoring the Response to Changing Mercury \n                Deposition'' was published in the journal Environmental \n                Science and Technology; and\n                    (ii) in 2008, the book entitled ``Ecosystem \n                Responses to Mercury Contamination: Indicators of \n                Change'' was published by CRC Press;\n            (5) as of the date of enactment of this Act, many \n        regulations limiting mercury emissions from different sources \n        have gone into effect or will be implemented, but ongoing \n        monitoring programs are not adequately measuring the \n        environmental benefits and effectiveness of mercury emission \n        controls;\n            (6) on May 15, 2006, the Office of Inspector General of the \n        Environmental Protection Agency issued a report entitled, \n        ``Monitoring Needed to Assess Impact of EPA's Clean Air Mercury \n        Rule (CAMR) on Potential Hotspots'', Report No. 2006-P-0025, \n        which states, in part--\n                    (A) ``Without field data from an improved \n                monitoring network, EPA's ability to advance mercury \n                science will be limited and `utility-attributable \n                hotspots' that pose health risks may occur and go \n                undetected''; and\n                    (B) ``We recommend that the EPA develop and \n                implement a mercury monitoring plan to assess the \n                impact of CAMR, if adopted, on mercury deposition and \n                fish tissue and evaluate and refine mercury estimation \n                tools and models'';\n            (7)(A) on January 1, 2007, the articles entitled \n        ``Biological Mercury Hotspots in the Northeastern U.S. and \n        Southeastern Canada'' and ``Contamination in Remote Forest and \n        Aquatic Ecosystems in the Northeastern U.S.: Sources, \n        Transformations and Management Options'' were published in the \n        journal BioScience; and\n            (B) the authors of the articles--\n                    (i) identified 5 biological mercury hotspots and 9 \n                areas of concern in the northeastern United States and \n                southeastern Canada associated primarily with \n                atmospheric mercury emissions and deposition;\n                    (ii) located an area of particularly high mercury \n                deposition adjacent to a coal-fired utility in southern \n                New Hampshire; and\n                    (iii) concluded that local impacts from mercury \n                emissions should be closely monitored in order to \n                assess the impact of Federal and State policies; and\n            (8)(A) building on previous efforts in 2003, on May 5 \n        through 7, 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency coconvened \n        a workshop with experts from the United States Geological \n        Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \n        the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park \n        Service, State and tribal agencies, the BioDiversity Research \n        Institute, the National Atmospheric Deposition Program, \n        industry, and other institutions;\n            (B) more than 50 workshop scientists participated and \n        agreed on a goal and major design elements for a national \n        mercury monitoring program, including a national distribution \n        of approximately 20 intensive sites to understand the sources, \n        consequences, and trends in United States mercury pollution;\n            (C) the consortium found that ``policy makers, scientists \n        and the public need a comprehensive and integrated mercury \n        monitoring network to accurately quantify regional and national \n        changes in atmospheric deposition, ecosystem contamination, and \n        bioaccumulation of mercury in fish and wildlife in response to \n        changes in mercury emissions.''; and\n            (D) the workshop findings are published in a report of the \n        Environmental Protection Agency (430-K-09-001).\n\nSEC. 3.
