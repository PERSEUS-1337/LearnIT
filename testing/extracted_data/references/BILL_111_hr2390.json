FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Nearly 8,800,000 Americans were eligible for benefits \n        under the Medicare program and for medical assistance under \n        Medicaid (dual eligible beneficiaries) in fiscal year 2005. Of \n        these ``dual eligible beneficiaries'', almost 40 percent have \n        cognitive impairments, including Alzheimer's disease, dementia, \n        serious mental illnesses, and intellectual disabilities. Until \n        December 31, 2005, dual eligible beneficiaries received \n        outpatient prescription drug benefits through medical \n        assistance under Medicaid. On January 1, 2006, drug coverage \n        for dual eligibles switched from Medicaid to Medicare.\n            (2) In 2008, 53 percent of dual eligible beneficiaries had \n        medication access problems and of those, 27 percent experienced \n        significant adverse clinical events.\n            (3) Individuals with medication access issues experience \n        significantly more adverse clinical events. Among dual eligible \n        beneficiaries with mental illness who had medication access \n        problems, 27 percent experienced significant adverse clinical \n        events, which included emergency room visits and \n        hospitalizations.\n            (4) In total, over 1,000,000 dual eligible beneficiaries \n        and low-income subsidy beneficiaries were automatically auto-\n        enrolled to new benchmark prescription drug plans under part D \n        of the Medicare program between 2006 and 2007.\n            (5) Community providers are at the front line of helping \n        the most vulnerable dual eligible beneficiaries obtain \n        prescription drug coverage under the Medicare program and \n        navigate complex enrollment and low-income subsidy eligibility \n        requirements under such program.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this bill to help low-income \npersons with cognitive impairments to enroll in and navigate the \nprescription drug benefit under the Medicare program by providing front \nline community providers who serve the population daily with financial \nassistance to conduct vigorous education and outreach and direct case \nmanagement.\n\nSEC. 3.
