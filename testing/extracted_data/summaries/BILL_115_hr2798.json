    "content": "No Russian Diplomatic Access to Compounds Here in America Act or No Russian DACHA Act This bill prohibits the President from allowing access by the government of the Russian Federation or its personnel to Russian-owned diplomatic facilities and properties at Pioneer Point in Centreville, Maryland, and in Upper Brookville, New York. Before taking any action to waive or otherwise limit the application of such prohibition, the President must submit to specified congressional committees and the majority and minority leaders of the House of Representatives and the Senate a report that describes the proposed action and certifies that the Russian government: (1) did not use such facilities and properties for intelligence-related purposes, and (2) has ceased the harassment of US government diplomatic personnel in Russia. The bill provides for a period of congressional review of such report and certification and prohibits the President from taking any such action if Congress passes a joint resolution disapproving it."
