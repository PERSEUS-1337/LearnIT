    "content": "Professional Boxing Safety Act - Allows a professional boxing match to be held in the United States only if: (1) the State where the professional boxing match is to be held has a State boxing commission or has entered into an agreement with a State boxing commission of another State to oversee the match and to regulate each of its boxing matches. And (2) the State boxing commission has established procedures to carry out this Act. Requires each professional boxer to register with: (1) the State boxing commission of the State in which such boxer resides. (2) the State boxing commission overseeing the boxing match if the boxer is a resident of a State in which there is no State boxing commission. And (3) any State that has a State boxing commission if the boxer is from a foreign country. Requires a State boxing commission to issue an identification card to each registered professional boxer to be renewed by the boxer at least once every three years and to be presented to the State boxing commission by the time of the weigh-in for a professional boxing match. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed as preventing a State from applying additional registration requirements.
