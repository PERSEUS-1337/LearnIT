    "content": "About 18% of all U.S. adolescents received mental health treatment in 2000. Almost $7billion was spent for such services for teens in 1998. While many youth have used alcohol or otherillicit drugs, less than 2% received treatment for substance use in 2000. In 1997, costs for such carefor children under 18 totaled $604 million. In this report, the availability of selected mental health and substance abuse services underMedicaid and SCHIP for low and moderate income children is explored. Under SCHIP, states mayprovide coverage by expanding Medicaid or creating a separate SCHIP program or both. Data fromtwo CRS-sponsored surveys, documenting general limits placed on such services as of June, 2000,are presented. For Medicaid, including Medicaid expansions under SCHIP, survey results werereported for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. For separate SCHIP programs, survey resultswere reported for all 41 programs operating in 33 states. Nearly all Medicaid and SCHIP programs covered inpatient and outpatient mental healthservices for children, and most also covered inpatient detoxification and outpatient substance abusetreatment. Such benefits were more frequently unlimited under Medicaid than under SCHIP. Whilethe majority of Medicaid programs covered residential treatment centers, most SCHIP programs didnot. In many cases, expressing benefit limits as a simple quantity (e.g., days of care, admissions peryear, visits/hours per year) did not address the full scope of restrictions on coverage. Other meansof limiting benefits were also reported (e.g., use of prior authorization, thresholds specific tocondition/diagnosis, and treatment plan requirements). Under SCHIP, but not Medicaid, a singlequantity limit was often applied to two or more related benefits combined rather than separately foreach benefit category. Coverage policies and benefit limits for children under Medicaid are seldom absolute in partbecause of special provisions in the law requiring that children receive all medically necessaryservices authorized in federal statute. This guarantee does not exist in SCHIP. Instead, SCHIPchildren have access to similar types of benefit packages available in the private sector. Facing declining revenues and increased expenses, some states are implementing a numberof Medicaid cost containment strategies focused on reductions in provider payments, and reductionsin and/or elimination of optional services and populations, mostly affecting adults. Under SCHIP,some states are also capping enrollment and increasing beneficiary cost-sharing. While theseproposed strategies appear to leave mental health and substance abuse benefits for children largelyintact, they could effectively limit access to care. Finally, this report also describes mental health parity and its application to Medicaid andSCHIP under current federal law, and related, pending legislation in the 108th Congress."
