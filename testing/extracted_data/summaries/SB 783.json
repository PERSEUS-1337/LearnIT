    "title": "An act to amend Section 1367.003 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to health care coverage.",
    "content": "Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. The federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires a health insurance issuer issuing health insurance coverage to comply with minimum medical loss ratios, and to provide an annual rebate to each insured if the medical loss ratio of the amount of the revenue expended by the issuer on costs to the total amount of premium revenue is less than a certain percentage, as specified. Existing law requires health care service plans to comply with those requirements. This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to the latter provision."
