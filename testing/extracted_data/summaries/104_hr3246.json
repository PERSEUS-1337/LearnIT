    "content": "ATM Fee Disclosure Act of 1996 - Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to prohibit imposition of a fee upon an electronic fund transfer initiated by a consumer from an electronic terminal unless explicit disclosures are provided regarding the amount of any transaction fee and the consumer's option to cancel the transaction without paying the fee. Mandates written documentation upon completion of the transfer of such fee amount and the identity of the person imposing it. Includes within such electronic fund transfers, for purposes of this Act, a balance inquiry initiated by a consumer in the same manner as an electronic fund transfer regardless of whether the consumer initiates a transfer of funds in the course of the transaction."
