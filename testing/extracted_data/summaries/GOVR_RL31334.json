Operation Noble Eagle is the name given to military operations related to homeland security and support to federal, state, and local agencies in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Operation Enduring Freedom includes ongoing operations in Afghanistan, operations against terrorists in other countries, and training assistance to foreign militaries which are conducting operations against terrorists. Operation Iraqi Freedom includes the invasion of Iraq, the defeat of Saddam Hussein's regime, and the subsequent rebuilding and counter-insurgency operations in Iraq. The questions are grouped into three major thematic areas: personnel, compensation and force structure. The section on personnel addresses issues such as casualties, reserve mobilization, \"sole surviving\" son or daughter status, conscientious objection, and \"stop-loss.\" The section on compensation addresses issues related to the pay and benefits\u2014including casualty and death benefits\u2014provided to members of the U.S. military participating in ONE/OEF/OIF and their families. The section on force structure addresses issues related to how ONE/OEF/OIF might affect the number of personnel needed by the military, and responds to common questions about whether a return to conscription is likely under current circumstances. This report will be updated as needed."
