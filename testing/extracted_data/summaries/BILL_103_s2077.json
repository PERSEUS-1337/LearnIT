    "content": "Community Improvement Volunteer Act of 1994 - Provides for waivers of the prevailing-wage-setting requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act with respect to volunteers who perform services under the Library Services and Construction Act, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, or migrant health centers or community health centers provisions of the Public Health Service Act. Prohibits approval of any expense, benefit, or fee being paid to such volunteers which has the effect of undermining labor standards by creating downward pressure on prevailing wages in the local construction industry. Directs the Secretary of Labor to report to the appropriate congressional committees on such waivers for volunteers on such projects and make recommendations with respect to other Davis-Bacon-related Acts that could be addressed to permit volunteer work."
