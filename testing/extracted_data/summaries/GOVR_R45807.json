Estimates suggest that more than two-thirds of the country's nearly 900 million eligible voters participated. The 545-seat Lok Sabha (People's House) is seated every five years, and the results saw a return to power of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was chief minister of the west Indian state of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014. Modi's party won decisively\u00e2\u0080\u0094it now holds 56% of Lok Sabha seats and Modi became the first Indian leader to win consecutive majorities since Indira Gandhi in 1971. The United States and India have been pursuing an expansive strategic partnership since 2005. The Trump Administration and many in the U.S. Congress welcomed Modi's return to power for another five-year term. Successive U.S. Presidents have deemed India's growing power and influence a boon to U.S. interests in Asia and globally, not least in the context of balancing against China's increasing assertiveness. India is often called a preeminent actor in the Trump Administration's strategy for a \"free and open Indo-Pacific.\" Yet there are potential stumbling blocks to continued development of the partnership. In 2019, differences over trade have become more prominent, and India's long-standing (and mostly commercial) ties to Russia and Iran may run afoul of U.S. sanctions laws. Additionally, India maintains a wariness of U.S. engagement with Pakistan and intentions in Afghanistan, with Islamabad presently facilitating a U.S.-Taliban dialogue and India counseling against a precipitous U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Prime Minister Modi's return to power promises broad continuity, even with some notable changes to the federal cabinet. By many accounts, Modi's record as an economic reformer and liberalizer is mixed, and his reputation as a nationalist \"watchman\" has not always translated into effective foreign policy, according to some analysts. It is unclear if Modi will use his renewed domestic political mandate to pursue more assertiveness internationally, possibly in ways that challenge U.S. preferences. Still, most analysts contend that Modi and the BJP have been and will continue to be more open to aligning with U.S. regional strategy and more energetic in pursuing U.S.-favored economic reforms than would have been any alternative Indian leadership. The BJP is a Hindu nationalist party, born in 1980 of a larger social movement, and Narendra Modi is a self-avowed Hindu nationalist (India is roughly 79% Hindu and 14% Muslim). The 2019 Modi-BJP campaign was widely criticized for divisiveness, and nationalist fervor following a February India-Pakistan crisis may have benefitted the BJP at the polls. India's minority communities and the country's civil society are widely reported to be under increasing threats emanating from Hindu majoritarian policies and sentiment. These threats can take violent and repressive forms, at times with the involvement of Indian officials or political figures, as reported by the U.S. State Department and independent human rights watchdogs, and as criticized by some Members of Congress. This report reviews the recent Indian election process and results, the country's national political stage, and possible implications for U.S. interests in the areas of bilateral economic and trade relations, defense and security ties, India's other foreign relations, and human rights concerns."
