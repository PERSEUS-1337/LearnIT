    "content": "This report explains the conditions in five countries in Central America (Costa Rica, ElSalvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua) and one country in the Caribbean (DominicanRepublic) that will be partners with the United States in the U.S.-Dominican Republic-CentralAmerica Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) signed in August 2004. All of the signatory countriesexcept Costa Rica have approved the pact. The agreement will enter into force for the approvingcountries on an agreed date, tentatively January 1, 2006. In U.S. approval action, the House andSenate passed the required implementing legislation ( H.R. 3045 ) on July 27 and 28,2005, and the President signed it into law ( P.L. 109-53 ) on August 2, 2005. The DR-CAFTA partners are basically small countries with limited populations andeconomic resources, ranging in population from Costa Rica with a population of 4.1 million toGuatemala with a population of 12.6 million, and ranging in Gross National Income (GNI) from $4.5billion for Nicaragua to $26.9 billion for Guatemala. While El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaraguaexperienced extended civil conflicts in the 1970s and 1980s, all of the countries have haddemocratically elected presidents for some time, and several of the countries have experienced recentelectoral transitions. For each of the countries the United States is the dominant market as well asthe major source of investment and foreign assistance, including trade preferences under theCaribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) and assistance following devastating hurricanes. The Bush Administration and other proponents of the pact argue that the agreement willcreate new opportunities for U.S. businesses and workers by eliminating barriers to U.S. goods andservices in the region. They also argue that it will encourage economic reform and strengthendemocracy in affected countries. Many regional officials favor the pact because it provides newaccess to the U.S. market and makes permanent many of the temporary one-way duty-free tradepreferences currently in place. Critics argue that the environmental and labor provisions areinadequate, that the pact will lead to the loss of jobs for workers in the United States and forsubsistence farmers in Central America, and that provisions relating to textiles/apparel and sugar willbe harmful to U.S. producers. In the context of legislative action, the Bush Administration promisedto limit sugar imports, to make some adjustments for textile industries, and to support multi-yearassistance to strengthen regional enforcement of labor and environmental standards.
