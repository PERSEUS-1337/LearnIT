    "title": "SB 907",
    "content": "The Personal Income Tax Law provides for modified conformity to specified provisions of federal income tax law relating to the exclusion of the discharge of qualified principal residence indebtedness, as defined, from an individual\u2019s income if that debt is discharged after January 1, 2007, and before January 1, 2014, as provided. The federal Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended the operation of those provisions to debt that is discharged before January 1, 2015. The federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 extended the operation of those provisions to debt that is discharged before January 1, 2017, and provides that its discharge provisions apply to specified written agreements entered into before January 1, 2017. This bill would conform to that additional discharge provision relating to specified written agreements and the federal extensions, some of which would be applied retroactively. The bill would discharge indebtedness for related penalties and interest and would make legislative findings and declarations regarding the public purpose served by the bill. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."
