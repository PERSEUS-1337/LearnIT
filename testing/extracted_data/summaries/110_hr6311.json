Sets forth factors that must be considered at minimum, including the identity of the organism to the species level, the geographic source, and the likelihood of spread and harm to groups of species or habitats. Provides procedures for issuance and expansion of the approved-for-importation list. Establishes prohibitions on: (1) importation of nonnative species or viable eggs, (2) permit violation. And (3) knowing possession, purchase, sale, barter, release, or breeding . Allows the imposition of fees to recover the costs of assessing risks of nonnative wildlife species. Establishes a Nonnative Wildlife Invasion Prevention Fund into which such fees will be deposited."
