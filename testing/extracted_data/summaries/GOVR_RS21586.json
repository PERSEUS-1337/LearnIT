    "content": "Congress created the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in 1972, P.L. 92-484, and terminated its funding in 1995. The pros and cons of reviving OTA or re-creating a similar body have been examined. Since 2002, at congressional direction, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has conducted several pilot technology assessments. Legislation was proposed during the 108th Congress to restore OTA's funding; to create an entity to conduct assessments for Congress; to conduct technology assessments in GAO; and to create a technology assessment capability in GAO or under its direction. In 2006, the House Science Committee held hearings on the issue of providing science and technology advice to Congress. Policy issues under discussion include the need for assessments, funding, the utility of GAO's technology assessment work, and options for design of an advisory body. This report will be updated as needed."
