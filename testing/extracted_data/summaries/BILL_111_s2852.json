    "content": "Renewable Energy Environmental Research Act of 2009 - Requires the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere in the Under Secretary's capacity as Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to develop a plan to: (1) define requirements for a comprehensive and integrated ocean, coastal, Great Lakes, and atmosphere science program to support renewable energy development. (2) identify and describe current climate, weather, and water data programs, products, services, and authorities within NOAA relevant to such development. (3) provide targeted research, data, monitoring, observation, and other information, products, and services concerning climate, weather, and water in support of renewable energy and smart grid technology. (4) provide research, data, monitoring, and other information, products, and services to inform renewable energy decisions concerning coastal and marine habitats, living marine resources and the ecosystems on which they depend, and coastal and marine planning. (5) reduce duplication and leverage the resources of existing NOAA programs. And (6) facilitate public-private cooperation. Requires the Administrator to establish a program to develop and implement an integrated and comprehensive ocean, coastal, Great Lakes, and atmosphere research and operations program, based on such plan, to support renewable energy development. Enumerates program components. Requires the program to be designed to collect, synthesize, and distribute data in a manner that can be used by marine resource managers responsible for making decisions about marine renewable energy projects. Requires the Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Commerce, Minerals Management Service, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and Department of Energy (DOE) to consider this information when making planning, siting, and permitting decisions for marine renewable energy. Requires the Administrator to: (1) seek opportunities to facilitate and expand cooperation with private sector entities to develop and expand information services that serve the renewable energy industry. And (2) report to specified congressional committees every two years on activities carried out under this Act, recommendations for priority activities under this Act, and funding levels for activities. Requires the Administrator, within a year of this Act's enactment, to establish a renewable energy information library and data portal, which shall include: (1) links to data and information products for use in renewable energy development. (2) links to planning and decision support tools for use in renewable energy development. (3) data about the baseline condition of ocean and coastal resources. And (4) links to digital mapping and geospatial information, products, and services. Gives the Administrator the discretion to allow any offshore exploration and production facility to execute a memorandum of understanding authorizing the use of offshore platforms and infrastructure for the placement of meteorological and oceanographic observation sensors of a type to be designated by the Administrator in support of the Integrated Ocean Observing System. Requires information collected by such sensors to be readily available for use in spill response as well as available to the National Weather Service, other NOAA programs, and the general public. Authorizes appropriations for FY2010-FY2014."
