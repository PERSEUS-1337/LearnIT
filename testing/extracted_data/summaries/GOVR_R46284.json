    "content": "The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) administers several types of programs to support small businesses, including direct disaster loan programs for businesses, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters; loan guaranty and venture capital programs to enhance small business access to capital; small business management and technical assistance training programs to assist business formation and expansion; and contracting programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting. Congressional interest in these programs has always been high, primarily because small businesses are viewed as a means to stimulate economic activity and create jobs, but it has become especially acute in the wake of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic's widespread adverse economic impact on the national economy, including productivity losses, supply chain disruptions, major labor dislocation, and significant financial pressure on both businesses and households. This report provides a brief description of the SBA's programs, examines congressional action to assist small businesses during and immediately following the Great Recession (2007-2009), and discusses legislation to assist small businesses adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including P.L. 116-123 , the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020, which provided the SBA an additional $20 million for SBA disaster assistance administrative expenses and deemed the coronavirus to be a disaster under the SBA's Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program. This change made economic injury from the coronavirus an eligible EIDL expense. P.L. 116-136 , the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), which, among other provisions, created the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to provide \"covered loans\" with a 100% SBA loan guarantee, a maximum term of 10 years, and an interest rate not to exceed 4% to assist small businesses, small 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations, and small 501(c)(19) veterans organizations that have been adversely affected by COVID-19. The act also provides for loan deferment and forgiveness under specified conditions. A c overed loan is defined as a loan made to an eligible recipient from February 15, 2020, through June 30, 2020. The SBA announced that PPP loans will have a two-year term at an interest rate of 1.0%. P.L. 116-139 , the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (Enhancement Act), among other provisions, appropriates an additional $321.335 billion for the PPP. H.R. 6800 , the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act (HEROES Act), among other provisions, would expand PPP eligibility and provide small businesses additional flexibility by extending the PPP loan forgiveness covered period from eight weeks to the earlier of 24 weeks or December 31, 2020 . Some of the CARES Act's provisions (e.g., fee waivers, increased loan limits, and increased guarantee percentages) were used in legislation passed during the 111 th Congress to address the severe economic slowdown during and immediately following the Great Recession (2007-2009). The main difference between that legislation and the CARES Act is that the CARES Act includes loan deferrals, loan forgiveness, and greatly expanded eligibility, including, for the first time, specified types of nonprofit organizations. The SBA started accepting PPP loan applications on April 3, 2020. Because the SBA neared its $349 billion authorization limit for section 7(a) lending, which includes the PPP, the SBA stopped accepting new PPP loan applications on April 15. The SBA started accepting PPP loan applications once again on April 27, following the Enhancement Act's enactment on April 24, 2020. The act increased the SBA's section 7(a) loan authorization limit from $349 billion to $659 billion, and appropriated an additional $321.335 billion to support that level of lending. One lesson learned from the actions taken during the 111 th Congress to assist small businesses during and immediately following the Great Recession is the potential benefits that can be derived from providing additional funding for the SBA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO). GAO and the SBA's OIG can provide Congress information that could prove useful as Congress engages in congressional oversight of the SBA's administration of legislation to address COVID-19's adverse economic impact on small businesses, provide an early warning if unforeseen administrative problems should arise, and, through investigations and audits, serve as a deterrent to fraud. Requiring the SBA to report regularly on its implementation of the CARES Act could promote transparency and assist Congress in performing its oversight responsibilities. In addition, requiring both output and outcome performance measures and requiring the SBA to report this information to Congress and the public by posting that information on the SBA's website could enhance congressional oversight and public confidence in the SBA's efforts to assist small businesses."
