    "content": "Training a model to perform a task typically requires a large amount of data from the domains in which the task will be applied.\n However, it is often the case that data are abundant in some domains but scarce in others. Domain adaptation deals with the challenge of adapting a model trained from a data-rich source domain to perform well in a data-poor target domain. In general, this requires learning plausible mappings between domains. CycleGAN is a powerful framework that efficiently learns to map inputs from one domain to another using adversarial training and a cycle-consistency constraint. However, the conventional approach of enforcing cycle-consistency via reconstruction may be overly restrictive in cases where one or more domains have limited training data. In this paper, we propose an augmented cyclic adversarial learning model that enforces the cycle-consistency constraint via an external task specific model, which encourages the preservation of task-relevant content as opposed to exact reconstruction. We explore digit classification in a low-resource setting in supervised, semi and unsupervised situation, as well as high resource unsupervised. In low-resource supervised setting, the results show that our approach improves absolute performance by 14% and 4% when adapting SVHN to MNIST and vice versa, respectively, which outperforms unsupervised domain adaptation methods that require high-resource unlabeled target domain.   Moreover, using only few unsupervised target data, our approach can still outperforms many high-resource unsupervised models. Our model also outperforms on USPS to MNIST and synthetic digit to SVHN for high resource unsupervised adaptation. In speech domains, we similarly adopt a speech recognition model from each domain as the task specific model. Our approach improves absolute performance of speech recognition by 2% for female speakers in the TIMIT dataset, where the majority of training samples are from male voices. Domain adaptation BID18 BID36 BID1 aims to generalize a model from source domain to a target domain. Typically, the source domain has a large amount of training data, whereas the data are scarce in the target domain. This challenge is typically addressed by learning a mapping between domains, which allows data from the source domain to enrich the available data for training in the target domain. One way of learning such mappings is through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs BID8 with cycle-consistency constraint (CycleGAN Zhu et al., 2017) , which enforces that mapping of an example from the source to the target and then back to the source domain would result in the same example (and vice versa for a target example). Due to this constraint, CycleGAN learns to preserve the 'content' 1 from the source domain while only transferring the 'style' to match the distribution of the target domain. This is a powerful constraint, and various works BID37 BID12 have demonstrated its effectiveness in learning cross domain mappings.Enforcing cycle-consistency is appealing as a technique for preserving semantic information of the data with respect to a task, but implementing it through reconstruction may be too restrictive when data are imbalanced across domains. This is because the reconstruction error encourages exact match of samples from the reverse mapping, which may in turn encourage the forward-mapping to keep the sample close to the original domain. Normally, the adversarial objectives would counter this effect; however, when data from the target domain are scarce, it is very difficult to learn a powerful discriminator that can capture meaningful properties of the target distribution. Therefore, the resulting mappings learned is likely to be sub-optimal. Importantly, for the learned mapping to be meaningful, it is not necessary to have the exact reconstruction. As long as the 'semantic' information is preserved and the 'style' matches the corresponding distribution, it would be a valid mapping.To address this issue, we propose an augmented cyclic adversarial learning model (ACAL) for domain adaptation. In particular, we replace the reconstruction objective with a task specific model. The model learns to preserve the 'semantic' information from the data samples in a particular domain by minimizing the loss of the mapped samples for the task specific model. On the other hand, the task specific model also serves as an additional source of information for the corresponding domain and hence supplements the discriminator in that domain to facilitate better modeling of the distribution. The task specific model can also be viewed as an implicit way of disentangling the information essential to the task from the 'style' information that relates to the data distribution of different domain. We show that our approach improves the performance by 40% as compared to the baseline on digit domain adaptation. We improve the phoneme error rate by \u223c 5% on TIMIT dataset, when adapting the model trained on one speech from one gender to the other. In this paper, we propose to use augmented cycle-consistency adversarial learning for domain adaptation and introduce a task specific model to facilitate learning domain related mappings. We enforce cycle-consistency using a task specific loss instead of the conventional reconstruction objective. Additionally, we use the task specific model as an additional source of information for the discriminator in the corresponding domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach by evaluating on two domain adaptation tasks, and in both cases we achieve significant performance improvement as compared to the baseline.By extending the definition of task-specific model to unsupervised learning, such as reconstruction loss using autoencoder, or self-supervision, our proposed method would work on all settings of domain adaptation. Such unsupervised task can be speech modeling using wavenet BID35 , or language modeling using recurrent or transformer networks BID27 ."
