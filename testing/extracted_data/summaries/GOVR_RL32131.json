    "content": "Provisions in the FY2004 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act ( P.L. 108-137 ) and the FY2004 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act ( P.L. 108-108 ) restrict funding for restoration activities in the Florida Everglades if Florida does not achieve certain phosphorus mitigation and water quality standards in Everglades waters by 2006. The provisions also require several federal agencies to report whether Florida is meeting the deadline. If not, some provisions state that Congress may disapprove funding for some Everglades restoration projects, including some projects in the $7.8 billion Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). (For more information, see CRS Report RS20702, South Florida Ecosystem Restoration and the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed].) These provisions may represent a turning point in the 10-year federal-state partnership to restore the Everglades. Since 1993, the federal, state, tribal and local governments have generally worked together towards restoration. Congress has not previously conditioned federal Everglades funding on Florida taking specific actions towards restoration, both because of this partnership and because a federal Consent Decree and a state law (the Everglades Forever Act) set a deadline of 2006 for phosphorus mitigation. However, in spring 2003, the Florida legislature amended the Everglades Forever Act to extend the deadline until at least 2016. Phosphorus pollution has been a concern in the Everglades for many years. Excess phosphorus can cause imbalances in vegetation and habitat and alter native ecosystems. Much of this phosphorus is discharged in water from the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA), which is located north of the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge and the Everglades National Park. The EAA has been used intensively for farming, particularly sugar cane, since the 1950s. In 1988, the federal government sued the State of Florida and two of its agencies, alleging that water released onto federal lands from agricultural sources contained elevated levels of phosphorus and other nutrients in violation of state water quality standards. Based on a 1992 Consent Decree settling this lawsuit, Florida enacted the Everglades Forever Act in 1994. This act required the state to establish a numeric limit for phosphorus by December 2003 and required actions to comply with this limit by December 2006. The federal judge overseeing the Consent Decree later adopted the December 2006 deadline. In spring 2003, Florida amended the 1994 Act to create flexibility in meeting deadlines for phosphorus mitigation to 2016 or later, and in July 2003, Florida issued a rule establishing a limit for phosphorus of 10 parts per billion and methods to measure compliance with that limit. This report discusses the FY2004 appropriations provisions that condition federal funding for Everglades restoration on compliance with water quality standards, provides a side-by-side analysis of pending appropriations legislation, and provides background and a timeline of efforts to address Everglades phosphorus pollution. This report will be updated as events warrant."
