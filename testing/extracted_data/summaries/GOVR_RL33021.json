    "content": "High prices for crude oil in 2004 and into 2005 have reduced consumers' purchasing powerand raised costs for businesses while providing billions of dollars to the oil industry and oil exportingcountries. The industry's increased revenues have led to record profit levels. As the 109th Congressengages in oversight of recent broad energy legislation which aims to increase the domestic supplyof crude oil to mitigate oil price increases in the longer term, another key factor in determiningincreased supply is how oil companies decide to allocate their profits between shareholder returnsand investment in oil production. This report is written in response to a number of requests fromCongress concerning profits in the oil industry. This report provides background informationconcerning the level of oil industry profits, the sources of those profits, and a discussion of thepotential uses of profits. In response to the increased price of crude oil since the fall of 2004, profits of virtually allfirms in all segments of the oil industry have increased. However, the greatest increases have beenin the downstream, or refining and marketing, segments of the industry. These increases in profitare apparent whether the major integrated oil companies, the independents, or refiners areconsidered, lending some credence to the viewpoint that industry profits are the result of factorsbeyond the elevated price of crude oil. Historically, the current combination of high oil prices andhigh profits have been seen before, and periods of low prices and profits tended to follow. The relatively high profit levels earned in refining and marketing suggest that conditions inthe petroleum products markets, including the gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel segments, contributedto earned profits above and beyond the effect of higher crude oil prices. Key factors in these marketsincluded tight refining capacity and low inventory levels. Mergers, acquisitions, and asset sales mayalso have changed the relative profit positions of many firms in the industry. All of these factorshave been influenced by investment decisions in the oil industry. Firms in the oil industry are likely to use their recently earned profits in a variety of ways. They are holding record cash balances, buying back their shares and increasing dividends. Mergerand acquisition activity in the industry again appears to be on the rise. In addition, the major oilcompanies are investing in a variety of energy related projects, although not necessarily oil, includingliquified natural gas and gas-to-liquids technologies. These projects tend to be international inscope. In the longer term, investments in exploration, production, and refining capacity are likelyto be needed to mitigate the high prices of 2004-2005. This report will not be updated."
