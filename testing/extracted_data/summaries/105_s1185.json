Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a model alternative dispute resolution procedure to be adopted by any plan at its discretion for appeals of plan benefits claims denials to which certain ERISA provisions apply. And (2) maintain a roster of employee benefit experts who may be called upon to serve as neutral experts in such procedure. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) assess fees to cover the costs of experts called. And (2) reduce or waive such a fee on the basis of inability to pay."
