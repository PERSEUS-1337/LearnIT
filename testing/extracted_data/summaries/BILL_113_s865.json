    "content": "Accelerating the End of Breast Cancer Act of 2013 - Establishes the Commission to Accelerate the End of Breast Cancer to help end breast cancer by January 1, 2020. Directs the Commission to identify, recommend, and promote initiatives, partnerships, and research within the public and private sectors, basic and applied sciences, and epidemiology that can be turned into strategies to prevent breast cancer and breast cancer metastasis while giving priority to those that are: (1) not prioritized within the public sector, and (2) unlikely to be achieved by the private sector due to technical and financial uncertainty. Requires the Commission to: (1) submit within six months to the President and to the relevant congressional committees a description of the Commission's strategic plan. (2) submit an annual report to the President, Congress, and the public. And (3) ensure that its activities are coordinated with, and do not duplicate the efforts of, programs and laboratories of other government agencies. Directs the President to enter into an agreement with the Institute of Medicine to evaluate the Commission's progress. Terminates the Commission on June 1, 2020."
