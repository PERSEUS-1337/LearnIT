    "content": "The Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bills include funding for more than two dozen independent agencies in addition to the larger entities in the bill (Department of the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President, the District of Columbia, and the judiciary). Among these are Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Election Assistance Commission (EAC), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Federal Election Commission (FEC), Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), General Services Administration (GSA), National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Selective Service System, Small Business Administration (SBA), and United States Postal Service (USPS). The House and Senate FSGG bills fund the same agencies, with one exception. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is funded through the Agriculture appropriations bill in the House and the FSGG bill in the Senate. On February 9, 2016, President Obama submitted his FY2017 budget request. The request included a total of approximately $3.19 billion for the independent agencies funded through the FSGG appropriations bill, including $330 million for the CFTC. On June 15, 2016, the House Committee on Appropriations reported the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2017 (H.R. 5485, H.Rept. 114-624). The bill was amended on the House floor and passed on July 7, 2016. Total FY2017 funding for the FSGG independent agencies in the passed bill would have been approximately $1.65 billion, with another $250 million for the CFTC included in the Agriculture appropriations bill (H.R. 5054, H.Rept. 114-531). The combined total of approximately $1.9 billion would have been about $1.3 billion below President Obama's FY2017 request. On June 16, 2016, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2017 (S. 3067, S.Rept. 114-280). S. 3067 would have appropriated approximately $2.08 billion for the FSGG independent agencies, about $1.11 billion below President Obama's request. No full-year FY2017 FSGG appropriations were enacted prior to the end of FY2016. On September 29, 2016, President Obama signed P.L. 114-223. Division C of this act provided for continuing appropriations through December 9, 2016, generally termed a continuing resolution (CR). The CR provided funding for most FSGG agencies at the FY2016 funding rate subject to an across-the-board decrease of 0.496%. This was followed by a second CR, P.L. 114-254, which provided funding through April 28, 2017, and a third, P.L. 115-30, which provided funding through May 5, 2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31/H.R. 244) was enacted on May 5, 2017, following House passage on May 3 and Senate passage on May 4. FSGG appropriations, including the CFTC, were provided in Division E. FY2017 FSGG appropriations for the independent agencies totaled $1.53 billion, approximately $1.66 billion below President Obama's request. Although financial services are a major focus of the FSGG appropriations bills, these bills do not include funding for many financial regulatory agencies, which are funded outside of the appropriations process. The FSGG bills do, however, often contain additional legislative provisions relating to such agencies."
