    "title": "AB 1465",
    "content": "Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue driver\u2019s licenses to applicants who meet specified criteria and provide the department with the required information. Existing law generally requires an applicant for an original driver\u2019s license or identification card to submit satisfactory proof to the department that the applicant\u2019s presence in the United States is authorized under federal law. This bill would also require, beginning July 1, 2016, an applicant for an original driver\u2019s license or identification card to submit satisfactory proof of California residency, and would prohibit the department from issuing an original driver\u2019s license or identification card to a person who does not submit satisfactory proof of California residency. The bill would require the department to adopt regulations relating to the procedures for verifying that the applicant is a California resident."
