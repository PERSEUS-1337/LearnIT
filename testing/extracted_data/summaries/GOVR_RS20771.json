    "content": "The congressionally mandated Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) directs DoD toundertake a wide-ranging review of strategy, programs,and resources. Specifically, the QDR is expected to delineate a national defense strategy consistent with the mostrecent National Security Strategy by defining force structure,modernization plans, and a budget plan allowing the military to successfully execute the full range of missionswithin that strategy. The report will include an evaluation by theSecretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the military's ability to successfully execute itsmissions at a low-to-moderate level of risk within the forecast budgetplan. The results of the 2001 QDR could well shape U.S. strategy and force structure in coming years. This reportwill be updated as future events warrant."
