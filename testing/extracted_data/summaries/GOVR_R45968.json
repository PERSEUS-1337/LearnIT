    "content": "Between 2001 and 2007, more than 575,000 members of the reserve components were ordered to active duty in support of ongoing military operations, including major combat operations in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom), Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom). While on active duty, reservists and their family members have access to a wide range of health care services administered by the Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Health System (MHS). However, prior to 2005, chapter 55 of Title 10, U.S. Code, authorized little to no DOD health care services to nonactivated reservists or their family members. In 2005, Congress began examining initial impacts of frequent mobilizations on reservists, their families, and their employers. Soon after, Congress enacted a series of new or expanded health care, transitional, and other personnel benefits to mitigate certain effects associated with reserve mobilizations. Two health care programs tailored for reservists were established: TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS)\u00e2\u0080\u0094a premium-based health plan option available to qualified members of the Selected Reserve and their family members; and TRICARE Retired Reserve (TRR)\u00e2\u0080\u0094a premium-based health plan option available to so-called gray area reservists\u00e2\u0080\u0094those who have retired but are too young to draw retired pay\u00e2\u0080\u0094and their family members. Section 701 of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization (NDAA) Act of Fiscal Year 2005 ( P.L. 108-375 ) established TRS. Initially, TRS eligibility was limited to certain reservists who had served on continuous active duty in support of a contingency operation and signed a military service obligation agreement. Section 706 of the John Warner NDAA for FY2007 ( P.L. 109-364 ) revised TRS by removing certain restrictions and expanding eligibility. The law also added a prohibition on members of the Selected Reserve and their family members from being eligible for TRS if they are also eligible for the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) program. Section 705 of the NDAA for FY2010 ( P.L. 111-84 ) established TRR, which also prohibits retired reservists and their families from participating, if they are also eligible for the FEHB program. Both reserve plans mirror the benefits and cost sharing requirements established for TRICARE Select, a health plan option available to family members of active duty servicemembers and certain military retirees. Congress has not explicitly addressed why the prohibition on TRS or TRR for FEHB-eligible reservists and their family members was established. Nevertheless, observers have noted several considerations in removing the statutory prohibition, including: potential impacts to the FEHB health insurance risk-pools; potential cost implications to federal mandatory and discretionary spending; and continuity of care for reservists transitioning between active and reserve status. While Congress has considered various proposals to remove the statutory prohibitions on TRS or TRR eligibility, none have been enacted."
