(2) that states that the recipient is likely to receive anything of value if statistically the recipient is not likely to receive anything of value. Or (3) resembling a negotiable instrument. Prescribes civil penalties for any person who, through the use of the mail, sends any matter which is nonmailable under Federal postal law. Deposits such penalties into the Postal Service Fund . Expresses the sense of the Congress that civil penalties collected through the enforcement of this Act should be allocated by the Postal Service to increase consumer awareness of misleading solicitations received through the mail, including releasing an annual listing of the top ten offenders of this Act. States that nothing in this Act shall preempt any State law that regulates advertising or sales of goods and services associated with any game of chance."
