    "title": "An act to amend Section 55.53 of the Civil Code, and to amend Sections 4459.5 and 4467 of the Government Code, relating to public contracts, and making an appropriation therefor.",
    "content": "The Construction-Related Accessibility Standards Compliance Act establishes standards for making new construction and existing facilities accessible to persons with disabilities, including inspections by private persons or building inspectors who are certified access specialists (CASps), and provides for construction-related accessibility claims for violations of those standards. That act requires a local agency, commencing January 1, 2014, to employ or retain a sufficient number of building inspectors who are CASps to conduct permitting and plan check services to review for compliance with state construction-related accessibility standards by a place of public accommodation with respect to new construction. The act requires, if a local agency employs or retains 2 or more CASps, that at least half one-half of the CASps be building inspectors who are CASps. This bill would require, commencing January 1, 2021, that all building inspectors employed or retained by a local agency who conduct permitting and plan check services to review for compliance with state construction-related accessibility standards by a place of public accommodation with respect to new construction or renovations, including, but not limited to, projects relating to tenant improvements that may impact access, be CASps. The bill would also require all new employees employed or retained by a local agency on or after January 1, 2018, and who will conduct permitting and plan check services to review for compliance with state construction-related accessibility standards by a place of public accommodation, to be CASps within 24 36 months of their initial date of employment. By adding to the duties of a local entity, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing law requires the State Architect to establish a program for voluntary certification by the state of any person who meets specified criteria as a CASp with respect to access to buildings for persons with disabilities and to determine minimum criteria for certification. This bill would require the State Architect, on or before January 1, 2018, to commence testing and certification of building inspectors as CASps, as specified. Until December 31, 2018, existing law requires any applicant for a local business license or equivalent instrument or permit, or renewal of a local business license or equivalent instrument or permit, to pay an additional state fee of $1 for that license, instrument, or permit. Under existing law, the city, county, or city and county that collected the fee retains 70 of the fee, and the remaining 30 of the fee is deposited into the Disability Access and Education Revolving Fund, a continuously appropriated fund. This bill, from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2019, would increase that state fee to $4 and would require any applicant for a building permit in a city, county, or city and county that does not issue business licenses or an equivalent instrument or permit to pay an additional fee of $4 for that building permit. Beginning January 1, 2020, those fees would be reduced to $1. The bill, from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2019, would increase the percentage of the fee retained by a local agency to 90 and the remaining 10 would be deposited into the Disability Access and Education Revolving Fund. Beginning January 1, 2020, those percentages would revert to 70 and 30, respectively. By increasing revenue to a continuously appropriated fund, increasing the fee, extending the period of time during which the fee will be collected, and imposing an additional fee, this bill would make an appropriation. The bill would make an appropriation by authorizing local government entities to retain an increased percentage of the increased fee. The bill would require that the moneys retained by a local agency be placed in a special fund established by the local agency, to be known as the \u201cCASp Certification and Training Fund.\u201d The bill would require that fees collected in a CASp Certification and Training Fund be used for increased certified access specialist training and certification in the local jurisdiction, thereby making an appropriation by expanding the purposes for which the retained fee moneys are required to be spent. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
