    "content": "In the decade between 1994 and 2004, the number of U.S. adults using the Internet increased from 15% to 63%, and by 2005, stood at 78.6%. From electronic mail to accessing information to watching videos to online purchasing, the Internet touches almost every aspect of modern life. The extent to which use of the Internet continues to grow, however, may be affected by a number of technology policy issues being debated in Congress. First is the availability of high-speed\u2014or \"broadband\"\u2014Internet access. Broadband Internet access gives users the ability to send and receive data at speeds far greater than \"dial-up\" Internet access over traditional telephone lines. With deployment of broadband technologies accelerating, Congress is seeking to ensure fair competition and timely broadband deployment to all sectors and geographical locations of American society. Next are a range of issues that reflect challenges faced by those who do use the Internet, such as security, privacy (including spyware and identity theft), unsolicited commercial electronic mail (\"spam\"), protecting children from unsuitable material (such as pornography), and computer security, including the vulnerability of the nation's critical infrastructures to cyber attacks. Other issues include the Internet's domain name system (DNS), which is administered by a nonprofit corporation called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). With the Department of Commerce currently exercising legal authority over ICANN, Congress continues to monitor the administration of the DNS, particularly with respect to issues such as privacy, governance, and protecting children on the Internet. The evolving role of the Internet in the political economy of the United States also continues to attract congressional attention. Among the issues are what changes may be needed at the Federal Communications Commission in the Internet age, federal support for information technology research and development, provision of online services by the government (\"e-government\"), and availability and use of \"open source\" software by the government. A number of laws already have been passed on many of these issues. Congress is monitoring the effectiveness of these laws, and assessing what other legislation may be needed. Other CRS reports referenced in this document track legislation, and the reader should consult those reports, which are updated more frequently than this one, for current information. This report will not be updated."
