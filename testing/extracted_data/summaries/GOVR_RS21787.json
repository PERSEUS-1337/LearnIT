    "content": "The Energy Information Administration (EIA), in the Annual Energy Outlook 2004(AEO), projects increased demand for imported naturalgas through 2025. The AEO reference case forecast assumes a natural gas pipeline will begin delivering Alaskannatural gas to the lower 48 state consuming markets in 2018. H.R. 6, the omnibus energy bill, contains provisions to enhance the future supply of natural gas throughconstruction of a pipeline. This report examines the effects of an Alaska natural gas pipeline on the U.S. current account balance. TheEIA finds that if the pipeline is not constructed, natural gas prices willincrease, markets will adjust, and imports of natural gas will increase. However, due to price induced marketadjustments, the increase in imports is projected to be less than the gasvolume lost from the lack of pipeline construction. As a result, if no pipeline is constructed, the effect on the currentaccount balance will be less than the value of the amount of gas thatwas projected to be delivered through a pipeline. This report will not be updated."
