    "content": "Pakistan, a key U.S. ally in global efforts to combat Islamist militancy, is facing a serious capital crisis. In the autumn of 2008, Pakistan was in urgent need of an estimated $4 billion in capital to avoid defaulting on its sovereign debt. The elected government of President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani sought short-term financial assistance from a number of sources, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), China, and an informal group of nations (including the United States) known as the \"Friends of Pakistan.\" The Pakistani government reached an agreement with the IMF for $7.6 billion in loans, but their capital crisis continues. In February 2009, Pakistan requested an additional $4.5 billion in assistance from the IMF and Prime Minister Gillani traveled to Beijing seeking financial support. According to a recent study by the Atlantic Council, Pakistan needs $4 billion - $5 billion in the next 6 to 12 months to avoid another possible default. Pakistan's continuing capital crisis is affecting the nation's overall economic performance and raising concerns about its political stability. During her Asia trip in February 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made several references to the importance of solving Pakistan's economic problems in the continued campaign to combat Islamic militants in the region. The Atlantic Council has called for an increase in U.S. assistance \"to avert an economic meltdown.\" The severity of Pakistan's economic situation has also been raised by several members of Congress. Several different research groups have recently issued reports on the situation in Pakistan that contain recommendations on what the United States could do to help alleviate Pakistan's economic problems. There are indications that Congress may consider some of these recommended actions, including an increase in U.S. non-military assistance and the creation of \"reconstruction opportunity zones\" in Pakistan. This report will be updated as circumstances warrant."
