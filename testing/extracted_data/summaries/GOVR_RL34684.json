    "content": "Public alarm about the spate of recent product recalls throughout 2007, particularly of toys and other products used by children, has focused attention on the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the CPSC or the Commission). This scrutiny led to consideration of major amendments to the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA), which established and authorized the CPSC in 1972 in response to growing concerns about protecting the public from unsafe, defective consumer products. Jurisdiction over the administration and enforcement of several existing consumer safety statutes was transferred from other agencies to and consolidated under the CPSC. However, in the years since its establishment, the staff and resources of the CPSC have been considerably reduced, leading many observers to doubt its ability to fulfill its mission effectively. Consequently, Congress considered major reform legislation to address organizational and systemic deficiencies. Legislative proposals in the 110th Congress included provisions targeting specific consumer product defects and hazards. On July 29, 2008, H.Rept. 110-787, the Conference Report for H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA), was released after several months of negotiations in the conference committee to reconcile differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. The bill passed the House of Representatives and the Senate on July 30, 2008 (424-1) and July 31, 2008 (89-3), respectively. On August 14, 2008, President Bush signed the bill into law as P.L. 110-314. CPSC Chairman Nord and Commissioner Moore each expressed approval of the final legislation, with Chairman Nord expressing a desire for Congress to appropriate further funding to carry out the new mandates of the legislation. This report provides an overview of the prior authority of the CPSC to establish consumer product safety standards and to inspect and recall unsafe consumer products, and discusses P.L. 110-314, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, reforming the CPSC and strengthening enforcement of consumer product safety standards. It supersedes CRS Report RL34399, Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008: H.R. 4040, by [author name scrubbed] (out of print but available from author).
