    "content": "The Future Combat System (FCS) was a multiyear, multibillion dollar program at the heart of the Army's transformation efforts. It was to be the Army's major research, development, and acquisition program, consisting of 14 manned and unmanned systems tied together by an extensive communications and information network. FCS was intended to replace current systems such as the M-1 Abrams tank and the M-2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle. The FCS program has been characterized by the Army and others as a high-risk venture because of the advanced technologies involved and the challenge of networking all of the FCS subsystems together so that FCS-equipped units could function as intended. On April 6, 2009, Secretary of Defense Gates announced that he intended to significantly restructure the FCS program. The Department of Defense (DOD) would then plan to accelerate the spin out of selected FCS technologies to all brigade combat teams (BCTs). Gates also recommended cancelling the manned ground vehicle (MGV) component of the program, which was intended to field eight separate tracked combat vehicle variants built on a common chassis that would eventually replace combat vehicles such as the M-1 Abrams tank, the M-2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, and the M-109 Paladin self-propelled artillery system. In October 2009, the Army announced a new BCT modernization strategy to implement Gates's restructuring announcement. Some of the key tenets of this strategy are as follows: Deliver capability packages consisting of key FCS technologies and warfighter urgent requirements in two year increments. The Army plans to expand the fielding of these capability packages to all BCTs by 2025. Get some FCS spin-outs\u2014capabilities from the FCS program aimed at the current force\u2014to the field in the FY2011-FY2012 capabilities package. Upgrade select core Army systems. Fully integrate Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected (MRAP) Vehicles into formations. Develop a Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) concept focused on building a versatile platform incorporating combat lessons learned, and field the system by 2017. The Army states that a \"new Ground Combat Vehicle, synchronized with upgrades, reset and divestiture of current vehicles is the most effective and affordable way to improve capability in the mid-term, mitigate risk associated with identified operational shortfalls and provide our Army the agility to adapt and versatility to meet the challenges of an ever-changing operational environment.\" The Army's restructured FCS program and the new plan for modernizing BCTs pose several oversight issues for Congress. Congressional decisions regarding these new plans may significantly affect Army capabilities and funding requirements, and the ground combat portion of the defense industrial base. ."
