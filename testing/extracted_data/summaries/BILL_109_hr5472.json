    "content": "National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program Reauthorization Act of 2006 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to change from 2000 to 2020 the target year for achieving the objectives established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services for reductions in the rate of mortality from breast and cervical cancer in the United States for the committee coordinating Public Health Service activities. Directs the Secretary to establish a demonstration project which allows the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to waive requirements for awarding breast and cervical cancer grants that require 60 of grant funds to be spent on screening and referrals for medical treatments and no more than 40 to be spent on other activities for not more than five states, if: (1) the state involved will use the waiver to leverage private funds to supplement screening and referral services or the application of such requirements would result in a barrier to the enrollment of women. (2) the state involved provides assurance that the state will annually demonstrate how it will use the waiver to maintain or expand the level of screening and follow-up services provided. (3) the state involved submits to the Secretary a plan for maintaining the level of activities carried out under the waiver after the expiration of the waiver. (4) the Secretary finds that granting such a waiver to a state will not reduce the number of women in the state who receive such services, including screening for both breast and cervical cancers. And (5) the Secretary finds that granting such a waiver to a state will not adversely affect the quality of such services. Requires the Secretary to grant such waivers for a period of two years. Allows the Secretary to extend a waiver, upon request of a state, for additional two-year periods if the Secretary reviews performance under the waiver and finds that the waiver requirements are and have been met. Requires the Secretary to include as part of the evaluations of the activities carried out pursuant to breast and cervical cancer grants: (1) the total amount of dollars leveraged annually from private entities in states receiving a waiver and how these amounts were used. (2) for states receiving a waiver, the percentages of the grant expended on screening and referral services and on other services or activities, (3) the number of states receiving waivers annually. (4) the number of women receiving screening and referral services in programs before and after the granting of a waiver. (5) the average annual level of state fiscal expenditures for such services for the year preceding the grant of the waiver. And (6) the amount of non-federal contributions by the state according to source and the proportion of non-federal funds to federal funds. Prohibits the use of amounts to which a waiver applies to increase the number of salaried employees. Authorizes appropriations for breast and cervical cancer grants from FY2007-FY2011."
