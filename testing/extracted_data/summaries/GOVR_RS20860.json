    "content": "On February 27, 2001, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, achallenge to EPA's promulgation in 1997 of revised national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulatesunder the Clean Air Act. On the broaderissues, the Court ruled that (1) the Act's provisions governing the setting of primary (health-protective) ambientstandards did not transgress the \"nondelegationdoctrine,\" a moribund constitutional principle that the court below had resurrected, and (2) the Act bars EPA fromconsidering implementation costs when it setsprimary national ambient standards. On a narrow issue, the Court held that EPA had not been justified, inpromulgating its ozone implementation plan, inapplying only the Act's nonattainment-area subpart of general application, rather than a subpart specific to ozonenonattainment. As a result, the Court chargedthe agency with developing a \"reasonable interpretation\" accommodating both subparts. Such accommodation islikely to prove a difficult task, however, andalmost certainly once adopted will generate further legal challenges."
