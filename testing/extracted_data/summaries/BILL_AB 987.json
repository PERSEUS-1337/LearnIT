Existing law requires an employer or other entity covered by the act to provide reasonable accommodation of, among other things, a person\u2019s disability and religious beliefs and prohibits discrimination against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under the act or because the person has filed a complaint.

The bill would make related findings and declarations."
