    "content": "The House and the Senate have, from time to time in the past, proposed and\u2014on some occasions\u2014adopted a resolution which has expressed the body's disapproval, condemnation, censure, or lack of confidence regarding a particular official in the executive branch of the federal government. Such actions have not been considered as part of the express impeachment authority of the House within the Constitution (nor the authority to try such impeachments in the Senate), nor have they generally been considered as either part of the inherent contempt authority of either house of Congress or the express constitutional authority of each house of Congress to discipline its own Members. Rather, such actions seem to be in the nature of a \"sense of the House\" or a \"sense of the Senate\" resolution, whereby a simple resolution is proposed and adopted by one house of Congress, without the concurrence of the other house of Congress, and without a requirement for a \"presentment\" to the President (as would be required of a \"bill\"). Such simple resolutions adopted by one house (or concurrent resolutions adopted by both houses) have come to be recognized by parliamentarians as a vehicle to express the opinion and sense of Congress on a nonlegislative matter; and \"sense of\" the House, Senate, or Congress resolutions concerning a wide range of subjects have been used frequently in the past by the House and Senate. The adoption of a simple or concurrent resolution expressing the House's or Senate's \"censure,\" \"condemnation,\" or \"no confidence\" in a particular officer of the federal government does not have any immediate or binding legal import, but does express a particular moral judgment and may have both symbolic as well as political implications. This report has been updated from an earlier version, and may be updated in the future to reflect new rulings, practices, or precedents."
