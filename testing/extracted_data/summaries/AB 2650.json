    "title": "An act to amend Section 16642 of, and to add Section 7513.76 to, the Government Code, relating to public employee retirement systems.",
    "content": "The California Constitution grants the retirement board of a public employee retirement system plenary authority and fiduciary responsibility for investment of moneys and administration of the retirement fund and system. The California Constitution qualifies this grant of powers by reserving to the Legislature the authority to prohibit investments if it is in the public interest and the prohibition satisfies standards of fiduciary care and loyalty required of a retirement board. Existing law prohibits the boards of administration of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System and State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System from making investments in certain countries and in thermal coal companies, as specified, subject to the boards\u2019 plenary authority and fiduciary responsibility for investment of moneys and administration of the systems. This bill would prohibit the boards of administration of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System and State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System from making additional or new investments, or renewing existing investments, of public employee retirement funds in an investment vehicle in Turkey that is issued by the government of Turkey or that is owned, controlled, or managed by the government of Turkey. The bill would require the boards to liquidate existing investments in Turkey in these types of investment vehicles on or before July 1, 2018, within 6 months of the passage of a federal law imposing sanctions on Turkey, subject to engagement with the government of Turkey regarding whether it is transitioning to publicly accepting its responsibility for the Armenian Genocide. The bill would require these boards, on or before January 1, 2019, within one year of the passage of a federal law imposing sanctions on Turkey, to make a specified report to the Legislature and the Governor regarding these actions. The bill would provide that its provisions do not require a board to take any action that the board determines in good faith is inconsistent with its constitutional fiduciary responsibilities to the retirement system. The bill would indemnify from the General Fund and hold harmless the present, former, and future board members, officers, and employees of, and investment managers under contract with, in connection with actions relating to these investments."
