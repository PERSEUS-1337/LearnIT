    "title": "SB 1454",
    "content": "Existing law, the Pharmacy Law, provides for the licensure and regulation of pharmacists and pharmacies by the California State Board of Pharmacy. Existing law imposes requirements on audits of pharmacy services provided to beneficiaries of a health benefit plan, as specified. This bill would prohibit a pharmacy benefit manager, as defined, from requiring that a pharmacist or pharmacy provide reimbursement to the pharmacy benefit manager for the cost of any drug dispensed to a patient that was properly adjudicated, as defined, except upon a showing of fraud or malfeasance. The bill would require any improper reimbursement made under those provisions during a specified 5-year period to be refunded to the pharmacist or pharmacy, as specified. The Pharmacy Law establishes in the Department of Consumer Affairs the California State Board of Pharmacy, which consists of 13 members. This bill would make a nonsubstantive change to these provisions."
