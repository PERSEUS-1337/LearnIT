    "content": "Reports indicate possible attempts to curtail the use of filibusters in the Senate, perhaps inthe 109th Congress. Some have suggested that proponents of this idea may invoke something calledthe \"nuclear\" or \"constitutional\" option in Senate floor procedure to try to end a filibuster withoutthe need for 60 votes or to amend the cloture rule (Rule XXII) itself. No set definition exists for theterm \"nuclear\" or \"constitutional\" in this context. Because the point of using such an option is toachieve a goal by means lying outside the Senate's normal rules of procedure, it would be impossibleto list all the different permutations such maneuvers could encompass. Several likely scenarios thatfall into this category are described in this report, followed by a discussion of the possible advantagesand disadvantages of using such an approach. Opponents (and some supporters) of this kind of plan typically refer to it as the \"nuclear\"option because of the potentially significant result for Senate operations that could follow from itsuse. The Senate relies heavily on unanimous consent to get its legislative work accomplished. Itmay be more difficult to achieve unanimous consent in an environment where the minority feels ithas lost some of its traditional rights. Supporters of the concept of majority cloture argue that it isa \"constitutional\" option because they will be making their argument based on a constitutionalprerogative or duty of the Senate. One method for changing Senate procedures might involve declaring extended debate onnominations dilatory, and thus, out of order. Another possibility is based on the argument that, onthe first day of a new Congress, Senate rules, including Rule XXII, the cloture rule, do not yet apply,and thus can be changed by majority vote. Under this argument, debate could be stopped by majorityvote. A Senator would move the adoption of a new rule or set of rules. The new rule or rules wouldbe subject to a majority vote, supporters argue, because the mechanics of cloture as set out in RuleXXII, which requires a supermajority to invoke cloture and end debate, would not yet apply and theSenate would be operating under general parliamentary law. One variation would be a claim thaton the opening day of a Congress a simple majority could invoke cloture on the motion to take upa resolution that proposed a rules change, or on the resolution itself. Again, this scenario would reston the proposition that Rule XXII was not yet in force and did not control action. Senators alsocould seek to have the 60-vote threshold declared unconstitutional, either for cloture in general, oronly as it applies to Senate consideration of presidential nominations, or perhaps a subset of suchnominations, such as of federal judges. This scenario might take place in at least two different ways. The presiding officer might make a ruling from the chair, or a Senator could make a point of orderfrom the floor that the supermajority requirement for cloture is unconstitutional. All these possible scenarios would require that one or more of the Senate's precedents beoverturned or interpreted otherwise than in the past. This report will be updated as events warrant."
