    "content": "We  propose an  interactive  classification approach  for natural  language  queries. Instead of classifying given the natural language query only, we ask the user for additional information using a sequence of binary and multiple-choice questions. At each turn, we use a policy controller to decide if to present a question or pro-vide the user the final answer, and select the best question to ask by maximizing the system information gain. Our formulation enables bootstrapping the system without any interaction data, instead relying on non-interactive crowdsourcing an-notation tasks. Our evaluation shows the interaction helps the system increase its accuracy and handle ambiguous queries, while our approach effectively balances the number of questions and the final accuracy. Responding to natural language queries through simple, single-step classification has been studied extensively in many applications, including user intent prediction Qu et al., 2019) , and information retrieval (Kang & Kim, 2003; Rose & Levinson, 2004) . Typical methods rely on a single user input to produce an output, missing an opportunity to interact with the user to reduce ambiguity and improve the final prediction. For example, users may under-specify a request due to incomplete understanding of the domain; or the system may fail to correctly interpret the nuances of the input query. In both cases, a low quality input could be mitigated by further interaction with the user. In this paper we propose a simple but effective interaction paradigm that consists of a sequence of binary and multiple choice questions allowing the system to ask the user for more information. Figure 1 illustrates the types of interaction supported by this method, showcasing the opportunity for clarification while avoiding much of the complexity involved in unrestricted natural language interactions. Following a natural language query from the user, our system then decides between posing another question to obtain more information or finalizing the current prediction. Unlike previous work which assumes access to full interaction data Hu et al., 2018; Rao & Daum\u00e9 III, 2018) , we are interested in bootstrapping an interaction system using simple and relatively little annotation effort. This is particularly important in real-world applications, such as in virtual assistants, where the supported classification labels are subject to change and thereby require a lot of re-annotation. We propose an effective approach designed for interaction efficiency and simple system bootstrapping. Our approach adopts a Bayesian decomposition of the posterior distributions over classification labels and user's responses through the interaction process. Due to the decomposition, we can efficiently compute and select the next question that provides the maximal expected information based on the posteriors. To further balance the potential increase in accuracy with the cost of asking additional questions, we train a policy controller to decide whether to ask additional questions or return a final prediction. Our method also enables separately collecting natural language annotations to model the distributions of class labels and user responses. Specifically, we crowdsource initial natural language queries and question-answer pairs for each class label, alleviating the need for Wizard-of-Oz style dialog annotations (Kelley, 1984; Wen et al., 2016) . Furthermore, we leverage the natural language descriptions of class labels, questions and answers to help estimate their correlation and reduce the need for heavy annotation. Got it! The article below might be helpful: We propose an approach for interactive classification, where users can provide under-specified natural language queries and the system can inquire missing information through a sequence of simple binary or multi-choice questions. Our method uses information theory to select the best question at every turn, and a lightweight policy to efficiently control the interaction. We show how we can bootstrap the system without any interaction data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two tasks with different characteristics. Our results show that our approach outperforms multiple baselines by a large margin. In addition, we provide a new annotated dataset for future work on bootstrapping interactive classification systems."
