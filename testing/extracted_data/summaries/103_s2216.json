    "title": "A bill to state the sense of Congress on the production, possession, transfer, and use of anti-personnel landmines, to place a moratorium on United States production of anti-personnel landmines, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should actively seek: (1) an international agreement prohibiting the production, possession, transfer, and use of antipersonnel landmines. And (2) in the interim, international agreements to further limit the production, possession, transfer, and use of such landmines. Expresses the sense of the Congress that a US moratorium on the purchase and production of such landmines would encourage other nations to adopt similar measures. Establishes such moratorium for a one-year period beginning 90 days after enactment of this Act. Calls for the President to urge other nations to adopt such a moratorium. Allows the moratorium to be extended. Earmarks funds authorized under the current Department of Defense Authorization Act for improving landmine detection and neutralization. Directs the Administrator of the Agency for International Development and the Secretary of State to jointly submit to the Congress a report containing an analysis of the social, economic, and environmental costs and effects of the use of antipersonnel landmines. Directs the Secretary of Defense to report to the Congress on the total number of US military personnel killed or wounded by such landmines during World War II, the Korean conflict, the Vietnam era, and the Persian Gulf War."
