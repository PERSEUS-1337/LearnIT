    "content": "Medical Bills Interest Rate Relief Act - Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) no American family or individual should be forced to choose between the health and life of a loved one and the financial constraints of medical care. (2) financial institutions, including credit card issuers, should not take financial advantage of unforeseen, nonpreventive, or catastrophic medical situations. And (3) individuals or families saddled with large medical bills should receive a fair and equitable credit rating that disregards off-schedule medical bill payments. Amends the Truth in Lending Act to prescribe guidelines governing the obligations of credit card issuers for credit extended to pay medical expenses. Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to prohibit a hospital or other medical treatment facility from submitting to a consumer reporting agency during a five-year period any negative information regarding the failure of a consumer to maintain full payments for medical expenses if the consumer continues in good faith to make partial payments on the outstanding balance on prescribed payment schedule due dates."
