    "content": "Radiation Detection for Dirty Bomb Material in Containers and Bulk Cargo Act of 2003 - Instructs the Secretary of Energy to implement a program to: (1) maintain and expand ongoing seaport and land radiation detection system projects. (2) use existing laboratory relationships and expertise in large-scale radiation monitoring systems. (3) evaluate radiation detection systems for use at seaports and places of entry by land in the United States. And (4) select at least one system for demonstration at a seaport and at a place of land entry. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct an evaluation of existing state-of-the-art systems that provide the highest degree of detection capability for radioactive sources hidden in sea freight containers or cargo crossing land borders. (2) emphasize the rapid development of existing technology and systems on completion of the evaluation. (3) develop standard procedures and protocols for detection and reporting of data collected from radiation collection systems. And (4) develop a national technical assistance program to share and propagate the experiences gained in conducting the program. Requires the Secretary to solicit the views of stakeholders, including the National Maritime Security Advisory Committee, local port authorities, the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors, Inc. and the Health Physics Society. And (2) provide student internships to universities in States with significant seaports that focus on academic programs pertaining to radiation detection and radiation health physics."
