(2) the US commitment to global leadership of transparency in extractive industries by supporting multilateral pro-transparency efforts, bilateral good governance efforts through US missions and activities abroad, implementation of extractive industries reporting requirements for companies under US jurisdiction, and efforts to persuade members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) to adopt uniform legislation to ensure a coordinated regulatory approach. And (3) the need for the President to commit the United States to become a Candidate Country of the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative.

Requires such rules, to the extent practicable, to support the US commitment to international transparency promotion efforts relating to such commercial development. Requires the SEC, to the extent practicable, to make publicly available online a compilation of the information required to be submitted under the disclosure rules issued pursuant to this Act."
