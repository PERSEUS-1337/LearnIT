    "content": "National Stalker Reduction Act of 1993 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to: (1) authorize the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to make grants to States which include programs that increase awareness, reporting, and prevention of stalking. And (2) provide for a reduction of formula grants for noncompliance by States with specified requirements. Directs each State which receives drug control and system improvement formula grants under the Act in a fiscal year to allocate not less than five percent of such funds for the development of records regarding stalking and other forms of domestic violence, including: (1) the development or expansion of maintaining records regarding the dispositions of all complaints and arrests for stalking and other forms of domestic violence, (2) the full automation of such records. And (3) the frequency and quality of reports sent to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Authorizes the Director to waive compliance with such allocation requirement by a State, or to authorize a State to reduce the minimum amount such State is required to allocate, if the Director finds that the quality of the States' records regarding stalking and domestic violence complaints and arrests does not warrant expending the amount allocated. Requires the Bureau of Justice Statistics to: (1) define terms that relate to stalking and make such definitions available to individuals and groups that request such information. And (2) compile a national database regarding stalking and other forms of domestic violence. Requires the Director to submit annual reports to the Congress, evaluating the effectiveness of State anti-stalking efforts and legislation."
