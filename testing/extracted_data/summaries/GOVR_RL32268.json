    "content": "The term \"open source\" refers to a computer program that is distributed along with a license, or contract, that requires users of the program to comply with specified conditions. Among thesestipulations are that the source code be distributed along with the software, and that others beallowed to modify the source code as they desire. In contrast, the source code of \"closed source\"software is proprietary, not publicly distributed and subject to alteration only by the softwaremanufacturer. Some concerns have arisen concerning the relationship between open source software and intellectual property rights, including copyrights, patents and trade secrets. Although a particularcomputer program may be designated as open source, it remains possible that an owner ofintellectual property may enforce its rights against open source software developers and users. Somecommentators have also expressed concern that open source licenses may overreach, convertingproprietary programs into open source software even if only a portion of that program was derivedfrom an open source original. Others have suggested that open source licenses may not be legallyenforceable, which would allow users to obtain and assert intellectual property rights pertaining tosoftware that was initially distributed as open source. Striking a balance between promoting innovation, on one hand, and accommodating the demands of software developers and users, on the other, forms an important component ofcontemporary software policy. The possibility of intellectual property rights, and their attendantlicense fees and royalties, may provide a significant incentive for firms to innovate and to distributesoftware. However, some proponents of open source software believe that these incentives areunnecessary, and further hope to maintain a non-proprietary environment of software distributionand development. Should Congress have an interest in this area, several options present themselves. No action need be taken if the current relationship between open source software and intellectual property isdeemed satisfactory, particularly as software publishers become increasingly aware of intellectualproperty and as judicial precedents may make the legal situation clearer. Congress might also assistindividuals in identifying intellectual property that pertains to software that has been identified asopen source; speak to the enforceability of open source licenses; and, as a possible more far-reachinglegal reform, allow proprietary software publishers a grace period for removing portions of programcode that derived from an open source original."
