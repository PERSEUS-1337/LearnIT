To qualify as an established provider, a provider must demonstrate that, within a specified timeframe: (1) at least 90 of Medicare claims submitted by the provider were determined to be eligible for full or partial payment, and (2) the provider appealed at least 90 of all Medicare claimsnbsp. That were not initially determined to be eligible for payment. HHS may withhold payment for a Medicare claim made by an established providernbsp, only if anbsp. Final determination has been made that the claim is ineligible for payment. If such a final determination is made, the provider shall repay such payment electronically and within a specified timeframe."
