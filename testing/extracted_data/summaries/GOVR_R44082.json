    "content": "Congress has directed that the federal government is responsible for managing wildfires that begin on federal lands, such as national forests or national parks. The states are responsible for managing wildfires that originate on all other lands. Although a greater number of wildfires occur annually on nonfederal lands, wildfires on federal lands tend to be much larger, particularly in the western United States. The federal government's wildfire management responsibilities\u2014fulfilled primarily by the Forest Service (FS) and the Department of the Interior (DOI)\u2014include prevention, detection, response, and recovery. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also may provide disaster relief for certain nonfederal wildfires. Congress provides appropriations for wildfire management to both FS and DOI. Within these appropriations, suppression operations are largely funded through two accounts for each agency: Wildland Fire Management (WFM) accounts and Federal Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement Act (FLAME) reserve accounts. If the suppression funding in both of these accounts is exhausted during any given fiscal year, FS and DOI are authorized to transfer funds from their other accounts to pay for suppression activities. Congress also may provide additional funds for suppression activities through emergency or supplemental appropriations. Thus, for any given year, total suppression appropriations to FS or DOI may be a combination of several sources: the WFM account, the FLAME account, additional funding as needed through transfers, and/or supplemental appropriations. Overall appropriations to FS and DOI for wildland fire management have quadrupled since the 1990s, going from $1.2 billion in FY1994 to $4.9 billion in FY2016 in constant dollars. A significant portion of that increase is related to rising suppression costs, even during years of relatively mild wildfire activity, although the costs vary annually and are difficult to predict in advance. Since FY2001, FS and DOI have required more suppression funds than have been appropriated to them in all but three years. This discrepancy often leads the agencies to transfer funds from other accounts, prompting concerns that increasing suppression spending may be detrimental to other agency programs. In response, Congress has enacted supplemental appropriations to repay the transferred funds or to replenish the agency's wildfire accounts 12 times, including $700 million provided as emergency spending in FY2016 to repay suppression costs from FY2015. Furthermore, wildfire spending\u2014like all discretionary spending\u2014is currently subject to procedural and budgetary controls. In the past, Congress has effectively waived some of these controls for certain wildfire spending, but it has not done so in more recent years. This situation has prompted some to explore providing wildfire spending outside of those constraints. The 115th Congress may consider legislation to address these issues. The 114th Congress considered\u2014but did not enact\u2014several wildfire spending bills that may be of interest. All of these bills, directly or indirectly, would have allowed for some wildfire suppression funds\u2014subject to certain criteria\u2014to be provided outside the statutory limits on discretionary spending, either through the annual appropriations process or through supplemental appropriations. Under those proposals, varying levels of wildfire funding would not have needed to compete with other programs and activities that are subject to the statutory limits. However, the amounts that could have been provided for wildfire suppression operations under these proposals\u2014both within and outside of the spending limits\u2014would have been subject to future appropriations decisions by Congress. These proposals also could have affected certain funding mechanisms that have been used to provide additional spending for major disaster recovery (e.g., hurricanes, earthquakes)."
