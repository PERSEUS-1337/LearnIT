    "content": "Emergency Financial Manager Reform Act of 2016 This bill requires a state with a state-appointed emergency financial manager to certify that the appointment: (1) does not have the purpose or effect of limiting the right to vote on account of race or color, and (2) followed a notice and comment period. If a state with a state-appointed emergency financial manager fails to submit such certification, then the Department of Justice may reduce by 5 that state's allocation of funds under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program."
