    "title": "An act to amend Section 13480 of the Water Code, relating to the State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund.",
    "content": "Existing law continuously appropriates state and federal funds in the State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund to the State Water Resources Control Board for loans and other financial assistance for the construction of publicly owned treatment works and other related purposes, to a municipality, intermunicipal agency, interstate agency, or state agency in accordance with the federal Clean Water Act and the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act. Existing law requires that moneys in the fund be used only for permissible purposes allowed by the Clean Water Act or a federal capitalization grant deposited in the fund to the extent authorized and funded by the grant. Existing law requires the loans to meet certain criteria, including requiring full amortization not later than 20 years after project completion, except as specified. This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to the requirement that moneys in the fund be used only for permissible purposes allowed by the Clean Water Act or a federal capitalization grant deposited in the fund. This bill would, subject to the same exception, require full amortization not later than 30 years after project completion."
