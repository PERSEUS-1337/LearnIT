    "content": "The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), is leveraging the use of telehealth with the goal of expanding veterans' access to VA care. Telehealth generally refers to the use of information and communication technology to deliver a health care service. It is a mode of health care delivery that extends beyond the \"brick-and-mortar\" health care facilities of the VHA. VA telehealth services are generally provided on an outpatient basis and supplement in-person care. Such services do not replace VA in-person care. The VA copay requirements for telehealth are the same as for VA in-person care, but in some cases may be lower than the copays for VA in-person outpatient health care services delivered through the VHA. President Trump and Congress have recently enacted measures such as the VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks of 2018 (VA MISSION Act; P.L. 115-182 ) that aim to address the access barriers that veterans may experience when accessing VA telehealth services across states lines. The VA MISSION Act, among other things, removes all geographic and licensing barriers to VA telehealth, thereby allowing veterans to access VA telehealth services in their communities from any location in the United States, U.S. territories, District of Columbia, and Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. VA Telehealth Modalities In FY2018, more than 9.3 million veterans were enrolled in VA care. In that same fiscal year, the VA provided 2.29 million telehealth episodes of care to 782,000 veteran patients collectively using the following three VA telehealth modalities: (1) home telehealth, (2) store-and-forward telehealth, and (3) clinical video telehealth. The VA has developed VA mobile applications (apps), which refer to software programs that run on certain operating systems of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) and computers that transmit data over the internet that veterans can access as telehealth applications. Veterans can access VA mobile apps on cellular and mobile devices that operate using either a web-based platform, an iOS platform, or an Android operating platform. VA Telehealth Partnerships and Access According to the VA, it cannot meet the health care demands of veteran patients in-house and therefore, it has established partnerships with private sector vendors to help address veterans' demand for VA care. For example, the VA's partnership with the wireless service provider T-Mobile would allow a veteran who has T-Mobile as a cellular wireless service provider to access the VA Video Connect app without incurring additional charges or reducing plan data allotments. VA Teleconsultations VA providers can use telehealth platforms and applications to consult with one another, which is referred to as a teleconsultation by section 1709A(b) of title 38 of the U.S. Code . The VA has adopted and modified the Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (Project ECHO) learning model, which the Expanding Capacity for Health Outcomes Act ( P.L. 114-270 ) required the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to examine and report on, to create a Specialty Care Access Network-Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (SCAN-ECHO) learning model. The VA's SCAN-ECHO is a similar approach that aims to connect underproductive providers to assist access-challenged providers, using the hub-and- spoke model , which refers to a structure whereby a central point (referred to as the \"hub\") disseminates information to different connecting points (referred to as the \"spokes\"). Topics Covered in This Report This report provides background information on VA telehealth, including veteran eligibility and enrollment criteria, VA telehealth copayment requirements, and VA providers' authority to provide telehealth services anywhere. The report also discusses the components of VA telehealth. It also discusses three issues that Congress could choose to consider: (1) access barriers to in-person VA care, (2) lack of access to the internet, and (3) conflicting guidelines for prescribing controlled substances via telehealth across state lines."
