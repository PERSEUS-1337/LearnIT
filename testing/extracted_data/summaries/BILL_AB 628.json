    "title": "AB 628",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes the Department of Toxic Substances Control to regulate the disposal of hazardous waste, including used oil, and, for those purposes, defines \u201cused oil\u201d to mean oil that has been refined from crude oil, or any synthetic oil, that has been used, and, as a result of use or as a consequence of extended storage, or spillage, has been contaminated with physical or chemical impurities. This bill would clarify that the synthetic oil referred to in the definition of \u201cused oil\u201d may be from any source."
