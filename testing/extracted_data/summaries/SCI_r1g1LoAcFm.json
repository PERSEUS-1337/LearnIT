One challenge with massively multi-label problems is that there is often a long-tailed frequency distribution for the labels, resulting in few positive examples for the rare labels. We propose a solution to this problem by modifying the output layer of a neural network to create a Bayesian network of sigmoids which takes advantage of ontology relationships between the labels to help share information between the rare and the more common labels.   We apply this method to the two massively multi-label tasks of disease prediction (ICD-9 codes) and protein function prediction (Gene Ontology terms) and obtain significant improvements in per-label AUROC and average precision. In this paper, we study general techniques for improving predictive performance in massively multilabel classification/prediction problems in which there is an ontology providing relationships between the labels. Such problems have practical applications in biology, precision health, and computer vision where there is a need for very precise categorization. For example, in health care we have an increasing number of treatments that are only useful for small subsets of the patient population. This forces us to create large and precise labeling schemes when we want to find patients for these personalized treatments.One large issue with massively multi-label prediction is that there is often a long-tailed frequency distribution for the labels with a large fraction of the labels having very few positive examples in the training data. The corresponding low amount of training data for rare labels makes it difficult to train individual classifiers. Current multi-task learning approaches enable us to somewhat circumvent this bottleneck through sharing information between the rare and cofmmon labels in a manner that enables us to train classifiers even for the data poor rare labels BID6 .In this paper, we introduce a new method for massively multi-label prediction, a Bayesian network of sigmoids, that helps achieve better performance on rare classes by using ontological information to better share information between the rare and common labels. This method is based on similar ideas found in Bayesian networks and hierarchical softmax BID18 . The main distinction between this paper and prior work is that we focus on improving multi-label prediction performance with more complicated directed acyclic graph (DAG) structures between the labels while previous hierarchical softmax work focuses on improving runtime performance on multi-class problems (where labels are mutually exclusive) with simpler tree structures between the labels.In order to demonstrate the empirical predictive performance of our method, we test it on two very different massively multi-label tasks. The first is a disease prediction task where we predict ICD-9 (diagnoses) codes from medical record data using the ICD-9 hierarchy to tie the labels together. The second task is a protein function prediction task where we predict Gene Ontology terms BID0 BID5 from sequence information using the Gene Ontology DAG to combine the labels. Our experiments indicate that our new method obtains better average predictive performance on rare labels while maintaining similar performance on common labels. This paper introduces a new method for improving the performance of rare labels in massively multi-label problems with ontologically structured labels. Our new method uses the ontological relationships to construct a Bayesian network of sigmoid outputs which enables us to express the probability of rare labels as a product of conditional probabilities of more common higher-level labels. This enables us to share information between the labels and achieve empirically better performance in both AUROC and average precision for rare labels than flat sigmoid baselines in three separate experiments covering the two very different domains of protein function prediction and disease prediction. This improvement in performance for rare labels enables us to make more precise predictions for smaller label categories and should be applicable to a variety of tasks that contain an ontology that defines relationships between labels."
