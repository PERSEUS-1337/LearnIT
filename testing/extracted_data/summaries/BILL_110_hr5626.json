    "content": "Protect Our Troops and Our Constitution Act of 2008 - Prohibits funds from being used to: (1) establish or maintain any permanent or long-term US military base or facility in Iraq. Or (2) implement any agreement that is consistent with US security commitments to Iraq under the Declaration of Principles or any agreement that provides authority to fight for US Armed Forces engaged in combat operations other than for self-defense purposes, unless the agreement is an Article II treaty with respect to which the Senate has given its advice and consent to ratification or the agreement is approved by an Act of Congress enacted after the date of the enactment of this Act. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) long-term US-Iraq relations should be determined by the US Administration taking office on January 20, 2009. (2) in determining its policy toward Iraq such Administration should consult with Congress, the government of Iraq, Coalition partners, and Iraq's neighbors. And (3) to maintain international legal authority as well as immunity from Iraqi prosecution for US Armed Forces and other Coalition forces operating in Iraq while such Administration determines policy toward Iraq the current US Administration should encourage the government of Iraq to request renewal of the U. N. mandate for Iraq beyond December 31, 2008."
