    "content": "Rail Merger Reform and Customer Protection Act - Amends Federal transportation law to condition the Surface Transportation Board's approval of any rail carrier consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control upon a finding that the transaction: (1) will not reduce competitive rail routes available to current railroad customers. (2) will provide additional rail to rail competition and competitive options for railroad customers, (3) will improve service to customers. And (4) is in conformity with the antitrust laws. Declares that rail carriers and rail transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board shall also be subject to the antitrust laws. Repeals the exemption of rate agreements from the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and specified parts of the Wilson Tariff Act . Repeals the mandate that the Federal Trade Commission report to the Board periodically on possible anticompetitive features of approved rate agreements, or agreements submitted for approval, and any organization operating under such agreements. Prohibits a person proceeding against a rail carrier in a complaint before the Board from proceeding against the same rail carrier pursuant to other Federal or State law, and vice versa. Amends the Clayton Act to conform with this Act."
