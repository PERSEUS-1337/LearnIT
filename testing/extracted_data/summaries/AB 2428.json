    "title": "An act to amend Section 104.16 of the Streets and Highways Code, relating to state highways.",
    "content": "Existing law provides that the Department of Transportation has full possession and control of the state highway system, including associated property. Existing law authorizes the department to lease certain property, including the area above or below a state highway, and certain property held for future highway purposes, to public agencies under specified terms and conditions, including specific provisions governing leases of airspace and other property in the City and County of San Francisco for purposes of an emergency shelter or feeding program, at a lease cost of $1 per month and payment of an administrative fee not to exceed $500 per year. This bill would revise the provisions governing leases of department property in the City and County of San Francisco to also authorize leases of property for park, recreational, or open-space purposes, subject to certain additional terms and conditions. These park, recreational, and open-space leases would be subject to a requirement for the department to lease property located within a priority development area, as defined, to the city and county on a right of first refusal basis and, for up to 10 parcels, at a specified below market value lease amount, and a requirement for the lessee to be responsible for all associated nonhighway maintenance costs. The bill would provide for the lease to authorize the lessee to subsidize its maintenance costs through a limited revenue generation model, with any revenues generated above the maintenance costs to be shared with the state, as specified."
