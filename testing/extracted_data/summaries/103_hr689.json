    "content": "National Labor Relations Fair Elections Act - Amends the National Labor Relations Act to direct the National Labor Relations Board to provide for fair and expeditious employee representation elections. Directs the Board to investigate expeditiously certain situations involving designation or election of individuals or labor organizations as employee representatives. Sets forth deadlines for the Board to conduct such investigations, as well as elections, tallies, and certifications of employee representatives. Allows employees or labor organizations to petition for such Board actions by alleging certain conditions, such as: (1) 75 percent of the employees in a collective bargaining unit having signed authorization cards designating their representative. Or (2) a majority of the employees in such a unit having designated their representative, which the employer declines to recognize. Requires, in any case where the Board directs such an election to be held, that the election and tally be carried out within specified deadlines, and any objections to election results be resolved expeditiously."
