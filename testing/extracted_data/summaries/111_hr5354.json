    "content": "Gestational Diabetes Act of 2010 or the GEDI Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to develop a multisite gestational diabetes research project within the diabetes program of the CDC to expand and enhance surveillance data and public health research on gestational diabetes. Requires such research project to address: (1) procedures to establish accurate and efficient systems for the collection of gestational diabetes data. (2) the progress of collaborative activities with the National Vital Statistics System, the National Center for Health Statistics, and state health departments to improve surveillance of gestational diabetes. (3) postpartum methods of tracking women with gestational diabetes after delivery and targeted interventions to lower the incidence of type 2 diabetes in such women. (4) variations in the distribution of diagnosed and undiagnosed gestational diabetes. And (5) factors and culturally sensitive interventions that influence risks and reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes and related complications during childbirth. Requires the Secretary, not later than two years after the enactment of this Act, to report on the findings and recommendations of the research project. Requires the Secretary to expand and intensify public health research on gestational diabetes, including. (1) developing and testing novel approaches for improving postpartum testing or screening and for preventing type 2 diabetes in women with a history of gestational diabetes. And (2) conducting research to further understanding of the factors and health systems that influence the risk of gestational diabetes and the development of type 2 diabetes in women with a history of gestational diabetes. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the CDC, to: (1) award grants on a competitive basis for demonstration projects that implement evidence-based interventions to reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes, the recurrence of such disease in subsequent pregnancies, and the development of type 2 diabetes in women with a history of gestational diabetes. And (2) report to Congress, not later than four years after the enactment of this Act, on the results of the demonstration projects. Sets forth priorities for awarding grants and requirements for the use of grant funds for carrying out demonstration projects. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the CDC, to work with state and Indian tribal-based diabetes prevention and control programs assisted by the CDC to encourage postpartum follow-up after gestational diabetes to reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes and its recurrence, the development of type 2 diabetes in at-risk women, and related complications. Authorizes appropriations for FY2012-FY2016."
