    "content": "On August 20,1998, the United States launched retaliatory and preemptive missile strikes against training bases andinfrastructure in Afghanistan used by groups affiliated with radical extremist and terrorist financier Usama binLaden. A \"pharmaceutical\" plant in Sudan, makinga critical nerve gas component, was destroyed as well. This is the first time the U.S. has unreservedly acknowledgeda preemptive military strike against a terroristorganization or network. This has led to speculation that faced with a growing number of major attacks on U.S.persons and property and mounting casualties,U.S. policymakers may be setting a new direction in counter-terrorism-- a more proactive and global policy, lessconstrained when targeting terrorists, their bases, or infrastructure. Questions raised include: What is the nature and extent of any actual policy shift; what are its prosand cons; and what other policy optionsexist? Issues of special concern to Congress include: (1) U.S. domestic and overseas preparedness for terroristattacks and retaliatory strikes; (2) the need forconsultation with Congress over policy shifts which might result in an undeclared type of war; and (3) sustainingpublic and Congressional support for a long termpolicy which may prove costly in: (a) dollars; (b) initial up-front loss of human lives, and (c) potential restrictionson civil liberties. Whether to change thepresidential ban on assassinations and whether to place Afghanistan on the \"terrorism\" list warrants attention as well.This short report is intended for Membersand staffers who cover terrorism, as well as U.S. foreign and defense policy. It will be updated as events warrant.For more information, see CRS Issue Brief IB95112, Terrorism, the Future and U..S.
