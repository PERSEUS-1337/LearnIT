    "content": "The European Union (EU) has been considering lifting its arms embargo on China, whichwas imposed in response to the June 1989 Tiananmen Crackdown. France, Germany, and other EUmembers claim that the embargo hinders the development of a \"strategic partnership\" with China. The Bush Administration and Members of Congress strongly oppose an end to the EU's armsembargo and urge stronger arms export controls. The United States contends that engagement withChina need not send the wrong signals on China's human rights record and military buildup thatthreatens a peaceful resolution of Taiwan and other Asian issues. The EU argues that the arms embargo -- which is not legally binding -- is weak and largelysymbolic. Indeed, some EU members reportedly have allowed defense-related exports to Chinaunder the arms embargo. While such sales have raised questions about the effectiveness of the EU'sarms embargo on China, they also point to the potential for future sales of military equipment ortechnology to China, particularly without the political restraint of the embargo. EU governments,led by the United Kingdom, stress that if and when the embargo is overturned, its end would beaccompanied by a stronger EU arms export control regime -- including an enhanced EU Code ofConduct on Arms Exports -- that will improve accountability and better control arms sales to Chinaand elsewhere. U.S. critics, however, remain skeptical that even a tighter EU Code will containsufficient enforcement and transparency mechanisms to dissuade EU countries from exportingadvanced defense technologies that could enhance China's military buildup and ultimately threatencommon U.S., European, and Asian interests in peace and stability. All 25 EU member states must agree before the embargo can be overturned. Although manyobservers had expected that the EU would lift the embargo in the spring of 2005, some membersgrew hesitant amid vocal and high-level U.S. opposition, especially since early 2005. Those arguingagainst lifting the embargo have cited persistent human rights problems in China, including a refusalto reexamine the Tiananmen Crackdown, and China's adoption in March 2005 of its \"Anti-SecessionLaw\" warning of a possible use of force against Taiwan. At present, ending the arms embargo onChina does not appear to be high on the EU's agenda. Still, the EU is politically committed tooverturning the embargo, and many observers believe that its end is ultimately only a matter of time. In the meantime, U.S. diplomacy could be effective, and the disagreement presents a chance forcloser coordination of U.S.-European policies, including those dealing with arms export controls anda rising China. Overall, there are two sets of questions for Congress in examining U.S. policy toward the fateof the EU's arms embargo on China. What are the implications for U.S. interests in trans-Atlanticrelations and China? If U.S. interests are adversely affected, what are some options for Congressto discourage the EU from lifting its arms embargo on China and, if it is lifted, to protect U.S.national security interests in both Asia and Europe? Issues raised by these questions are the subjectof this CRS Report. This report will be updated as warranted."
