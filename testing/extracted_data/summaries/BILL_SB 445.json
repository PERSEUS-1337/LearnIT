    "title": "SB 445",
    "content": "The federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act sets forth specified requirements relating to the education of homeless children and youth, as defined. Under existing state law, a local educational agency liaison for homeless children and youth is required to ensure that public notice of the educational rights of homeless children and youths is disseminated in schools within the liaison\u2019s local educational agency, as specified. This bill would require a local educational agency serving a homeless child, once a child becomes a homeless child, to allow the homeless child to continue his or her education in the school of origin through the duration of the homelessness, and would set forth related requirements governing the enrollment of homeless children. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing law requires a pupil placed in a licensed children\u2019s institution or foster family home to attend programs operated by the local educational agency, unless one of certain circumstances applies. Existing law requires each local educational agency to designate a staff person as the educational liaison for foster children, as defined. Existing law requires the educational liaison for foster children to ensure and facilitate the proper educational placement, enrollment in school, and checkout from school of foster children, and to assist foster children when transferring from one school to another school or from one school district to another school district in ensuring the proper transfer of credits, records, and grades. Existing law defines a local educational agency for purposes of these provisions, the provisions above relating to homeless children and youth, and other related provisions to include a school district, a county office of education, a charter school participating as a member of a special education local plan area, or a special education local plan area. This bill would revise the definition of a local educational agency for purposes of those provisions to include all charter schools. To the extent this would impose additional duties on charter schools, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
