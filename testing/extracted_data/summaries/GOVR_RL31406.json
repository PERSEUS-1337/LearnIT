With the $1.3 billion FY2002 supplementalrequest for Pell grants in the President's February budget, the Administration's request was $28.4billion. Although there was broad congressional support for the new supplemental, Congress debated the total spending level, the amount for homeland security, and inclusion of budget ceilings forFY2003, as well as other issues from the time that the bill was submitted in the spring to its finalpassage in late July. Resolving differences between the two houses and between Congress and the Administration proved to be difficult. The initial draft conference version developed by the appropriators wasrejected by the White House. A compromise package designed by Senate appropriators was thenrejected by the House. House appropriators then put together a final $28.9 billion spending packagethat was acceptable to both houses and the Administration. That package, the conference version of H.R. 4775 ( H.Rept. 107-593 ), passed the House by 397 to 32 on July 23, and the Senate by 92 to 7 on July 24, 2002. The President signed the bill on August2, 2002 ( P.L. 107-206 ). As cleared by both houses, the bill includes $14.5 billion for DOD, $6.7billion for homeland security, $5.5 billion for assistance to New York, $2.1 billion for foreignassistance and embassy security, $1 billion for Pell grants, and $400 million for electionadministration reform. As enacted, P.L. 107-206 includes $25 billion in emergency spending and $5.1 billion in contingent emergency spending. The President had thirty days after enactment (September 1) todecide whether to submit a budget amendment to Congress that designates either all or none of that$5.1 billion of contingent spending as emergency funding. The $5.1 billion portion includes about$1 billion in additional DOD funding, $275 million for veterans' medical care, $250 million in aidto Israel and the Palestinians, $200 million in HIV/AIDS funding, and $450 million for electionreform. The funding designated as contingent emergency spending was either not requested by thePresident or reflects higher levels than included in the Administration's request. On August 13, the President announced that he would not utilize the $5.1 billion contingent emergency spending. White House officials said, however, that the Administration would seek about$1 billion of that amount as an amended FY2003 appropriation request, including funds for Israel,the Palestinians, international HIV/AIDS, and the Transportation Security Agency. Based on thisaction, the total funding dedicated to combating terrorism since September 11 is $63.9 billion,including $40 billion that was appropriated immediately after the terrorist attacks and $24 billion inthe FY2002 supplemental."
