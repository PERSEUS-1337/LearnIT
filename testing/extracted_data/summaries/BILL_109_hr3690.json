(2) their attendance was interrupted because of the disaster's impact on them or the institution. And (3) their withdrawal ended within the academic year during which the major disaster designation occurred or during the next succeeding academic year. Provides such students with deferments for certain student loan obligations for up to six months. Directs the Secretary to recalculate the expected family contribution for such students."
