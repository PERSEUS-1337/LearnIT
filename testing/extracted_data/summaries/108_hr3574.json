And (2) the four most highly compensated executive officers that were serving as executive officers of an issuer at the end of the most recent fiscal year . Defines the fair value of an option to purchase such stock. Exempts small business issuers from the Act's requirement. Amends the Securities Act of 1933 to prohibit the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from recognizing as generally accepted any accounting principle relating to the expensing of stock options unless it complies with both: (1) specified expense recomputation requirements. And (2) a required joint study by the Secretaries of Commerce and of Labor of the economic impact of the mandatory expensing of employee stock options. Requires the recomputation and re-reporting of the expense of a stock purchase option that is exercised, to equal the difference between the price of the underlying stock and the exercise price. Requires the re-reporting as a reduction of the total expense originally required to be reported if the option expires or is forfeited. Directs the SEC to require each issuer to include in its periodic report more detailed information regarding stock option plans, stock purchase plans, and other arrangements involving an employee acquisition of an equity interest in the company, including: (1) a discussion, written in accordance with the Plain English Handbook published by the SEC Office of Investor Education and Assistance on the dilutive effect of stock option plans. (2) expanded disclosure of the dilutive effect of employee stock options on the issuer's earnings per share. (3) prominent placement and increased comparability and uniformity of all stock option related information, (4) the number of outstanding stock options.
