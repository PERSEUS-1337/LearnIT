    "content": "Peru, a coca-producing country in the Andean region of South America, has had a turbulent political history. Despite its tumultuous past, Peru has recently taken steps to consolidate its democracy and pursue market-friendly economic policies. For the past seven years, Peru, a leading mineral exporter, has posted some of the fastest economic growth rates in Latin America. GDP growth reached 8% in 2007. In June 2006, former president Alan Garc\u00c3\u00ada (1985-1990) was elected president in a close race. After taking office, Garc\u00c3\u00ada embraced the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA), which the two countries signed on April 12, 2006 and the Peruvian legislature ratified in June 2006. PTPA implementing legislation ( H.R. 3688 ) passed the House on November 8, 2007, by a vote of 285 to 132; the Senate on December 4 by a vote of 77 to 18; and was signed by President Bush on December 14, ( P.L. 110-138 ). In addition to trade matters, congressional interest in Peru focuses on human rights issues and counternarcotics cooperation.
