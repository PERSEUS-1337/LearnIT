    "title": "SB 930",
    "content": "Existing law prohibits recreational use involving bodily contact with the water in Bear Lake Reservoir unless certain conditions are satisfied, including that the water subsequently receives complete water treatment. Existing law requires the Lake Alpine Water Company, on or before January 1, 2016, to file with the Legislature a report on the recreational uses at Bear Lake Reservoir and the water treatment program for that reservoir. Existing law provides that, upon a finding of noncompliance, the Lake Alpine Water Company could be subject to suspension, amendment, or revocation of any permit issued pursuant to specified provisions, and that failure to comply with these provisions would be deemed a violation subject to specified fines, penalties, or other enforcement actions. Existing law repeals these provisions on January 1, 2017. This bill would extend the operation of all these provisions until January 1, 2022, and would require the Lake Alpine Water Company to file the report on or before December 31, 2017, and biennially thereafter until January 1, 2022. By expanding the scope of a crime, the bill would create a state-mandated local program. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Bear Lake Reservoir. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
