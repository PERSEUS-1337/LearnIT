    "content": "National Health Services Corps and Loan Repayment Programs Renewal Act of 2007 - Reauthorizes appropriations for the National Health Service Corps for FY2008-FY2012. Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in approving applications for assignment of members of the Corps, to give the highest preference to entities that are federally-qualified health centers, that are rural health clinics, and that primarily serve health disparity populations or medically underserved populations. Repeals the requirement that federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics demonstate that they meet health professional shortage area requirements every six years after such a center or clinic is designated as having such a shortage."
