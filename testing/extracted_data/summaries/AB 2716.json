    "title": "An act to amend Sections 18980, 18981, 19010, 19011, 24744, 25053, 25055, and 25056 of, and to repeal and amend Section 24745 of, the Food and Agricultural Code, relating to meat.",
    "content": "The California Meat and Poultry Supplemental Inspection Act requires, until January 1, 2017, each person to be licensed before operating a meat processing establishment or a custom livestock slaughterhouse and sets annual license renewal fees for custom livestock slaughterhouses and meat processing establishments. The act, until January 1, 2017, also establishes application fees for initial and renewal of licenses for livestock meat inspectors and processing inspectors. The act imposes a penalty on applicants for renewal who fail to pay the renewal fee by the expiration date of the meat processing establishment, custom livestock slaughterhouse, livestock meat inspector, or processing inspector license and provides cause for revocation of the license if the applicant fails to pay the renewal fee, plus the penalty, within 90 days of the license\u2019s expiration. Existing law provides for the regulation, inspection, and licensing of poultry plants and for the regulation and licensing of poultry meat inspectors. Existing law, until January 1, 2017, specifies the license application fees for a new, previously unlicensed poultry plant and for a license application submitted upon change of ownership of an existing, previously licensed poultry plant. Existing law, until January 1, 2017, requires that an application for renewal of a license of a poultry plant, accompanied by a specified renewal fee, be made on or before the expiration of the license. Existing law, until January 1, 2017, specifies the application fee for a poultry meat inspector license application and the renewal fee of that license. Existing law, until January 1, 2017, imposes a penalty of $25 on applicants for renewal who fail to pay the renewal fee by the expiration date of the license, and provides for revocation of the license if the applicant fails to pay the renewal fee, plus the penalty, within 90 days of the license\u2019s expiration. This bill would extend these licensing and inspector provisions to January 1, 2022, and would delete an obsolete provision."
