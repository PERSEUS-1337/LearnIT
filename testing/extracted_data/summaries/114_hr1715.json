    "content": "Executive Amnesty Prevention Act This bill prohibits the use of funds to implement specified memoranda from the President, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), or other related memoranda. No deposit in the Immigration Examinations Fee Account may be used to implement, administer, or enforce the policies in such memoranda. Such memoranda or substantially similar policy changes are declared to have no statutory or constitutional basis and therefore no legal effect. No funds or fees made available to the Secretary or to any federal official may be used to grant any federal benefit to any alien pursuant to any of such policy changes. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to: (1) exclude from the definition of unauthorized alien, with respect to employment, any alien otherwise admitted to and lawfully present in the United States. And (2) consider any alien without lawful status to be an unauthorized alien whose employment is unlawful."
