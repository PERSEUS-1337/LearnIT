    "content": "Chemical Security Act of 1999 - Bars the public disclosure of off-site consequence analysis submissions under the Clean Air Act for a period of one year after this Act's enactment. Defines an off-site consequence analysis submission as a portion of a risk management plan submitted to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency by stationary sources of certain hazardous substances. Permits disclosure of such information for official use only. Prescribes penalties for violation of such prohibition. Directs the Administrator, after June 21, 1999, to make information from risk management plans, including information from off-site consequence analysis submissions, publicly available in a form which excludes information concerning the identity or location of covered stationary sources. Requires owners or operators of such sources to convene a meeting with community representatives, employees and contractors working at such sources, and local emergency planning committees and other emergency responders to discuss measures necessary to prevent, and protect such sources from, attacks by terrorists and other criminals. Provides for certifications to the Federal Bureau of Investigation by such owners or operators that such meetings have been held. Directs the Attorney General to review and report to Congress on the vulnerability of covered stationary sources to criminal and terrorist activity, current industry practices regarding site security, security of transportation of extremely hazardous substances, and this Act's effectiveness. Provides for biennial updates of such report and for recommendations for reducing such vulnerability through inherently safer practices and site security and the need for additional legislation. Requires the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the health and environmental effects of public disclosure of information. Requires, as part of such report, an examination of the reductions in toxic chemical releases associated with reporting requirements of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986. Authorizes appropriations."
