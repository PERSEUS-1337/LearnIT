This report describes the key provisions of the enacted law, summarizes the legislative action on H.R. 6, and provides a summary of the provisions under each of the titles in the law. The highlights of key provisions enacted into law are as follows: Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE). The law sets a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks by model year 2020. Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS). The law sets a modified standard that starts at 9.0 billion gallons in 2008 and rises to 36 billion gallons by 2022. Energy Efficiency Equipment Standards. The adopted bill includes a variety of new standards for lighting and for residential and commercial appliance equipment. The equipment includes residential refrigerators, freezers, refrigerator-freezers, metal halide lamps, and commercial walk-in coolers and freezers. Repeal of Oil and Gas Tax Incentives. The enacted law includes repeal of two tax subsidies in order to offset the estimated cost to implement the CAFE provision. The two most controversial provisions of H.R. 6 that were not included in the enacted law were the proposed Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) and most of the proposed tax provisions, which included repeal of tax subsidies for oil and gas and new incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy."
