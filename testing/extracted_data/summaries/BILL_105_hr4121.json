Requires programs for emergency medical services and preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, and rehabilitative approaches to include: (1) development and dissemination of a core content for a model State training program applicable to cardiac arrest for inclusion in EMS educational curricula and training programs that address lifesaving interventions, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation. (2) a limited demonstration project to provide training in such core content, (3) identification of cardiac arrest care providers. (4) identification of equipment and supplies that should be accessible to such providers to permit lifesaving interventions, (5) development of model State and Federal legislation. And (6) coordination of a national database for reporting and collecting information on the incidence of cardiac arrest and related issues. Prescribes guidelines for the core content of the model State training program. Declares that the purpose of the model legislation is to ensure: (1) access to EMS through consideration of a requirement for public placement of lifesaving equipment. And (2) good samaritan immunity for cardiac arrest care providers, those involved with the instruction of the training programs, and owners and managers of property where equipment is placed."
