    "content": "This report profiles significant legislation, including floor votes, that authorized the use of presidential Trade Promotion Authority (TPA)\u2014previously known as fast-track trade negotiating authority\u2014since its inception in 1974. The report also includes a list of floor votes since 1979 on implementing legislation for trade agreements that were passed under TPA fast-track procedures. Although TPA expired on July 1, 2007, four free trade agreements (FTAs) were signed in time to be considered under TPA expedited procedures in the 110th Congress. The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act was passed by Congress (H.R. 3688) and signed into law as P.L. 110-138 on December 14, 2007. The legislative future of three proposed U.S FTAs (with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea) is uncertain. For further discussions of TPA or fast-track legislative activity, the report lists CRS reports and Internet resources. This report will be updated as events warrant in the 112th Congress."
