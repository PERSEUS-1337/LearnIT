    "content": "Student Disciplinary Fairness Act of 2013 - Amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to establish an Office of School and Discipline Policy for the purpose of reducing the number of juveniles who are incarcerated and develop a criminal record based on activity that occurs while the juvenile is at school. Directs the Office to: (1) collect and publish data relating to the arrest and incarceration of juveniles for violations of school policies or rules. (2) work with states, local governments, and nongovernmental organizations to expand the use of alternatives to detention and incarceration programming in schools. And (3) collect and publish data on the relationship between the presence of a school resource officer at a school and the rate of juveniles who are arrested and incarcerated for violations of school rules or policies. Authorizes the Director of the Office of School and Discipline Policy to make grants to states, local governments, and local educational agencies to reduce the number of juveniles who are incarcerated and develop a criminal record based on activity that occurs while the juvenile is at school. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require state or local government applicants for community policing grants to provide assurances that the administration of juvenile justice in their jurisdictions is consistent with constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection. Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to authorize the Attorney General to issue subpoenas to access documents relating to actions by governmental and law enforcement officials responsible for the administration of juvenile justice or the incarceration of juveniles. Directs the Secretary of Education to make grants to states, local governments, or juvenile justice agencies to fund training for school personnel in elementary and secondary schools to mitigate delinquent student behavior which may avoid a referral to law enforcement officials."
