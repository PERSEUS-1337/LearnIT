    "content": "Congress has played a role in establishing museums that have become part of the Smithsonian Institution (e.g., the National Museum of the American Indian and the National Museum of African American History and Culture) and museums that operate independently (e.g., the National Gallery of Art and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum). Historically, for most museums operated in whole or in part by the federal government, congressional authorization has been required. Congressional action is likely required to authorize a new federal museum. In the 113th Congress (2013-2014), legislation was introduced to authorize the National Museum of the American Latino and to authorize a commission to study the potential creation of a National Women's History Museum. For the National Museum of the American Latino, a commission reported to Congress in 2011 that the museum should be established and made part of the Smithsonian Institution. Since then, proposals to authorize the museum have been introduced, but no further action has been taken either by the committees of jurisdiction or the House or the Senate. In December 2014, the Commission to Study the Potential Creation of a National Women's History Museum was established in the Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (P.L. 113-291). It will report \"not later than 18 months after the date of the first meeting of the Commission\" on whether the museum should be authorized, how it should be funded, and whether it should be a Smithsonian museum. If Congress considers creating a new museum in the District of Columbia\u2014either the National Museum of the American Latino, the National Women's History Museum, or another yet-to-be proposed museum\u2014several issues might warrant consideration: the museum's subject matter and whether it might conflict with existing federal museums or other local museums; the museum's funding and if federal appropriations, private donations, or a combination of both will be used; the museum's potential location; the museum's proposed management (i.e., Smithsonian, another federal agency, or an independent entity); and the Commemorative Works Act's (CWA's) role, if any, on the museum authorization process. This report examines the contemporary process used to authorize new museums in Washington, DC, and evaluates potential issues for congressional consideration if new museum legislation is introduced, examined by committee, and potentially advanced for consideration on the House or Senate floor."
