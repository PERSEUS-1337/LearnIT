    "content": "Charter-party carriers of passengers, including transportation network companies, are subject to the jurisdiction and control of the Public Utilities Commission under the Passenger Charter-party Carriers\u2019 Act. This bill would require the commission to establish a telephone communications service, with a designated telephone number, that would be available to members of the public to communicate to the commission any concerns, or register complaints, regarding service provided by charter-party carriers of passengers, including transportation network companies. The bill would require each charter-party carrier of passengers to include the telephone number designated by the commission on all contracts for service made after January 1, 2018, and for a transportation network company or other charter-party carrier of passengers that arranges for transportation utilizing application software, commonly termed an app, the bill would require that the customer be notified of the existence of, andf the Passenger Charter-party Carriers\u2019 Act or an order or direction of the commission pursuant to the act is a crime. Because the provisions of this bill are within the act and require action by the commission to implement its requirements, a violation of these provisions would impose a state-mandated local program by creating a new crime. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has broad regulatory authority pursuant to the California Constitution and the Public Utilities Act over public utilities, as defined, including common carriers, toll bridge corporations, electrical corporations, gas corporations, pipeline corporations, telephone corporations, telegraph corporations, water corporations, sewer system corporations, and heat corporations. In addition, the commission has more limited authority over certain other corporations, including charter-party carriers of passengers. Existing law provides compensation for reasonable advocate\u2019s fees, reasonable expert witness fees, and other reasonable costs to public utility customers and representatives of customers for participation or intervention in formal proceedings of the commission involving electrical, gas, water, telegraph, and telephone public utilities. This bill would additionally authorize compensation to be awarded by the commission for reasonable advocate\u2019s fees, reasonable expert witness fees, and other reasonable costs to customers and representatives of customers for participation or intervention in formal proceedings of the commission involving a corporation that is subject to regulation by the commission pursuant to the Passenger Charter-Party Carriers\u2019 Act. Existing law requires the commission to deny compensation to any customer who attempts to delay or obstruct the orderly and timely fulfillment of the commission\u2019s responsibilities. This bill would require the commission to deny any claim for compensation for contributions to a closed proceeding unless otherwise specified."
