    "title": "SB 383",
    "content": "Under existing law, a party in a civil action may object to a complaint, cross-complaint, or answer by demurrer, as specified. Existing law authorizes a party to amend a pleading once without leave of the court at any time before an answer or demurrer is filed, or after a demurrer is filed and before the trial of the issue of law thereon. This bill would require a demurring party in certain civil actions, before filing the demurrer, to engage in a specified meet and confer process with the party who filed the pleading demurred to for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached as to the filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer. The bill would prohibit a party from amending a complaint or cross-complaint more than 3 times in response to a demurrer filed before the case is at issue, except as specified. The bill would prohibit a party from demurring to a pleading that is amended following a sustained demurrer as to any portion of the amended pleading on grounds that could have been raised by the prior demurrer. This bill would also authorize a party to amend a pleading after a demurrer is filed but before it is heard by the court if the amended pleading is filed and served before the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer. The bill would authorize a party to amend a pleading after the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer upon stipulation by the parties. The bill would repeal its provisions on January 1, 2021. The bill would require a demurring party, in some circumstances, to file a declaration under penalty of perjury. By expanding the scope of the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
