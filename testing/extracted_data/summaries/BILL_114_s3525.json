    "content": "Strengthening American Transportation Security Act of 2016 This bill expresses the sense of Congress that the personnel system used by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) provides insufficient workplace protections for its workforce and such personnel should be entitled to protections under the civil service system applicable to all federal employees. The bill repeals personnel authorities of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Transportation governing the conditions of employment for TSA employees, thus making TSA employees subject to the personnel management system applicable to all other federal employees. Within 60 days after the enactment of this bill or an earlier date set by DHS: (1) all TSA personnel management policies, directives, letters, and guidelines and any DHS human resources management system shall cease to be effective with respect to TSA employees. And (2) TSA employees shall become subject to labor provisions applicable to other federal transportation employees. The bill sets forth transition rules that protect the pay rates and other rights of TSA employees. DHS shall consult with the labor organization certified by the Federal Labor Relations Authority to carry out the conversion of TSA employees and positions to the civil service system. The provisions of this bill do not affect the prohibitions against disloyalty and asserting the right to strike against the federal government."
