    "title": "An act to amend Section 19320 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to marijuana.",
    "content": "Existing law, the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MCRSA), provides for the licensure and regulation of medical cannabis and requires all commercial cannabis activity to be conducted between licensees. Existing law establishes the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation within the Department of Consumer Affairs. Existing law authorizes licensing authorities to only issue state licenses to qualified applicants. Existing law, upon the date of implementation of regulations by the licensing authority, prohibits a person from engaging in commercial cannabis activity without possessing both a state license and a local permit, license, or other authorization. This bill would instead prohibit a person from engaging in commercial cannabis activity without possessing both a state license and a local permit, license, or other authorization one year after the bureau posts a notice on its Internet Web site that the licensing authorities have commenced issuing licenses. The bill would also, with regard to commercial cannabis activity in the City of Los Angeles, prohibit licensing authorities from requiring a local license, permit, or other authorization, and would require the issuance of a state license, if the authorities determine, as specified, that the applicant meets all of the requirements of MCRSA and specified criteria relating to Measure D, which was approved by the voters of the City of Los Angeles at the May 21, 2013, general election. The bill would further provide that a license issued pursuant to the above provision has the same force and effect, and confers the same benefits and responsibilities, as licenses issued to licensees not subject to the above-described exception. The bill would require the exemption to the local licensing requirement provided by these provisions to be superseded by a subsequent initiative authorizing the City of Los Angeles to issue local licenses to medical marijuana businesses in the city if the voters of Los Angeles approve the initiative prior to the time the State of California begins issuing state licenses."
