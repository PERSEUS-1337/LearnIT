    "content": "On October 9, 1999, the President signed the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Act, 2000 ( P.L. 106-69 ). The Act provided $50.2 billion for the Department ofTransportation (DOT). DOT had requested funding similar to the level enacted in P.L. 106-69 . However, the FY2000 Consolidated appropriations act, P.L. 106-113 , calls for an across-the-boardrescission of 0.38% from each agency's discretionary budget authority and obligation limits. Thiswill result in a reduction of approximately $179 million from the level enacted in P.L. 106-69 . TheFederal Highway Administration (-$105.3 million), the Airport Improvement Program (-$54.4million), the Federal Transit Administration (-$17.6 million), and the Coast Guard (-$1.6 million)together absorb all but about $0.5 million of the DOT reductions. Even with the rescission, theamount provided represents a nearly 6% increase over the FY1999 enacted level. Reflecting the continuing impact of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), both the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal TransitAdministration (FTA) received increases of 7% above FY1999 enacted levels. The Federal AviationAdministration (FAA) received a more modest increase of just under 3%. The FY2000 Act fundsthe entire FAA budget out of the airport and airway trust fund. Historically, a significant portion ofthe FAA operations budget has been provided from general fund revenues. Much of the debate over the Department's budget focused on allocating resources raised by user fees and deposited in specific transportation trust funds. A debate arose between those in favorof a unified budget vs. those seeking to protect individual programs either by taking them off budgetor using fiscal boundaries or \"firewalls\" to ensure a minimum level of financing. This policy ofcreating discretionary spending guarantees originated with the provisions of the TransportationEquity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), legislation that placed \"firewalls\" around certaincategories of the Federal Highway Administration's programs. The House version of the FederalAviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill, H.R. 1000 , proposes also changingthe budgetary treatment of the airport and airway trust fund by taking the fund off budget. For the highway trust fund, TEA-21 provided for the disposition of actual receipts above those forecast and authorized. The Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) provisions requireadditional trust fund receipts to be redistributed to individual states based on the formula used toapportion highway dollars. The enacted version of H.R. 2084 narrows the scope ofRABA distribution to certain core highway programs, thereby reducing the allocations to a numberof smaller TEA-21 programs and increasing the funds flowing to the states.
