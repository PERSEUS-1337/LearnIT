Health care providers give each visiting child between the ages of six months and five years a new, developmentally appropriate children's book to take home and keep. And health care facilities create literacy-rich environments that include gently used books for waiting room use or volunteer readers to show parents the techniques of reading aloud to young children. Requires that the books provided to children under the programs be obtained at a discount."
