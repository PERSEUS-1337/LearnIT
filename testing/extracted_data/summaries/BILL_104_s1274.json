    "content": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to define remediation waste as a solid waste or any medium generated during implementation of a remedial action plan (RAP) (a document issued, entered into, or approved by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency . Directs a State that has a remediation waste management program authorized under this Act to exercise compliance with respect to a RAP in the program State. Directs the Administrator to exercise such authority with respect to a plan in a nonprogram State. Provides a rule for the management of remediation waste where a RAP provides for management of such waste in a State other than the State in which it is generated. Allows a State with a hazardous waste program authorized under the Act to obtain interim authorization to carry out its remediation waste management program after certifying to the Administrator that the State has the authority to control the management of remediation waste in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment, resources to administer and enforce such authority, and procedures to ensure public notice and opportunity for comment on RAPs submitted to the State. Provides for issuance of final authorization of the State's program by the Administrator not later than 18 months after it submits a certification. Provides a similar, but more extended procedure for remediation waste management programs of States without authorized hazardous waste programs. Provides for issuance by the Administrator of compliance orders for violations of RAP requirements, but requires notice to a State by the Administrator of violations of remedial waste management requirements contained in a RAP before commencing action to enforce compliance. Allows the Administrator to issue an order or commence an enforcement action if after 30 days the State does not take appropriate action to require compliance with RAP requirements. Excepts from hazardous waste classification petroleum-contaminated media and debris that fail the test for toxicity characteristics due to organics issued by the Administrator under hazardous waste identification and listing provisions and that are subject to corrective action under the underground storage tank provisions."
