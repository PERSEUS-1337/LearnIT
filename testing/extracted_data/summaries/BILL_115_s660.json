    "content": "Native American Indian Education Act This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to allow the Department of Education, for FY2018-FY2022, to pay Native American-serving, nontribal institutions of higher education the tuition of their out-of-state Native American students. This applies only to schools that are required to provide a tuition-free education, with the support of their state, to Native American students as a condition under which the college or state received its original grant of land and facilities from the federal government. Payments are treated as reimbursements to institutions from their states."
