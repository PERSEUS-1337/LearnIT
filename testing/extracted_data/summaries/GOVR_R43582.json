    "content": "The House and Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) appropriations subcommittees are charged with providing annual appropriations for the Department of Transportation (DOT), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and related agencies. THUD programs receive both discretionary and mandatory budget authority; HUD's budget generally accounts for the largest share of discretionary appropriations, but when mandatory funding is taken into account, DOT's budget is larger than HUD's budget. Mandatory funding typically accounts for around half the total annual THUD appropriation. The THUD bill's appropriation totaled $104 billion in FY2014: $51 billion in net discretionary funding and $53 billion in mandatory funding. But there is a decrease of $3 billion in offsetting receipts to HUD for FY2015 compared to FY2014. Thus, just to maintain the FY2015 THUD bill's overall budgetary resources at the same level as in FY2014, the THUD bill would need $3 billion more in budget authority than it received in FY2014. The House Appropriations Committee's FY2015 discretionary budget allocation to its THUD subcommittee is $52 billion ($1 billion more than the FY2014 discretionary funding level); the Senate Appropriations Committee's FY2015 allocation to its THUD subcommittee is $54 billion ($3 billion more than FY2014). The Administration requested net budget authority of $127 billion (after scorekeeping adjustments) for the THUD bill for FY2015, an increase of $22 billion (21%). Most of this increase was for highway, transit, and passenger rail programs in DOT, reflecting the increased funding proposed in the Administration's surface transportation reauthorization proposal. Congress is considering DOT appropriations in the context of the expiration of highway and transit authorizations at the end of the summer of 2014, and the projected insolvency of the highway trust fund before the end of the summer. The Administration requested a total of $91 billion in discretionary and mandatory funding for DOT for FY2015, an increase of roughly $20 billion (28%) over FY2014. The House provided $70 billion for DOT, $1 billion less than in FY2014. The reductions were primarily to the TIGER grant program (-$500 million), the New Starts transit grant program (-$253 million), and Amtrak capital grants (-$200 million). The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $72 billion for DOT, $1 billion more than the FY2014 level. The President requested $37 billion in net new budget authority for HUD in FY2015, $4 billion more than provided in FY2014 ($33 billion). The House provided $35 billion for HUD, $2 billion above the net discretionary funding in FY2014. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $36 billion, $3 billon more than the FY2014 level. The Administration requested a total of $346 million for the agencies in Title II (the Related Agencies). This is $20 million (5%) less than the $366 million they received in FY2014. The reduction is almost entirely in the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation ($204 million in FY2015, $182 million requested). The House agreed to the requested level; the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $351 million, adding $4.6 million to the Neighborhood Investment Corporation."
