    "content": "Preventing Sex Offenders Access to Children in Our Communities Act of 2010 - Amends the Sex Offender Notification and Registration Act to require jurisdictions subject to such Act to prohibit registered sex offenders from: (1) accepting a position of employment, including a volunteer position, which by the inherent nature of the position places such sex offender in direct and substantial contact with minors. Or (2) obtaining a permit or permission to carry out an activity or performance that would present direct and substantial contact with minors. Authorizes the Attorney General to award grants and enter into contracts with public agencies or nonprofit private organizations to establish a community accessible sex offender tips and support program to provide for anonymous or confidential tips regarding sex offenders who are not complying with registration or other applicable requirements. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to: (1) coordinate with the head of each executive agency to determine which government publications could be made available on government web sites and no longer printed. (2) devise a strategy to reduce overall government printing costs by not less than $15 million over a five-year period beginning with FY2011. And (3) ensure that essential printed documents continue to be made available to Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries and individuals living in areas with limited Internet access or use."
