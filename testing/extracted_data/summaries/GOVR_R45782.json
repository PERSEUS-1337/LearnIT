    "content": "The substantial burden of opioid abuse related to the current opioid epidemic in the United States has resulted in a disparity between the need for substance abuse treatment and the current capacity. Methadone and buprenorphine are two medications used in medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD). Methadone and buprenorphine are both opioids; their use to treat opioid use disorders is often called opioid agonist treatment or therapy (OAT) or opioid agonist MAT . As controlled substances, methadone and buprenorphine are subject to additional regulations. Methadone may be used to treat opioid addiction within federally certified opioid treatment programs (OTP)\u00e2\u0080\u0094often referred to as methadone clinics. Buprenorphine may be used to treat opioid use disorder in two settings: (1) within an OTP and (2) outside an OTP pursuant to a Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) waiver. The federal government has taken steps to increase the availability of MAT in response to the escalation of opioid overdoses and deaths in recent years. Policy efforts to address the opioid epidemic have corresponded with increased treatment availability, yet access to substance abuse treatment has not kept pace with the increasing rates of opioid addiction in the United States. Geographic information is important in accurately evaluating treatment capacity. Treatment location may be especially relevant to understanding the discrepancy between need and capacity. The current report identifies the geographic location of MAT providers using methadone and buprenorphine (opioid agonist treatment) in the United States. The analysis uses Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) data to identify the number and location of (1) federally certified opioid treatment programs and (2) practitioners with DATA waivers. The geographic location of OTPs and DATA-waived practitioners are displayed in several national and regional maps. Identifying the location of OAT providers may have utility in increasing accessibility to treatment. However, simply increasing capacity for treatment may not effectively increase availability (or decrease opioid-related overdoses) if treatment providers are not located in areas of need. The current analysis does not evaluate need\u00e2\u0080\u0094by locating opioid-related overdose hospital admissions and deaths for instance. It does, however, provide an initial step in assessing how treatment providers are dispersed geographically. Other factors, such as substance use treatment financing, stigma, and waiting periods for services may also affect OAT availability. Practitioners are subject to state laws and regulations regarding prescribing privileges which affect their eligibility for DATA waivers and, in turn, the availability of treatment. Congress may incorporate geographic factors in strategies designed to increase capacity and availability of treatment."
