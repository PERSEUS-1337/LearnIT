    "content": "Mortgage E-Verify Act of 2010 - Amends the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act to require the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act to confirm the identity and work eligibility of the mortgagor as a prerequisite to: (1) any refinancing, restructuring, or modification agreement governing a single-family housing mortgage that is held by, or that backs any security issued by, either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Or (2) any purchase of, or issuance of any security that is backed by, any single-family housing mortgage made for the refinancing, restructuring, or modification of the mortgagor's previous single-family housing mortgage on the same property. Identifies the required inquiry as one made through the basic pilot E-Verify program under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. Amends the National Housing Act to require the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to use the E-Verify program to confirm the identity and work eligibility of the mortgagor as a prerequisite to single-family housing mortgage insurance issued under the Act."
