    "content": "Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 - Requires a group health plan that applies an aggregate lifetime limit for medical or surgical services, if the plan also provides a mental health benefit, to include mental health payments in that limit or establish a separate aggregate lifetime limit for mental health services, with the mental health limit not less than the medical or surgical limit. Prohibits a group health plan that does not apply a medical or surgical limit from applying a mental health limit. Exempts employers with fewer than 26 employees. Makes this Act ineffective after September 30, 2001. Exempts a purchaser from this Act if the Act's provisions result in a one percent or greater increase in the cost of a group health plan's premiums."
