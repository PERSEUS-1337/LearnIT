    "content": "Broadband Deployment and Competition Enhancement Act of 2001 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit subjecting an incumbent local exchange carrier (carrier) to common carrier regulation with respect to any optical fiber facility, or any technology of a similar facility, in the carrier's network that is used to provide service to residential customers and that is or was deployed where no outside telephone distribution plant previously existed, or from any structure or premise to a customer premise, if the facility is capable of providing advance service. Prohibits subjecting such a carrier to such regulation with respect to packet switching or successor technology or the resale of advanced service or high-speed Internet access service. Requires such carrier to provide: (1) collocation in its central offices with respect to equipment used in the provision of advanced service. And (2) advanced service to all of its customers in a State within five years after the enactment of this Act, making carriers that do not so comply subject to common carrier regulation thereafter. Prohibits requiring such a carrier to convert to a network element or combination of network elements any special access circuit being provided on June 1, 2001. Requires the Federal Communications Commission to identify in its regulations any requirements or obligations that result in different or disparate treatment among various types of providers of advanced service and high-speed Internet access service, or among different technologies used to provide such service."
