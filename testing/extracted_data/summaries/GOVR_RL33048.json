    "content": "Since the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, the nation has been working to improve thesecurity of hazardous chemicals transportation. Marine shipments of hazardous chemical cargo maybe attractive terrorist targets because of their large volume and inherent toxicity or flammability. Anecdotal evidence and international events suggest that terrorists may have both the desire andcapability to attack such shipments in U.S. waters. Building on existing legislation, Congress isanalyzing the security of hazardous chemical marine shipments and deciding whether to strengthenrelated federal security efforts. H.R. 2651, for example, would increase penalties for criminal orterrorist activities around ports and marine vessels. S. 1052 includes provisions to increase generalport security, including foreign port security. Drawing on marine commerce data from the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE), CRS hasanalyzed marine shipments of acutely toxic or combustible chemicals as defined underEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. According to this analysis, over 100,000marine shipments (54 million tons) of chemicals potentially capable of causing mass casualties(injuries or deaths) among the general public passed through U.S. waters in 2003. These chemicalshipments accounted for 2% of U.S. marine cargo tonnage and were shipped through 113 U.S. ports. The top 30 ports handled 95% of this hazardous chemical tonnage. Most marine shipments ofhazardous chemicals are much larger than such shipments on land; they would be of sufficientvolume, on average, to require an off-site risk management plan under EPA rules if the samequantity of chemical was stored at a chemical plant. The Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA, P.L. 107-295 ) and the International Shipand Port Facility Security Code give the Coast Guard far-ranging authority over the security ofhazardous marine shipping. The agency has developed port security plans addressing how to deployfederal, state, and local resources to prevent terrorist attacks. Under the MTSA, the Coast Guard hasassessed the overall vulnerability of marine vessels, their potential to transport terrorists or terrormaterials, and their use as potential weapons. The Coast Guard has employed these assessments toaugment marine assets security and develop new maritime security standards. As federal oversight of hazardous chemical marine security continues to evolve, Congressmay raise questions concerning terrorism risk uncertainty and efforts by federal agencies and theprivate sector to rigorously evaluate that risk. Congress may assess whether responsible federalagencies and private sector entities have in place sufficient resources and effective measures tosecure hazardous chemical marine cargo from terrorist attack. Congress may also evaluate theemergency response capabilities of coastal communities exposed to chemical shipping hazards. Determining how hazardous chemical marine security fits together with other homeland securitypriorities to achieve common security goals could be an oversight challenge for the 109th Congress. This report will be updated as events warrant."
