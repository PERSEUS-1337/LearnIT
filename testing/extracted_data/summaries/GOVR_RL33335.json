    "content": "This report examines the growing threat of transnational organized crime to U.S. nationalsecurity and global stability. The end of the Cold War -- along with increasing globalizationbeginning in the 1990s -- has helped criminal organizations expand their activities and gain globalreach. Criminal networks are believed to have benefitted from the weakening of certain governmentinstitutions, more open borders, and the resurgence of ethnic and regional conflicts across the formerSoviet Union and many other regions. Transnational criminal organizations have also exploitedexpanding financial markets and rapid technological developments. In addition, terrorist networksare believed to be increasingly supporting themselves through traditional crime, and have beenlinked to criminal organizations. Alliances between the two groups could amplify threats toAmerican security. Transnational criminals engage in a spectrum of illicit activities, includingnarcotics and arms smuggling, trafficking in persons, counterfeiting, and money laundering and otherfinancial crimes. The report also outlines the U.S. response to international crime. While U.S. policy is framedwithin the 1998 International Crime Control Strategy, it is also shaped by other more recent federaland agency plans. Agencies heading government efforts include the Departments of State, Defense,Justice, Treasury, and Homeland Security. Key federal programs and initiatives and theirinteragency coordination are discussed. International cooperation and agreements are vital to U.S.strategy; also, many programs seek to assist and train foreign law enforcement. Finally, this reportexamines likely Congressional concerns related to U.S. efforts to combat transnational crime. Thereport will not be updated."
