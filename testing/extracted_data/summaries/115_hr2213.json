    "title": "Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act of 2017",
    "content": "Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act of 2017 This bill amends the Anti-Border Corruption Act of 2010 to expand the authority of the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to waive the administration of polygraph examinations to civilian and military applicants for law enforcement positions in the CBP. This expanded waiver authority terminates five years after the enactment of this bill. An individual who receives such a waiver is not exempt from other hiring requirements relating to suitability for employment and eligibility to hold a national security designated position. Any individual who receives a waiver and holds a current Tier 4 background investigation shall be subject to a Tier 5 background investigation. The CBP may administer a polygraph examination to an applicant or employee who receives a waiver if information is discovered prior to the completion of a background investigation that results in a determination that a polygraph examination is necessary to make a final determination regarding suitability for employment or continued employment. The CBP shall provide Congress information on the number of waivers requested, granted, and denied, and the reasons for any such denial, and the final outcome of the application for employment at issue. Such information shall also include the number of instances a polygraph examination was administered, the result of any such examination, and the final outcome of the application for employment at issue."
