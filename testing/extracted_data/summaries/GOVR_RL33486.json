    "content": "This report assesses U.S. policy toward Islamist organizations in the Arab world, specificallythose groups that have renounced violence and terrorism. The report analyzes U.S. governmentattitudes toward Islamist movements and investigates how U.S. democracy promotion policy isapplied in three Arab countries with a significant Islamist presence in the political sphere: Morocco,Egypt, and Jordan. It may be updated periodically to include new case studies of Islamist movementsin Algeria, Yemen, Kuwait, Bahrain, or areas outside the Arab world. The Bush Administration has made the promotion of democracy in the Middle East a nationalsecurity priority, stating that greater political freedom can undercut the forces of Islamic radicalismand indoctrination. As U.S. democracy promotion policies have moved forward, policy makers haveconfronted a significant dilemma: how to respond to challenges posed by political Islamistmovements (i.e. parties and political organizations that promote social and political reform inaccordance with Islamic religious principles that may lead them to oppose U.S. foreign policy). In response to this dilemma, some observers have questioned whether the United Statesshould exert pressure on Arab governments to open their political systems and respect human rightswith the knowledge that such steps, if successful, may benefit Islamist groups. Representing apowerful and popular political force in the Arab world today, many Islamist political parties andorganizations are largely opposed, at least rhetorically, to key aspects of U.S. foreign policy in theMiddle East, such as support for Israel, the occupation of Iraq, and the large U.S. military presencein the Persian Gulf. Elections in Iraq, Egypt, and the Palestinian Authority that were supported bythe United States have strengthened the political positions of Islamist organizations, including, inthe case of Hamas, armed groups that have refused to renounce violence. Non-violent Islamist groups, which have chosen or been permitted to peacefully participatein politics, present their own challenges to U.S. policy makers. This report raises the followingquestions: Are Islamists liberal democrats or fundamentalists? Should the United States support theirparticipation in democratic politics? Do non-violent Islamists welcome dialogue with the UnitedStates or would such action discredit them among their followers? While many continue to speculate over the direction of U.S. democracy promotion in theMiddle East, Congress may use its oversight authority to bring further clarity to the Administration'sregional strategy, particularly on the issue of dealing with Islamist groups. Congress alsoappropriates funds for regional democratization programs and foreign aid projects and may specifythat these funds be used for certain projects or channeled to certain groups."
