    "content": "The ability to gather accurate and timely information on enemy forces is an essential enabler of modern military operations. The growing use of precision guided munitions (PGMs) which candestroy specific targets without extensive collateral damage depends upon the availability of preciseinformation. No single platform or technology can satisfy the needs of the Department of Defense(DOD) for information at all times in all scenarios. However, airborne platforms will likely continueto satisfy a large portion of DOD's ISR requirements over the next several decades. Among airborne ISR platforms, the U-2 Dragon Lady and the RQ-4A Global Hawk are especially valuable. The U-2 stands out for its proven track record of providing vital near-real-timeintelligence to military theater commanders in the 1991 war with Iraq (Operation Desert Storm), the1999 conflict in Kosovo (Operation Allied Force), and other conflict areas. Global Hawk, a soon to be fielded unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), has been considered a complement to, and potentially a replacement for the U-2. While the un-proven Global Hawkappears to offer some advantages over the U-2 -- such as greater range and endurance, and notexposing a pilot to danger -- as currently designed it does not currently match the U-2's intelligencegathering capabilities. The Air Force is seeking to upgrade these designs so the second generationof Global Hawks would be more similar to U-2s in capability. Both Congress and DOD face important decisions regarding current and future mix of U.S. airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. An overarching line of inquiryis: Over the next 20 to 30 years, what mix of existing and planned manned and unmanned ISRaircraft can most effectively satisfy DOD's requirement for timely and accurate information onenemy forces? An important immediate issue to be resolved is how to best introduce Global Hawk platforms into the U.S. ISR inventory and at what pace, relative to planned or unplanned U-2 attrition. Keyconcerns are whether manned aircraft can be completely replaced by UAVs, the time that it will taketo integrate the Global Hawks into the operating force structure, and the availability of adequatefunds to support the acquisition of Global Hawks without compromising vital operationalcapabilities for an extended period."
