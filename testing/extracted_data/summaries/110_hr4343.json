    "title": "To amend title 49, United States Code, to modify age standards for pilots engaged in commercial aviation operations.",
    "content": "Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act - Amends federal transportation law to allow a pilot who has attained 60 years of age to serve as a passenger airline pilot until the age of 65, provided that a pilot who has attained age 60 may serve as pilot-in-command on international flights only if there is another pilot in the flight crew who has not yet attained 60 years of age. Prohibits subjecting pilots to different medical examinations and standards on account of age unless to ensure an adequate level of safety in flight, except that no person who has attained 60 years of age may serve as a pilot unless such person has a first-class medical certificate. Requires air carriers to: (1) continue to provide FAA-approved training to pilots, with specific emphasis on initial and recurring training and qualification of pilots who have attained 60 years of age. And (2) evaluate, every six months, the performance of pilots who have attained 60 years of age through a line check of such pilot. Requires the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the effect of the modification of pilot age requirements, if any, on aviation safety."
