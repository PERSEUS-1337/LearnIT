    "content": "Targeting Child Predators Act of 2017 This bill amends the federal criminal code to add new provisions with respect to a nondisclosure requirement issued in connection with an administrative subpoena in a child exploitation or abuse investigation. The bill modifies the process for issuing a nondisclosure requirement in a child exploitation or abuse investigation and lengthens the period of time during which a recipient of an administrative subpoena is prohibited from disclosure. It also subjects a nondisclosure requirement to judicial review, requires the administrative subpoena to include notice of the availability of judicial review, and establishes a process for judicial review."
