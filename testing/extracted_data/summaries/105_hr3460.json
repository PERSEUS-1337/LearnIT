    "content": "Approves a specified international fishery agreement between the United States and the Republic of Latvia. Extends the authorization of appropriations for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention Act of 1995. Mandates an annual report to the Congress on the activities of the Fisheries Commission, the General Council, the Scientific Council, and the consultative committee. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to seek to establish a new practice for allocating quotas under the Convention that is predictable and transparent, provides fishing opportunities for all members of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, and is consistent with the Straddling Fish Stocks Agreement. Amends the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975 to authorize appropriations to carry out the Act. Authorizes the States of Washington, Oregon, and California to adopt and enforce State laws governing fishing and processing in the Exclusive Economic Zone adjacent to that State in any Dungeness crab fishery for which there is no fishery management plan in effect. Prohibits any vessel from harvesting or processing Dungeness crab in those areas except as authorized by a permit issued by any of those States or under certain tribal treaty rights. Repeals existing provisions, scheduled to expire on October 1, 1999, regarding State regulation of that fishery."
