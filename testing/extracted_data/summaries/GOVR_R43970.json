    "content": "This report tracks and describes actions taken by the Administration and Congress to provide FY2016 appropriations for the International Trade Administration (ITA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), and the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR). These three trade-related agencies are part of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) appropriations process. The report also provides an overview of three trade-related programs that are administered by ITA, USITC, and USTR. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) provided a total of $600.8 million for the three agencies, including $462.0 million for ITA, $84.5 million for USITC, and $54.3 million for USTR. For FY2016, the Administration requested $684.6 million for FY2016 for the three agencies, an amount 13.9% greater than what Congress appropriated for FY2015. The request included a one-time increase of $83.8 million (55.6%) in funding for USITC for costs associated with securing space for the agency following the expiration of its current lease in August 2017. The House passed the FY2016 CJS appropriations bill (H.R. 2578) on June 3, 2015. The House-passed bill included $597.8 million for CJS trade-related agencies, an amount 0.5% less than the FY2015 enacted amount and 12.7% less than the Administration's FY2016 request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved its FY2016 CJS appropriations bill, which was offered as an amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 2578, on June 16, 2015. The Senate committee-reported bill recommended $601.8 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies, an amount 0.2% greater than the FY2015 enacted amount, 12.1% less than the Administration's FY2016 request, and 0.7% greater than the House-passed amount. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended that USTR be consolidated into the Department of Commerce and that funding for this agency be moved to the Department of Commerce heading. On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113). Division B of the act provides $483.0 million for ITA, $88.5 for USITC, and $54.5 million for USTR. The FY2016 appropriation for the three CJS trade-related agencies is $626.0 million, an amount 4.2% greater than the FY2015 appropriation, but 8.6% less than the Administration's request."
