    "title": "AB 381",
    "content": "Existing law, in cases in which a minor is adjudged alleged to be a dependent child of the court on the ground that the minor has suffered abuse or neglect, allows the court to take the child from the physical custody of his or her parents or guardian if there would be a substantial danger to the physical health, safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the minor if the minor were returned home, among other criteria. If a child is removed from the physical custody of his or her parents, existing law requires preferential consideration to be given to a request by a relative of the child for placement of the child with the relative. Existing law requires that the best interest of the child be considered, among other specified factors, in making that determination. Existing law also requires that, subsequent to the hearing on the proper disposition to be made of the child, whenever a new placement of the child must be made, consideration for placement again be given to relatives who have not been found to be unsuitable, as specified. This bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to ensure the best possible outcome for children removed from the physical custody of his or her parents. require the county social worker and the court, when determining whether placement with a relative is appropriate, to consider the above-described factors on a case-by-case basis. The bill also would require that consideration for placement with a relative subsequent to the disposition hearing be given without regard to whether a new placement of a child must be made, and would direct the social worker to report and the court to consider additional enumerated factors in making this determination. By increasing the duties of county social workers, this bill would create a state-mandated local program. The bill would also require the Judicial Council to adopt a rule of court on or before January 1, 2017, that implements these provisions. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
