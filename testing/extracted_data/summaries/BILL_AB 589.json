    "title": "AB 589",
    "content": "Existing law prohibits a person, firm, partnership, association, or corporation from operating, establishing, managing, conducting, or maintaining a child day care facility without a current valid license. Existing law requires the Community Care Licensing Division of the State Department of Social Services to regulate child care licensees. Existing law requires the department to establish a registry of child care providers who have undergone criminal background checks. These providers are known as registered trustline child care providers. Existing law also requires a licensed child day care facility to make available to the public licensing reports and other licensing documents that pertain to a facility visit or a substantiated complaint investigation, among other licensing issues. Existing law establishes in the State Treasury the Child Health and Safety Fund. Existing law authorizes the department to allocate the funds, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for purposes that include site visits of day care centers and family day care homes. This bill would require an online child care job posting service to include specified information regarding each child care provider on the Internet Web site profile or page that lists child care provider information, including a description of the trustline registry and the toll-free telephone number and the link to the Internet Web site for the registry, a description of the availability of free child care referrals in every county, and, if the service provides background checks, an easy-to-understand overview of what is included in the background check and what is not included. The bill would impose a fine of $1,000 for a 2nd or subsequent violation of these requirements, after written notice and an opportunity for a hearing. The bill would provide that fines collected pursuant to these provisions would be deposited in the Child Health and Safety Fund. The bill would also require the department to develop regulations for these purposes as specified."
