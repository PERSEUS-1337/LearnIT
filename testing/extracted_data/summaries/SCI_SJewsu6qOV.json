    "content": "The \u201cSupersymmetric Artificial Neural Network\u201d in deep learning (denoted (x; \u03b8, bar{\u03b8})Tw), espouses the importance of considering biological constraints in the aim of further generalizing backward propagation. \n\n Looking at the progression of \u2018solution geometries\u2019; going from SO(n) representation (such as Perceptron like models) to SU(n) representation (such as UnitaryRNNs) has guaranteed richer and richer representations in weight space of the artificial neural network, and hence better and better hypotheses were generatable. The Supersymmetric Artificial Neural Network explores a natural step forward, namely SU(m|n) representation. These supersymmetric biological brain representations (Perez et al.) can be represented by supercharge compatible special unitary notation SU(m|n), or (x; \u03b8, bar{\u03b8})Tw parameterized by \u03b8, bar{\u03b8}, which are supersymmetric directions, unlike \u03b8 seen in the typical non-supersymmetric deep learning model. Notably, Supersymmetric values can encode or represent more information than the typical deep learning model, in terms of \u201cpartner potential\u201d signals for example. Pertinently, the \"Edward Witten/String theory powered supersymmetric artificial neural network\", is one wherein supersymmetric weights are sought.Many machine learning algorithms are not empirically shown to be exactly biologically plausible, i.e. Deep Neural Network algorithms, have not been observed to occur in the brain, but regardless, such algorithms work in practice in machine learning.Likewise, regardless of Supersymmetry's elusiveness at the LHC, as seen above, it may be quite feasible to borrow formal methods from strategies in physics even if such strategies are yet to show related physical phenomena to exist; thus it may be pertinent/feasible to try to construct a model that learns supersymmetric weights, as I proposed throughout this paper, following the progression of solution geometries going from ( ) to ( ) and onwards to ( | ) BID15 ."
