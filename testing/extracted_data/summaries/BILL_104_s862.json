    "content": "Small Business Enhancement Act of 1995 - Authorizes the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to make grants to eligible institutions to design and implement programs to assist businesses, especially those in lower income urban communities, to become more productive and able to compete in the global marketplace. Directs the SBA Administrator to establish a peer review panel to review grant applications and make recommendations to the Administrator concerning the selection of grant recipients. Limits to $400,000 the assistance provided to any single recipient during any one-year period. Requires the SBA Administrator to achieve equitable geographic distribution in the awarding of such grants. Defines an eligible institution as a nonprofit institution of higher education that is located in an urban area, has an accredited school of business, draws a substantial amount of its enrollment from urban areas, and carries out programs to make postsecondary educational opportunities more accessible to residents of such urban or contiguous areas. Authorizes appropriations for the grant program for FY 1996 through 2000."
