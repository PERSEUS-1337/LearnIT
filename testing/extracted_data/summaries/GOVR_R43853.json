    "content": "The President makes appointments to positions within the federal government, either using the authorities granted to the President alone or with the advice and consent of the Senate. There are some 349 full-time leadership positions in the 15 executive departments for which the Senate provides advice and consent. This report identifies all nominations submitted to the Senate during the 112th Congress for full-time positions in these 15 executive departments. Information for each department is presented in tables. The tables include full-time positions confirmed by the Senate, pay levels for these positions, and appointment action within each executive department. Additional summary information across all 15 executive departments appears in the Appendix. During the 112th Congress, the President submitted 116 nominations to the Senate for full-time positions in executive departments. Of these 116 nominations, 90 were confirmed, 11 were withdrawn, and 15 were returned to him in accordance with Senate rules. For those nominations that were confirmed, a mean (average) of 151.4 days elapsed between nomination and confirmation. The median number of days elapsed was 131.5. Information for this report was compiled using the Senate nominations database of the Legislative Information System (LIS) http://www.lis.gov/nomis/, the Congressional Record (daily edition), the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents, telephone discussions with agency officials, agency websites, the United States Code, and the 2012 Plum Book (United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions).
