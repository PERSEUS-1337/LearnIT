    "content": "States have primary responsibility for administering child welfare funds. However, the federal government provides substantial child welfare funding that is contingent on states meeting certain program requirements. The greatest part of federal assistance dedicated to child welfare is included in Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Programs authorized under these parts of the law provide funds for a range of child welfare services, from family support and preservation to foster care, adoption support and independent living. State compliance with the plan requirements of Title IV-E and Title IV-B is determined primarily via the Child and Family Services Review, (which is authorized by Section 1123A of the Social Security Act). Separately, under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), states receive funds to improve their child protective service systems; to develop and support community-based programs that support and strengthen families to prevent child abuse and neglect; and to improve the handling, investigation, and prosecution of child maltreatment cases. The 109 th Congress saw the enactment of six bills that amended federal child welfare policies in Title IV-B or Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. S. 1894 ( P.L. 109-113 ) and S. 1932 ( P.L. 109-171 ) changed program eligibility rules for the federal Title IV-E foster care and adoption assistance programs. Each of the remaining bills added to or otherwise amended the Title IV-B or Title IV-E state plan requirements. Under the Title IV-B programs, states are now required (or will be on a specified effective date) to (1) develop standards for the frequency and content of caseworker visits to children in foster care; (2) limit total funds spent for administrative purposes to no more than 10% of the program spending; (3) describe how they consult with medical professionals to assess the health and well-being of foster children and determine their appropriate treatment; (4) have procedures in place to respond to a disaster and to maintain child welfare services at such a time; and (5) to report on the actual use of federal funds received under Title IV-B ( S. 3525 , P.L. 109-288 ). Changes made to the Title IV-E Foster Care and Adoption Assistance programs require all states to (1) establish procedures for the \"orderly and timely interstate placement of children,\" including compliance with specific time frames for conducting home studies requested prior to an interstate placement and for making a decision about the placement ( H.R. 5403 , P.L. 109-239 ); (2) comply with expanded federal procedures to check the criminal records of prospective foster or adoptive parents (as well as primarily civil child abuse and neglect registries) before approving placement of any foster child in a home ( H.R. 4472 , P.L. 109-248 ); and (3) have procedures for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of all children in foster care ( H.R. 6111 , P.L. 109-432 ). This report summarizes changes made in the 109 th Congress and then categorizes and describes state program requirements (and related definitions) linked to dedicated federal child welfare funds. As a whole, these program requirements constitute federal child welfare policy, and are the fundamental basis on which state conformity with federal law is based. This report will be updated as significant program requirement changes are enacted."
