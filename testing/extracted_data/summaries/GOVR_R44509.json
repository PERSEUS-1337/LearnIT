    "content": "The mediums through which Members and constituents communicate have changed significantly over American history and continue to evolve today. Whereas most communications traditionally occurred through the media, via postal mail, or over a telephone, the adoption and use of electronic communications via email and social media technologies (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and other sites) changes how Representatives and Senators disseminate and gather information, who they communicate with, and what types of information they share and receive from the general public, many not residing in their district or state. In less than 20 years, the entire nature of Member-constituent communication has been transformed, perhaps more than in any other period in American history. Over the last several years, the number of Representatives and Senators adopting social media and the number of different services being utilized has increased. In 2009, for example, Members of Congress were just beginning to adopt social media and only a small number were actively using Twitter, mostly as a dissemination tool. Today, all 100 Senators and almost all Representatives have adopted Twitter, Facebook, and other social media tools as a way to supplement their overall office communication strategies and disseminate information. Electronic communication and social media differ from traditional Member-constituent communication in three key ways. Electronic communication is inexpensive. Members can reach large numbers of constituents for a fixed cost, and constituents can reach Members at virtually zero cost. Electronic communication is fast. The relay of information from Capitol Hill to the rest of the country (and vice versa) has been reduced, time-wise. As soon as something happens in Congress, it can be known everywhere in real time. Electronic communication reaches a wide audience. Members can reach large numbers of citizens who are not their own constituents. The cost, speed, and reach of social media have wide-ranging implications for the work of Congress. When Members choose to use electronic communication, they must consider many issues, including office operations (communications expectations and staff allocation); communications strategies (gathering and evaluating constituent opinions, content, interactivity, policies for posting and responding to content); and consequences for representation, including whether the office will respond to postings and, if so, how often. How an office evaluates and manages its social media presence varies from Member to Member."
