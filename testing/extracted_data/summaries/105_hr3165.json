Includes within such guidelines: (1) SEC consideration of investor protection, and the promotion of efficiency, competition, and capital formation, (2) SEC consultation with Federal banking agencies. (3) a public file of the record engendered by a proposed accounting principle, and (4) the availability of judicial review."
