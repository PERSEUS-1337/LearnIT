    "title": "SB 1037",
    "content": "Existing law requires the Secretary of Food and Agriculture to maintain quarantine inspection stations. Existing law requires that a sign be conspicuously posted at any inspection station maintained at or near the California border stating that the federal Gun Control Act of 1968 may prohibit persons from bringing firearms into the state that were acquired outside of the state. The bill would require that these inspection station signs also state that California law may prohibit a person from bringing a firearm into the state that was acquired outside of the state. Existing law prescribes the statute of limitations for filing various criminal complaints. This bill would provide that, notwithstanding any other statute of limitation for filing a criminal complaint, the limitation of time would not commence until one year after discovery of of, but in no event later than 5 years after the commission of, the violation for specified offense involving the transfer of firearms, including, among others, violating prohibitions against transferring a firearm to a person who is prohibited from possessing a firearm, and transferring a firearm to a minor or a handgun to a person under 21 years of age, and failing to complete a firearm transfer through a firearms dealer as required. age. Existing law generally regulates the sale and transfer of firearms. Existing law requires a firearms transaction conducted by a firearms dealer to include, among other things, a background check of the purchaser, and certain personal information about the purchaser to be submitted to the department. Existing law requires a firearm transfer between 2 persons, neither of whom are a firearms dealer, to be conducted through a dealer. Similarly, existing law requires a person who imports or transports a firearm into this state that was obtained outside of the state to have the firearm delivered to a dealer for delivery to that person. This bill would provide a return process for firearms obtained under the circumstances described above and in violation of the requirement that a firearms dealer conduct the transfer. The bill would require the owner of the firearm to deliver the firearm to a firearms dealer, who would report taking possession of the firearm to the department, and would require the firearm to be returned to the prior owner after a background check and other requirements that apply to a firearms transaction conducted by a dealer have been met. A violation of these provisions by a dealer would be a misdemeanor. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would make conforming changes to other provisions of law relating to records of firearms transactions kept by the department and a firearms dealer. The bill would, for firearms complying with those return provisions, make conforming changes to other provisions of law that provide exceptions from various prohibitions, including, among others, exceptions to the prohibition against carrying a concealed firearm, to the prohibition against openly carrying a firearm, and to carrying a firearm that is not a handgun in public. The bill would, for firearms returned pursuant to the return provisions, also make exceptions to other provisions of law requiring firearm safety devices, firearm safety certificates, and regulating unsafe handguns. Existing law makes it a crime for a person, corporation, or firm to sell, loan, or transfer a firearm to a minor or sell a handgun to an individual under 21 years of age. Existing law makes it a crime for a firearms dealer to supply, deliver, or give possession or control of a handgun to any person under 21 years of age, or any other firearm to a person under 18 years of age. Existing law makes these crimes punishable as a misdemeanor, except that in the case of a handgun the crimes are punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony, as specified. This bill would make these crimes punishable as a misdemeanor or felony, as specified, in the case of a centerfire semiautomatic rifle. Existing law, subject to exceptions, requires a firearms dealer to comply with certain requirements when delivering a firearm to a person, including, among others, that the firearm is not delivered within 10 days of the application to purchase and is not delivered to a person that the Department of Justice has notified the dealer is prohibited from receiving a firearm. Existing law makes a violation of these provisions a misdemeanor, except that in the case of a handgun the violation is a misdemeanor or a felony, as specified. This bill would make a violation of those provisions, in the case of a centerfire semiautomatic rifle, punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony, as specified. By creating new crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing law requires reports of ownership be filed within certain grace periods for firearms brought or imported into the state by a personal firearms importer or licensed collector. Existing law makes a violation of these provisions a misdemeanor. This bill would make a violation of those provisions, in the case of a handgun, punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony. By increasing the penalty for an existing offense, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would provide that the violations of failing to process a firearms transaction through a dealer when neither party to the transaction is a dealer, and of importing a firearm without it going to a dealer for delivery to the importer would not apply if the only evidence of the violation arises because of information supplied to the Department of Justice in connection with the return process described above. Existing law prohibits a person, corporation, or dealer from acquiring a firearm for the purpose of selling, loaning, or transferring the firearm if the dealer has the intent to transfer the firearm to a minor or to evade specified requirements on the transfer of firearms, or in the case of a person, if the person intends to violate the requirement that the transaction be conducted through a licensed firearms dealer. A violation of these provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony. This bill would similarly prohibit a person, corporation, or dealer from transporting a firearm or bringing a firearm into this state for the purpose of selling, loaning, or transferring the firearm with the intent specified above. By expanding the definition of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
