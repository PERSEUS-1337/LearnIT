Existing law requires a home improvement contract to contain, as specified, a notice stating that the owner or tenant has the right to require the contractor to have a performance and payment bond. The bill would require the board to establish through regulation requirements for a contractor to maintain a blanket performance and payment bond for the purpose of solar installation. Existing law prohibits the downpayment for a home improvement contract from exceeding $1,000 or 10 of the contract amount, whichever is less. Existing law exempts from this restriction a contractor who, among other things, furnishes a blanket performance and payment bond. The bill would subject a contractor for the installation of a solar energy system to the restriction despite having those performance and payment arrangements."
