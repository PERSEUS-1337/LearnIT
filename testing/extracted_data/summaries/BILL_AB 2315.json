    "title": "AB 2315",
    "content": "Existing law provides generally for procedures governing civil actions. Existing law imposes additional procedures that apply with respect to limited types of civil actions. This bill would enact the Asbestos Tort Claim Trust Transparency Act, which would establish additional procedures with respect to civil actions pertaining to asbestos tort claims, as defined. The bill would, among other things, require, that a plaintiff disclose specified information with respect to any asbestos trusts, as defined, against which the plaintiff has or could pursue a claim, and would entitle a defendant to discover relevant information pertaining to the plaintiff held by other asbestos trusts and to pursue various motions. This bill would require a plaintiff to serve certain statements made under penalty of perjury. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
