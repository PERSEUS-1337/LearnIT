    "content": "President Obama's budget request for FY2013 included $140.820 billion for research and development (R&D), a $1.951 billion (1.4%) increase from the FY2012 estimated funding level of $138.869 billion. The FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-6), signed into law on March 26, 2013, provided year-long appropriations to all agencies for FY2013. The law included divisions incorporating five of the regular appropriations bills\u2014Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies; Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies; Department of Defense; Department of Homeland Security; and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies\u2014and included continuing appropriations for agencies covered under the other regular appropriations bills. Agency appropriations were subject to one or more rescissions as well as sequestration. For several agencies, research and development (R&D) funding is included in accounts with non-R&D activities. For such agencies, unless Congress provides funding at the full request level as requested, it is not possible to know the agency's R&D funding level. In such cases, the funding level may not be known until it is included in the President's FY2015 budget request and/or agency budget justifications. When final appropriations are not resolved until after the President's next fiscal year budget request is prepared (as was the case for FY2013 appropriations and the President's FY2014 request) funding for agency R&D may not be known until the subsequent year's budget request. However, some agencies may opt to provide funding estimates, publicly or privately (for example, in response to a CRS inquiry). Determination of funding levels can be complicated by a number of factors, including rescissions, sequestration, supplemental funding, transfers, and reprogramming. Agency analyses in this report use the most current information available at the time this report was published. Funding for R&D is highly concentrated in a few departments. Under President Obama's FY2013 budget request, seven federal agencies would have received 95.8% of total federal R&D funding, the largest among them being the Department of Defense (50.6%) and the Department of Health and Human Services (22.3%, primarily for the National Institutes of Health). Among the largest changes proposed in the President's request, the R&D budget of the Department of Defense would have fallen by $1.535 billion (2.1%), while R&D funding for the Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) would have increased by $1.329 billion. The proposed NIST growth was fueled by increases in funding for its core research laboratories and by the establishment of two new initiatives: $1 billion for the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation, which seeks to promote the development of manufacturing technologies with broad applications, and $300 million for a Wireless Innovation (WIN) Fund to help develop cutting-edge technologies for public safety users. President Obama also requested increases in the R&D budgets of NIST, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science that were targeted for doubling over 7 years, from their FY2006 levels, by the America COMPETES Act, and over 11 years by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. The funding requested for FY2013 was consistent with a doubling timeframe of 17 years, much longer than authorized by either act. The President's budget request sought support for three multi-agency R&D initiatives in FY2013: $1.766 billion for the National Nanotechnology Initiative, an increase of $70 million (4.1%) over FY2012; $3.807 billion for the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development program, an increase of $69 million (1.8%); and $2.633 billion for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, an increase of $136 million (5.6%)."
