    "content": "April 1, 2020, will mark the official date of the 24 th U.S. decennial census. Mandated by the Constitution and federal law, the census is considered a cornerstone of the nation's representative democracy. Nevertheless, an enumeration that is complete and accurate is difficult to achieve. Among other challenges, the census is often misunderstood, mischaracterized, feared, or avoided. This report addresses common questions concerning the 2020 census. The report is intended to provide information about the census, including clarifying various aspects of the census process. Among the topics covered are the origin and purpose of the census; the dates of key census activities; what the Census Bureau has done to promote the enumeration and gain cooperation with it, such as background research on hard-to-count groups and areas, and outreach to them and the broader public through a $500 million communications strategy that includes paid advertising; what basic data the census will collect, largely about how many people live in each household; each person's sex, age, birthdate, race, Hispanic or non-Hispanic ethnicity, and relationship to the person filling out the census form; and whether the housing unit is owned or rented; what information, the Census Bureau has explained, the census never collects, including Social Security numbers, bank or credit card account information, money, or anything on behalf of a political party; why people who consider themselves to be of Middle Eastern or North African race or ethnicity will not be able to report themselves as such on the census questionnaire; clarification that the census will not include a citizenship, nationality, immigration, or other related question; how the Census Bureau will collect detailed socioeconomic and housing data separately from the census; clarification that people have several different options for answering the census\u00e2\u0080\u0094online, on paper, or by telephone\u00e2\u0080\u0094even though online responses are officially most encouraged; language support for the census, including online questionnaires in English and 12 non-English languages, Census Questionnaire Assistance by telephone in the same languages and through a telecommunications device for the deaf, and language guides in 59 non-English languages that will be available in video, standard and large print, braille, and American Sign Language; legal requirement to answer the census and possible $5,000 penalty for nonresponse or false answers; clarification that people must respond to the 2020 census even if they participated in the 2018 or 2019 census tests; the process for updating the Master Address File, the basis for contacting the population about the start of the census and following up with nonrespondents; how and when people can become employed as temporary 2020 census workers, what the requirements are for being hired, and what this work can offer to employees; how the public can identify census workers to be sure that they are legitimate; and legal and cybersecurity protections for confidential census information."
