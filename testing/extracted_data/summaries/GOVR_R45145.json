This report describes the federal tax structure and system in effect for 2018, incorporating these recent changes. The report also provides selected statistics on the tax system as a whole. Historically, the largest component of the federal tax system, in terms of revenue generated, has been the individual income tax. For fiscal year (FY) 2018, an estimated $1.7 trillion, or 50% of the federal government's revenue, will be collected from the individual income tax. The corporate income tax is estimated to generate another $218 billion in revenue in FY2018, or just under 7% of total revenue. Social insurance or payroll taxes will generate an estimated $1.2 trillion, or 35% of revenue in FY2018. For 2018, it is estimated that revenues will be 16.7% of GDP, slightly below the post-World War II average of 17.2% of GDP. The largest source of revenue for the federal government is the individual income tax. The federal individual income tax is levied on an individual's taxable income, which is adjusted gross income (AGI) less deductions. Tax rates based on filing status (e.g., married filing jointly, head of household, or single individual) determine the amount of tax liability. Income tax rates in the United States are generally progressive, such that higher levels of income are typically taxed at higher rates. Once tentative tax liability is calculated, tax credits can be used to reduce tax liability. Tax deductions and tax credits are tools available to policymakers to increase or decrease the after-tax price of undertaking specific activities. Individuals with high levels of deductions and credits relative to income may be required to pay the alternative minimum tax (AMT). The federal government also levies taxes on corporations, wage earnings, and certain other goods. Corporate taxable income is also subject to tax at a flat rate of 21%. Social Security and Medicare tax rates are, respectively, 12.4% and 2.9% of earnings. In 2018, Social Security taxes are levied on the first $128,400 of wages. Medicare taxes are assessed against all wage income. Federal excise taxes are levied on specific goods, such as transportation fuels, alcohol, and tobacco. Looking at the tax system as a whole, several observations can be made. Notably, the composition of revenues has changed over time. Corporate income tax revenues have become a smaller share of overall tax revenues over time, while social insurance revenues have trended upward as a share of total revenues. Social insurance revenues are a sizable component of the overall federal tax system. Most taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes. Many taxpayers pay social insurance taxes but do not pay individual income taxes, having incomes below the amount that would generate a positive income tax liability. From an international perspective, the U.S. federal tax system tends to collect less in federal revenues as a percentage of GDP than other OECD countries."
