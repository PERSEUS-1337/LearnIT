    "content": "Medicaid Community Attendant Services Act of 1997 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to provide for Medicaid coverage of qualified community-based attendant services for any individual entitled to nursing facility or intermediate care facility services. Limits such services to those furnished to an individual in a home or community-based setting, which may include a school, workplace, or recreating or religious facility, but not a nursing facility, an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded, or other institutional facility. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) review existing Medicaid regulations for home health services and other services in home and community-based settings. (2) report to the Congress on how excessive utilization of medical services can be reduced under Medicaid by using qualified community-based attendant services. (3) develop a functional needs assessment instrument with respect to an individual's need for such services. And (4) establish a task force to examine appropriate methods for financing long-term care services. Amends SSA title XIX to allow States to waive certain income limitations with respect to Medicaid payments to individuals eligible for medical assistance who are also eligible for or already receiving a State supplementary payment. Allows such a waiver in such cases as the State finds the potential for employment opportunities would be enhanced through the provision of qualified community-based attendant services. Allows the State, in the case of such an individual made eligible for medical assistance because of such a waiver, to impose a premium based on a sliding scale relating to income."
