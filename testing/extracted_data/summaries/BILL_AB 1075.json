    "title": "AB 1075",
    "content": "The Hazardous Waste Control Law regulates the use and disposal of hazardous waste and authorizes the Department of Toxic Substances Control to deny, suspend, or revoke any permit, registration, or certificate applied for, or issued to, a person or entity if that person or entity engaged in specified activities in violation of the Hazardous Waste Control Law or other laws. This bill would require the department to consider, except under specified circumstances, 3 or more violations of, or noncompliance with, specified provisions for which a person or entity has been found liable or has been convicted, with respect to a single hazardous waste facility within a 5-year period, as compelling cause to deny, suspend, or revoke a permit, registration, or certificate applied for by, or issued to, that person or entity. Existing law authorizes the department to temporarily suspend any permit, registration, or certificate prior to a hearing if the department determines that action is necessary to prevent or mitigate an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or safety or the environment. Existing law requires the department, upon receipt of a notice of defense to the accusation from the holder of the permit, registration, or certificate, to set the matter for hearing within 15 days and to hold the hearing as soon as possible, but not later than 30 days after receipt of the notice. Existing law requires the hearing to be held without delay and completed as soon as possible. This bill would instead authorize the department to temporarily suspend any permit, registration, or certificate prior to a hearing if the department determines that conditions may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or safety or the environment. The bill would repeal the requirement that the hearing be held without delay and completed as soon as possible. Existing law provides for the imposition of civil and criminal penalties upon persons who violate the requirements of the hazardous waste control law or take other actions with regard to the handling of hazardous waste. This bill would impose, upon a person who is subject to the imposition of those civil or criminal penalties, an additional civil penalty of not less than $5,000 or more than $50,000 for each day of each violation, if the person has been found liable for, or been convicted of, 2 or more previous violations of certain of these hazardous waste-related provisions within any consecutive 60 months."
