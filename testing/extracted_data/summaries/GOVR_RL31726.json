    "content": "The Latin American and Caribbean region has made enormous strides over the past two decades in political development, with all countries but Cuba having regular free and fair elections for headof state. But several nations have faced considerable challenges that have threatened politicalstability, including economic decline and rising poverty, violent guerrilla conflicts, drug trafficking,and increasing crime. Bush Administration officials maintain that U.S. policy toward Latin America has three overarching goals: strengthening security; promoting democracy and good governance; andstimulating economic development. Some observers argue that the Administration has not beenpaying enough attention to the region and to instability in several countries. They maintain that theUnited States, faced with other pressing foreign policy problems like the war in Iraq and the globalanti-terrorist campaign, has fallen back to a policy of benign neglect of the region. In contrast, othersmaintain that the United States has an active policy toward Latin America and point to theconsiderable assistance and support provided to Colombia and its neighbors as they combat drugtrafficking and terrorist groups. They also point to the momentum toward free trade in the regionthrough negotiation of numerous free trade agreements, and to increased bilateral and regionalcooperation on security issues. Congressional attention to Latin America in the 108th Congress continued to focus on counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism efforts in the Andean region, trade issues, and potentialthreats to democracy and stability. U.S. counter-narcotics efforts focused on continuation of theAndean Counterdrug Initiative supporting Colombia and its neighbors in their struggle against drugtrafficking and drug-financed terrorist groups. With regard to trade, Congress approvedimplementing legislation for a bilateral free trade agreement with Chile in July 2003; the UnitedStates signed a combined U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement(DR-CAFTA) on August 5, 2004, but Congress did not consider implementing legislation before theend of the 108th Congress. Congress also paid increased attention to economic, social, and politicaltensions in South America that threatened democratic order, particularly in the Andean region. Inthe Caribbean, Haiti's persistent poverty and political instability remained a congressional concern,as did assistance to Haiti and other Caribbean nations in the aftermath of devastating damageincurred by hurricanes and storms in 2004. Congress also continued to debate the appropriate U.S.policy approach to Cuba, the region's only holdout to democracy, as it did for the past several years. Finally, Congress maintained an active interest in neighboring Mexico, with a myriad of trade,migration, border and drug trafficking issues dominating bilateral relations. This report examines issues in U.S. policy toward Latin America and the Caribbean in the 108th Congress. It reflects final actions of the 108th Congress and will not be updated.
