    "title": "AB 1345",
    "content": "Existing law requires the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to implement various fire prevention programs in the state and to provide fire suppression service in the event of wildfires in forest resources and timberlands. The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases. The state board is required to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 to be achieved by 2020. The act authorizes the state board to include the use of market-based compliance mechanisms. Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the state board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of a market-based compliance mechanism to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and to be available upon appropriation. This bill would require the state board, in consultation with the department, no later than January 1, 2017, to estimate the annual greenhouse gas emissions associated with wildfires in California between the years 1990 and 2015, inclusive. The bill would require the state board to develop, no later than January 1, 2017, an emissions baseline for wildfires by calculating the average of the annual greenhouse gas emissions associated with wildfires between the years 1990 and 2015, inclusive. The bill would require the state board and the department to annually approximate, no later than July 1, 2017, and every year thereafter, the greenhouse gas emissions associated with wildfires during the prior calendar year. This bill, beginning with the 2016\u201317 fiscal year, would continuously appropriate $100,000,000 to the department from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for specified activities that have the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by preventing the incidence of and reducing the intensity of catastrophic wildfires. This bill would require the department, no later than July 1, 2017, after one or more specified public workshops, to develop and begin implementation of strategies to reduce by 2035 the preceding 5-year average of greenhouse gas emissions associated with wildfires by 20 percent below the greenhouse gas emissions baseline described above."
