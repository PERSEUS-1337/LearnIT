    "content": "The 9/11 Commission found that al Qaeda operatives exploited known weaknesses in U.S.aviation security to carry out the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. While legislation andadministration actions after September 11, 2001 were implemented to strengthen aviation security,the 9/11 Commission concluded that several weaknesses continue to exist. These include perceivedvulnerabilities in cargo and general aviation security as well as inadequate screening and accesscontrols at airports. The 9/11 Commission issued several recommendations designed to strengthen aviationsecurity by: enhancing passenger pre-screening; improving measures to detect explosives onpassengers; addressing human factors issues at screening checkpoints; expediting deployment ofin-line baggage screening systems; intensifying efforts to identify, track, and screen potentiallydangerous cargo; and deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft. In addition to thesespecific recommendations, an overarching recommendation for transportation security policy assertsthat priorities should be set based on risk, and the most practical and cost effective deterrents shouldbe implemented assigning appropriate roles and missions to federal, state, and local authorities, aswell as private stakeholders. In response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, the National Intelligence ReformAct of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ; 118 Stat. 3638) was enacted on December 17, 2004. The act containsnumerous aviation security provisions, many of which address 9/11 Commission recommendationsrelated to aviation safety. These provisions build upon prior aviation security-related provisions,contained in Vision 100 - the Century of Aviation Reathorization Act ( P.L. 108-176 ; 117 Stat. 2490)that was enacted a year earlier on December 12, 2003, addressing many of the concerns expressedby the 9/11 Commission. This report will not be updated."
