    "content": "This report offers an overview of actions taken by Congress and the President to provide FY2018 appropriations for accounts funded by the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (LHHS) appropriations bill. This bill includes all accounts funded through the annual appropriations process at the Departments of Labor (DOL) and Education (ED). It also provides annual appropriations for most agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with certain exceptions (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration is funded via the Agriculture bill). Finally, the LHHS bill provides funds for more than a dozen related agencies, including the Social Security Administration (SSA). FY2018 Rescissions Proposal: On May 8, 2018, the Trump Administration submitted to Congress a proposal for rescissions of budget authority totaling $15.8 billion. The proposal included a number of LHHS-related rescissions of both mandatory and discretionary funding. After it was introduced as H.R. 3, this proposal passed the House on June 7, 2018, but has not been taken up by the Senate as of the date of this report. FY2018 Omnibus: On March 23, 2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2018 (H.R. 1625, P.L. 115-141) was enacted, providing LHHS appropriations in Division H. FY2018 LHHS discretionary appropriations totaled $186.5 billion (excluding emergency-designated amounts provided by an earlier supplemental appropriations act for FY2018). This amount is 7.6% more than FY2017 levels and 25.3% more than the FY2018 budget request from the Trump Administration. The omnibus also provided $817.5 billion in mandatory funding, for a combined FY2018 LHHS total of $1.004 trillion. The distribution of discretionary funding is as follows: DOL: $12.2 billion, 1.1% more than FY2017. HHS: $88.2 billion, 12.8% more than FY2017. ED: $70.9 billion, 3.9% more than FY2017. Related Agencies: $15.3 billion, 2.8% more than FY2017. FY2018 Supplemental Appropriations: On February 9, 2018, supplemental appropriations to address the 2017 hurricane season and a series of deadly wildfires in California were enacted as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. In total, $4.0 billion in emergency-designated appropriations for accounts and purposes traditionally associated with the LHHS appropriations bill were enacted for accounts at DOL, HHS, and ED. The FY2018 enacted totals presented throughout this report do not include these emergency funds. FY2018 Continuing Resolutions: Prior to the enactment of the omnibus, FY2018 appropriations were provided by five continuing resolutions (CRs): P.L. 115-56, P.L. 115-90, P.L. 115-96, P.L. 115-120, and P.L. 115-123. Government-wide funding was interrupted between the third and fourth CR due to a funding gap that commenced on January 20, 2018, and ended on January 22, 2018. With limited exceptions, the FY2018 CRs generally funded discretionary LHHS programs at FY2017 levels minus a reduction of about two-thirds of one percent (-0.6791%). FY2018 LHHS House Action: The House Appropriations Committee's version of the FY2018 LHHS appropriations bill was ordered reported by the full committee on July 19, 2017, by a vote of 28-22, and reported to the House on July 24 (H.R. 3358). This bill would have provided $168.9 billion in discretionary LHHS funds, a 2.6% decrease from FY2017 enacted levels. This amount is 13.4% more than the FY2018 President's request. In addition, the House committee bill would have provided an estimated $817.4 billion in mandatory funding, for a combined total of $986.3 billion for LHHS as a whole. The distribution of discretionary funding was as follows: DOL: $10.6 billion, 12.6% less than FY2017. HHS: $77.6 billion, 0.7% less than FY2017. ED: $66.0 billion, 3.2% less than FY2017. Related Agencies: $14.7 billion, 1.1% less than FY2017. The House committee-reported version of the LHHS bill (H.R. 3358) did not receive floor consideration, but the text of this measure (with minor alterations) was included in an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 3354) that was amended on the floor and passed by the House on September 14, 2017. Comprehensive figures that account for the budgetary effects of the LHHS-related floor amendments to H.R. 3354 are generally not available. As a result, this report does not present funding levels from this House-passed measure. However, Appendix B includes a discussion of the LHHS-related amendments that were offered during floor consideration of H.R. 3354. This measure was not taken up in the Senate. FY2018 LHHS Senate Action: The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of the FY2018 LHHS appropriations bill on September 7, 2017, by a vote of 29-2 (S. 1771). This bill would have provided $174.4 billion in discretionary LHHS funds. This is 0.6% more than FY2017, and 17.2% more than the FY2018 President's request. In addition, the Senate committee bill would have provided an estimated $817.4 billion in mandatory funding, for a combined total of $991.9 billion for LHHS as a whole. The distribution of discretionary funding was as follows: DOL: $12.0 billion, 0.5% less than FY2017. HHS: $79.8 billion, 2.1% more than FY2017. ED: $68.3 billion, 0.04% more than FY2017. Related Agencies: $14.4 billion, 3.6% less than FY2017. FY2018 President's Budget Request: On May 23, 2017, the Trump Administration released the FY2018 President's budget. The President requested $148.9 billion in discretionary funding for accounts funded by the LHHS bill, which is a decrease of 14.1% from FY2017 levels. In addition, the President requested $815.8 billion in annually appropriated mandatory funding, for a total of $964.7 billion for the LHHS bill as a whole. The distribution of discretionary funding was as follows: DOL: $9.7 billion, 19.4% less than FY2017. HHS: $63.0 billion, 19.3% less than FY2017. ED: $62.9 billion, 7.8% less than FY2017. Related Agencies: $13.2 billion, 11.1% less than FY2017."
