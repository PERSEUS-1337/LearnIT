    "content": "Federal Judiciary Emergency Special Sessions Act of 2005 - Allows federal circuit courts of appeals, district courts, bankruptcy courts, and magistrate judges to hold special sessions outside their circuits or districts upon a finding by a chief judge or judicial council that, because of emergency conditions, no location within the courts' regular circuits or districts is reasonably available. Authorizes such courts to transact any business, except certain district court criminal proceedings, at a special session outside their circuits or districts which they might transact at a regular session. Requires special session courts, through the Administrative Office of the US Courts, to notify the Judiciary Committees of Congress of any order issued in a special session. Requires the Administrative Office to report to such congressional committees describing the reasons for the issuance of a special session order, the duration of such order, the impact of such order on litigants, and the costs to the judiciary resulting from such order. Requires special session courts to provide reasonable notice to the US Marshals Service before the commencement of any special session. Prohibits a criminal trial from being conducted at a special session outside the state in which the crime was committed unless the defendant consents. Restricts criminal jury pools to the district in which a crime was committed unless the defendant consents to be tried by jurors from the district in which the trial court is holding a special session."
