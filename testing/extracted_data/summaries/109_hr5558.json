    "title": "To amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to provide more effective permitting and enforcement mechanisms for stormwater discharges associated with residential construction activity.",
    "content": "Stormwater Enforcement and Permitting Act of 2006 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to require the owner or operator of any point source to provide information necessary to address an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or welfare or the environment. Requires the Administrator to provide an operator a reasonable opportunity to correct a violation of a permit condition for a site with residential construction activity before initiation of an enforcement action, if such violation has not resulted in a discharge of stormwater. Prohibits more than one opportunity to correct violations of the same condition. Prohibits the Administrator from requiring a permit for stormwater runoff from such a site if: (1) the runoff enters a municipal separate storm sewer system that is covered by a permit and the operator is in compliance with runoff requirements. And (2) such site has minimal potential for soil erosion. Prohibits the Administrator from exercising enforcement authority with respect to a state permit that authorizes stormwater discharge from such a site unless: (1) such a discharge flows across a state line or onto a federal facility or Indian tribal lands. (2) such permit was issued under a state program that the Administrator has suspended or withdrawn. Or (3) a discharge results in imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or welfare or the environment. Prohibits the Administrator from paying any state penalty for a violation of a permit for such a discharge. Requires the Administrator to establish a program that will develop and distribute to site operators a pamphlet that explains permitting requirements for stormwater discharges. Authorizes the Administrator or the state to issue a general permit for no more than five years on a state, regional, or nationwide basis to cover any category of discharges, sludge use, disposal practices, or facilities. Declares that the Administrator or state is not required to review, approve, or provide an opportunity for public comment on any application for a discharge under a general permit."
