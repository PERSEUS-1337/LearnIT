    "content": "Ebola Emergency Response Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that: the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa poses severe health, economic, and security threats to the affected countries, the United States, and the broader international community. And the whole-of-government response taken by the United States provides capabilities critical to helping contain Ebola in West Africa. Yet the United States alone will not succeed in containing it. Directs the President to: coordinate with the governments of affected African countries, the private sector, regional and international financial institutions and international organizations, civil society, and nongovernmental organizations to implement a comprehensive Ebola control strategy and assist affected populations. And use US influence at the United Nations (U. N.) to ensure that the U. N. Mission in Liberia is protecting individuals under its care and playing an active emergency response role, and ensuring that the U. N. Mission for the Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) is playing an effective role in aligning donors around a plan to detect, contain, treat, and deter Ebola's further spread. Authorizes the President to provide specified emergency assistance to countries directly affected by or at imminent risk of being affected by the Ebola outbreak. Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should work with other donors, including international financial institutions, to encourage them to: (1) help the governments of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone mitigate the risks of economic collapse and related civil unrest by providing access to emergency grants and financing tools to address fiscal issues that are the direct result of the Ebola crisis, and (2) assist with post-crisis economic recovery."
