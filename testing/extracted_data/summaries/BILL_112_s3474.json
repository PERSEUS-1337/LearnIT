    "content": "Protecting Students from Worthless Degrees Act - Makes any institution of higher education (IHE) postsecondary program designed to prepare students for a recognized occupation or profession requiring licensing or other entry pre-conditions ineligible to participate in a federal financial assistance program, unless it meets specified student consumer protection requirements. Requires each program to: (1) fully prepare students to satisfy those entry pre-conditions in the state in which the program is operated and in any state the program claims a successful program graduate will be prepared to work in the particular occupation or profession involved. (2) provide timely placement of students in required pre-licensure positions, such as internships or apprenticeships. And (3) meet specialized state accreditation requirements, or notify students if the program has not yet been fully accredited. Requires an IHE to notify out-of-state applicants as to whether or not its program satisfies the requirements of the applicant's state."
