Or (2) in any case in which the burden affects, or in which removal of the burden would affect, international or interstate commerce or commerce with Indian tribes. Allows a substantial burden if the government demonstrates that it is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest.

And (2) the State regarding any other element of the claim.

Prohibits a State from: (1) imposing a land use regulation in a way that does not treat religious assemblies or institutions on equal terms with nonreligious assemblies or institutions. (2) imposing a land use regulation that discriminates against any assembly or institution on the basis of religion or religious denomination. Or (3) unreasonably excluding or limiting from a jurisdiction assemblies or institutions principally devoted to religious exercise.

(4) authorize a government to regulate or affect, directly or indirectly, the activities or policies of a person other than a government as a condition of receiving funding or other assistance.

Redefines exercise of religion to mean any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by or central to a system of religious belief, including: (1) the use, building, or converting of real property for religious exercise.
