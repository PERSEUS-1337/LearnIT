    "content": "Nowadays deep learning is one of the main topics in almost every field. It helped to get amazing results in a great number of tasks. The main problem is that this kind of learning and consequently neural networks, that can be defined deep, are resource intensive. They need specialized hardware to perform a computation in a reasonable time. Unfortunately, it is not sufficient to make deep learning \"usable\" in real life. Many tasks are mandatory to be as much as possible real-time. So it is needed to optimize many components such as code, algorithms, numeric accuracy and hardware, to make them \"efficient and usable\". All these optimizations can help us to produce incredibly accurate and fast learning models."
