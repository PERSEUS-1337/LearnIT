    "content": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appropriations bill includes funding for all components and functions of DHS, including Customs and Border Protection (CBP); Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); the Transportation Security Administration (TSA); Coast Guard (USCG); Secret Service (USSS); the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), which includes Infrastructure Protection and Information Security (IPIS) and the Federal Protective Service (FPS); the Office of Health Affairs (OHA); the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS); the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC); the Science and Technology directorate (S&T); the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO); departmental management, Analysis and Operations (A&O), and the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). For FY2013, the Administration requested $39.510 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS, as part of an overall budget of $59.501 billion (including fees, trust funds, and other funding that is not appropriated or does not score against the budget caps). H.R. 5855, the House-passed DHS appropriations bill in the 112th Congress, would have provided $39.114 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, while S. 3126, its Senate-reported counterpart in the 112th Congress, would have provided $39.514 billion. Congress did not enact final FY2013 appropriations legislation prior to the end of FY2012. From October 1, 2012, through March 26, 2013, the federal government (including DHS) operated under the terms of P.L. 112-175, a part-year continuing resolution. While operating under this resolution, two major events impacted the DHS budget. First, Hurricane Sandy struck the east coast of the United States, which started a legislative process that resulted in enactment of legislation that provided $50.7 billion in disaster relief and emergency appropriations, including $12.072 billion for DHS, and $9.7 billion in additional borrowing authority for the National Flood Insurance Program. Weeks later, On March 1, 2013, an across-the-board reduction in budget authority, or sequestration, was ordered as required under the terms of the Budget Control Act (P.L. 112-25). The Office of Management and Budget's sequestration report indicated that DHS would lose $3.191 billion as a result of sequestration. On March 26, 2013, the President signed into law P.L. 113-6, the FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act. Division D of that act is the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2013, which includes $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS. Two across-the-board cuts unrelated to the March 1 sequestration that were included in the final legislation to ensure the bill complies with discretionary budget caps reduced this by $54 million to $39.592 billion. The above enacted funding levels for FY2013 are subject to sequestration cuts. As the federal government was operating under a continuing resolution at the time sequestration was ordered, the final budget impact cannot be authoritatively stated until the Office of Management and Budget provides further information. This report will be updated as events warrant."
