    "content": "Veterans' preference is a system that provides special consideration to certain former members of the Armed Forces who pursue civilian employment with the federal government. This report describes how veterans' preference is established and applied in the assessment and selection of candidates for federal positions that use competitive examination procedures. The specific type of preference for which a veteran qualifies (if any) depends on the timing of the veteran's service and whether or not the veteran has a service-connected disability. The strongest preference is for veterans who have a service-connected disability rated at 30% or greater. In some cases, if a veteran is not able to use his or her preference due to death or disability, a family member may claim derived preference. For federal positions that follow competitive examination procedures, applicants are typically assessed on the basis of their qualifications (e.g., education and experience). The application of veterans' preference depends on the assessment procedure being used. When applicants are assessed using category rating, a process that assigns applicants to quality categories (e.g., minimally qualified, well qualified, and highest qualified), preference is applied by moving an eligible veteran to the top of the category for which he or she qualifies or, in some cases, to the top of the highest quality category. When applicants are assessed using numerical rating, preference is applied by adding extra points to a veteran candidate's assessed score. Veterans' preference also has a role in the selection process. In cases where a preference eligible is among the highest-ranked candidates and therefore eligible for selection, the selecting official must either (1) select the preference eligible or (2) pass over the preference eligible by disqualifying the preference eligible. In FY2016, the most recent year for which data are available, veterans with preference made up 28% of nonseasonal, full-time, permanent federal employees. In recent years, veterans with preference have accounted for a larger portion of new federal hires and the proportion of veterans in the federal workforce has gradually increased. In FY2016, veterans with preference accounted for 37% of nonseasonal, full-time, permanent new hires."
