    "content": "Advanced Energy Initiative Act of 2006 - Instructs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) implement a project to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of advanced clean coal energy technology, including carbon capture and geological sequestration, for electricity generation (FutureGen). And (2) ensure, to the extent practicable, that the project utilizes available advanced clean coal technology, such as coal gasifier technology. Directs the Secretary to implement research and development programs for advanced nuclear fuel cycle technologies for generating electricity and industrial process heat from nuclear power, including spent fuel recycling, waste minimization, and reduction of radioactivity of final waste products. Directs the Secretary to develop a comprehensive modeling and simulation capability to enable a thorough analysis of possible advanced nuclear fuel cycle systems, as well as of more than one possible configuration of an advanced nuclear fuel cycle system using the analytical capability so developed. Requires the Secretary to develop and report to Congress a detailed advanced nuclear fuel cycle system technology plan. Prohibits the Secretary, until 90 days after delivery of such report, from initiating detailed design or construction of any demonstration facility: (1) capable of processing 500 kilograms or more per year of nuclear fuel or spent nuclear fuel. And (2) designed to demonstrate certain advanced nuclear fuel system component technologies. Instructs the Secretary to implement research and development programs for advanced: (1) battery technologies to use in motor vehicles, particularly plug-in hybrids, (2) biofuel technologies, (3) hydrogen storage technologies, (4) solar photovoltaic technologies, and (5) wind energy technologies."
