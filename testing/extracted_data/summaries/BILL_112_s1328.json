    "content": "Strengthening Kids' Interest in Learning and Libraries Act or SKILLS Act - Amends part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to require the inclusion of effective school library programs in school improvement programs. Defines an effective school library program as one that: (1) is staffed by a state sanctioned school librarian, (2) has up-to-date materials and technology, including broadband. (3) includes regular collaboration between teachers and school librarians concerning school reform efforts. And (4) supports the development of digital literacy skills. Replaces the existing program under subpart 4 of part B of title I of the ESEA with a new program awarding competitive three-year grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to develop and enhance effective school library programs. Makes LEAs eligible for such grants only if at least 20 of their students are impoverished. Amends part A of title II of the ESEA to rename part A the Teacher, School Librarian, and Principal Training and Recruiting Fund. Requires states and LEAs to use funds under the program to train school librarians, and recruit and retain highly effective school librarians."
