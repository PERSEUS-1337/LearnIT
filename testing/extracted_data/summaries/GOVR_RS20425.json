    "content": "Congress has passed several laws to provide consumers greater access tolocal network television stations, particularly via satellite. The 1988 Satellite Home Viewer Act (SHVA), amendedin1994, was expanded in 1999 with the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act (SHVIA). SHVIA allows (notrequires) satellite companies to retransmit a local broadcast network signal back into the same localmarket area fromwhich it originates (\"local-into-local\"). Concerned that satellite TV companies do not plan to offer local-into-localinall parts of the country, Congress then passed the Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act(LOCAL). That act creates a loan guarantee program to help ensure that consumers in small and rural marketsreceivelocal network TV stations via satellite or other technologies. This historical report summarizes SHVIA andLOCAL,and the debate over whether a company called Northpoint should be able to use the same frequencies as satellitestotransmit data and television using terrestrial systems. It does not address the 2004 Satellite Home Viewer Extensionand Reauthorization Act (SHVERA). See CRS Report RS21768 instead. This report will not be updated."
