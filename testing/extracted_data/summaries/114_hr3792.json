    "content": "Young Adults Driving Safety Act of 2015 This bill directs the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to award competitive grants of up to $100,000 to non-profit organizations, tribal governments, or educational institutions to develop model programs to assist young adults with obtaining or regaining driver's licenses. A recipient may use grant funds to: conduct a comprehensive assessment of the driver's licensing status of young adults in the neighborhoods to be served. Develop and implement strategies to address licensing deficits and barriers faced by young adults and disconnected youth in obtaining a driver's license. Study the impact of state and local driver's license suspensions and revocation policies on young adults in the areas to be served. Identify potential sources of funding for high school driver's education programs. Develop innovative and cost-effective strategies for preparing young adults for legal driving. And evaluate the effectiveness of the funded grant activities in achieving the program goals. The Department of Transportation (DOT) shall give priority to entities proposing programs to assist low-income young adults with obtaining or regaining driver's licenses. Statewide efforts to improve traffic safety for teen drivers, for which states may use DOT-approved highway safety program funds, shall include peer-to-peer education and prevention strategies in schools and communities designed to support teen driving education and driving skills improvement."
