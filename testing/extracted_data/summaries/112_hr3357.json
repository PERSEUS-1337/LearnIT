    "content": "Child Marriage Violates the Human Rights of Girls Act of 2011 - Defines child marriage as the marriage of a girl or boy not yet the minimum age for marriage stipulated in law in the country in which the girl or boy is a resident, or where there is no such law, under the age of 18. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) child marriage is a violation of human rights and its prevention and elimination should be a US foreign policy goal. And (2) educational opportunities for girls, economic opportunities for women, and reducing maternal and child mortality are critical to US global health and development objectives, including efforts to prevent HIVAIDS. Directs the Secretary of State, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the heads of other relevant departments and agencies to collect and make available data on the incidence of child marriage in specified countries that receive US foreign or development assistance where the practice of child marriage is prevalent. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require that Department of State reports on human rights practices for specified countries include a description of the status of child marriage for each country in which child marriage is prevalent."
