Declares that it should be the duty of the Commission to: (1) conduct a needs assessment in the US-Mexican border area to identify and resolve health problems that affect the general population of the area. (2) coordinate public and private entities to educate the population about, and resolve, such health problems and develop programs to meet needs that are not being met by such persons. And (3) formulate recommendations for a fair method by which the government of one country would reimburse a public or private entity in the other country for the cost of a health care service furnished to a citizen of the first country who is unable to pay for the service."
