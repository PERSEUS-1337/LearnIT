    "title": "SB 890",
    "content": "Existing sales and use tax laws impose taxes on retailers measured by the gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property sold at retail in this state, or on the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property purchased from a retailer for storage, use, or other consumption in this state, and provides various exemptions from the taxes imposed by those laws. The Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law authorizes cities and counties to impose local sales and use taxes in conformity with the Sales and Use Tax Law, and existing law authorizes districts, as specified, to impose transactions and use taxes in accordance with the Transactions and Use Tax Law, which conforms generally to the Sales and Use Tax Law. Exemptions from state sales and use taxes are incorporated into these laws. This bill would exempt from those taxes the gross receipts from the sale of, and the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of, firearms, ammunition, and hunting supplies purchased by an individual in the 2-day period beginning at 12:01 a. m. on the first Saturday in September and ending at midnight the next day and the 2-day period beginning at 12:01 a. m. on the first Saturday in October and ending at midnight the next day, as provided. The bill would specify that this exemption does not apply to local sales and use taxes and transactions and use taxes, and specified state sales and use taxes the proceeds of which are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund, the Local Revenue Fund 2011, the Local Public Safety Fund, and the Education Protection Account. This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy. Existing law establishes a standard form for fire insurance policies in this state. Existing law requires that all fire insurance policies in California be on the standard form, with no additions to that form, except as provided. Existing law prohibits any part of the standard form from being omitted from the policy, except as specified. This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to that provision."
