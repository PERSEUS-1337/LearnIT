    "content": "The 108th Congress did not complete action to reauthorize child care legislation that expiredat the end of FY2002, but funding has continued via a series of temporary measures, and annualappropriations. \"Child care reauthorization\" is composed of two parts: legislation to reauthorize theChild Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act and legislation to extend mandatoryfunding appropriated under Section 418 of the Social Security Act. In February 2003, the House passed a consolidated bill, H.R. 4 , whichencompassed both parts of reauthorization by including provisions that would have addressedmandatory appropriations, discretionary funding authorization levels, and other amendments to theCCDBG Act. The Senate Finance Committee reported its own version of H.R. 4, whichincluded mandatory child care funding, and the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions(HELP) Committee reported a separate bill, S. 880 , which included all provisionspertaining to discretionary funding authorization, and amended the CCDBG Act itself. The fullSenate began consideration of H.R. 4 on March 29, 2004, passing one amendment toit (to increase child care funding), but then failed to resume consideration of the bill. Both versions of H.R. 4 originally proposed to appropriate $2.917 billion inmandatory CCDBG funding for each of fiscal years 2004 through 2008, which would have reflectedan increase of $1 billion over five years above current (FY2002) funding. (The amendment approvedon the Senate floor would have provided an additional $6 billion, on top of the $1 billion.) Discretionary funding levels are authorized within the CCDBG Act, and both the House version ofH.R. 4 and S. 880 proposed to authorize $2.3 billion in FY2004, rising up to$3.1 billion in FY2008. Also of note, H.R. 4 (House) would have allowed states to transferup to 50% of their TANF block grants to the CCDBG (rather than current law's limit of 30%). Both H.R. 4 (House) and S. 880 would have revised and expandedthe CCDBG program goals to include and emphasize school readiness. Of the two bills, S.880 provided the greater detail in terms of defining the skills and development to befostered in efforts to prepare children for school. Both bills included provisions to increase theminimum quality set-aside from 4% to 6%, and to define \"quality activities\" in more detail. Both bills proposed to eliminate the federal eligibility ceiling (85% of state median income);and to place new requirements on state plans to emphasize coordination, consumer education, andprogram quality. S. 880 would have also strengthened requirements (currently only inregulation) that states set provider payment rates in accordance with a recent market rate survey.Other provisions in S. 880 included amending the list of data elements collected on amonthly basis; enhancing security at federal child care facilities, and establishing a small businesschild care grant program. This report provides a side-by-side comparison of the proposed bills, andwill not be updated."
