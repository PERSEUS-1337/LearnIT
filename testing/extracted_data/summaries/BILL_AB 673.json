    "title": "AB 673",
    "content": "Existing law requires a court to transfer the case of a person released on probation or mandatory supervision to the superior court in any other county in which the person resides permanently, unless the transferring court determines the transfer would be inappropriate and states its reasons on the record. Existing law requires the court of the receiving county to accept the entire jurisdiction over the case. This bill would require the receiving court to accept the entire jurisdiction over the case effective the date the transferring court orders the transfer. The bill would provide that when fines, forfeitures, penalties, assessments, or restitution have been ordered by the transferring court and have not been fully paid, those payments would be made to the collecting program for the transferring court for distribution and accounting. The bill would authorize the receiving court and probation department to impose additional local fees and costs, as specified, and would authorize the collection program for the receiving court to collect court-ordered payments from the defendant for transmittal to the collection program for the transferring court, as specified. The bill would require the Judicial Council to consider adoption of rules of court as it deems appropriate to implement the collection, accounting, and disbursement requirements of the bill."
