    "content": "Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to make it out of order in Congress to consider any budget resolution that would: (1) set forth an on-budget deficit for any fiscal year. Or (2) decrease the on-budget surplus below a level of Medicare surplus reserve determined according to a certain formula, except for any portion of such reserve appropriated in new amounts for Medicare prescription drug benefits, or to the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to extend: (1) discretionary spending limits in specified amounts, (2) the pay-as-you-go requirement, (3) the Act itself. And (4) the Social Security firewall. Declares that any legislation that would reduce, reverse, or repeal the transfers to the Trust Funds made by this Act shall not be counted on the pay-as-you-go scorecard and shall not be included in any pay- as-you-go estimates of the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act."
