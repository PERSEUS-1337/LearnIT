    "content": "The clearing process for checks is more expensive than other methods of payment which are cleared electronically, such as credit cards and Internet banking. The main reason is that checkclearing requires banks to physically present and return checks unless they obtain legal agreementsto clear electronically. The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-100 )eliminates the requirement to physically return the original checks to the paying bank. Before thebill by the same title became law, on April 3, 2003, the Senate held its first hearing on the Fed'sCheck Truncation Act (CTA) proposal that was sent to banking committees of both Houses inDecember 2001. On June 5, 2003, the House passed H.R. 1474 and referred it to theSenate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. On June 18, 2003, at a markup, theSenate Banking Committee approved its Check Truncation Act of 2003 ( S. 1334 ) andon June 27, 2003, the full Senate passed S. 1334 and incorporated it in H.R. 1474 . On October 1, 2003, House and Senate conferees reported H.R. 1474 (Conference Report H.Rept. 108-291 ). On October 28, 2003, President Bushsigned the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act ( P.L. 108-100 ) into law, which is now also knownas Check 21 Act. Estimates of cost savings from moving to electronic check clearing vary widely because estimates of the cost of using a check and the number of checks written each year remain in dispute. Consequently, estimates of cost savings range from $1.4 billion annually for truncation alone to $68billion for replacing checks with electronic payments. In testimony at the hearing of Senate andHouse banking committees in the 108th Congress, the Fed's CTA in the Senate and H.R. 1474 in the House were supported by the Federal Reserve Board, which testified that it would liketo remove some of the consumer protection provisions that were in its 2001 proposal because theywere unnecessary. The Fed argued that the regulatory costs these provisions would place on bankswould outweigh the consumer benefits. Still, the bill is supported by America's CommunityBankers, the American Bankers Association, the Consumer Bankers Association, and the FinancialServices Roundtable. The opposition to the Check 21 Act came from the Consumers Union, supported in its testimony by the Consumer Federation of America, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and theNational Consumer Law Center. The Consumers Union argued that the Act would make itimpossible for an estimated 45.8 million U.S. households who are currently getting their paperchecks back to continue to do so. These consumers would be less protected from fraud under theAct than under the existing check clearing process when there are disputes about check payments.The Consumers Union's suggested changes in the proposed legislation would significantly increaseconsumer protection. At the same time, these changes would increase financial institutions' costsof voluntarily adopting check truncation. Other witnesses argued that those banks with decades ofusing truncated checks have not experienced many disputed check payments, and when they did theywere quickly resolved. This report will be updated as legislative and financial developments warrant."
