    "content": "School Security Improvement Act of 1997 - Amends the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to require educational entities to include, in the educational records of students who are children with disabilities and students who are children without disabilities, documentation with regard to disciplinary measures taken against them. Permits the use of long-term disciplinary measures against students who are children with disabilities. Requires continuing provision of educational services to children with disabilities who engage in behavior that violates an educational entity's rules or code of conduct, unless such behavior is not a manifestation of their disabilities, and it is the entity's policy to cease educational services to any child engaged in such behavior. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the Congress should follow through on its original commitment and provide funding for the IDEA State grant program at the level of 40 percent of the national average per-pupil expenditure."
