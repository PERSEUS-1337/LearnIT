    "title": "A bill to direct the Secretary of Education to pay to Fort Lewis College in the State of Colorado an amount equal to the tuition charges for Indian students who are not residents of the State of Colorado.",
    "content": "Requires the Secretary of Education, beginning in FY2011, to pay to Fort Lewis College in Colorado an amount equal to the charges for tuition for enrolled Indian students who are not Colorado residents. Limits the amount paid to Fort Lewis College per fiscal year to an amount equal to the charges for tuition for Indian students who were non-Colorado residents and were enrolled for the academic year 2010-2011. Treats amounts received under this Act as a reimbursement from Colorado to Fort Lewis College for complying with federal law requiring the admission of Indian students at the College free of charge of tuition. Prohibits anything in this Act from being construed as relieving Colorado from reimbursing Fort Lewis College for each academic year: (1) with respect to enrolled Indian students who are not Colorado residents, any amount of the charges for their tuition which exceeds the amount received under this Act. And (2) with respect to enrolled Indian students who are Colorado residents, an amount equal to the charges for their tuition."
