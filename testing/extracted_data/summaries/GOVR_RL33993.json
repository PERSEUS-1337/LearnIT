    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides services and benefits to veterans who meet certain eligibility criteria. VA carries out its programs nationwide through three administrations and the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA). The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is responsible for veterans' health care programs. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) is responsible for providing compensation, pensions, and education assistance, among other things. The National Cemetery Administration's (NCA) responsibilities include maintaining national veterans cemeteries. VHA operates the nation's largest integrated health care system. Unlike most other federal health programs, VHA is a direct service provider rather than a health insurer or payer for health care. VA health care services are generally available to all honorably discharged veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces who are enrolled in VA's health care system. VA has a priority enrollment system that places veterans in priority groups based on various criteria. Under the priority system, VA decides each year whether its appropriations are adequate to serve all enrolled veterans. If not, VA could stop enrolling those in the lowest-priority groups. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. Armed Forces have been deployed in two major theaters of operation. Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) constitute the largest sustained ground combat mission undertaken by the United States since the Vietnam War. Veterans from these conflicts and from previous wars are exerting tremendous stress on the VA health care system. With increased patient workload and rising health care costs, the 110th Congress is focused on such issues as how to contain costs and at the same time maintain high-quality health care services to veterans who need them. Among other things, Congress may address the best method of funding for veterans' health care, while continuing to focus on ensuring a \"seamless transition\" process for servicemembers moving from the military health system into the VA health care system, improving mental health care services for veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and improving rehabilitation and mental health services for those with Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI). In recent years, VA has made an effort to realign its capital assets, primarily its buildings, to better serve veterans' needs. VA established the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) initiative to identify how well the geographic distribution of VA health care resources matches the projected needs of veterans. Given the tremendous interest in the implementation of the CARES initiative in the previous Congress, the 110th Congress will likely continue to monitor the CARES implementation. H.R. 327 was enacted into law (P.L. 110-110) on November 5. The House has passed several measures to improve and expand health care services to veterans: H.R. 327, H.R. 612, H.R. 1315, H.R. 1470, H.R. 2199, H.R. 2623, and H.R. 2874. The Senate VA Committee has reported the following measures: S. 1233, S. 2004, S. 2142, S. 2160, and S. 2162. This report will be updated as legislative activities warrant."
