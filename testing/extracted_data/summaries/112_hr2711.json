    "content": "Seniors Protection Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, for each non-cost-of-living (non-COLA) year, to disburse a cash payment to recipients of Social Security, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) under title XVI of the Social Security Act, railroad retirement benefits, and veterans disability compensation or pension benefits. Defines a non-COLA year as a 12-month period for which: (1) a cost-of-living adjustment is generally provided under the pertinent program in relation to an index. But (2) such an adjustment does not take effect by reason of the performance of that index. Makes $250 the payment for any non-COLA year: (1) ending with or during 2011 or 2011, and (2) any non-COLA year not immediately preceded by another non-COLA year. Makes the payment for any non-COLA year ending after 2011 which is immediately preceded by another non-COLA year the same as the payment for that immediately preceding non-COLA year, plus $50."
