    "content": "Significant changes were made by Congress to the current lobbying laws, and to internal House and Senate rules on ethics and procedures, by the passage of S. 1 , 110 th Congress ( P.L. 110-81 , 121 Stat. 735, September 14, 2007) and the adoption of H.Res. 6 , 110 th Congress. In the face of mounting public and congressional concern over allegations and convictions of certain lobbyists and public officials in a burgeoning \"lobbying and gift\" scandal, and with a recognition of legitimate concerns over undue influence and access of certain special interests to public officials, Congress has adopted stricter rules, regulations, and laws attempting to address these issues. This report provides summaries of the changes made to law and congressional rule in S. 1 , 110 th Congress ( P.L. 110-81 ), and the changes adopted to internal House rules earlier in the Congress in H.Res. 6 . The statutory and internal congressional rule changes which have been adopted address five general areas of reform: (1) broader and more detailed disclosures of lobbying activities by paid lobbyists, and more disclosures concerning the intersection of the activities of professional lobbyists with government policy makers; (2) more extensive restrictions on the offering and receipt of gifts and favors for Members of Congress and their staff, including gifts of transportation and travel expenses; (3) new restrictions addressing the so-called \"revolving door,\" that is, post-government-employment \"lobbying\" activities by former high-level government officials on behalf of private interests; (4) reform of the government pension provisions with regard to Members of Congress found guilty of abusing the public trust; and (5) greater transparency in the internal legislative process in the House and Senate, including \"earmark\" disclosures and accountability."
