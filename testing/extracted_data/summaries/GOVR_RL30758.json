    "content": "The sharp increase in petroleum prices beginning in mid-1999, experiences with tighter supply, and international instability have renewed concern about our dependence on petroleum imports. Oneof the strategies for reducing this dependence is to produce vehicles that run on alternatives togasoline and diesel fuel. These alternatives include alcohols, gaseous fuels, renewable fuels,electricity, and fuels derived from coal. The push to develop alternative fuels, although driven byenergy security concerns, has been aided by concerns over the environment, because manyalternative fuels lead to reductions in emissions of toxic chemicals, ozone-forming compounds, andother pollutants, as well as greenhouse gases. Each fuel (and associated vehicle) has various advantages and drawbacks. The key drawback of all alternative fuels is that because of higher fuel and/or vehicle prices, alternative fuel vehicles(AFVs) are generally more expensive to own than conventional vehicles. And while many AFVshave superior environmental performance compared to conventional vehicles, their performance interms of range, cargo capacity, and ease of fueling may not compare favorably with conventionalvehicles. Furthermore, because there is little fueling infrastructure (as compared to gasoline anddiesel fuel), fueling an AFV can be inconvenient. Any policy to support AFVs must address the performance and cost concerns, as well as the issue of fueling infrastructure. Within this context, a \"chicken and egg\" dilemma stands out: Thevehicles will not become popular without the fueling infrastructure, and the fueling infrastructurewill not expand if there are no customers to serve. Three key laws, the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 ( P.L. 100-494 ), the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 ( P.L. 101-549 ), and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-486 ), as well asthree Executive Orders, support the development and commercialization of alternative fuels andalternative fuel vehicles. These legislative acts and administrative actions provide tax incentives topurchase AFVs, promote the expansion of alternative fueling infrastructure, and require the use ofAFVs by various public and private entities. The 108th Congress considered comprehensive energy legislation, but a final bill was not submitted to the President for signature. H.R. 6 would have promoted the developmentof renewable fuels, especially ethanol and hydrogen. Further, it would have provided incentives forthe development and purchase of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles. In addition tothe energy bill, other bills were introduced to create vehicle purchase tax credits, promote researchand development of fuels, and require the use of alternative fuels. It is likely that similar legislationwill be introduced in the 109th Congress. This report reviews these issues. It will be updated as events warrant."
