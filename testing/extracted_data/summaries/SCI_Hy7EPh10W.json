    "content": "The ability of a classifier to recognize unknown inputs is important for many classification-based systems. We discuss the problem of simultaneous classification and novelty detection, i.e. determining whether an input is from the known set of classes and from which specific class, or from an unknown domain and does not belong to any of the known classes. We propose a method based on the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) framework. We show that a multi-class discriminator trained with a generator that generates samples from a mixture of nominal and novel data distributions is the optimal novelty detector. We approximate that generator with a mixture generator trained with the Feature Matching loss and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods for novelty detection. Our findings demonstrate a simple, yet powerful new application of the GAN framework for the task of novelty detection. In recent years we have witnessed incredible progress in AI, largely due to the success of Deep Learning, and more specifically Supervised Deep Learning. One of the basic requirements from a good supervised learning algorithm is generalization -the ability to classify input that is reasonably similar to the training data. However, usually there are no requirements whatsoever on how the classifier should behave for new types of input that differ substantially from the data that are available during training. In fact for such novel input the algorithm will produce erroneous output and classify it as one of the classes that were available to it during training. Ideally, we would like that the classifier, in addition to its generalization ability, be able to detect novel inputs, or in other words, we would like the classifier to say, \"I don't know.\" Novelty detection can be defined as the task of recognizing that test data differs in some manner from the data that was available during training. The problem of novelty detection arises in many fields and is closely related, but not identical, to the problems of anomaly detection (also outlier detection), where the goal is to recognize anomalous examples in a dataset BID2 . Novelty detection is a hard problem that has received relatively little attention in the ML literature. Nevertheless, in our opinion novelty detection should be a central part of every recognition system. For a comprehensive in-depth review of the topic of novelty detection, we refer the reader to BID18 . Popular conventional novelty detection methods such as Probabilistic methods BID18 , which perform density estimation of the examples from a nominal class, or Domainbased methods BID23 ; BID27 , which re-formulate novelty detection as a \"one-class classification\" problem and define a boundary around the nominal class, do not scale well to large high-dimensional datasets. Another class of novelty detection methods is distance-based methods, which assume that the nominal data are tightly clustered, while novel data occur far from their nearest neighbors. These methods require computationally expensive clustering or nearest neighbors search. One of the major drawbacks of conventional novelty detection methods is that at test time, they are separated from the classification algorithm and therefore increase the overall computational and design complexity of the system. Furthermore, combining novelty detection with a multi-class classifier into a single algorithm may leverage important intra and inter-class information in the training data which can benefit both tasks.In this paper we are interested in methods for simultaneous classification and novelty detection. A popular heuristic approach to simultaneous classification and novelty detection is thresholding the maximum of estimated class probability BID9 , or alternatively, to threshold the entropy of the estimated probability distribution. Another practical approach is to collect \"backgroundclass\" samples, that is, samples that are not from the nominal set and hopefully represent novel data. In this case, novelty detection can be reduced to a supervised learning problem. Unfortunately, this solution requires collecting a large set of background inputs -a time-consuming task and moreover, it is very difficult to sample a large enough background class that will represent all possible novel examples.We embrace the \"background-class\" sampling idea and ask is it possible to generate novel data? To the best of our knowledge, no method for novelty detection is based on generating novel examples. In this paper we examine whether Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), a popular generative framework that can be used to generate novel examples. The GAN framework was proposed by BID8 , as a generative modeling method, mostly used for generating realistic samples of natural images. More specifically, GAN is an approach to generative modeling where two models are trained simultaneously: a generator and a discriminator. The task of the discriminator is to classify an input as either the output of the generator (\"fake\" data), or actual samples from the underlying data distribution (\"real\" data). The goal of the generator is to produce outputs that are classified by the discriminator as \"real\", or as coming from the underlying data distribution.In some formulations of GANs Odena (2016); BID25 , the discriminator is trained to classify data not only into two classes \"real\" and \"fake\", but rather into multiple classes. If the \"real\" data consists of K classes, then the output of the discriminator is K + 1 class probabilities where K probabilities corresponds to K known classes, and the K + 1 probability correspond to the \"fake\" class.In this paper, we propose to use a multi-class GAN framework for simultaneous classification and novelty detection. If during training the generator generates a mixture of nominal data and novel data, the multi-class discriminator learns to discriminate novel data from nominal data and essentially became a novelty detector. At test time, when the discriminator classifies a real example to the K + 1 th class, i.e., class which represented \"fake examples\" during training, this the example is most likely a novel example and not from one of the K nominal classes. In fact, we prove that in this case the discriminator become an optimal novelty detector (for a given false positive rate). We approximate such a mixture generator with a generator trained with specifically designed loss functions. In Section 2 we provide background and a theoretical justification to our proposed method and its connection to existing novelty detection methods. We validate the proposed method by a set of experiments in Section 3. The ability to identify novelties or say \"I don't know\" is an important tool for many classificationbased systems. In this work, we propose to solve a problem of simultaneous classification and novelty detection within the GAN framework. We propose to use a GAN with a mixture generator to turn this problem into a supervised learning problem without collecting \"background-class\" data.In the case where a mixture generator generates samples from a mixture of nominal data distribution and novel data distribution, we showed that the GAN's discriminator is an optimal novelty detector. We approximate that generator with a mixture generator trained with the Feature Matching loss. This mixture generator generates samples scattered around and in the low-density areas of the data manifold, and this makes a multi-class discriminator a powerful novelty detector. We empirically validate that the performance of the proposed solution is comparable to several popular novelty detection methods, and sometimes outperforms them.Clearly, evaluation of the proposed framework on more challenging datasets is required. As a future research direction we would like to search for new loss functions for mixture generators that will enrich the generator distribution and will improve novelty detection. Classification with asymmetric label noise problem BID24 is closely related to semi-supervised novelty detection, and it will be interesting to see whether the GAN framework can be used to solve this problem. Finally, it is interesting to see if the suggested framework can be applied to detecting the adversarial examples."
