    "content": "Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success Act or the A PLUS Act - Allows each state to submit to the Secretary of Education a declaration of intent, applicable for up to five years, permitting it to receive federal funds on a consolidated basis that would otherwise be directed toward specific programs furthering the stated purpose of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Requires each declaration to be formulated by a combination of specified State Authorizing Officials or by referendum and to list the programs for which consolidated funding is requested. Allows states to use such funds for any educational purpose permitted by state law, but requires them to make certain assurances that they will use fiscal control and fund accounting procedures, abide by federal civil rights laws, and advance educational opportunities for the disadvantaged. Allows states to amend their declarations. Allows each declaration state to adopt new academic assessments and standards or apply those described under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, but requires each state to have a single system of assessments and standards that includes student proficiency goals. Requires each declaration state to: (1) inform the public about its student achievement assessment system. (2) report annually on student progress toward the state's proficiency standards, disaggregating performance data by specified student groups. And (3) keep aggregate spending on elementary and secondary education at no less than 90 of such spending for the school year coinciding with this Act's enactment. Limits administrative expenses. Requires each declaration state to provide for the equitable participation of private school children and teachers in the activities assisted under its declaration of intent."
