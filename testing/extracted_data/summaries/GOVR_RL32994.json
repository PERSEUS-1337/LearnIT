The Administration's proposed budget included $573.4 million in federal payments to the District of Columbia. Four payments (for court operations, defender services, offender supervision, and criminal justice coordination) represented $471.4 million, or 82%, of the proposed $573.4 million in total federal payments to the District. On June 2, 2005, the District's city council approved the city's $8.8 billion operating budget for FY2006. The District's budget, which must be approved by Congress, also included $3 billion in capital outlays, including $535 million to finance a new baseball stadium. In addition, the District's budget included a request for $635 million in special federal payments. The conference version of H.R. 3058\u2014a bill providing FY2006 appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, the District of Columbia, and Independent Agencies (TTHUD)\u2014was signed into law by the President on November 30, 2005, as P.L. 109-115. The act appropriated $603 million in special federal payments to the District, including $75 million in special federal payments in support of elementary, secondary, and post-secondary education initiatives. P.L. 109-148 subjects the $603 million to a 1% rescission to help offset the cost of Hurricane Katrina disaster relief and avian flu pandemic preparedness. In addition, P.L. 109-115 contains a number of general provisions, including several so-called social riders. Consistent with provisions included in previous appropriations acts, P.L. 109-115 prohibits the use of federal and District funds to finance or administer a needle exchange program intended to reduce the spread of AIDS and HIV; or for abortion services except in an instance of rape or incest, or when the life of the mother is threatened. A provision not included in the final version of the act, but included in a Senate version of H.R. 3058, would have allowed the use of local, but not federal, funds for a needle exchange program. The act, as approved by Congress, restricts the use of District and federal funds for abortion services and prohibits the implementation of the city's medical marijuana initiative, which would decriminalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes. It does not include a House provision that would have prohibited the District from enforcing a section of its gun control laws that requires registered owners of handguns to keep such weapons unloaded, disassembled, or trigger-locked in their homes. The final version of the act includes two new initiatives: $3 million for marriage development accounts for low-income persons and a transfer of 15 acres of federal land at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium to the District for construction of a public charter boarding school. P.L. 109-115 does not include two initiatives included in the Senate version of the act: a $2 million Latino youth education and health initiative and a $3 million housing initiative for recently released ex-offenders. This report will be updated as events warrant."
