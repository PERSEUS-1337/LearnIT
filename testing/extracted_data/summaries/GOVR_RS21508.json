    "content": "Congress has acted to create two special funds to hold the revenue of certain spectrum auctions for specific purposes. These funds represent a departure from existing practice, which requires that auction proceeds be credited directly to the Treasury as income. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-171, Title III) required the auctioning of licenses for spectrum currently used by TV broadcasters for analog transmissions. It established the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund to receive this auction revenue and use some of the proceeds for the transition to digital television, public safety communications, and other programs. The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act (P.L. 108-494, Title II) established a Spectrum Relocation Fund to hold the proceeds of certain spectrum auctions for the specific purpose of reimbursing federal entities for the costs of moving to new frequency assignments. The spectrum being vacated by federal users has been sold for commercial use. Passage of the Spectrum Enhancement Act set a precedent in national policy for spectrum management by linking spectrum auction proceeds to specific funding programs. Among bills related to special funds that were introduced during the 110th Congress are: the Spectrum Relocation Improvement Act of 2008 (H.R. 7207, Inslee): the RESPONDER Act of 2008 (S. 3465, Wicker); and The Public Safety Interoperability Implementation Act (H.R. 3116, Stupak)."
