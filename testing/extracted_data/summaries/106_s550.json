    "title": "State Excise Sales, and Transaction Tax Enforcement Act of 1999",
    "content": "Defines a qualified State tax as any lawfully imposed, nondiscriminatory excise, sales, or transaction tax imposed by a State on a purchase of a good or service from a tribal retail enterprise by a person who is not a member of the Indian tribe that is the owner or operator of the tribal enterprise, excluding any State tax otherwise described if: (1) the tribal retail enterprise is exempted under State law from collecting and remitting that tax because the associated Indian tribe imposes and collects an equivalent tax. (2) the State has waived the applicability of that tax to a purchase from the enterprise by a person who is not a member of the associated tribe that is the owner or operator of the enterprise. (3) the tax is the subject of an agreement between an enterprise and a State that exempts that enterprise from collecting and remitting that tax. Or (4) the incidence of which falls on an Indian tribe or a member of an Indian tribe."
