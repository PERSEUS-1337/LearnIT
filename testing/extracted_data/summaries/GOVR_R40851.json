    "content": "South Korea's maturing democracy and rapid economic development have had a significant impact on its external relations, including the strategic and economic relationship with the United States. After decades of close strategic alignment with the United States under authoritarian governments, the past several democratically elected leaders in Seoul have sought their own brand of foreign policy and relations with the United States. Now the 13th largest global economy, South Korea is a major U.S. trade partner and host to some 37,000 forward deployed U.S. troops. President Lee Myung-bak entered office in 2008 planning to upgrade ties with the United States and carry out other ambitious proposals, but faced multiple political challenges early in his administration. One initial crisis was the massive anti-government protests against the April 2008 U.S.-Korea beef deal. Lee's approval ratings fell to the 20%-30% level, although his ratings had returned to the 40-50% range in the early fall of 2009 due to improved economic forecasts. Many experts agree his political support remains fragile, including within his Grand National Party (GNP), which controls South Korea's unicameral National Assembly. Lee's clout may be limited by his early \"lame duck\" status; by law, South Korean presidents are limited to one, five-year term. The next presidential election is scheduled for 2012, the same year as the next nationwide National Assembly elections. Although many argue that Lee's early problems were of his own making, South Korea's politically charged and fractious democratic system presents unique challenges for its leaders. Korean presidents operate under extremely intense media and voter scrutiny, and are occasional targets of activist groups that use the Internet to mobilize mass demonstrations like the 2008 beef protests. Civic demonstrations are a carryover from the pro-democracy movement that helped to end South Korea's authoritarian rule just two decades ago. South Korea's increased self-assurance has raised aspirations for greater international clout and respect from the United States as a more equal alliance partner. Over the past decade, Washington and Seoul have taken a number of steps to recognize South Korea's rise. President Lee's vision of a \"Global Korea\" reflects even greater ambitions for a higher profile on the world stage, including a more assertive role in regional diplomacy. Lee has also shifted his predecessor's policy of unconditional engagement of North Korea to a \"reciprocal\" policy toward Pyongyang. This move has reoriented South Korean diplomacy away from pro-engagement China and closer to the U.S. and Japanese position on pressuring the regime to give up its nuclear weapons program. Despite an upswing in South Korean attitudes toward the United States, several outstanding agenda items are affecting bilateral relations. These include relocating the U.S. Army base at Yongsan to Pyongtaek; transferring wartime operational control (OPCON) from U.S. to South Korean command; South Korea's contribution to allied efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan; and the pending bilateral KORUS Free Trade Agreement. Congress has a decisive role to play in approving appropriations for the base relocation plan and the ratification of the KORUS FTA. Lee and President Obama nevertheless signed a \"Joint Vision\" statement during their bilateral summit in June 2009 that outlines a broad set of proposals for upgrading bilateral cooperation on global issues such as climate change and non-proliferation. But domestic political factors will likely set the parameters of Korea's efforts to become a greater stakeholder in the international community. A clearer understanding of these factors may help Congress and U.S. policymakers determine realistic goals for the U.S.-South Korean relationship over the mid to long term."
