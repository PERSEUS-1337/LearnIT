    "content": "Managing policy differences on a range of issues emanating from the Middle East posesserious challenges for the United States and its European allies and friends. The most vitriolicdispute has centered on the conflict in Iraq. However, divisions over how best to approach theongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, manage Iran and Syria, and combat terrorism also persist. TheBush Administration and Members of Congress are concerned that continued disagreements betweenthe two sides of the Atlantic could both constrain U.S. policy choices in the region and erode thebroader transatlantic relationship and counterterrorism cooperation over the longer term. TheU.S.-initiated Broader Middle East and North Africa partnership project seeks to encourage reformsin the region and U.S.-European cooperation in tackling Mideast problems. This initiative waswelcomed by the 9/11 Commission, which recommended that the United States \"should engage othernations in developing a comprehensive coalition strategy against Islamist terrorism.\" TheIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ) contains elements thatseek to promote Middle East development and reform and enhance international cooperation againstterrorism. Many analysts assert that the United States and Europe share common vital interests in theMiddle East: combating terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; promotingMiddle East peace and stability; ensuring a reliable flow of oil; and curtailing Islamic extremism. U.S. and European policies to promote these goals often differ considerably. Although the Europeangovernments are not monolithic in their opinions on the Middle East, European perspectives havebeen shaped over time by common elements unique to Europe's history and geostrategic position. Many Europeans believe the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should be a priority. They view it as a keydriver of terrorism, Islamic extremism, and political unrest among Europe's growing Muslimpopulations. In contrast, the U.S. Administration stresses that terrorism and weapons proliferationare the primary threats and must be pro-actively confronted; peace and stability in the region will notbe possible until these twin threats are removed. A number of other factors, such as divergentperceptions of the appropriate role of the use of force and growing European Union (EU) ambitionsto play a larger role on the world stage, also contribute to the policy gaps that have emerged. How deep and lasting the clash over Iraq and subsequent Middle East policies will be totransatlantic relations will likely depend on several factors, including whether Washington andEuropean capitals can cooperate more robustly to rebuild Iraq; whether Europeans perceive arenewed U.S. commitment to revive the Middle East peace process; and whether differences overMideast issues spill over into NATO or impede EU efforts to forge a deeper Union. This report willbe updated as events warrant.
