    "content": "Congress directs the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to plan and build water resource facilities through the agency's civil works program. The Corps also has a prominent role in responding to natural disasters, especially floods, in U.S. states and territories. In recent years through supplemental appropriations, Congress also has funded the agency to study and construct projects that reduce flood risks in areas recently affected by some hurricanes and floods. The 115th Congress is considering possible responses to various natural disasters in 2017. H.R. 4667\u2014Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements, 2017 (as passed by the House)\u2014proposes $12.09 billion for the agency's activities associated with response, repair, and recovery from natural disasters including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Policy Considerations. A common issue for Congress after a flood-related disaster is whether to provide supplemental funds directly to the Corps and, if so, how much and for which Corps activities. During its deliberations on recent supplemental appropriations bills, Congress also has considered whether to maintain requirements for nonfederal cost sharing, what requirements to include regarding reporting to Congress and public transparency associated with supplemental funds, and what type of flood damage-reduction efforts to support (e.g., repair of existing infrastructure, construction of new infrastructure). Supplemental Corps funding debates also may raise broader questions for policymakers. These include, for example, the effectiveness and efficiency of processes such as those for postdisaster supplemental appropriations and Corps annual budget development, especially in regard to identifying and supporting priority investments in reducing the nation's flood risk. Supporters of supplemental appropriations for the construction of Corps flood-risk reduction projects in natural disaster-affected areas view these projects as part of the broader recovery effort and as means to improve flood resilience of the affected areas. Other stakeholders would prefer more attention and funding that supports other programs and measures to reduce the nation's flood risks. Supplemental Funds. From 2005 to 2016, Congress appropriated $31.4 billion in supplemental funding to the Corps; these funds amounted to almost half of the agency's annual discretionary appropriations over that same period. Of the $31.4 billion, $27.2 billion (87%) was for responding to flooding and other natural disasters. The majority of this funding related to Hurricane Katrina and other 2005 storms (approximately $16 billion) and to Hurricane Sandy in 2012 ($5.3 billion). Supplemental bills most frequently fund two Corps accounts: Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies (FCCE; i.e., flood fighting, repairs to damaged nonfederal flood-control projects) and Operations and Maintenance (O&M; i.e., repairs to existing Corps projects). In some instances, principally since 2005, Congress also has provided supplemental funding for other Corps accounts, such as the Construction account. Of the supplemental funds that Congress provided to the Corps for Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, 31% and 66%, respectively, were for construction activities. Of the $12.1 billion that H.R. 4667 would provide, $10.48 billion would be for activities in the agency's Construction account\u2014$55 million for repairs to Corps construction projects damaged by natural disasters, and $10.425 billion for expedited construction of flood control and storm damage reduction projects in areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. That is, 86% of the funding for the Corps in H.R. 4667 would be for construction. For comparison, that amount would exceed the agency's $9.1 billion total discretionary spending appropriations for flood-related construction for the decade FY2008 to FY2017. Conditions Applicable to Supplemental Funds. In supplemental appropriations bills, Congress has at times maintained, and at other times waived, local cost-sharing requirements for Corps flood-risk reduction construction projects. The standard nonfederal cost shares range from 35% to 50%, depending on the activity. H.R. 4667 would waive the nonfederal cost share for studies and ongoing construction funded through the bill. The bill also would provide the Secretary of the Army with the authority to use funds from the bill, subject to approval by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, to initiate construction on projects that have completed the agency's multistep project development process without project-specific congressional construction authorization."
