    "title": "SB 789",
    "content": "The California Constitution prohibits the Legislature from imposing taxes for local purposes, but allows the Legislature to authorize local governments to impose them. This bill would authorize a local public entity that supplies water at retail or wholesale for the benefit of persons within the service area or area of jurisdiction of that public entity to impose, by ordinance, an excise tax on an excessive user of water, at a rate not to exceed 300 of the purchase price of the water, if the ordinance proposing the tax is approved by 23 of the electors voting on the measure and the revenue from the tax is equally distributed between the public entity and the State Water Resources Control Board for water conservation efforts within the jurisdiction of the public entity. Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to suspend the driving privilege of a person who is involved in an accident and fails to provide evidence of financial responsibility, as specified, at the time of the accident. Under existing law, the suspension period is one year, as specified, except that the suspension must be reinstated if the person fails to maintain proof of financial responsibility for 3 years. However, upon application and if certain criteria are met, the department may restrict the person\u2019s driving privilege, in lieu of suspending it pursuant to this provision, in specified situations. This bill would, commencing July 1, 2016, also authorize the department to restrict a person\u2019s driving privilege, in lieu of suspending it, in order to allow the person to drive to school. For purposes of this authorization, the bill would define \u201cschool\u201d to mean a California community college campus, a California State University campus, a University of California campus, or a private postsecondary educational institution."
