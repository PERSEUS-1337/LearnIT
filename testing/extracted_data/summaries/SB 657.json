    "title": "An act to amend Sections 50003 and 50201 of the Financial Code, relating to mortgages.",
    "content": "Existing law defines specified terms for purposes of the California Residential Mortgage Lending Act, which generally prohibits a person from engaging in the business of making residential mortgage loans or servicing residential mortgage loans without first obtaining a license from the Commissioner of Business Oversight in accordance with the act. Existing law defines a lender as a person who is an approved lender for the Federal Housing Administration, the Veterans Administration, the Farmers Home Administration, the Government National Mortgage Association, the Federal National Mortgage Association, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, who directly makes residential mortgage loans, and who makes the credit decision in the loan transactions. Existing law requires a licensee issued a license for purposes of making or servicing residential mortgage loans to continuously maintain a minimum tangible net worth of $250,000. This bill would specify that the term \u201clender\u201d includes a person, other than a natural person, and a natural person who is also an independent contractor, who engages in the activities of a loan processor or underwriter for residential mortgage loans, but does not solicit loan applicants, originate mortgage loans, or fund mortgage loans, as specified. The bill would authorize the commissioner to require a licensee who is engaged in the processing or underwriting of residential mortgage loans to continuously maintain a minimum tangible net worth in an amount that is greater than $250,000, but that does not exceed the net worth required of an approved lender under the Federal Housing Administration."
