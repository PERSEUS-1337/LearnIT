    "title": "An act to amend Section 1635.1 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to tissue banks.",
    "content": "Existing federal law governs the processing, storage, and use of human tissue and human cell, tissue, or cellular- or tissue-based products (HCTP), as specified, and imposes certain regulatory duties relating to HCTP upon the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Existing state law requires the State Department of Public Health to license and regulate tissue banks, which process, store, or distribute human tissue for transplantation into human beings. Existing law generally requires every tissue bank operating in this state to have a current and valid tissue bank license issued or renewed by the department, but exempts certain activities from that requirement, including the storage of HCTP by a licensed physician or podiatrist, as specified, if the products were obtained from a California-licensed tissue bank, stored in strict accordance with manufacturer instructions, and used solely for the express purpose of direct implantation into or application on the practitioner\u2019s own patient, among other criteria. This bill would create an additional exemption from the tissue bank licensing requirement for the storage of allograft tissue by a person if that person is a hospital or outpatient setting, the person maintains a log including specified information pertaining to the allograft tissue, and the allograft tissue meets specified requirements, including, among other things, that the allograft tissue was obtained from a California-licensed tissue bank, is individually boxed and labeled with a unique identification number and expiration date, and is intended for the express purpose of implantation into or application on a patient."
