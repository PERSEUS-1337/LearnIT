    "content": "The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140), also known as the 2007 energy bill, significantly expands existing programs to promote biofuels. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-246), also known as the 2008 farm bill, contains a distinct energy title (Title IX) that covers a wide range of energy and agricultural topics with extensive attention to biofuels, including corn-starch based ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, and biodiesel. Research provisions relating to renewable energy are found in Title VII and tax provisions are found in Title XV of the farm bill. Key biofuels-related provisions of EISA and the 2008 farm bill include: a major expansion of the renewable fuel standard (RFS) established in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) [EISA]; expansion and/or modification of tax credits for ethanol [farm bill]; grants and loan guarantees for biofuels (especially cellulosic) research, development, deployment, and production [EISA, farm bill]; studies of the potential for ethanol pipeline transportation, expanded biofuel use, market and environmental impacts of increased biofuel use, and the effects of biodiesel on engines [EISA, farm bill]; expansion of biofuel feedstock availability [farm bill]; reauthorization of biofuels research and development at the U.S. Department of Energy [EISA] and the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Environmental Protection Agency [farm bill]; and reduction of the blender tax credit for corn-based ethanol, a new production tax credit for cellulosic ethanol, and continuation of the import duty on ethanol [farm bill]. This report includes information from CRS Report RL34130, Renewable Energy Policy in the 2008 Farm Bill, by Tom Capehart, and CRS Report RL34136, Biofuels Provisions in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-140), H.R. 3221, and H.R. 6: A Side-by-Side Comparison, by [author name scrubbed]."
