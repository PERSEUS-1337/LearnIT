    "content": "Patient Access to Durable Medical Equipment Act of 2016 This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to delay by one yearnbsp. The full implementation of new Medicare payment rates for durable medical equipment . nbsp, In addition, the billnbsp, specifies that the bid ceiling for durable medical equipment itemsnbsp. Under Medicare's competitive acquisition program shall not be less than the fee schedule amount that would otherwise be determined for those items. Under current law, the Centers for Medicare amp. Medicaid Services (CMS) must use payment information from competitive acquisition programs to make payment adjustments for durable medical equipment items furnished in areas outside of such programs. Current law also allows, but does not require,nbsp. CMS to make such adjustments with respect to certain orthotics and parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment, and supplies . nbsp, The bill requires CMS, in makingnbsp, these adjustments, to account fornbsp. Stakeholder input. In addition, CMS must account for a comparison of competitive acquisition areas and other areas with respect to the following factors: average travel distance and cost associated with furnishing items and services, barriers to access, average delivery time, average volume of items and services furnished by suppliers, and number of suppliers. In four quarterly reports, CMS must publish on its website the results of the monitoring of health outcomes and Medicare beneficiaries' accessnbsp. To durable medical equipment. The bill accelerates the applicability, from January 1, 2019, to October 1, 2018,nbsp, of provisions of current lawnbsp, that limitnbsp, federalnbsp. Medicaid reimbursement to states for durable medical equipment to Medicare payment rates."
