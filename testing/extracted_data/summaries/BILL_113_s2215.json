(4) increase civil fines for unauthorized disclosures of tax return information. (5) prohibit the consideration by the IRS Office of Appeal on appeal of any issue that was not within the scope of the initial determination. (6) prohibit a tax lien against a taxpayer's principal residence unless a written determination is made that all other property of the taxpayer, if sold, is insufficient to pay the tax liability and the lien will not create an economic hardship for the taxpayer.

(8) allow a declaratory judgment with respect to the initial or continuing classification of a tax-exempt social welfare organization. And (9) require the Inspector General for Tax Administration of the Department of the Treasury to review any IRS criteria for selection of tax returns for examination or audit, assessment or collection of deficiencies, criminal investigation or referral, refunds for amounts paid, or any heightened scrutiny or review to determine whether such criteria discriminates against taxpayers on the basis of race, religion, or political ideology and to consult with the IRS on recommended amendments to such criteria."
