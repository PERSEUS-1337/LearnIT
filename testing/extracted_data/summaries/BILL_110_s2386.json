    "content": "Mortgage and Rental Disaster Relief Act of 2007 - Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to authorize the President to provide temporary assistance in the form of mortgage or rental payments to or on behalf of individuals and households who, as a result of financial hardship caused by a major disaster, have received written notice of dispossession or eviction from a residence because of a foreclosure of mortgage or lien, cancellation of sales contract, or lease termination, entered into before such disaster. Defines such a financial hardship to include: (1) the loss of employment or significant income because a job, a business, or a business interest was located in a disaster area. Or (2) suffering financially because of travel restrictions or station or road closures affecting residents of such area. Restricts eligibility for such assistance to individuals or households who have an adjusted gross income of not more than $75,000 . Directs the President to adjust the limits annually to reflect inflation. Allows assistance to be provided for the duration of the period of financial hardship caused by the disaster, not to exceed 18 months. Requires recipients determined to be ineligible to return the full amount of assistance to the government. Makes this Act applicable to any major disaster declared on or after October 21, 2007."
