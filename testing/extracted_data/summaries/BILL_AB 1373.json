    "title": "AB 1373",
    "content": "The Outdoor Advertising Act provides for the regulation by the Department of Transportation of advertising displays, as defined, within view of public highways. The act exempts from certain of its provisions advertising displays that advertise the business conducted or services rendered or goods produced or sold on the property upon which the display is placed, as specified. This bill would exempt from those provisions of the act advertising displays located in specific geographic areas in the City of Los Angeles if those displays meet specified conditions and requirements, including the adoption of, and compliance with, an ordinance by the City of Los Angeles. The bill would impose certain conditions if an advertising display authorized by this bill is a message center display. The bill would require the department, before the advertising display may be placed, to determine or to request the Federal Highway Administration to determine that the display will not cause a reduction in federal aid funds or otherwise be inconsistent with any federal law, regulation, or agreement between the state and a federal agency or department. The bill would make the City of Los Angeles primarily responsible for ensuring that a display remains in compliance with the ordinance and the bill\u2019s requirements, and would require the city to indemnify and hold the department harmless if the city fails to do so. This bill would also make findings and declarations as to the need for a special statute relating to the City of Los Angeles."
