    "content": "Keeping the Internet Devoid of Sexual Predators Act of 2008 or the KIDS Act of 2008 - Directs the Attorney General to: (1) require sex offenders to provide to the National Sex Offender Registry all Internet identifiers used by such offenders, (2) specify requirements for keeping Internet identifier information current. (3) exempt Internet identifiers provided by a sex offender from public disclosure. And (4) establish procedures to notify sex offenders of changes in requirements for providing Internet identifier information. Requires the Attorney General to establish and maintain a secure system to allow social networking websites to compare information contained in the National Sex Offender Registry with the Internet identifiers of users of their websites. Allows social networking websites to use such system to conduct searches as frequently as the Attorney General may allow. Authorizes the Attorney General to deny, suspend, or terminate use of the system by a social networking website for misuse. Prohibits the Attorney General and social networking websites from releasing to the public any list of the Internet identifiers of sex offenders. Exempts a social networking website from civil claims in federal or state court arising from: (1) use of the National Sex Offender Registry unless such website engages in actual malice, intentional misconduct, or reckless disregard to a substantial risk of causing injury without legal justification. And (2) any decision not to compare its database with the online identifiers contained in the National Sex Offender Registry. Amends the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 to revise the minimum standards, under a pilot program, for electronic monitoring of sex offenders to eliminate requirements that the tracking device: (1) contain cellular technology in a single unit, and (2) provide two- and three-way voice communication."
