    "content": "The Affordable Care Act (ACA) authorized many new discretionary grant programs and provided each one with an authorization of appropriations\u2014typically through FY2014 or FY2015\u2014to carry them out. The ACA also reauthorized funding for numerous existing programs with expired authorizations of appropriations, most of which were still receiving annual funding. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that fully funding the discretionary grant programs authorized (or reauthorized) by the ACA, based on the amounts specified in the authorizations of appropriations, would result in appropriations of almost $100 billion over the period FY2012-FY2021. However, the total amount of discretionary funding provided to date falls well below CBO's estimate for two reasons. First, few of the new grant programs authorized by the ACA have received any discretionary appropriations. Second, programs that were reauthorized by the ACA generally have received discretionary appropriations at levels well below the amounts authorized in the law. The ACA included provisions intended to strengthen the health care safety net and improve access to care. For example, it permanently reauthorized the federal health center program and the National Health Service Corps (NHSC). The NHSC provides scholarships and student loan repayments to individuals who agree to a period of service as a primary care provider in a federally designated Health Professional Shortage Area. In addition, the ACA addressed concerns about the current size, specialty mix, and geographic distribution of the health care workforce. It reauthorized and expanded existing health workforce education and training programs under Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Title VII supports the education and training of physicians, dentists, physician assistants, and public health workers through grants, scholarships, and loan repayment. The ACA created several new programs to increase training experiences in primary care, in rural areas, and in community-based settings, and provided training opportunities to increase the supply of pediatric subspecialists and geriatricians. It also expanded the nursing workforce development programs authorized under PHSA Title VIII. As part of a comprehensive framework for federal community-based public health activities, including a national strategy and a national education and outreach campaign, the ACA authorized several new grant programs with a focus on preventable or modifiable risk factors for disease (e.g., sedentary lifestyle, tobacco use). The new law also leveraged a number of mechanisms to improve health care quality, including new requirements for quality measure development, collection, analysis, and public reporting; programs to develop and disseminate innovative strategies for improving the quality of health care delivery; and support for care coordination programs such as medical homes and the co-location of primary health care and mental health services. Additionally, the ACA authorized funding for programs to prevent elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation; grants to expand trauma care services and improve regional coordination of emergency services; and demonstration projects to implement alternatives to current tort litigation for resolving medical malpractice claims, among other provisions. The two agencies primarily responsible for implementing the ACA's expansion of insurance coverage and its revenue provisions\u2014the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\u2014have requested an increase in their annual appropriations in each of the past five years (i.e., FY2013-FY2017) to help cover these costs. But Congress has not provided the agencies with any additional discretionary funding for ACA implementation. CMS, in particular, has relied on funding from a variety of other sources to support these activities."
