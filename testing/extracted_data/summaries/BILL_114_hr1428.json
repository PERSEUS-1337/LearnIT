    "content": "This measure has not been amended sincenbsp. It was reported to the Senate on February 1, 2016. nbsp. Judicial Redress Act of 2015 This bill authorizes the Department of Justice (DOJ) to designate foreign countries or regional economic integration organizations whose natural citizens may bring civil actions under the Privacy Act of 1974 against certain US government agencies for purposes of accessing, amending, or redressing unlawful disclosures of records transferred from a foreign country to the United States to prevent, investigate, detect, or prosecute criminal offenses. The citizens of such countries or organizations may bring a civil action against: (1) US agencies that intentionally or willfully violate conditions for disclosing records without the consent of the individual to whom the record pertains. And (2) US agencies designated by DOJ, with the concurrence of the agency, that refuse an individual's request to review or amend his or her records. DOJ, with the concurrence of the Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Homeland Security, may designate countries or organizations whose citizens may pursue such civil remedies if the person's country or organization: (1) has appropriate privacy protections for sharing information with the United States, as provided for in an agreement with the United States or as determined by DOJ. (2) permits the transfer of personal data for commercial purposes between its territory and the United States. And (3) has DOJ-certified data transfer policies that do not impede US national security interests. A country's designation may be revoked if it: (1) is not complying with a privacy protection agreement, (2) no longer has appropriate privacy protections for sharing information, (3) fails to meet requirements for transfers of personal data for commercial purposes, (4) no longer meets the DOJ's transfer policy certification requirements, or (5) impedes the transfer of information to the United States by a private entity or person. DOJ's designations are exempt from judicial or administrative review. The US District Court for the District of Columbia is granted exclusive jurisdiction over any claim arising under this Act."
