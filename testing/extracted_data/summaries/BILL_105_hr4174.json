    "content": "Amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to replace provisions regarding the rescission of budget authority with those authorizing the President to propose the rescission of any budget authority provided in an appropriation Act or repeal of any targeted tax benefit provided in any revenue Act. Authorizes the President to transmit a draft bill to the Congress with such a proposal that clearly identifies the budget authority proposed to be rescinded or the targeted tax benefit to be repealed. Includes within such bill a Deficit Reduction Account. Permits the President to place in the Account an amount not to exceed total rescissions in the bill. Establishes expedited procedures in the Senate and the House of Representatives for consideration of such bill. Makes any amount of budget authority proposed to be rescinded available for obligation on the day after the date either House rejects such bill. Deems any targeted tax benefit proposed for repeal to be repealed unless either House rejects such bill during a prescribed time frame."
