    "content": "Mercury-Free Vaccines Act of 2004 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to deem a banned mercury-containing vaccine to be adulterated. Amends the Public Health Service Act to deem a vaccine to be a banned mercury-containing vaccine if: (1) one dose of the vaccine contains 1 or more micrograms of mercury in any form. Or (2) the vaccine contains any thimerosal and is listed in the current version of the recommended childhood and adolescent immunization schedule of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to declare that an actual or potential bioterrorist incident or other public health emergency makes the administration of such vaccines advisable for a specified period. Specifies different effective dates of the provisions of this Act for particular vaccines. Requires the Secretary to revise the vaccine information included with thimerosal-containing vaccines to include: (1) a statement that indicates the presence of thimerosal in the vaccine. (2) information on the availability of any thimerosal-free or thimerosal-reduced alternative vaccine and instructions on how to obtain such an alternative vaccine. And (3) a recommendation against administration of any thimerosal-containing vaccine to a pregnant woman. Expresses the sense of Congress that the CDC should disseminate, with any vaccine-related information, a recommendation against administration of any thimerosal-containing vaccine to a pregnant woman."
