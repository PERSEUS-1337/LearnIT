    "content": "The United States and Mexico have a special relationship as neighbors and partners under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The friendly relationship has been strengthenedby President Bush's meetings with President Fox but has been weakened by disagreements over Iraqand other issues. Major congressional issues are trade, migration/border security, drug trafficking,and political issues. Trade. Since 1994, NAFTA institutions have been functioning, trade between the countries has tripled, and allegations of violations of labor and environmental laws have been considered. TheBush Administration has argued that NAFTA has had modest positive impacts on all three membercountries, but Mexican farmers have strongly criticized the effects of NAFTA. Recent trade disputeswith Mexico have involved trucking, telecommunications, tuna, sweeteners and sugar. Migration/Border Security. In February 2001, Presidents Bush and Fox agreed to establish high-level talks to ensure safe, legal, and orderly migration flows between the countries, but the talksstalled after the September 2001 terrorist attacks, and border controls were later strengthened underthe new Department of Homeland Security. In January 2004, President Bush proposed a majorimmigration reform \"to match willing foreign workers with willing U.S. employers when noAmericans can be found to fill the jobs.\" In December 2004, Congress passed the IntelligenceReform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 ( S. 2845 / P.L. 108-458 ), with provisionsto increase immigration law enforcement personnel and to adopt more stringent border control andidentity document standards. Drug Trafficking. Bush Administration officials have regularly praised Mexico's counter-narcotics efforts under Fox, especially action against major traffickers, and havecharacterized the bilateral cooperation in this area as unprecedented. The State Department reportedin April 2004, however, that marijuana and opium poppy cultivation increased significantly inMexico in 2003. In recent law enforcement actions, on October 19, 2004, DEA officials announcedthe dismantling, through Operation Money Clip, of a major Mexican money-laundering and drugtrafficking organization operating in the United States. Political and Human Rights. In nation-wide elections on July 6, 2003, to renew the Chamber of Deputies, President Fox's PAN fared poorly, while the previously dominant PRI and the leftistPRD increased representation, making congressional approval of President Fox's reform measuresless likely. Local elections are being held in an environment in which the parties are positioningthemselves for the July 2006 presidential elections. On human rights issues, President Fox hasdesignated special prosecutors to prosecute those responsible for human rights abuses in the 1970sand 1980s, but little progress has been made. On December 10, 2004, President Fox, responding toan analysis by the U.N. High Commission for Human Rights, presented a series of proposed reformsto discourage torture and to strengthen the rights of defendants in Mexico."
