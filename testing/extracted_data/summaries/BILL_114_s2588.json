    "content": "Grants and Education To Tackle Homeowner Exposure to Lead Ensuring America Drinks Only from Unpolluted Taps Act of 2016 or the GET THE LEAD OUT Act of 2016 This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a grant program to provide assistance to eligible entities for reducing lead levels in water for human consumption. Grant funds may be used to assist low-income homeowners in carrying out lead reduction projects, as long as the grant amount does not exceed the cost of replacing the privately owned portion of the service line. If an eligible entity uses funds for replacing lead service lines, it must: (1) notify customers of the planned replacement of any publicly owned portion of the lead service line. (2) inform each customer that it will replace the public portion of the line only if it obtains the customer's consent to simultaneously replace the privately owned portion of the line. And (3) demonstrate that it has considered multiple options for reducing lead in drinking water, including an evaluation of options for corrosion control."
