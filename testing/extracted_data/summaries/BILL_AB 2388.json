    "title": "AB 2388",
    "content": "Existing law, the Housing Authorities Law, declares that providing safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low income is a public use and purpose for which public money may be spent and private property acquired, and is a governmental function of state concern. Existing law establishes procedures by which a local government may create or authorize a local housing authority to operate within it for this purpose. Existing law authorizes those housing authorities to convey surplus lands, as specified, for the development of homes for ownership by persons and families of low or moderate income. Existing law requires every local housing authority within a county or city to file on the first day of October of each year with the Department of Housing and Community Development a complete report of its activities during the previous fiscal year, with specified recommendations. This bill would require the department, in conjunction with the California Housing Finance Agency to report, no later than January 1, 2018, on ways to increase homeownership for extremely low, very low, and low-income households. The bill would require the department and the agency to carry out and include in the report a survey of housing authorities in California, as specified. Existing law declares the intent of the Legislature to preserve, upgrade, and expand the supply of housing to persons and families of low or moderate income, through the sale of specified surplus residential property owned by public agencies. Existing law establishes priorities and procedures that any state agency disposing of that surplus residential property is required to follow. This bill, on or before January 1, 2018, would require every local government agency, as defined, to adopt a mortgage program that, among other things, allocates 10 of all single-family residences that the local government agency owns and leases to become eligible for purchase by tenants presently occupying the single\u2013family residence. The bill would require each local government agency to adopt regulations for the administration of the program that include, among other things, eligibility requirements that limit the program to use by persons with extremely low income households, very low income households, lower income households, or persons and families of low or moderate income. By imposing new duties on local government agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
