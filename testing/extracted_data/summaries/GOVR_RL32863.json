    "content": "This report describes the FY2006 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Administration requested a net appropriation of $30.6 billion in net budget authority for FY2006, of which $29.6 billion is discretionary budget authority, and $1 billion is mandatory budget authority. P.L. 109-90 was signed into law on October 18, 2005, and provides a net appropriation of $31.9 billion for DHS and $30.8 billion in discretionary budget authority. The President's request for appropriations includes the following break out of net budget authority for the four Titles of the DHS appropriation bill: (I) Departmental Management and Operations, $748 million; (II) Security, Enforcement and Investigations, $20,566 million; (III) Preparedness and Response, $6,710 million; and (IV) Research and Development, Training, Assessments, and Services, $2,546 million. The House-passed version of H.R. 2360 would provide the following amounts for each title: (I) $561 million; (II) $21,988 million; (III) $6,688 million; and (IV) $2,522 million. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2360 would provide the following amounts for each title: (I) $647 million; (II) $22,193 million; (III) $6,334 million; and (IV) $2,686 million. P.L. 109-90 reflects Secretary Chertoff's proposed reorganization and provides the following amounts for each title: (I) $907 million; (II) $22,401 million; (III) $6,666 million; and (IV) $1,899 million. P.L. 109-90 concurs with much of Secretary Chertoff's reorganization of DHS, including moving the Federal Air Marshals from ICE to TSA and splitting the Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection into two different agencies, Analysis and Operations within Title I, and Infrastructure Protection and Information Security, within Title III. The requested net appropriation, amounts in House-passed H.R. 2360 (in parentheses), amounts in Senate-passed H.R. 2360 [in brackets], and amounts in the conference report {in ellipses} for major components of the department include the following: $5,575 ($5,785) [$5,998] {$5,993} million for Customs and Border Protection (CBP); $3,648 ($3,830) [$3,808] {$3,175} million for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); $1,641 ($3,263) [$3,065] {$3,925} million for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA); $7,962 ($7,458) [$7,780] {$7,797} million for the U.S. Coast Guard; $1,204 ($1,232) [$1,192] {$1,212} million for the Secret Service; $3,565 ($3,665) [$3,573] {$3,346} million for the Office of State and Local Government Preparedness (SLGCP); $3,135 ($3,013) [$2,758] {$2,633} million for the Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate (EPR); $80 ($120) [$80] {$115} million for Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS); and $1,368 ($1,290) [$1,453] {$1,502} million for the Science and Technology Directorate. Responding to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, Congress enacted two supplemental appropriation laws totaling $60 billion in FY2005 for EPR. This report will not be updated."
