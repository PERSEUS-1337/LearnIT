    "title": "An act to\namend Section 13260 of\nadd and repeal Section 13172.6\nof\nthe Water Code, relating to\nwater quality.\ndredging.",
    "content": "Existing law prohibits the use of any vacuum or suction dredge equipment by any person in any river, stream, or lake of this state without a permit issued by the Department of Fish and Wildlife. Existing law requires the department to issue a permit if the department determines that the use does not cause any significant effects to fish and wildlife and would authorize the department to adjust the specified fee to an amount sufficient to cover all reasonable costs of the department in regulating suction dredging activities. Existing law authorizes the State Water Resources Control Board or a California regional water quality control board to adopt waste discharge requirements or a waiver of waste discharge requirements that address certain water quality impacts, specify conditions or areas where the discharge of waste or other adverse impacts on beneficial uses of the waters of the state from the use of vacuum or suction dredge equipment is prohibited, or prohibit particular use of, or methods of using, vacuum or suction dredge equipment, or any portion thereof, for the extraction of minerals, that the state board or a regional board determines generally cause or contribute to an exceedance of applicable water quality objectives or unreasonably impact beneficial uses. This bill would require the state board and the department to report to the Legislature, on or before June 1, 2017, on the status of the suction dredge permitting program. Under existing law, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, the State Water Resources Control Board and the California regional water quality control boards are the principal state agencies with responsibility for the coordination and control of water quality in the state. The act, with certain exceptions, requires a waste discharger to file certain information with the appropriate regional board and to pay an annual fee. This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to these provisions."
