    "content": "U.S. funding for global health has grown significantly over the last decade, from approximately $1.7 billion in FY2001 to $8.8 billion in FY2012. During the George W. Bush Administration, Congress provided unprecedented increases in global health resources, especially in support of multi-agency initiatives targeting infectious diseases, such as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). As support for global health increased, the 110th and 111th Congresses began to emphasize better coordination of all global health programs and efforts to strengthen health systems in recipient countries. In 2009, the Obama Administration announced the Global Health Initiative (GHI), proposed as a six-year, $63 billion effort to integrate existing global health programs and provide a comprehensive U.S. global health strategy. Funding for FY2012 was signed into law on December 23, 2011 (P.L. 112-74). FY2012 appropriations for global health programs remained similar to FY2011, although these amounts were agreed to after prolonged debate over potential budget reductions. The 112th Congress is currently debating FY2013 funding for global health activities. The Administration's FY2013 budget request includes reduced funding for global health for the first time in over a decade. However, early debate and action on FY2013 appropriations by both the House and Senate suggests that Congress may not support these reductions. While some policymakers and health experts argue that reductions in global health may be possible due to newly identified efficiencies in programming that could yield important savings, others have raised concerns about the impact of potential cuts on current U.S. global health activities and stated targets. Some groups contend that lower levels of U.S. assistance could limit U.S. agencies' ability to integrate their activities and implement innovative approaches to global health, as emphasized by GHI; threaten advances in eradicating diseases like polio and guinea worm and reverse progress made in preventing and treating diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; compel recipient countries to decrease spending on health issues that disproportionately affect the poor, like neglected tropical diseases and limit access to basic health services such as midwifery care, nutritional support, and vaccinations; and weaken U.S. efforts to encourage greater country ownership through multi-year funding plans. This report provides a broad overview of U.S. global health assistance, including global health programs and global health initiatives, and analyzes some of the policy questions that the 112th Congress may consider as it oversees and debates funding for global health programs.
