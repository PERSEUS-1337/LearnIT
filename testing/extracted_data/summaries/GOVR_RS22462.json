    "content": "Mexico held national elections for a new president and congress on July 2, 2006. Conservative Felipe Calder\u00c3\u00b3n of the National Action Party (PAN) narrowly defeated Andr\u00c3\u00a9s Manuel L\u00c3\u00b3pez Obrador of the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) in a highly contested election. Final results of the presidential election were only announced after all legal challenges had been settled. On September 5, 2006, the Elections Tribunal found that although business groups illegally interfered in the election, the effect of the interference was insufficient to warrant an annulment of the vote, and the tribunal declared PAN-candidate Felipe Calder\u00c3\u00b3n president-elect. PRD candidate L\u00c3\u00b3pez Obrador, who rejected the Tribunal's decision, was named the \"legitimate president\" of Mexico by a National Democratic Convention on September 16. The electoral campaign touched on issues of interest to the United States including migration, border security, drug trafficking, energy policy, and the future of Mexican relations with Venezuela and Cuba.
