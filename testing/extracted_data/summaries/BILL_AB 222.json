    "title": "AB 222",
    "content": "Existing law prohibits the disclosure of the home addresses of certain public employees and officials, including an employee of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Juvenile Facilities or the Prison Industry Authority, that appear in records of the Department of Motor Vehicles, except to a court, a law enforcement agency, an attorney in a civil or criminal action under certain circumstances, and certain other official entities. This bill would extend that prohibition, subject to those same exceptions, to the disclosure of the home addresses of an employee of the State Department of State Hospitals, as specified. Existing law requires the owner of a vehicle of a type required to be registered under the Vehicle Code to submit an application for the original or renewal registration of that vehicle to the Department of Motor Vehicles upon the appropriate form furnished by the department. This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions."
