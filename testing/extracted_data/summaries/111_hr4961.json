    "content": "Haitian Private Sector Encouragement Act of 2010 - Authorizes the President to designate one private, nonprofit organization established under state law as the Haitian-American Enterprise Fund, which shall be eligible to receive funds and support under this Act. Authorizes the President, through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), to provide a grant to the Fund to promote policies and practices conducive to the development of private property rights for Haitian citizens, particularly citizens of limited economic means, through integration of extralegal property arrangements into property recordation systems that fix the economic potential of assets, integrate ownership information into one system, hold citizens accountable, make assets fungible, and protect commercial transaction integrity. Directs USAID to monitor Fund activities. Applies the enterprise fund provisions of the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 to the Fund in the same manner as such provisions apply to other similar US-established enterprise funds. Authorizes the President to establish the Haitian-American Economic Oversight Panel to monitor Fund activities and all other US economic development initiatives for Haiti. Authorizes FY2011 appropriations."
