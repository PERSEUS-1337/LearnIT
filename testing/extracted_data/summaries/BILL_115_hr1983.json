    "content": "David Ray Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2017 or David's Law This bill makes it unlawful to willfully cause bodily injury to any person or, through the use of fire, a firearm, or an explosive device, attempting to cause such injury, whether or not acting under color of law, because of: (1) the actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national origin of that person. Or (2) the actual or perceived religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability of that person where the offense is in or affects interstate or foreign commerce. The US Sentencing Commission is directed to study the issue of adult recruitment of juveniles to commit hate crimes and, if appropriate, to amend the federal sentencing guidelines to provide sentencing enhancements for using juveniles to assist in the commission of such hate crimes. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention of the Department of Justice (DOJ) shall make grants to state and local programs designed to combat hate crimes committed by juveniles. The bill authorizes the Department of the Treasury and DOJ, for FY2017-FY2019, to increase the number of personnel to protect against criminal interference with federally-protected activities."
