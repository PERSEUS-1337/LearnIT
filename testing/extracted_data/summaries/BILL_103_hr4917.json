(2) include among such required information an index of all information stored in an electronic form by the agency, a description of any new database, and a list of all statutes authorizing the agency to withhold information under such Act. (3) enable requesters to receive records in the format in which such records are maintained. (4) require reasonable efforts by the agency to provide records in an electronic format even when such records are not usually maintained in such format. (5) credit to agencies which have been found to be responsive to FOIA requests a percentage of the fees collected from such requests to offset compliance costs, at an agency's request. (6) provide for Government payment of the requester's out-of-pocket expenses in any case in which the agency has failed to comply with the FOIA request within prescribed time limits. (7) lengthen from ten to 20 days the period for agency decision to comply with a request for information. (8) preclude treatment of predictable workload as unusual circumstances warranting extension of time limits. (9) require denial notifications to specify the total number of denied records and pages considered in responding to the FOIA request, . (11) require the extent of deletions to be indicated on the released portion of the record where they were made. And (12) define record to include all information or documentary materials regardless of physical form or characteristics, and search to include an automated examination to locate records."
