    "content": "Senior Executive Service Accountability Act - Requires each federal agency to include in its biennial report to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a specific number of Senior Executive Service (SES) positions a justification for each position and the specific result expected from each such position, including the impact of such result on the agency mission. Extends from one year to two years the probationary period for SES employees. Eliminates the authority for allowing an individual removed from the SES for a less than fully successful executive performance to retain an SES pay grade level if appointed to a civil service position. Requires a written description of employee performance requirements to be provided to SES employees not later than 30 calendar days before each rating period. Makes SES employees subject to the same 14-day suspension period, without duties and pay, as is applicable to other federal employees. Expands the grounds for suspension or termination of an SES employee to include such cause as would promote the efficiency of the SES. Requires: (1) a written decision of an adverse action to be rendered not later than 30 days after the employee's answer to such action is received, and (2) any SES employee who is terminated from service to repay any salary received and forfeit any annual leave accumulated during the period of any adverse action leading to termination."
