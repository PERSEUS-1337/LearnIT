    "content": "The capture and subsequent release of five Japanese civilians in two differenthostage-taking situations by Islamicterrorist groups in Iraq in April 2004 underscored the high stakes for both the Japanese government of PrimeMinister Junichiro Koizumi and for the U.S.-ledcoalition. Except for the small Communist and Socialist parties, Japanese political leaders across the boardsupported Koizumi's adamant stance againstresponding to the hostage-takers' demands that Japan withdraw its contingent of some 550 troops that were deployedto Samawah, in southern Iraq, in early2004. While this show of resolve by Japan has been welcomed by the Bush Administration, the longer-term effectof the hostage-taking and the upsurge inanti-coalition violence may reinforce the views of many in Japan, including the main opposition party, that agreeingto send Japanese troops to Iraq was amistake. A number of Japanese commentators and political leaders have suggested that the government's mainmotive for sending troops was to strengthenU.S.-Japan alliance cooperation in the face of perceived security threats from North Korea and a rising China, notbecause of strong agreement with U.S. policyin Iraq. From this perspective, Tokyo's steadfastness could have a positive influence on other coalition governments who may now be reconsidering theircommitments, while the withdrawal of Japanese forces, as many in Japan are demanding, could cause significantcomplications for the U.S. effort in Iraq andadversely affect broader U.S.-Japan alliance relations. This report will be updated as news events warrant."
