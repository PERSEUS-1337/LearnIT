    "content": "Attention to environmental issues in the 110th Congress focused early and heavily on climate change\u2014the state of the science, and whether (and, if so, how) to address greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Seventeen bills were introduced to establish GHG emission caps, and hearings on climate change were held by at least 10 committees. The Lieberman-Warner bill to establish a cap-and-trade system for GHG emissions (S. 2191) was reported by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, May 20, 2008. Senate debate began on a modified version of the bill (S. 3036) June 2 but ended June 6, as the Senate failed to muster sufficient votes to invoke cloture. Climate change hearings and markup were among the highest priorities for the committees that have jurisdiction over air issues (principally Senate Environment and Public Works and House Energy and Commerce). Other clean air issues were addressed largely through oversight of Administration actions. Oversight issues included how best to control emissions of mercury and other pollutants from electric power plants; whether EPA's new standards for ambient air concentrations of fine particulates, ozone, and lead adequately reflect the state of the science; and whether EPA's new process for setting ambient air quality standards politicized what traditionally have been scientific judgments. In addition to EPA, state governments and the courts have taken action on air issues that has stirred congressional interest. On April 2, 2007, the Supreme Court decided Massachusetts v. EPA, finding that EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles and requiring EPA to make a finding as to whether such emissions endanger public health or welfare. On February 8, 2008, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Jersey v. EPA, found EPA's approach to the regulation of power plant mercury emissions to be unlawful. On July 11, 2008, in North Carolina v. EPA, the D.C. Circuit vacated the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which would have controlled emissions from power plants affecting air quality in downwind states. Other cases involving climate change, clean air standards, and the regulation of power plants are pending at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and in a number of federal and state courts. Decisions in these cases may prompt hearings or legislation. States interested in setting more stringent environmental standards are continuing to develop and implement regulations that go well beyond the requirements of federal law. Of particular interest is California's request for a waiver of federal preemption to control greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks. On December 19, 2007, EPA announced that it would deny the waiver request, and the agency's Administrator signed a decision document formalizing his denial, February 29, 2008. California and more than a dozen other states are challenging the denial in court. Legislation was introduced in both the Senate (S. 2555) and the House (H.R. 5560) to overturn the Administrator's decision. The Senate bill was reported June 27, 2008, but no further action was taken."
