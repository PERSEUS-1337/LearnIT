    "content": "Civil Justice Reform Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal judicial code to entitle the prevailing party in a diversity action to attorney's fees only to the extent that such party prevails on any position or claim advanced during the action. Requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to study and report to the Congress on the caseloads of such diversity actions and the awarding of attorney's fees therein. Repeals such entitlement five years after the enactment of this Act. Outlines provisions under which any party to a civil action filed in a district court may serve upon, and have accepted by, any adverse party a written offer to allow judgment to be entered for the money or property specified in the offer. Requires such offer to be accepted by the adverse party within 14 days or to be considered withdrawn. Requires a claimant, at least 30 days before filing suit in a civil action brought in a US district court, to transmit written notice to any intended defendant at an address reasonably calculated to provide actual notice. Directs the claimant, at the commencement of the action, to file in such court a certificate of service evidencing compliance with such provision. Provides for a 30-day extension of any applicable statute of limitations that would expire during the period of such notice. Makes such provision inapplicable under specified circumstances. Amends the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act to provide that, in actions brought by any adult convicted of a crime and confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility, the court shall continue such case for up to 180 days in order to require the exhaustion of remedies. Requires the Attorney General, upon the request of a State or local correctional facility, to provide technical advice and assistance in establishing plain, speedy, and effective administrative remedies for inmate grievances. Prohibits the district court in a civil action from permitting opinion evidence on the same issue from more than one expert witness for each party, except upon a showing of good cause."
