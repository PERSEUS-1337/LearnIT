    "content": "Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997 - Directs the President to report periodically to specified congressional committees on foreign persons who, on or after August 8, 1995, have transferred, or attempted to transfer, controlled goods or technology, or provided, or attempted to provide, technical assistance or facilities that contributed, or would have contributed, to Iran's efforts to acquire, develop, or produce ballistic missiles. Excludes from identification in such reports any such persons who were previously identified or sanctioned, who are subject to a waiver, or who have acted on behalf of, or in concert with, the United States. Requires imposition on such persons of minimum two-year sanctions prohibiting: (1) sales to such persons of items on the United States Munitions List. (2) the export to such persons of dual use goods and technology. And (3) the provision of US financial assistance. Authorizes the President to waive such sanctions on the basis of US national security or additional information demonstrating that the sanctioned person did not commit the acts alleged. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should exercise the authority granted to him under the Freedom for Russia and Emerging Eurasian Democracies and Open Markets Support Act of 1992 to prevent: (1) the transfer through purchase, barter, or other acquisition of weapons-related material and delivery systems to Iran. And (2) the transfer to Iran of scientific and technical expertise with respect to such material and systems. Authorizes the use of certain assistance, otherwise available for the independent states of the former Soviet Union under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, to prevent such transfers."
