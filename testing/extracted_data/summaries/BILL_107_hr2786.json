(2) system cost in relation to other Department of Defense (DOD) priorities will not lead to an overall reduction in national security by reducing resources available for other defense priorities, (3) the system will not diminish overall US national security. (4) the system will not threaten to disrupt relations with US nuclear allies, US European allies, Russia, the People's Republic of China, and other nations. And (5) the threat of a long-range ballistic missile attack from a nation of concern is clearly demonstrated. Prohibits the President from directing DOD to deploy a system unless and until: (1) the President certifies to Congress that the above deployment conditions have been met. And (2) a joint resolution is enacted concurring in the President's certification. Prohibits DOD procurement funds from being obligated for a system unless: (1) the President certifies to Congress that adequate system tests have been undertaken to meet identified threats against countermeasures. And (2) a joint resolution is enacted concurring in the President's certification. Requires the Secretary of Defense to direct the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization to: (1) include specified system countermeasures in system ground and flight testing conducted before the system becomes operational.
