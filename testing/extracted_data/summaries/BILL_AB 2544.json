    "title": "AB 2544",
    "content": "Existing law imposes a minimum franchise tax of $800, except as provided, on every corporation incorporated in this state, qualified to transact intrastate business in this state, or doing business, as defined, in this state, and an annual tax in an amount equal to the minimum franchise tax on every limited liability company registered, qualified to transact business, or doing business in this state, as specified. Existing law requires every limited liability company subject to that annual tax to pay annually to this state a fee equal to specified amounts based upon total income from all sources attributable to this state. Existing law requires every partnership to file a return that includes specified information, verified by a written declaration made under the penalty of perjury and signed by one of the partners, within a specified time period. This bill bill, for each taxable year beginning before January 1, 2020, would exempt a limited liability company that is a qualified investment partnership, as defined, from that annual tax and fee by excluding it from the definition of a limited liability company. The bill would require that entity to submit a return under the conditions applicable to a partnership. This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."
