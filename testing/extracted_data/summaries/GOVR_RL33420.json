    "content": "The annual Foreign Operations appropriations bill in the House, and the State, Foreign Operations measure in the Senate are the primary legislative vehicles through which Congress reviews the U.S. international affairs budgets and influences executive branch foreign policy making generally. They contain the largest shares\u2014the House bill, about two-thirds; the Senate bill, about 97%\u2014of total U.S. international affairs spending. Due to subcommittee structural differences between the House and Senate in the 109th Congress, the House Appropriations Committee considered the Foreign Operations request separate from the State Department budget, with the latter falling under the jurisdiction of the Science, State, Justice, and Commerce (SSJC) Subcommittee. The Senate Appropriations Committee, however, combined Foreign Operations and State Department funding requests. Funding for Foreign Operations and State Department/Broadcasting programs has been rising for six consecutive years, and amounts approved in FY2004 reached an unprecedented level compared with the past 40 years. Emergency supplementals enacted since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to assist the front line states in the war on terrorism, Afghanistan and Iraq reconstruction, and for State Department operations and security upgrades have pushed spending upward. Major issues confronting the 110th Congress in considering the Foreign Operations and State Department/Broadcasting appropriations request for FY2007 included: The overall size of the Foreign Operations request\u2014a 14.4% increase over regular FY2006 Foreign Operations funds; Proposed cuts in spending on core bilateral development assistance and programs in Latin America; A 71% increase in appropriations for the Millennium Challenge Account; and Secretary Rice's Transformational Diplomacy initiative for the State Department. On February 14, 2007, Congress completed work on the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill and the Science, State, Justice, and Commerce Appropriations bill as part of the FY2007 Continuing Resolution (H.J.Res. 20/ P.L. 109-289 as amended by P.L. 110-5). The bill provided $32.6 billion in international affairs spending, of which $9.56 billion was for State Department Operations, diplomacy and broadcasting, and $23.0 billion for foreign assistance programs. This is the final update of this report."
