    "content": "The 115th Congress has passed legislation that substantially changes the U.S. federal tax system (H.R. 1). This report describes the federal tax structure, provides some statistics on the tax system as a whole, as of 2017. Historically, the largest component of the federal tax system, in terms of revenue generated, has been the individual income tax. In fiscal year (FY) 2016, $1.5 trillion, or 47% of the federal government's revenue, was collected from the individual income tax. The corporate income tax generated another $300 billion in revenue in FY2016, or 9% of total revenue. Social insurance or payroll taxes generated $1.1 trillion, or 34% of revenue in FY2016. Revenues in 2016 were 17.8% of GDP, slightly above the post-World War II average of 17.3%. The federal individual income tax is levied on an individual's taxable income, which is adjusted gross income (AGI) less deductions and exemptions. Tax rates based on filing status (e.g., married filing jointly, head of household, or single individual) determine the level of tax liability. Tax rates in the United States are generally progressive, such that higher levels of income are typically taxed at higher rates. Once tentative tax liability is calculated, tax credits can be used to reduce tax liability. Tax deductions and tax credits are tools available to policymakers to increase or decrease the after-tax price of undertaking specific activities. Individuals with high levels of exemptions, deductions, and credits relative to income may be required to file under the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Corporate taxable income is also subject to varying rates, where those with higher levels of income pay higher levels of taxes. Social Security and Medicare tax rates are, respectively, 12.4% and 2.9% of earnings. In 2017, Social Security taxes are levied on the first $127,200 of wages. Medicare taxes are assessed against all wage income. Federal excise taxes are levied on specific goods, such as transportation fuels, alcohol, and tobacco. Looking at the tax system as a whole, several observations can be made. Notably, the composition of revenues has changed over time. Corporate income tax revenues have become a smaller share of overall tax revenues over time, while social insurance revenues have trended upwards as a share of total revenues. Social insurance revenues are a sizable component of the overall federal tax system. Most taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes. Many taxpayers pay social insurance taxes but do not pay individual income taxes, having incomes below the amount that would generate a positive income tax liability. From an international perspective, the U.S. federal tax system tends to collect less in federal revenues as a percentage of GDP than other OECD countries. This report reflects the tax system as in effect in 2017. H.R. 1, the 2017 tax revision, as passed in both the House and Senate, substantially modifies the federal tax system. The purpose of this report is to review the federal tax system in 2017. Any changes to the federal tax system enacted in the 115th Congress will be explored in subsequent reports and other CRS products."
