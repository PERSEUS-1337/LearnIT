    "content": "HIV Prevention Act of 1996 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to add certain requirements relating to prevention of the transmission of the HIV virus which State Medicaid plans must incorporate in order to receive Federal approval. Includes among such requirements: (1) mandatory confidential reporting of HIV positive results by the health professional or other entity performing HIV tests to the State public health officer. (2) informing of individuals who may have been exposed to HIV by the public health officer of the State. (3) mandatory HIV testing of alleged rapists for which victims and their attorneys are notified of the results. (4) subjection to mandatory HIV testing of prospective patients who are to undergo an invasive medical procedure that would place the health professionals involved at risk of becoming infected with HIV, with the health professionals notified of the results. And (5) notification of individuals who are to undergo an invasive medical procedure by any health professional who is to perform such procedure and knows that he or she has HIV disease. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) with respect to health professionals with HIV disease who perform invasive medical procedures on patients, the medical profession should develop guidelines to assist them in complying with the requirements of this Act. (2) the States should have in effect laws providing that, in the case of individuals who know they have HIV disease, it is a felony to engage in any behaviors that the individual knows will place others at risk of infection with the disease, regardless of whether the behaviors actually transmit such infection. And (3) strict confidentiality should be maintained in carrying out the requirements added by this Act."
