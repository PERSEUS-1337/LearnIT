    "content": "Juvenile Criminal Act of 1994 - Amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to include among the Act's: (1) findings that emphasis should be placed on identifying hardcore youths who should be transferred from the juvenile justice system to the adult criminal justice system. And (2) purposes to assist State and local governments in improving the identification of hardcore juvenile offenders and the removal of such offenders from the juvenile justice system. Requires State plans under the Act to provide: (1) specified funding for the establishment and maintenance of an effective system that requires the prosecution of at least those juveniles who are 14 years of age and older as adults, rather than in juvenile proceedings, for listed offenses unless, on a case-by-case basis, the transfer of such juveniles for disposition in the juvenile justice system is determined under State law to be in the interest of justice. And (2) that the State ensure that whenever a juvenile is adjudicated in a juvenile proceeding to have engaged in such offenses that a record be kept relating to that adjudication, the juvenile be fingerprinted and photographed (with such fingerprints and photograph sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)), and the court in which the adjudication takes place transmit to the FBI information concerning the adjudication and disposition. Provides for a reduction of sums allotted to a State for a fiscal year by 16 23 percent for each of specified paragraphs of the Act with respect to which noncompliance occurs."
