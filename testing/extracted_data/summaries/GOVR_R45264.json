    "content": "The National Hurricane Center (NHC), part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) National Weather Service (NWS), is responsible for forecasting hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern Pacific Ocean. The NHC provides estimates of the path of a storm (i.e., hurricane track), the intensity, and the size and structure of the storm, as well as predictions of storm surge, rainfall, and even tornadoes. Depending on the storm's status, this information may be used to create a hurricane watch or a hurricane warning and public advisories, which are issued on an increasingly frequent basis if a storm strengthens and approaches the U.S. coastline. Three major hurricanes struck the continental United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico in 2017, causing severe damage: Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Hurricane Harvey was the first major hurricane to strike the continental U.S. coast since 2005, achieving category 4 strength before making landfall along the Texas coast on August 25, 2017. According to the NHC, Harvey \"was the most significant tropical cyclone rainfall event in United States history, both in scope and peak rainfall amounts, since reliable records began around the 1880s.\" Hurricane Irma was the second major hurricane to strike the continental U.S. coast in 2017, making landfall in the Florida Keys on September 10. Irma's large wind field produced significant storm-surge flooding along the northeastern coast of Florida, even though the storm made landfall in southwestern Florida. Puerto Rico was still recovering from damage caused by Hurricane Irma when Hurricane Maria made landfall on September 20. Maria was the deadliest storm of 2017 and is widely regarded as the worst natural disaster on record to strike Puerto Rico. For the 2018 hurricane season, the Climate Prediction Center (CPC), within the NWS, predicted 10-16 named storms, 5-9 hurricanes, and 1-4 major hurricanes in its May 24, 2018 announcement. The August 9, 2018, update to the seasonal prediction lowered those estimates to 9-13 named storms, 4-7 hurricanes, and 0-2 major hurricanes. The updated forecast indicated a less active Atlantic hurricane season in 2018 compared to the May prediction. In general, forecasts of the 2017 hurricanes' tracks were better than the previous five-year average for track forecasts. The ability to forecast hurricane tracks has improved steadily since the 1960s, increasing the likelihood of more accurately predicting landfall location. Better instruments aboard weather satellites, such as the GOES (geostationary) series and the polar-orbiting weather satellites, have contributed to these improvements, together with more sophisticated hurricane forecast models and vastly improved computing capabilities, among other factors. These factors also have improved forecasts of hurricane intensity, but they have done so in smaller increments per decade compared to improvements in track forecasts (at least until the last decade). Forecasts of intensity for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria proved more difficult than forecasts of tracks; some errors in intensity forecasts for these hurricanes exceeded the previous five-year averages for forecast errors. Indeed, perhaps the biggest challenge for the NHC is how to improve the ability to predict hurricane intensity. Furthermore, hurricane intensity itself is generally measured as highest sustained wind speeds, but that measurement does not take into consideration the storm-surge or precipitation-caused flooding, both of which may be among the most dangerous elements of a hurricane. Superstorm Sandy, for example, produced a storm surge that inundated the heavily populated coastline in New Jersey and New York to cause enormous damage. On April 18, 2017, Congress enacted P.L. 115-25, the Weather Research and Forecasting Act of 2017, which provides direction to NOAA and NWS on a range of weather-related activities, including hurricanes. The legislation's broad aim is to improve weather forecasts and warnings, and Section 104 of Title 1 specifically aims to improve hurricane forecasting. At an April 12, 2018, hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the acting Administrator for NOAA stated that NOAA would continue to follow guidelines outlined in P.L. 115-25 to improve the agency's hurricane predictions. Congress likely will continue to oversee implementation of P.L. 115-25 and may consider other legislation regarding the federal effort to improve hurricane forecasting, especially in response to active and destructive hurricane seasons, such as the one in 2017."
