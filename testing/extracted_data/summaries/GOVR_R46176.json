    "content": "The Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA; P.L. 89-329, as amended) authorizes programs and activities to provide support to individuals who are pursuing a postsecondary education and to institutions of higher education (IHEs). During the 116 th Congress, the House Committee on Education and Labor marked up and ordered to be reported the College Affordability Act ( H.R. 4674 ), which would provide for the comprehensive reauthorization of most HEA programs. This report organizes the changes proposed by H.R. 4674 into seven themes: Expanding the availability of financial aid to postsecondary students . This would primarily be accomplished by increasing funding available through grant programs and by expanding student aid eligibility criteria. This includes increasing the total maximum Pell Grant award and expanding Pell Grant eligibility to new subsets of students, increasing funding for existing student aid programs, creating a new Direct Perkins Loans program, and modifying the need assessment and Free Application for Federal Student Aid filing process. I nstitutin g borrower-focused student loan reforms . This set of proposed changes aims to ease a borrower's student loan burden. It includes amending loan terms and conditions to be more generous once an individual has entered repayment on his or her loan, modifying and making efforts to streamline student loan administrative procedures, and expanding the availability of student loan refinancing options. Modifying educational, financial, and other institutional accountability requirements for receipt of federal funds. With respect to requirements IHEs must meet to participate in the Title IV federal student aid programs, these proposed changes include revising accreditation requirements, adjusting current participation metrics, and creating new participation metrics. They also include addressing regulatory requirements of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs or activities receiving federal funds. Revising public accountability, transparency, and consumer information requirements . This would primarily be accomplished by providing consumers with additional and more nuanced information to make more informed college-going and student loan borrowing decisions. Proposed changes include repealing the student unit record system ban and requiring annual student loan counseling. Expanding academic and personal supports to specific student populations. Proposed changes include creating several new programs and reauthorizing and increasing the authorization of appropriations for several existing programs, such as TRIO and Child Care Access Means Parents in School. Increasing financial support to IHEs , focusing on minority-serving institutions. These proposals involve reauthorizing and increasing the authorization of appropriations for numerous institutional support programs. Creating new grant programs for states and IHEs to reduce students' postsecondary costs . This would be accomplished by authorizing grants to support a federal-state partnership to provide tuition-free community college."
