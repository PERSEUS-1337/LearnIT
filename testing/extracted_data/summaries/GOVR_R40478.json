    "content": "The party ratio in a House of Representatives standing committee refers to the proportional number of members of each party caucus assigned to each committee. Determining sizes, ratios, and committee assignments are among the first actions taken following a general election and at the beginning of a Congress. The Standing Rules of the House of Representatives are silent regarding committee sizes and party ratios; the apportionment of committee seats is a decision of the majority leadership that may include discussions between majority and minority party leaderships. Historically, the number of majority seats on some committees has exceeded, in varying degrees, the strength of the majority party in the House chamber, regardless of which party has been in power. This generally has ensured that the majority party has a sufficient number of members distributed across committees to control voting in many committees. The exception has been the House Committee on Ethics (known as the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct prior to the 112th Congress), for which House Rules guarantee an equal share of the seats to the two parties. This report shows House committee party ratios for 18 Congresses, covering the period from the 98th Congress (1983-1985) through February 2017, the first part of the 115th Congress (2017-2019). Table 1 shows a comparison of majority party strength in the House chamber with total majority committee seats for the 98th Congress through the beginning of the 115th Congress. Unfilled seats on committees (if so noted in the Clerk's lists) are counted in individual and overall committee totals for consistency. Tables 2-19 show for each of the 18 Congresses examined, by majority, minority, and Independents (where present) House party breakdown and majority margin; total committee seats, majority and minority committee seats, and majority margin; the standing and select committees (with legislative jurisdiction) as established and named in each Congress; committee seats allocated to the majority and minority parties, including Independents (where present), for each committee; and majority-minority seat margin for each committee. Committee ratios data for this report are from the official committee lists for each Congress issued by the Clerk of the House, using editions that generally reflect the party ratios in effect at the beginning of each Congress. Later versions of the Clerk's lists, or the use of alternate sources or methodologies, may yield different results. Independent Members are listed separately, consistent with the Clerk's committee lists. Tables for each Congress include the standing committees and any permanent select committees as established and named in each Congress."
