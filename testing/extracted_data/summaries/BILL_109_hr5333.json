Or (2) any other surface-to-air missile system designed to be operated and fired by more than one individual acting as a crew and portable by several individuals.

Authorizes the Secretary of State to carry out an accelerated global program to secure, remove, or eliminate stocks of MANPADS and other conventional weapons that pose a proliferation, security, or humanitarian threat. States that it should be US policy to hold foreign governments accountable for knowingly transferring MANPADS to state-sponsors of terrorism or terrorist organizations. Directs the President, upon a determination that a foreign government which has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism knowingly transfers MANPADS to a foreign government or a terrorist organization, to: (1) report such information to the appropriate congressional committees. And (2) impose specified foreign assistance and military assistance sanctions on the transferring government. Exempts humanitarian assistance from such prohibition.
