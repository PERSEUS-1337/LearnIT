    "content": "Conferees on the House and Senate energy bills ( H.R. 6 ) met on November 17,2003 and approved a conference report. On November 18, 2003, the House approved the Conferencereport to H.R. 6 by a vote of 246-180. On November 21, 2003, a cloture motion to limitdebate on H.R. 6 in the Senate failed by a vote of 57-40. This report describes Title XII of the conference report on H.R. 6 which dealswith electric power issues. In part, this Title would create an electric reliability organization (ERO)that would enforce mandatory reliability standards for the bulk-power system. All ERO standardswould be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Under this Title, theERO could impose penalties on a user, owner, or operator of the bulk-power system that violates anyFERC-approved reliability standard. This Title also addresses transmission infrastructure issues. The Secretary of Energy would be able to certify congestion on the transmission lines and issuepermits to transmission owners. Permit holders would be able to petition in U.S. District Court toacquire rights-of-way for the construction of transmission lines through the exercise of the right ofeminent domain. The Standard Market Design notice of proposed rulemaking would be remanded to theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Conference report would clarify native load serviceobligation. Federal utilities would be allowed to participate in regional transmission organizations. The electricity Title would repeal the mandatory purchase requirements under the PublicUtility Regulatory Policy Act. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA) wouldbe repealed. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state regulatory bodies would be givenaccess to utility books and records. FERC would be required to issue rules to establish an electronic system that providesinformation about the availability and price of wholesale electric energy and transmission services. For electric rates that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission finds to be unjust, unreasonable,or unduly discriminatory, the effective date for refunds would begin at the time of the filing of acomplaint with FERC but not later than five months after filing of a complaint. Criminal and civilpenalties would be increased. The Secretary of Energy would be required to transmit to Congress a study on whetherFERC's merger review authority is duplicative with other agencies' authority. The Federal Power Actwould be amended to give FERC review authority for transfer of assets valued in excess of $10million. This report will be updated as events warrant."
