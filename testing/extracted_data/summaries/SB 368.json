    "content": "Existing law, with certain exceptions, establishes 8 hours as a day\u2019s work and a 40-hour workweek, workweek and requires payment of prescribed overtime compensation for additional hours worked. Existing law authorizes the adoption by 23 of employees in a work unit of alternative workweek schedules providing for workdays no longer than 10 hours within a 40-hour workweek. This bill would enact the California Workplace Flexibility Act of 2015. 2016. The bill would permit an individual nonexempt employee to request an employee-selected flexible work schedule providing for workdays up to 10 hours per day within a 40-hour workweek, workweek and would allow the employer to implement this schedule without the obligation to pay overtime compensation for those additional hours in a workday. The bill would prescribe a method for calculating the payment of overtime for hours worked in excess of the permitted amounts and would establish requirements for termination of these agreements. The bill would except from its provisions employees covered by collective bargaining and public employees, as specified. The bill would require the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement in the Department of Industrial Relations to enforce this provision and adopt regulations."
