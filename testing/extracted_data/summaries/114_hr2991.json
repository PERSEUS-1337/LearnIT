    "content": "Preparing More Welfare Recipients for Work Act This bill amends part A (TANF) of title IV of the Social Security Act with respect to mandatory work requirements to: eliminate the requirement that recipients participate in certain core work activities not fewer than 20 hours per week, as well as separate requirements for two-parent families. Allow states to receive partial credit for certain families participating for less than the minimum hours required for purposes of calculating the monthly participation rate. Give states the option to apply an alternative work participation rate calculation, revise requirements for counting job search as work. Modify the rule deeming an individual to meet work participation requirements by attending secondary school. Require a state to meet individuals participating for three months in job readiness assistance and certify whether continued participation is necessary to prepare them for employment. Replace with job readiness assistance as a separate work activity the currently recognized work activity of providing child care services to a participant in a community service program. And increase from 12 to 24 months the maximum period that vocational educational training counts as a work activity."
