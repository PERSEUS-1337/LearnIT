    "content": "Student Financial Aid Data Privacy Protection Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to take actions necessary to maintain confidence in the National Student Loan Data System, at a minimum: (1) ensuring that guaranty agencies, lenders, and schools primarily access it for legitimate program operations. (2) prohibiting nongovernmental researchers or policy analysts from accessing personally identifiable information. (3) creating a disclosure form for actual and potential students describing the contents of, and access to, the system. (4) requiring guaranty agencies, lenders, and schools to inform borrowers of Federal Family Education Loans, Direct Loans, and Perkins Loans that such a loan will be submitted to the system and accessible to such entities. (5) regularly review the system to delete inactive users, monitor use, and ensure that data is not used for marketing purposes. And (6) developing standardized protocols for limiting access. Requires the Secretary to study and report to Congress on: (1) mechanisms giving borrowers the option of restricting lender access to their system records, and (2) appropriate risk-based protocols for limiting access."
