    "content": "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created in 1958 by the National Aeronautics and Space Act (P.L. 85-568) to conduct civilian space and aeronautics activities. It has four mission directorates. The Science Mission Directorate manages robotic science missions, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, the Mars rover Curiosity, and satellites for Earth science research. The Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate conducts research and development on aircraft and aviation systems. The Space Technology Mission Directorate develops technologies for use in future space missions, such as advanced propulsion and laser communications. The Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate is responsible for human spaceflight activities, including the International Space Station and development efforts for future crewed spacecraft. In addition, NASA's Office of Education manages formal and informal education programs for school children, college and university students, and the general public. While Congress is generally supportive of most NASA programs, government-wide fiscal constraints make funding decisions challenging. The Administration has requested $19.025 billion for NASA in FY2017. This amount is 1.3% less than the FY2016 appropriation of $19.285 billion. Unusually, the FY2017 request includes $763 million in mandatory funds. The House bill (H.R. 5393) would provide $19.508 billion. The Senate bill (S. 2837) would provide $19.306 billion. Neither bill includes mandatory funding. The FY2017 request for the Science Mission Directorate is $5.601 billion, an increase of 0.2% from FY2016. Within this total, funding for Earth Science, Astrophysics, and Heliophysics would increase, while funding for Planetary Science and the James Webb Space Telescope would decrease. The House bill would provide $5.597 billion for Science, while the Senate bill would provide $5.395 billion. Within these totals, the bills differ considerably in their allocation of funding between Earth Science and Planetary Science. The FY2017 request for the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate is $790 million, an increase of 23.5% from FY2016. The request includes New Aviation Horizons (NAH), a new initiative of experimental aircraft and systems demonstrations. The House and Senate bills would provide $712 million and $601 million, respectively, for Aeronautics. The FY2017 request for the Space Technology Mission Directorate is $827 million, an increase of 20.4% from FY2016. The House and Senate bills would provide $739 million and $687 million. For the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, the FY2017 request for Exploration is $3.337 billion, a decrease of 17.2% from FY2016, while the request for Space Operations is $5.076 billion, an increase of 0.9%. The Exploration request includes $1.263 billion, a decrease of 35.2%, for Space Launch System launch vehicle development. Funding for the Commercial Crew program (formerly requested in Exploration) is combined with funding for operational cargo and crew transport to the International Space Station in a new Space Transportation item within Space Operations. The House bill would provide $4.183 billion for Exploration, including $2.000 billion for SLS development, and $4.890 billion for Space Operations. The Senate bill would provide $4.330 billion for Exploration, including $2.150 billion for the SLS, and $4.951 billion for Space Operations. The FY2017 request for the Office of Education is $100 million, a decrease of 13.0% from FY2016. The House and Senate bills would provide $115 million and $108 million, respectively. The request would reduce funding for the National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program, the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, and the Minority University Research Education Program. Both bills would fund these programs at their FY2016 levels."
