    "content": "Home Construction Lending Regulatory Improvement Act of 2011 - Directs the appropriate federal banking agencies to initiate a coordinated rulemaking with respect to financial institutions under their respective jurisdictions that make real estate loans to home builders. Requires such rulemaking to provide for: (1) elimination of the 100 of bank capital measurement, (2) realistic market-based appraisals, and (3) a prohibition against compelling lenders to call or curtail loans in good standing. Prohibits a federal banking agency also from preventing a qualified financial institution from making a real estate loan to a home builder that has a viable project."
