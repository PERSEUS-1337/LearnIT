    "title": "AB 2405",
    "content": "Existing law prohibits an employer who employs 25 or more employees working at the same location from discharging or discriminating against an employee who is a parent, as defined, having custody of a child in a licensed child day care facility or in kindergarten or grades 1 to 12, inclusive, for taking off up to 40 hours each year to find, enroll, or reenroll their child in a school, to participate in school activities, or address emergency situations at school, subject to specified conditions. Existing law requires an employee to use vacation or other paid time off when taking time off under these provisions and authorizes the use of unpaid time off, to the extent made available by the employer. This bill would require an employer to annually provide an employee at least 24 8 hours of paid time off for the purposes of a planned absence under these provisions, except as specified, and would instead authorize an employee to use vacation or paid time off, or use unpaid time off, if available, when taking time off under these provisions. The bill would provide a remedy to an employee whose request for time off under these provisions is denied by the employer. The bill would require the Labor Commissioner to create a poster listing the protections available to employees and would require an employer to post it at the workplace, as specified."
