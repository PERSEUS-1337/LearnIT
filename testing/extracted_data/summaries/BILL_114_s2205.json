    "content": "Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts Act of 2015 This bill permits the Department of Justice (DOJ) to award grants to tribal governments acting in partnership with state or local governments for tribal healing to wellness courts. Courts receiving grants must monitor individuals under their jurisdiction and must periodically test each individual for drug use. DOJ may require these courts to increase punitive or treatment responses for an individual who fails a drug test. Violent offenders may not be under the jurisdiction of these courts unless the court has received a waiver from DOJ."
