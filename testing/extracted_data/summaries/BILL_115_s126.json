    "content": "Repeal ID Act of 2017 This bill repeals provisions of the REAL ID Act of 2005 that prohibit federal agencies from accepting state-issued driver's licenses or identification cards that do meet minimum specified security requirements. The bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish minimum standards for federal agency acceptance of state-issued driver's licenses and personal identification cards for purposes of identification. A federal agency may not accept such a driver's license or identification card issued more than two years after promulgation of such standards unless it conforms with such standards. Each state shall certify to DOT that the state is in compliance with such standards. DOT shall award grants to assist states to conform driver's licenses and identification cards to such standards."
