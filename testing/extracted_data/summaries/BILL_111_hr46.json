    "content": "Family Self-Sufficiency Act of 2009 - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to revise requirements for the administrative fee payable to public housing agencies to cover the costs of administering family self-sufficiency programs in connection with the housing choice voucher program of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Prescribes: (1) a base fee for a public housing agency serving 25 or more program participants equal to the costs of employing one full-time family self-sufficiency coordinator. And (2) an additional fee for an agency meeting minimum performance standards to cover the costs of employing a second coordinator if the agency has 75 or more participating families, and a third coordinator if it has 125 or more participating families. Permits the Secretary to reserve certain amounts to provide support to or reward family self-sufficiency programs that are particularly innovative or highly successful in achieving program goals."
