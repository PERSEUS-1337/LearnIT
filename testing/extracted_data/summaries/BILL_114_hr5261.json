    "content": "Protecting the US Corporate Tax Base Act of 2016 This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise the rules for taxing the earnings and determining the stock ownership of certain controlled foreign corporations (CFCs). The bill provides that, in the case of certain CFCs, subpart F income includes a US shareholder's pro rata share of any increase in the CFC's investment of earnings in certain foreign property. The bill also revises the rules for determining stock ownership to prohibit a CFC from transferring stock to a foreign affiliate to reduce the portion of stock owned by US shareholders below the level required to be considered a CFC."
