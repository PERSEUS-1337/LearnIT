    "title": "AB 2618",
    "content": "The Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982 specifies the requirements for the establishment of a community facilities district, including, among other things, a petition, a hearing, the establishment of the boundaries of the community facilities district, and an election on the question. Existing law authorizes a community facilities district formed pursuant to an alternative procedure under which the district initially consists solely of territory proposed for annexation to the community facilities district in the future and territory is annexed and subjected to special taxes only upon unanimous approval of the owners, to finance and refinance the acquisition, installation, and improvement of energy efficiency, water conservation, and renewable energy improvements. This bill would authorize a community facilities district that is formed pursuant to the alternative procedure to additionally finance seismic retrofitting, as specified. This bill would incorporate changes to Section 53328.1 of the Government Code proposed by both this bill and AB 2693, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last."
