Dairy pricing refers to the process of establishing the farm value of milk. The federal government plays a prominent role in that process. Among the dairy pricing issues are how milk producers receive price signals under existing policy and how that affects their production decisions. Some market participants say that the system does not transmit price signals to milk producers quickly enough, which can delay the response of producers needed to correct market imbalances. Another issue is farm milk price variability and managing price risks, given declines in dairy price supports and increased dependence on exports over the years, which have contributed to greater price volatility. Finally, some observers are concerned about the farm share of retail prices for dairy products and whether retail prices track changes in the farm milk price. The difference between farm and retail prices has declined in recent months after increasing in late 2008. Dairy pricing in the United States is a unique combination of market-based and administered (through public dairy programs) prices. Each influences the other to determine the overall price level and price movements to some extent. Two characteristics\u2014perishability and production on a daily basis\u2014create challenges for pricing and marketing milk (and the products made from it). Market-based pricing for milk and dairy products is similar to many other agricultural commodities, in that primary mechanisms for price discovery like cash and futures markets, such as those located at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), play key roles. Wholesale cash prices for dairy products (cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk) are determined daily at the CME. The prices written into contracts nationwide between dairy manufacturers and wholesale or retail buyers of basic dairy products often reflect CME prices. Some producers have raised concerns about limited trading volumes and the potential for price manipulation at the CME. Administered farm milk prices are derived from two government policies that originated more than 50 years ago: the dairy product price support program (DPPSP) and federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs). The two policies operate independently until market prices decline to support levels. The DPPSP simply provides price support for dairy farmers through government purchases of butter, American cheese, and nonfat dry milk from dairy processors at legislated prices. In contrast, the FMMO system generally does not support prices but is designed to stabilize market conditions, which had been chaotic in the 1920s and early 1930s, through monthly, market-based minimum prices that processors must pay for farm milk. FMMO prices are based on current wholesale product prices, which are determined largely by prices established on the CME. FMMOs also provide for sharing farm revenue across producers in certain geographic areas and for balancing marketing power between milk handlers, who reportedly held an advantage prior to FMMO development, and farmers. Current policy is set for DPPSP until 2012 under the 2008 farm bill, and FMMOs are permanently authorized. As Congress, the Administration, and the dairy industry consider how to revise the dairy pricing system, two schools of thought appear to be emerging. One is to reduce price volatility through some means of supply control while raising farm prices. The other is to allow the market to fluctuate and help farmers manage the resulting price risk through hedging strategies used by farmers in other parts of the agriculture sector."
