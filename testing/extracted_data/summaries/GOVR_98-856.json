    "content": "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided at its scheduled meeting, held on April 29, 2009, to leave unchanged the target rate for federal funds, which is now at a range from 0% to \u00bc%. In doing so, it took notice of its previous decision to add up to $1.75 trillion to the reserves of depository institutions by purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities ($1.25 trillion), agency debt ($200 billion), and Treasury securities ($300 billion). It also repeated that other measures had been adopted to facilitate the flow of credit to households and small businesses. In making its decision, the FOMC stressed that while the pace of the economic contraction appears to have slowed somewhat, the following factors remain: (1) a continuing pattern of job losses, lower household wealth, and tight credit; (2) the decline in global demand is increasing; and (3) while inflationary pressures remain subdued, they may be inconsistent with longer term growth and price stability (meaning that the United States may be facing deflation in the future). Nevertheless, a gradual recovery of sustainable economic growth in the context of price stability is expected to begin, given Fed action to stabilize financial markets and institutions and the monetary and fiscal stimulus now in place. The FOMC pledged to employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth in a stable price environment. It expects that this will require an exceptionally low federal funds target for some time. The Board of Governors also decided to keep unchanged the discount rate for primary credit at \u00bd%. The next scheduled meeting of the FOMC is set for June 23-24, 2009. This report will be updated as events warrant."
