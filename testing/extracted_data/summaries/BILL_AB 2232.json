    "title": "AB 2232",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes the trial court clerk to destroy court records, as defined, after notice of destruction, if there is no request and order for transfer of the records, upon the expiration of specified time periods after final disposition of the case. Existing law generally provides that court records of a criminal proceeding relating to a misdemeanor violation may be destroyed after 5 years, but that court records of a criminal proceeding relating to a misdemeanor violation for speed contests, driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or driving under the influence and causing bodily injury, may be destroyed after 10 years. This bill would decrease the time period that a court record of a misdemeanor violation for speed contests must be retained before it can be destroyed by the trial court clerk from 10 years to 5 years. The bill would increase the time period that a court record of a misdemeanor violation for reckless driving must be retained before it can be destroyed by the trial court clerk from 5 years to 10 years."
