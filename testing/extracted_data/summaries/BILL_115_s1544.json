    "content": "No Funds for Cyber Coordination with Russia Act of 2017 This bill prohibits federal funds from being used to establish a cyber security unit in cooperation with the government of the Russian Federation. It is the sense of Congress that the President: (1) should publicly endorse the assessment of the Armed Forces and the intelligence community that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election and take measures to deter such future activities. (2) must not use taxpayer funds to engage in cyber coordination with the Russian government, a foreign adversary. And (3) should work with Congress to establish a non-partisan commission of experts to report on Russian cyber operations and other attempts to interfere in the 2016 election."
