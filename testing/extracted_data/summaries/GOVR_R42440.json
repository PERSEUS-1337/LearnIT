The Administration requests a total of $62.076 billion for the agencies and bureaus funded as a part of the annual Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) appropriations bill. The Administration's request includes $7.978 billion for the Department of Commerce, $28.079 billion for the Department of Justice, $25.090 billion for the science agencies, and $929.2 million for the related agencies. The FY2013 request for CJS is 1.9% greater than the FY2012 appropriation of $60.910 billion. On April 19, 2012, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013 (S. 2323). The bill includes a total of $61.762 billion for the agencies and bureaus that would be funded by the bill. The Senate committee-reported amount is 1.4% greater than the FY2012 appropriation of $60.910 billion, but it is 0.1% below the Administration's request. The bill includes $6.288 billion for the Department of Commerce, $27.866 billion for the Department of Justice, $26.679 billion for the science agencies, and $929.2 million for the related agencies. On May 10, 2012, the House passed the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 5326). The bill would provide $60.879 billion for CJS. The House-passed amount is under 0.1% less than the FY2012 appropriation, 1.5% less than the Administration's request, and 1.4% below the Senate Committee on Appropriation's mark. The bill includes $7.663 billion for the Department of Commerce, $27.584 billion for the Department of Justice, $24.786 billion for the science agencies, and $845.9 million for the related agencies. On March 26, 2013, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6). The act provides a total of $60.638 billion for CJS. This amount includes $7.726 billion for the Department of Commerce, $27.305 billion for the Department of Justice, $24.737 billion for the science agencies, and $870.1 million for the related agencies. This report will track and describe actions taken by the Administration and Congress to provide FY2013 appropriations for CJS accounts. It also provides an overview of FY2012 appropriations for agencies and bureaus funded as a part of the annual appropriation for CJS. The source for the FY2012-enacted amounts is the conference report for the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-55, H.Rept. 112-284). FY2013-requested amounts were taken from S.Rept. 112-158 and the appendix to the Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2013. The Senate committee-reported amounts were taken from S.Rept. 112-158 and the House-passed amounts were taken from H.Rept. 112-463 and the version of H.R. 5326 passed by the House. The amounts provided in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) were taken from the text of the act and rescissions of FY2013 budget authority were calculated by CRS."
