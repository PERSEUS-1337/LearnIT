    "content": "Amends Federal transportation law to require foreign air carriers to transmit to the Secretary of Transportation and the Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board a plan for addressing the needs of families of passengers involved in aircraft accidents involving foreign air carriers and a significant loss of life. Requires such a plan to include: (1) publicizing a reliable, toll-free telephone number and staff to take calls from families of passengers involved in such an accident. (2) a process for notifying such families as soon as possible, and in person to the extent practicable, before providing any public notice of the passengers' names. (3) an assurance that each passenger's family will be consulted about the disposition of any remains and personal effects within the foreign air carrier's control. (4) an assurance of retention by the foreign air carrier of unclaimed possessions for at least 18 months. And (5) an assurance of other specified services. Makes inclusion of such a plan in the application for a foreign air transportation permit, or request for exemption from the requirement of a permit, a condition for approval. Declares that a foreign air carrier shall not be liable for damages in any action brought in a Federal or State court arising out of the foreign air carrier's performance in preparing or providing a passenger list pursuant to such a plan, unless the liability was caused by any conduct of the carrier which was grossly negligent or which constituted intentional misconduct."
