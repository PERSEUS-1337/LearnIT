The nuclear fuel cycle is the cradle-to-grave life cycle from extracting uranium ore from the earth through power production in a nuclear reactor to permanent disposal of the resulting spent nuclear fuel. The front-end of the nuclear fuel cycle considers the portion of the nuclear fuel cycle leading up to electrical power production in a nuclear reactor. The front-end of the nuclear fuel cycle has four stages: mining and milling, conversion, enrichment, and fabrication. Mining and milling is the process of removing uranium ore from the earth, and physically and chemically processing the ore to develop \"yellow-cake\" uranium concentrate. Uranium conversion produces uranium hexafluoride, a gaseous form of uranium, from uranium concentrate. Uranium enrichment physically separates and concentrates the fissile isotope U-235. The enriched uranium used in nuclear power reactors is approximately 3%-5% U-235, while weapons-grade enriched uranium is greater than 90% U-235. Nuclear fuel fabrication involves manufacturing enriched uranium fuel rods and assemblies highly specific to a nuclear power reactor. Historically, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), a predecessor federal agency to the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), promoted uranium production through federal procurement contracts between 1947 and 1971. Since the late 1980s, U.S. nuclear utilities and reactor operators have purchased increasingly more foreign-origin uranium for reactor fuel than domestically produced uranium. In 1987, about half of uranium used in domestic nuclear reactors was foreign origin. By 2018, however, 93% of uranium used in U.S. nuclear reactors was foreign origin. No uranium conversion facilities currently operate in the United States. There is one operational U.S. commercial uranium enrichment facility, which has the capacity to enrich approximately one-third of the country's annual reactor requirements. In addition to newly mined uranium, U.S. nuclear power reactors also rely on secondary sources of uranium materials. These sources include federal and commercial stockpiles, reenrichment of depleted uranium, excess feed from underfeeding during commercial enrichment, and downblending of higher enriched uranium. The global uranium market operates with multiple industries exchanging uranium products and services through separate, nondirect, and interrelated markets. Producers, suppliers, and utilities buy, sell, store, and transfer uranium materials. Nuclear utilities and reactor operators diversify fuel sources among primary and secondary supply, and may acquire uranium from multiple domestic and foreign suppliers and servicers. For example, a nuclear power utility in the United States may purchase uranium concentrate that has been mined and milled in Australia, converted in France, enriched in Germany, and fabricated into fuel in the United States. On January 16, 2018, two domestic uranium producers\u00e2\u0080\u0094representatives from the uranium mining/milling industry\u00e2\u0080\u0094petitioned the U.S. Department of Commerce to conduct a Section 232 investigation pursuant to the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a71862) to examine whether U.S. uranium imports pose a threat to national security. The department found that uranium imports into the United States posed a threat to national security as defined under Section 232. In a July 12, 2019, memorandum, President Trump announced he did not concur with the Department of Commerce's \"finding that uranium imports threaten to impair the national security of the United States as defined under section 232 of the Act.\" The Section 232 uranium investigation into uranium imports has increased the discussion about the nuclear fuel supply chain and potential future U.S. uranium needs. Included in the July 12, 2019, memorandum, the Trump Administration established a Nuclear Fuel Working Group, to assess the challenges facing the domestic uranium industry and to consider options to \"revive and expand the nuclear energy sector.\" Given uncertainties regarding the long-term viability of the domestic uranium production and commercial nuclear power sectors, continued issues associated with the front-end of the nuclear fuel cycle may persist."
