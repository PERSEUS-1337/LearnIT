    "content": "High Plains Groundwater Resource Conservation Act - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture in FY 2002 through 2011 to provide cost-share payments, incentive payments, and technical assistance to eligible producers who enter into contracts with the Secretary through a High Plains Aquifer Groundwater Conservation Incentives Program. Requires the Secretary to provide financial and technical assistance, including modeling and engineering design to States, tribes, and counties, conservation districts, and other political subdivisions recognized under State law for the development of groundwater conservation plans within the High Plains. Requires the creation of a certification process for such plans developed under this program or developed independently by such entities. Provides that, to be certified, a plan must achieve significant per acre savings of groundwater from the Aquifer and must meet the criteria specified by this Act. Directs the Commodity Credit Corporation to make available specified amounts in FY 2002 through 2011 to carry out such Program. Requires that lands eligible for the Environmental Conservation Acreage Reserve Program which would result in significant per acre savings of groundwater resources of the Aquifer if removed from agriculture production be awarded 90 Program bid points, to be designated as groundwater conservation points, in addition to any other ratings such lands may receive."
