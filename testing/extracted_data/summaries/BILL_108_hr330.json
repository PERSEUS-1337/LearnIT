    "content": "Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 2003 - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to extend from August 1, 2002 to August 1, 2017 the indemnification authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Secretary of Energy (Secretary) with respect to certain licensees, Department of Energy (DOE) contractors, and nonprofit educational institutions, respectively. Increases the maximum amount of standard deferred premium that may be assessed a licensee following a nuclear incident. Specifies $10 billion as the aggregate amount by which the Secretary must indemnify DOE contractors above the amount of the financial protection required for each nuclear incident. Increases from $100 million to $500 million the indemnification limits for incidents outside the United States. Mandates an indemnification inflation adjustment at least once every five years. Instructs the NRC to consider a combination of modular reactors at a single site. Repeals the requirement that the Secretary determine by rule whether nonprofit educational institutions should receive automatic remissions of civil monetary penalties for violations of DOE regulations. Limits the civil liability incurred by not-for-profit contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers to the total amount of fees paid within any one-year period under the contract to which the violation occurs."
