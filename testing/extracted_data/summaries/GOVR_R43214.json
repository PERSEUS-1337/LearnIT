    "content": "The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) requires covered employers to allow eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month period to care for a newborn, adopted, or foster child; to care for a family member with a serious health condition; or because of the employee's own serious health condition. The act allows eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of leave because of \"qualifying exigencies\" when a family member who is in the Armed Forces or National Guard is deployed overseas. An employee may also take up to 26 weeks of leave during a single 12-month period to care for a servicemember who was seriously injured while on active duty. To assist Congress in evaluating proposals to expand or limit the availability of FMLA leave, this report uses data from two household surveys. The Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) supplement to the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) is used to estimate the number of employees who may or may not be eligible for FMLA leave. Data from a 2012 survey conducted for the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) are used to compare the use of leave for FMLA-related reasons by employees who may or may not be eligible for leave. An analysis of employees ages 18 and over shows that a majority of employees may be eligible for FMLA leave. Based on responses from 91,349 employees to the ASEC supplement, in 2011 an estimated 56.5% of employees were likely eligible for FMLA leave. According to the 2012 DOL survey of 2,852 employees, approximately 59.2% of employees may be eligible for FMLA leave. According to the 2012 DOL employee survey, an estimated 15.9% of employees who may have been eligible for FMLA leave used leave for FMLA-related reasons in the year before they were surveyed. By contrast, approximately 10.2% of employees who were likely ineligible for FMLA leave took leave for FMLA-related reasons. According to the ASEC supplement, in 2011 men were more likely than women to be eligible for FMLA leave (57.2% compared to 55.6%). However, according to the 2012 DOL employee survey, women were more likely than men to take leave for FMLA-related reasons. Among employees who were likely eligible for leave, 17.9% of women and 14.1% of men took leave in the past year. Employees between the ages of 34 and 49 were more likely (62.7%) than younger (48.5%) or older (57.9%) workers to be eligible for FMLA leave. But, workers ages 50 and over were more likely (17.9%) to have taken leave in the past year for FMLA-related reasons. Married employees were more likely (60.4%) than employees who were not married to be eligible for FMLA leave. Married workers were also more likely (16.8%) than unmarried workers to have taken FMLA-related leave in the past year. For a majority of employees (56.6%), the most recent medical reason for taking leave was for the employee's own illness. Employees with a Bachelor's or advanced degree were more likely than other employees to be eligible for FMLA leave. By contrast, employees with a high school degree or less were more likely than other employees to have taken FMLA-related leave in the past year. An estimated 91.0% of federal, 80.5% of state, and 73.5% of local government employees may be eligible for FMLA leave, compared to 52.1% of private-sector employees. The percentage of employees who may be eligible for FMLA leave increased with annual earnings. On the other hand, among employees who were likely ineligible for FMLA leave, the percentage who took leave for FMLA-related reasons in the past year was higher among employees with lower incomes. Approximately 75.3% of employers with FMLA-eligible employees report that it is \"very\" or \"somewhat\" easy to comply with the FMLA, while 14.6% report that it is \"very\" or \"somewhat\" difficult to comply with the FMLA. In the years before 1993, when the FMLA was enacted, the U.S. workforce and American family had changed. The labor force participation rate for women had been rising steadily, more married women with children were working, and more families were headed by single parents. For employees who did not have job-protected family or medical leave, the FMLA was intended to address these changes. Since it was enacted, supporters of the FMLA have proposed different ways to expand the program. Among the changes are proposals to expand employee eligibility, cover more employers, allow eligible employees to take leave to care for more family or household members, or expand the types of FMLA leave. On the other hand, others have proposed changes that would narrow the definition of a serious health condition or curtail the use of intermittent leave for a chronic health condition. In general, those who favor expanding the FMLA argue that these changes would further the objectives of the act. For a number of reasons, some employers and policymakers may oppose an expansion of FMLA leave. For instance, expansion could increase employer administrative and operating costs. If additional employees become eligible for, and take, FMLA leave, employers may have to make more adjustments to work schedules. In order to maintain the same level of output of goods or services, some employers may need to hire more workers or pay more workers for overtime. An expansion of FMLA leave could create an incentive for employers to hire more part-time workers. Extending FMLA coverage to smaller employers could impose greater costs on those employers than on larger employers."
