    "content": "Honduras, a Central American nation of 9.1 million people, has had close ties with the United States for many years. The country served as a base for U.S. operations designed to counter Soviet influence in Central America during the 1980s, and it continues to host a U.S. military presence and cooperate on antidrug efforts today. Trade and investment linkages are also long-standing and have grown stronger since the implementation of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) in 2006. In recent years, instability in Honduras\u2014including a 2009 coup and significant outflows of migrants and asylum-seekers since 2014\u2014has led U.S. policymakers to focus greater attention on conditions in the country and their implications for the United States. Domestic Situation President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez of the conservative National Party was inaugurated to a second four-year term in January 2018. He lacks legitimacy among many Hondurans, however, due to allegations that his 2017 reelection was unconstitutional and marred by fraud. Over the past five years, Honduras has made some progress in reducing violence and putting public finances on a more sustainable path. Anti-corruption efforts have also made some headway, largely as a result of cooperation between the Honduran public prosecutor's office and the Organization of American States-backed Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras. Nevertheless, considerable challenges remain. Honduras continues to be one of the poorest countries in Latin America, with more than 67% of Hondurans living below the poverty line. It also remains one of the most violent countries in the world and continues to suffer from persistent human rights abuses and widespread impunity. Moreover, the country's tentative progress in combating corruption has generated a fierce backlash, calling into question the sustainability of those efforts. U.S. Policy In recent years, U.S. policy in Honduras has been guided by the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, a whole-of-government effort designed to promote economic prosperity, strengthen governance, and improve security in Honduras and the rest of the region. Congress has appropriated more than $2.6 billion for the strategy since FY2016, at least $431 million of which has been allocated to Honduras. Continued U.S. engagement in the region is uncertain, however, as the Trump Administration announced in March 2019 that it intends to end foreign assistance programs in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala due to the continued northward flow of migrants and asylum-seekers to the United States. The 116th Congress could play an important role in shaping U.S. policy toward Honduras and the broader region. Several legislative initiatives that have been introduced\u2014including H.R. 2615, S. 1445, and H.R. 2836\u2014would authorize foreign assistance for certain activities in Central America. Congress will also consider FY2020 foreign aid appropriations. H.R. 2839 would appropriate $540.9 million for the Central America strategy, including at least $75 million for Honduras. That would be $96 million more than the Administration requested for Central America and about $9 million more than the Administration requested for Honduras. Other bills Congress may consider would tie U.S. security assistance to human rights conditions in Honduras (H.R. 1945), tie U.S. assistance to the number of unaccompanied Honduran children that arrive at the U.S. border (H.R. 2049), and expand in-country refugee processing in Honduras (H.R. 2347)."
