    "content": "Oversight of Sensitive Military Operations Act - Directs the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to notify the congressional defense and appropriations committees of any sensitive military operation promptly following such operation. Requires: (1) the Secretary to submit to such committees procedures for complying with such requirement consistent with US national security and the protection of operational integrity, and (2) such committees to ensure that committee procedures designed to protect the unauthorized disclosure of US national security information are sufficient to protect the information submitted. Makes the notification requirement inapplicable to a sensitive military operation executed within Afghanistan pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force. Requires the Secretary to submit to such committees an explanation of the legal and policy considerations and approval processes used in determining whether an individual or group could become the target of a sensitive military operation. Directs the Secretary to provide such committees quarterly briefings on DOD counterterrorism operations and related activities involving special operations forces."
