    "title": "An act to amend Sections 10506.4 and 10506.5 of, to amend the heading of Article 1.5 (commencing with Section 10506.4) of Chapter 2.1 of Part 2 of Division 2 of, and to repeal Sections 10506.8 and 10506.9 of, the Public Contract Code, relating to public contracts.",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes, through January 1, 2017, a pilot program for the Regents of the University of California to contract for certain types of projects on the university of the University of California based on the best value procedures, as specified. Existing law defines the term \u201cuniversity\u201d to mean the campuses of the University of California, including the medical centers. The law requires, on or before January 1, 2016, the Regents of the University of California to report to specific committees of the Legislature regarding the pilot program, including, among other information, a description of the projects awarded using the best value procedures. This bill would extend the provisions of the pilot program until January 1, 2018, and would repeal the reporting requirement. This bill would modify the definition of the term \u201cuniversity\u201d to mean all locations of the University of California. By extending the requirement that bidders verify specified information under oath, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program by expanding the scope of an existing crime. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
