    "title": "AB 2687",
    "content": "Existing law makes it unlawful for a person who is under the influence of any alcoholic beverage or drug to drive a vehicle. Existing law makes it unlawful for a person who has 0.04 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a commercial motor vehicle, as defined. Existing law also makes it unlawful for a person who has 0.04 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a commercial motor vehicle and concurrently do any act forbidden by law or neglect any duty imposed by law that proximately causes bodily injury to another person other than the driver. This bill would make it unlawful, commencing July 1, 2018, for a person who has 0.04 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a motor vehicle when a passenger for hire, as defined, is a passenger in the vehicle at the time of the offense. The bill would also make it unlawful, commencing July 1, 2018, for a person who has 0.04 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a motor vehicle, as specified, and concurrently do any act or neglect any duty that proximately causes bodily injury to another person other than the driver. Because this bill would expand the application of a crime to more people, it would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
