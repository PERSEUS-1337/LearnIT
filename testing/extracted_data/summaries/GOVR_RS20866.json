    "content": "At the direction of Congress primarily through Water Resources Development Acts (WRDAs), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (an agency within the Department of Defense) undertakes water resources projects. The agency's civil works mission has expanded beyond its original responsibility of improving and maintaining navigable channels; the mission now includes flood control, emergency and disaster response, environmental restoration, municipal water infrastructure, and other activities. The non-federal sponsors and the federal government (primarily through the annual Energy and Water Development Appropriations Acts) share the cost of most Corps projects and activities. This report outlines the agency's organization, project development process, civil works appropriations, and evolution of its responsibilities."
