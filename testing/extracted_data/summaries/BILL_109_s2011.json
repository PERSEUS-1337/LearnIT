    "content": "Tire-Derived Fuel Safety Act of 2005 - Prohibits the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from issuing a permit under the Clean Air Act authorizing the burning of tire-dervied fuel at any pulp or paper mill unless such mill meets specified performance standards promulgated by the Administrator or has agreed to install control equipment and operate at or below required emission performance standards. Allows the Administrator to issue interim permits under certain conditions. Requires the Administrator to: (1) establish performance standards for fine particulates for new and existing mills. And (2) conduct studies of the health effects of increased emissions from the use of tire-derived fuel and report to Congress on such studies."
