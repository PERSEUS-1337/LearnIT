    "content": "Campus Crime Disclosure Act of 1998 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 with respect to the categories of crimes on which higher education institutions are required to report under the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990. Adds reporting requirements for the offenses of manslaughter, larceny, arson, and for arrests or persons referred for campus disciplinary action for liquor law violations, drug-related violations, and weapons violations. Requires that an institution's campus crime reports be readily available to its students and employees through various media, such as resident advisors, electronic mail, school newspapers, and announcement postings throughout the campus. Revises the definition of campus, for purposes of such campus crime disclosures, to include: (1) any building or property owned and controlled by the institution, or by a student organization recognized by the institution, within the same reasonably contiguous geographic area of the institution. (2) all public property within such area that provides immediate access to the facilities of the institution. (3) any building or property owned, controlled, or used by the institution for educational purposes, and is used by students, even if is not within the contiguous area. And (4) all dormitories or other student residential facilities owned or controlled by the institution. Directs the Secretary of Education to: (1) report to the Congress each institution not in compliance with campus crime reporting requirements. And (2) provide data on successful campus security measures as well as technical assistance to institutions having difficulty with or not in compliance with such reporting requirements. Requires institutions to distinguish in their reports crimes committed: (1) on public property within the same reasonably contiguous geographic area of the institution. And (2) in student residential facilities or other facilities affiliated with the institution. Establishes civil penalties for institutions for certain violations of, failures to comply with, or misrepresentations with respect to such campus crime reporting requirements."
