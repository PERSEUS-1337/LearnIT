    "title": "Nigeria Democracy Act",
    "content": "Nigeria Democracy Act - Imposes certain economic sanctions on Nigeria to promote democracy and human rights there. Requires the President to direct the Secretary of Transportation to revoke the right of Nigerian air carriers to service, and prohibit US air carriers from servicing, routes between the United States and such country. Authorizes waiver of such sanctions if the President certifies to the Congress that such waiver is important to the national interest. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the United States should exclude Nigerian sporting teams from participating in any sporting event in the United States. And (2) the President should work with the Government of Australia before the 2000 Olympic Games to be held in Sydney to determine the appropriateness of issuing visas for Nigerian participants in such Games. Directs the President to report periodically to the Congress on the extent to which Nigeria has made progress toward democracy, civilian rule, and respect for internationally-recognized human rights."
