    "content": "Post Office Relocation Act of 1997 - Modifies Federal postal provisions to require a 60-day notice before the renovation, relocation, closing, or consolidation of a post office. Requires such notice to be: (1) hand delivered or delivered by mail. And (2) published in one or more newspapers of general circulation within the zip codes served by such post office. Sets forth provisions which: (1) allow any person served by the post office to offer an alternative renovation, relocation, consolidation, or closing proposal within such 60-day period. And (2) require the Postal Service to conduct a hearing to allow the individual to present oral or written testimony. Revises the factors to be considered in deciding whether or not to renovate, relocate, close, or consolidate a post office to include: (1) the extent to which the post office is part of a core downtown business area, (2) the sentiment of the community, (3) whether postal officials negotiated with persons served. (4) whether management of the post office contributed to a desire to relocate. And (5) the adequacy of the existing post office. Requires the Postal Service to follow a community's public participation procedures to address the renovation, relocation, closing, or consolidation of buildings in the community if participation requirements of such procedures are more stringent than those provided in this Act. Requires the Postal Service, in making a determination to renovate, relocate, close, or consolidate any post office, to comply with any zoning, planning, or land use regulations or building codes applicable to State or local public entities, including the zoning authority of the local jurisdiction. Includes within the Postal Service policy with respect to planning and building new postal facilities that the Service consider the effect a new facility may have on the community."
