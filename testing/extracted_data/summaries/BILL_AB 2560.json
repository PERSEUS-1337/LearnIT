    "title": "AB 2560",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of the practice of accountancy by the California Board of Accountancy within the Department of Consumer Affairs. Existing law authorizes the board to make a determination based on specified factors about whether allowing individuals from a particular state to practice pursuant to a practice privilege violates the board\u2019s duty to protect the public and requires the board, if it were to make such a determination, to require those individuals, except as specified, to file the notification form and pay specified fees as a condition to exercising a practice privilege in this state. This bill would authorize the board to adopt emergency regulations in order to implement the above-described provisions."
