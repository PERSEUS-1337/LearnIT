    "content": "Public Library Innovation Space Act This bill requires the National Museum and Library Services Board to carry out a program for making competitive grants to eligible partnerships to establish makerspaces at public libraries. A makerspace is a facility that is open to the public and provides individuals with access to: (1) tools, technology, and educational resources designed to enable such individuals to create physical goods, including prototypes. And (2) educational opportunities, including vocational training and assistance with early-stage business ventures. A partnership must contribute, for the activities for which the grant was awarded, nonfederal matching funds equal to the grant amount. Each eligible partnership that receives a grant may not use its grant funds, or the matching funds contributed by it, for construction activities at a public library that would provide extra square footage to house a makerspace."
