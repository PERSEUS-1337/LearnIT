    "content": "Measures to Prevent Childhood Obesity Act of 2012 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require: (1) each health care provider that administers a vaccine set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table to record in the vaccinated person's medical record the person's age, gender, height, and weight to calculate body mass index (BMI). (2) the provider and the vaccine manufacturer to report such information to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). And (3) the provider to report to the relevant department of the state in which it practices the data collected. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to not more than 20 entities to analyze BMI measurements of children of ages 2 through 18. Gives priority in grant selection to states in which a high percentage of health care providers submit data to a statewide immunization information system that contains immunization data for at least 20 percent of the population under the age of 18 and includes data collected from men and women of a wide variety of ages who reside in a wide variety of geographic areas. Provides standards for BMI measurement in recipient states, including concerning the providing of information on state and local obesity prevention programs. Sets forth state reporting requirements regarding BMI data and obesity prevention and wellness programs and policies. Requires a report to Congress and the Departments of Education and of Agriculture (USDA) analyzing childhood obesity trends and describing programs that significantly lower childhood obesity rates for certain geographic areas and which the Secretary recommends for implementation by states."
