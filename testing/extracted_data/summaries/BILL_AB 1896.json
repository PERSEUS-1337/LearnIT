    "title": "AB 1896",
    "content": "Existing law, the Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law, authorizes a city, county, or city and county to impose local sales and use taxes, as specified. That law requires the sales tax portion of any sales and use tax ordinance adopted under that law to be imposed for the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail and to include specified provisions. This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to those provisions."
