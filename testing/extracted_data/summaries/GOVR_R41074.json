    "content": "According to its website, the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is responsible \"for the operations and care of more than 18.4 million square feet of facilities, 570 acres of grounds and thousands of works of art.\" Pursuant to the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1990, the Architect is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Prior to the enactment of this law, the President appointed the Architect for an unlimited term with no formal role for Congress. The act also established a 10-year term for the Architect as well as a bicameral, bipartisan congressional commission to recommend candidates to the President. As subsequently amended in 1995, this law provides for a commission consisting of 14 Members of Congress, including the Speaker of the House, the President pro tempore of the Senate, the House and Senate majority and minority leaders, and the chair and ranking minority members of the Committee on House Administration, the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, and the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. An Architect may be reappointed. Alan M. Hantman was the first Architect appointed under the revised appointment procedure. He declined to seek reappointment and served from January 30, 1997, to February 4, 2007. Stephen T. Ayers, who served as Acting Architect of the Capitol following Mr. Hantman's retirement, was nominated by President Obama on February 24, 2010, for a 10-year term. The nomination was referred to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. The committee held a hearing on April 15, 2010, during which the chair and ranking member praised Mr. Ayers for his work as acting Architect and congratulated him on the nomination. Mr. Ayers was confirmed by voice vote in the Senate on May 12, 2010. Upon the retirement of Mr. Ayers on November 23, 2018, Christine Merdon, the Deputy Architect of the Capitol/Chief Operating Officer, became the Acting Architect of the Capitol. Since at least the 1950s, multiple bills have been introduced that would alter the AOC appointment process and require the appointment to be made by the leadership of Congress rather than the President. Some of the Architect's current duties, however, may potentially raise a question as to whether the Architect is an \"Officer of the United States\" such that his or her appointment must comply with the requirements of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution.

Brudnick."
