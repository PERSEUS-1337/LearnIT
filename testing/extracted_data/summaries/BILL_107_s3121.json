Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) make US voluntary contributions to the IAEA for a program to provide radioactive source discovery, inventory, and recovery. (2) assist the Government of the Russian Federation to substitute solar power sources to replace radioisotope thermal generator powered units operated by the Federation and other independent states of the former Soviet Union in applications such as lighthouses, remote weather stations, unattended sensors, and remote electricity. And (3) conclude an agreement under which a foreign country would train first responders in the detection and characterization of radioactive material and contaminated areas. Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to establish a Special Representative for Inspections of Nuclear and Radiological Materials for negotiating international agreements that ensure inspection of cargoes of nuclear and radiological materials destined for the United States. Establishes a program of research and development grants concerning the detection and identification of fissile and radioactive materials. Requires a study of the use of radioactive sources in industry and of potential substitutes for those sources."
