    "content": "Three recess appointments to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) expired at the end of the first session of the 110th Congress, leaving the agency with just two commissioners. Because the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) requires that at least four commissioners vote affirmatively to execute some of the agency's major functions, the FEC was unable to issue regulations, approve enforcement actions, and administer aspects of the presidential public campaign financing program. The Commission also could not issue advisory opinions. Existing campaign finance law and regulations remained in effect. Remaining commissioners and staff continued routine business. On June 24, 2008, the Senate confirmed five nominees to the FEC. Those five commissioners joined a sixth member who continued to serve in holdover status. Therefore, the Commission was restored to full decision-making strength. By the end of April 2009, the terms of three commissioners (total) had expired, but because commissioners may continue to serve in holdover status, six members remained in office. Examining the Commission's operating status and its backlog from 2008 may be an oversight or appropriations issue of interest to the 111th Congress. CRS Report R40091, Campaign Finance: Potential Legislative and Policy Issues for the 111th Congress, by [author name scrubbed], discusses other recent campaign finance developments, including FEC issues.) Although the loss of the Commission's policymaking quorum has now been resolved, this report will be updated occasionally to reflect subsequent developments."
