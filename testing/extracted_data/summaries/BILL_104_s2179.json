(4) develop and issue an EPA-approved warning sign and label for posting in such areas. And (5) prohibit a school or park from using any pollutant on the high hazard risk list. Directs the Administrator and the Secretaries of Agriculture and of Health and Human Services to: (1) coordinate and implement research studies of the physiological and pharmacokinetic differences in the effects and toxicity of pesticides and other pollutants on children and other vulnerable subpopulations. (2) conduct surveys and research to document differences between children and adults with respect to exposure. And (3) report to the Congress.
