    "content": "Ratepayer Fairness Act of 2015 This bill amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to require a state regulatory authority and a nonregulated electric utility (entities), to the extent that they allow electric utility rates to include charges that subsidize customer-side technology, to consider whether that subsidy would: result in benefits predominately enjoyed by only the users of the customer-side technology. Shift costs of a customer-side technology to electricity consumers that do not use it, particularly in cases in which disparate economic or resource conditions exist among the electricity consumers cross-subsidizing the customer-side technology. Negatively affect resource utilization, fuel diversity, grid reliability, or grid security. Give any unfair competitive advantage to market the customer-side technology, including an analysis of whether a state regulatory authority has uncovered fraudulent customer-side technology marketing practices. And be necessary to fulfill an obligation to serve electric consumers. The bill sets deadlines within which the entities must set a hearing date to consider and subsequently determine the subsidization of customer-side technology."
