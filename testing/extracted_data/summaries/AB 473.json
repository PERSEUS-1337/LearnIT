    "title": "An act to amend Section 10072 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to public social services.",
    "content": "Existing law, administered by the State Department of Social Services, provides for the establishment of a statewide electronic benefits transfer (EBT) system for the purpose of providing financial and food assistance benefits. Existing law authorizes a county to deliver CalFresh benefits and, upon election by the county, CalWORKs benefits through the use of an EBT system. Existing law requires, among other things, that a recipient not incur any loss of cash benefits that are taken by an unauthorized withdrawal, removal, or use of benefits that does not occur by the use of a physical EBT card issued to the recipient or authorized 3rd party to directly access the benefits. This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to those provisions."
