Restricts rebates to owners of manufactured homes that are used on a year-round basis as a primary residence and that will be destroyed and replaced, in the same general location, with an Energy Star qualified manufactured home. Limits rebates to: (1) one owner per household. (2) households with total incomes not exceeding 200 of the federal poverty level in the applicable area. And (3) $7,500 per manufactured home. Directs the Secretary to seek to achieve the purpose of this Act through similar federal programs, including: (1) the Weatherization Assistance Program, and (2) the Department of Energy\u0092s (DOE\u0092s) State Energy Program."
