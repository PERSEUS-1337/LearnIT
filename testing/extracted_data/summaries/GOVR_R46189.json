    "content": "Cannabidiol (CBD), a compound in the Cannabis sativa plant, has been promoted as a treatment for a range of conditions, including epileptic seizures, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, inflammation, and sleeplessness. However, limited scientific evidence is available to substantiate or disprove the efficacy of CBD in treating these conditions. In the United States, CBD is marketed in food and beverages, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and tobacco products such as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS)\u00e2\u0080\u0094products that are primarily regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA, 21 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7301 et seq.). CBD is also the active ingredient in Epidiolex, an FDA-approved pharmaceutical drug. The Regulation of Marijuana and Hemp CBD is derived from the Cannabis sativa plant (commonly referred to as cannabis), which includes both hemp and marijuana. Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA, 21 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7802 et seq.) and is regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Schedule I substances are subject to the most severe CSA restrictions and penalties. Except for purposes of federally approved research, it is a federal crime to grow, sell, or possess marijuana. Until December 2018, hemp was included in the CSA definition of marijuana and was thus subject to the same restrictions. Legislative changes enacted as part of the 2018 farm bill (Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, P.L. 115-334 ) removed longstanding federal restrictions on the cultivation of hemp. No longer subject to regulation and oversight as a controlled substance by DEA, hemp production is now subject to regulation and oversight as an agricultural commodity by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The 2018 farm bill expanded the statutory definition of what constitutes hemp to include \"all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers,\" as long as it contains no more than a 0.3% concentration of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; 7 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a71639o). All non-hemp cannabis and cannabis derivatives\u00e2\u0080\u0094including marijuana-derived CBD\u00e2\u0080\u0094are considered to be marijuana under the CSA and remain regulated by DEA. Production and Marketing of Hemp Products Legislative changes related to hemp enacted as part of the 2018 farm bill were widely expected to generate additional market opportunities for the U.S. hemp market. However, the farm bill explicitly preserved FDA's authority under the FFDCA and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA, 42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7262), including for hemp-derived products. Following enactment of the farm bill, in a December 2018 statement, FDA stated that it is \"unlawful under the [FFDCA] to introduce food containing added CBD or THC into interstate commerce, or to market CBD or THC products as, or in, dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived.\" The agency has maintained this view in subsequent communications. Despite FDA's determination, CBD continues to be widely marketed and sold in both food and dietary supplements in the United States. To date, FDA has generally prioritized enforcement against companies and products that pose the greatest risk to consumers\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, CBD products claiming to treat Alzheimer's or stop cancer cell growth. In 2014, total U.S. CBD sales were a reported $108 million. In 2018, more than 1,000 companies produced and marketed CBD for the U.S. market, and U.S. CBD sales were estimated at $534 million, according to the Hemp Business Journal . That dollar amount is projected to exceed $1 billion in 2020 and to reach nearly $2 billion in 2022. This amount includes sales from hemp-derived CBD, marijuana-derived CBD (currently a Schedule I controlled substance), and pharmaceutical CBD (currently only Epidiolex). Congressional Interest Congress has expressed concern about the proliferation of CBD products marketed in violation of federal law and has called on FDA to provide guidance on lawful pathways for marketing hemp-derived CBD in food and dietary supplements. In absence of a regulatory framework for hemp-derived CBD, in the explanatory statement accompanying the FY2020 enacted appropriation, Congress directed FDA to issue a policy of enforcement discretion with respect to CBD products that meet the statutory definition of hemp. In addition to the activities directed in the explanatory statement, Congress could also take further legislative action in the future, such as requiring FDA to issue a regulation, under its FFDCA authorities, expressly permitting CBD that meets the definition of hemp to be used as a food additive or dietary supplement. Congress also could amend the FFDCA provisions that FDA has identified as restricting marketing of CBD in food and dietary supplements. In determining whether a legislative approach is appropriate, Congress may consider the potential for adverse health effects and other unintended consequences."
