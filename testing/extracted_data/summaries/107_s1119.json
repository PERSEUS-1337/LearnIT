    "title": "A bill to require the Secretary of Defense to carry out a study of the extent to the coverage of members of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve of the Armed Forces under health benefits plans and to submit a report on the study of Congress, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "Expresses the sense of Congress that steps should be taken to ensure that every member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve and such member's family have health care benefits that are adequate to: (1) ease the member's transition from civilian to full-time military life during a mobilization. (2) minimize the adverse effects of a mobilization on the member's ability to provide adequate health care to his or her family. And (3) improve readiness and retention in the Selected Reserve. Directs the Secretary of Defense to contract with a federally funded research and development center to study the health care benefit needs of such members and their families and to issue a report that shall include recommended options for extending health care benefits under the Defense Health Program or the Federal Employee Health benefits program to cover such members."
