    "title": "An act to amend Section 5813.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to mental health.",
    "content": "Existing law contains provisions governing the operation and financing of community mental health services for the mentally disordered in every county through locally administered and locally controlled community mental health programs. Existing law, the Mental Health Services Act, an initiative measure enacted by the voters as Proposition 63 at the November 2, 2004, statewide general election, funds a system of county mental health plans for the provision of mental health services, as specified. The act establishes the Mental Health Services Fund, which is continuously appropriated to to, and administered by by, the State Department of Health Care Services, to fund specified county mental health programs, including programs funded under the Adult and Older Adult Mental Health System of Care Act. Existing law prohibits these funds from being used to pay for persons incarcerated in state prison or parolees from state prisons. This bill would clarify that the counties may use Mental Health Services Fund moneys to provide voluntary outpatient crisis stabilization services to individuals who are voluntarily receiving those services, individuals, even when individuals who are receiving involuntary services involuntarily are treated at the same facility. Because the bill would clarify the procedures and terms of Proposition 63, it would require a majority vote of the Legislature."
