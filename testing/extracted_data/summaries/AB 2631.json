    "title": "An act to amend Section 11450 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to CalWORKs.",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program under which, through a combination of federal, state, and county funds, each county provides cash assistance and other benefits to qualified low-income families. As part of the CalWORKs program, a homeless family that has used all available liquid resources in excess of $100 may be eligible for homeless assistance benefits to pay the costs of temporary shelter. The CalWORKs program also provides permanent housing assistance to pay rent or a security deposit, as specified, in order to secure housing for the family or prevent eviction. Under existing law, eligibility for homeless assistance is limited to one period of up to 16 consecutive days in a lifetime, and eligibility for permanent housing assistance is limited to one payment of assistance, subject to specified exceptions for homelessness caused by domestic violence, illness, or sudden or unusual circumstances beyond the control of the family. Existing law authorizes a county to require certain recipients of homeless assistance to participate in a homelessness avoidance case plan as a condition of eligibility for homeless assistance benefits. This bill would increase the duration of homeless assistance benefits to 30 days and would delete the limitation on the number of times a recipient may receive homeless assistance or permanent housing assistance benefits. The bill would limit the number of times a family may receive temporary shelter assistance to once per year. The bill would also delete the authority for the county to require a homelessness avoidance case plan as a condition of eligibility for homeless assistance benefits. Because this bill would increase the administrative duties of counties, it would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing law continuously appropriates moneys from the General Fund to defray a portion of county costs under the CalWORKs program. This bill would, instead, provide that the continuous appropriation would not be made for purposes of implementing the bill. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
