And (2) designate such drug as a cancer drug before the submission of a request for approval or licensing. Requires the Secretary to designate such drug as a cancer drug if the drug is being or will be investigated for use for cancer. Prohibits the Secretary from approving another application or issuing another license for a designated cancer drug for a person who is not the holder of the approved application or license until the expiration of seven years, with certain exceptions. Requires the Secretary to encourage the sponsor of a designated cancer drug approved for investigational use to design protocols for the drug that include persons with the cancer involved who cannot be satisfactorily treated by alternative drugs.
