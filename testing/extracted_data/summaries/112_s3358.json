    "content": "Responding to Urgent Needs of Survivors of the Holocaust Act or RUSH Act - Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to: (1) include specifically within its purview older Americans who are Holocaust survivors. (2) direct the Assistant Secretary for Aging of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants or contracts to nonprofit organizations to increase and improve transportation services to enable older individuals to remain in the community, with preference for Holocaust survivors. (3) authorize the Administrator for Community Living to designate, within the HHS Administration for Community Living, a person with specialized training, background, or experience with issues of Holocaust survivors to implement services for them. (3) require state nutrition projects to ensure that project meals meet the dietary needs of program participants based on religious, cultural, or ethnic requirements. And (4) require a state nutrition project to encourage individuals who distribute nutrition services to engage in conversation with homebound older individuals and to be aware of the warning signs of medical emergencies, injury, or abuse in order to reduce isolation and promote wellbeing. Amends the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006 to require the study of nutrition projects to analyze the abilities of service providers to obtain viable contracts for special foods necessary to meet a religious requirement, required dietary need, or ethnic consideration."
