    "content": "Military personnel issues typically generate significant interest from many Members of Congress and their staffs. Recent military operations in Iraq and ongoing operations in Afghanistan, along with the operational role of the Reserve Components, further heighten interest in a wide range of military personnel policies and issues. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) has selected a number of the military personnel issues considered in deliberations on the House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012. This report provides a brief synopsis of sections that pertain to personnel policy. These include end strengths, pay raises, health care issues, and language affecting the repeal of the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy, as well as congressional concerns over the handling of sexual assaults in the military. The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, H.R. 1540, was introduced in the House on April 14, 2011; reported by the House Committee on Armed Services on May 17, 2011 (H.Rept. 112-78); and passed on May 26, 2011. Various Senate versions were introduced. S. 1867 was introduced on November 15, 2011, and passed by the Senate on December 1, 2011. Often the Senate will add language not included in the House version, add language that affects an issue in a differing manner (for example, the Senate may have end strengths numbers that differ from the House). Usually, these differences will be worked out under the Conference Committee's consideration of the legislation. The Conference Committee language was incorporated into the report. On December 14, 2011, the House passed the conference reported version of H.R. 1540. The next day, the Senate passed H.R. 1540. On December 31, 2011, President Obama signed P.L. 112-81 into law. Where appropriate, related CRS products are identified to provide more detailed background information and analysis of the issue. For each issue, a CRS analyst is identified and contact information is provided. This report focuses exclusively on the annual defense authorization process. It does not include language concerning appropriations, veterans' affairs, tax implications of policy choices, or any discussion of separately introduced legislation."
