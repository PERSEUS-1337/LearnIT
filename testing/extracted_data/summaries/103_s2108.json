    "content": "NATO Revitalization Act - Declares that it should be US policy to: (1) continue the commitment to and an active leadership role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). (2) join with NATO allies to redefine the role of the alliance in the post-Cold War world, taking into account specified factors. (3) urge NATO to extend membership to European countries that meet appropriate standards and establish benchmarks and a timetable for eventual membership for selected countries in transition. And (4) affirm that NATO military planning should include joint military operations beyond the geographic bounds of the alliance under the North Atlantic Treaty when the shared interests of the United States and other member countries require such action to defend vital interests."
