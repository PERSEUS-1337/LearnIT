    "content": "Tule Lake National Historic Site Establishment Act of 2015 This bill establishes the Tule Lake National Historic Site in California as a unit of the National Park System in order to preserve, protect, and interpret the site of incarceration and segregation of US citizens of Japanese descent and resident immigrants of Japanese citizenry at Tule Lake during World War II. The National Park Service (NPS) and the US Fish and Wildlife Service shall enter into an agreement to allow the NPS to manage and interpret the resources of the portions of the Site within the Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge. The resources of the Lava Beds National Monument may be used to administer the Site. The Department of the Interior shall prepare a general management plan for the Site. The boundaries of the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument are revised to exclude from the Monument the Tule Lake Unit, consisting of portions of the Tule Lake Segregation Center National Historic Landmark and Camp Tule Lake, and incorporate the excluded lands and interests into the Site. The President may not designate, nor may Interior acquire, lands for inclusion in the Site outside specified boundaries unless Interior has: (1) consulted with the county of Modoc and the city of Tulelake, and (2) obtained their written concurrence for the designation or acquisition."
