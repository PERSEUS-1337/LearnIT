As summit chair, he focused the meeting, held at Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland,July 6-8, on this initiative. Blair pushed for a substantial aid increase for Africa beginning in 2006,through an \"International Finance Facility\" (IFF), and for 100% forgiveness of poor country debt tothe international financial institutions. The IFF would have issued bonds to finance an additional $25billion in annual aid to Africa for three to five years, followed by another $25 billion boost if Africangovernments improved their managerial and administrative capabilities. IFF bonds would have beenbacked by a promise from the G7 leading economic powers to repay them after 2015. Poor countrydebts to the World Bank and the African Development Bank would have been repaid by the G7,while debts to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would have been paid by revaluing or sellingIMF gold. Finally, Blair sought the removal of barriers to Africa's exports. Blair has long championed a \"Marshall Plan\" for Africa as part of a \"deal\" to help the regionachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), U.N.-endorsed targets for 2015 that includeuniversal primary education and sharp cuts in poverty. In exchange, he expects further governanceand free-market economic reforms in Africa. On March 11, 2005 a high-level Commission forAfrica appointed by Blair issued a comprehensive report elaborating the initiative, which wonsupport from President Chirac of France and Germany's Chancellor Schroeder. The Bush Administration reacted cooly to the proposed IFF on grounds that it lacks a meansof assuring that new aid funds would be well spent. Officials also argued that the IFF wouldunconstitutionally bind future Congresses to appropriations. IFF supporters noted that the fundswould be passed through existing aid agencies with their own monitoring mechanisms. Some alsoargued that the United States routinely agrees to repay debt in the future. At Gleneagles, the IFFproposal was dropped, but the participants agreed on a $25 billion increase in annual aid to Africaby 2010. Moreover, the G8 ratified an agreement on debt forgiveness for 18 of the world's poorestcountries, including 14 in Africa. The donors are to compensate the World Bank and the AfricanDevelopment Bank for the lost repayments. The IMF will fund the loss from its own resources, butnot sell gold. Participants reiterated that they supported the removal of trade barriers, but no specificactions were taken. Many development experts welcomed the summit's results as an important stepforward; but several non-governmental organizations argued that the summit had done too little ontrade or to mobilize \"new money.\" Previous G8 meetings have also focused on Africa. There has been much debate overwhether G8 countries have fulfilled past promises -- and over whether the African states have mettheir own promises of reforms. This report will not be updated.
