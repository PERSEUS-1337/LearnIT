    "title": "AB 280",
    "content": "Existing law establishes a small claims division, known as a small claims court, in each superior court. Existing law provides that the small claims court has jurisdiction over actions seeking certain forms of relief, including money damages in specified amounts. Existing law prohibits a city, county, city and county, school district, county office of education, community college district, local district, or any other local public entity from filing a claim in the small claims division if the amount of the demand exceeds $5,000. Existing law also provides that a small claims action filed by a city, county, city and county, school district, county office of education, community college district, local district, or any other local public entity must be transferred out of the small claims division if the opposing party is represented by legal counsel and properly informs the entity of this fact. This bill would give the small claims court jurisdiction over an action filed by a city, county, city and county, school district, county office of education, community college district, local district, or any other local public entity if the amount of the demand does not exceed $10,000. This bill would also eliminate the provision relating to the transfer of small claims actions where the opposing party is represented by counsel."
