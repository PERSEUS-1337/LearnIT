For the response to health emergencies, most authority resides with state and local governments, and most capacity resides in the private sector. The federal government plays a key role, however, providing numerous forms of assistance for planning and preparedness, as well as for response and recovery. Previous Congresses passed a number of laws intended to establish clear federal leadership roles and responsibilities and effective organizational structures, in the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Homeland Security (DHS) in particular. Nonetheless, challenges persist in coordinating federal preparedness and response efforts. From FY2002 through FY2010, Congress provided about $11.4 billion in grants to states and territories to strengthen public health and medical system capacity in preparedness for health threats. However, depending on the incident, dedicated funding for the actual response to these threats may or may not be available. For example, it is not clear that infectious disease incidents (such as bioterrorism or a flu pandemic) would qualify for major disaster assistance under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act). Also, although the HHS Secretary has authority for a Public Health Emergency Fund, Congress has not appropriated monies to the fund for many years. Finally, there is no federal assistance program designed purposefully to cover uncompensated or uninsured health care costs for disaster victims. Another challenge is ensuring that the right medical products are available, and that they can be delivered to those in need in a timely manner. Previous Congresses established Project BioShield and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in HHS to encourage private-sector development of medical countermeasures, such as drugs and vaccines, that lack commercial markets. Given the high cost and financial risk inherent in the development of new medical products, debate continues about how to balance these costs and risks between the federal government and product developers. Given the current budgetary climate, spending for public programs, including emergency management programs, may be significantly constrained. Under the circumstances, the 112th Congress may be interested in approaches that improve community resilience in the face of disasters through better integration of the private sector in planning and response activities and better leveraging of routine capabilities for incident response, among others. The 112th Congress is also likely to remain interested in optimizing coordination, efficiency, and accountability in federal activities. Finally, for a number of health emergency activities authorized by previous Congresses, appropriations authority has expired or will expire at the end of FY2011. If the 112th Congress considers reauthorization, the matter of efficient use of federal resources is likely to be front and center during its deliberations. This report, which will be updated, summarizes key issues in domestic public health and medical preparedness and response, and discusses selected federal programs, citing other CRS reports and other sources of additional information. Specifically, it discusses issues regarding government leadership, organization, and capacity; health system preparedness and response; the development, procurement, and use of countermeasures; and the defense against specific threats, including foodborne outbreaks and bioterrorism, among others."
