    "title": "AB 2341",
    "content": "Existing law specifies the number of judges for the superior court of each county. Existing law allocates additional judgeships to the various counties in accordance with uniform standards for factually determining additional judicial need in each county, as updated and approved by the Judicial Council, pursuant to the Update of Judicial Needs Study, based on specified criteria, including, among others, workload standards that represent the average amount of time of bench and nonbench work required to resolve each case type. This bill would require the allocation of up to 5 vacant judgeships, as defined, from superior courts with more authorized judgeships than their assessed judicial need to superior courts with fewer authorized judgeships than their assessed judicial need. The bill would require the allocation to be in accordance with a methodology approved by the Judicial Council, as specified, and would require the determination of a superior court\u2019s assessed judicial need to be in accordance with the above uniform standards and be based on the criteria described above. The bill would require the Judicial Council, if a vacant judgeship is eligible for allocation to another superior court, to promptly notify the applicable courts, the Legislature, and the Governor that the judgeship shall be allocated to another court. This bill would also make a statement of legislative intent regarding the authority of the Legislature, the Governor, and the Chief Justice of California. Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of health facilities by the State Department of Public Health and prohibits a health facility from providing a special service without the approval of the department. Under existing law, a violation of these provisions is a crime. Existing law defines a \u201cspecial service\u201d to mean a functional division, department, or unit of a health facility that is organized, staffed, and equipped to provide a specific type of patient care and that has been identified by regulations of the department and for which the department has established special standards for quality of care. Under existing law, \u201cspecial services\u201d includes physical therapy services, occupational therapy services, or speech pathology and audiology services provided by a nursing facility to outpatients. This bill would additionally define \u201cspecial services\u201d to mean dialysis, peritoneal, and infusion services as may be approved by the department for nursing facilities and skilled nursing facilities that are not identified in regulations of the department, if the licensee can demonstrate to the department that the special service will operate in accordance with a minimum standard for quality of care. The bill would require a licensee applying to the department for approval of special services that are not identified by regulations of the department to submit an application and other information, as specified. By expanding the application of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
