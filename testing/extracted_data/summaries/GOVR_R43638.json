    "content": "This report explains the process for filling positions to which the President makes appointments with the advice and consent of the Senate (also referred to as PAS positions). It also identifies, for the 111th Congress, all nominations to full-time positions requiring Senate confirmation in the 15 executive departments. It excludes appointments to regulatory boards and commissions and independent and other agencies, which are covered in other CRS reports. The appointment process for advice and consent positions consists of three main stages. The first stage is selection, clearance, and nomination by the President. This step includes preliminary vetting, background checks, and ethics checks of potential nominees. At this stage, if the position is located within a state, the President may also consult with Senators who are from his party. The second stage of the process is consideration of the nomination in the Senate, most of which takes place in committee. Finally, if a nomination is approved by the Senate, the President may then present the nominee with a signed commission, making the appointment official. During the 111th Congress, the President submitted to the Senate 347 nominations to executive department full-time positions. Of these 347 nominations, 293 were confirmed; 16 were withdrawn; and 38 were returned to him in accordance with Senate rules. For those nominations that were confirmed, an average of 73.2 days elapsed between nomination and confirmation. The median number of days elapsed was 52.0. The President made 10 recess appointments to full-time positions in executive departments during the 111th Congress. Information for this report was compiled from data from the Senate nominations database of the Legislative Information System (LIS) http://www.congress.gov/nomis/, the Congressional Record (daily edition), the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents, telephone discussions with agency officials, agency websites, the United States Code, and the 2008 \"Plum Book\" (United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions). This report will not be updated."
