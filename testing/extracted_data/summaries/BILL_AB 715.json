    "title": "AB 715",
    "content": "Existing law, the Planning and Zoning Law, limits the amount of fees, charges, dedications, or other requirements levied or imposed by state and local agencies on the planning, use, or development of real property for the construction or reconstruction of school facilities based upon assessable space, as defined. In the case of residential construction, existing law defines assessable space to mean all of the square footage within the perimeter of a residential structure, not including any carport, walkway, garage, overhang, patio, enclosed patio, detached accessory structure, or similar area. This bill would revise the definition of assessable space to specify that a covered or uncovered walkway is excluded."
