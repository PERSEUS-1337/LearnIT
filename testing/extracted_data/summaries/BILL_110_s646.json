(3) establish additional slots for nursing students at existing nursing education programs. And (4) establish new nursing education programs at institutions of higher education. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) report to Congress on the source of newly licensed nurses and physical therapists in each state. (2) contract with the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine to determine the necessary level of federal investment under the Public Health Service Act to eliminate the domestic nursing and physical therapist shortage. And (3) collaborate with other agencies in working with the five countries from which the most nurses and physical therapists arrived to address health worker shortages caused by emigration. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to exempt aliens seeking US entry to perform labor in shortage occupations from worldwide and per-country numerical limitations through September 30, 2017.
