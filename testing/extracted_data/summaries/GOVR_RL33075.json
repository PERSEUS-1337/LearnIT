    "content": "On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast region coming ashore just eastof New Orleans. On September 24, 2005, Hurricane Rita hit the Gulf Coast region making land fallnear the border of Texas and Louisiana. Both hurricanes left behind widespread devastation. Ritaappears to have done most of its damage to energy infrastructure off-shore in contrast to Katrinawhich devastated large swaths of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. This report examines theimpact of these hurricanes on three important factors affecting the U.S. agricultural sector: marketinginfrastructure based on the Mississippi River waterway and Gulf ports; production losses for majorcrop and livestock producers in the affected region; and potential consequences for agriculturalproduction as a result of high energy costs. It also discusses the federal government response toagricultural concerns. Agricultural producers from the states directly impacted by Katrina have suffered economiclosses, although this varies greatly by crop and locality. Preliminary estimates by USDA is thatHurricane Katrina contributed to $882 million in total crop, livestock, and aquaculture losses. Thoseactivities most affected were aquaculture ($151 million), sugar cane ($50 million), and cotton ($40million). The damage estimate does not include losses in timber and nursery and greenhouseproducts. No preliminary estimate has been released by USDA concerning agricultural damage fromHurricane Rita. Hurricane Katrina temporarily halted the flow of agricultural trade through New Orleans --a major gateway for U.S. oil imports and agricultural exports -- causing commodity prices to declinein interior markets along the Mississippi River waterway. Although partial recovery of marketinginfrastructure occurred soon following Katrina's passage (with a brief shutdown in late Septemberdue to Hurricane Rita), substantial congestion and high costs continue to plague the MississippiRiver grain transport network. This traffic bottleneck and its depressive effect on farm commodityprices could persist into the spring of 2006. Energy prices jumped substantially in early September 2005, as a significant portion of U.S.petroleum and natural gas production, import, and refining facilities were damaged and shut down. There is considerable uncertainty surrounding the permanency of energy price rises and theirpotential impact on the U.S. economy in general, and U.S. agriculture in particular. By raising theoverall price structure of production agriculture, sustained high energy prices could result insignificantly lower farm and rural incomes in 2006. Certain ongoing federal programs, primarily crop insurance and disaster loans, are availableto eligible producers. The combination of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita with a Midwestern droughtmight also cause Congress to consider supplemental crop and livestock disaster assistance. Thisreport is intended as an overview of how the hurricanes have affected and are likely to continue toaffect the agricultural sectors of both the impacted regions and the United States. It is not intendedto provide a day-to-day update of events. It will, however, be updated as events warrant."
