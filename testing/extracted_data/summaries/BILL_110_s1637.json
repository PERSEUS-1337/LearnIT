And (3) establish methods to track the success of federal agencies with respect to that goal. Requires the Administrator to: (1) review the current use of geothermal heat pump technologies in GSA facilities and the availability of such technologies to facility managers. And (2) establish an acceleration program to achieve maximum feasible replacement of existing heating and cooling technologies with geothermal heat pump technologies in each GSA facility. Requires the Administrator to: (1) ensure that a manager responsible for accelerating the use of geothermal heat pump technologies is designated for each GSA geothermal heat pump technologies and practices facility. And (2) submit to Congress a plan for implementing, within five years, geothermal heat pump technologies and practices at GSA facilities."
