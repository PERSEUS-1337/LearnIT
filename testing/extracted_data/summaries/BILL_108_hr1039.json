    "content": "Wholesale Motor Fuel Fairness and Competition Restoration Act - Declares that it shall be unlawful for an owner or operator to sell motor fuel from its terminal facility to any person in excess of the price it charges any other person, including a distributor or retailer which it owns or with which it is affiliated. Exempts from such prohibition certain franchises or sales contracts entered into before enactment of this Act. Establishes civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Instructs the Federal Trade Commission to: (1) issue regulations requiring full disclosure by refiners and distributors of their wholesale motor fuel pricing policies, with a separate listing of each component contributing to prices, including the cost of crude oil, refining, marketing, transportation, equipment, overhead, and profit, along with a description of any rebates, incentives, and market enhancement allowances. And (2) ensure that all information acquired pursuant to such regulations is disseminated to the public."
