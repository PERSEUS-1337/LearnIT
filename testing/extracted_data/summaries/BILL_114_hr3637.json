    "content": "HIV Clinical Services Improvement Act This bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require payment under the Medicaid program for services furnished by recipients of Ryan White Part C grants, which support comprehensive primary care in outpatient settings for individuals living with HIV. Providers must be paid an amount equivalent to the prior average costs of providing these services. However, a state plan may establish an alternative payment methodology that: (1) is agreed to by the state and the grantee, and (2) results in payment to the grantee that at least equals the amount otherwise required to be paid to the grantee under the bill. As a condition of receiving payment under the bill, a grantee shall be subject to specified quality management and reporting requirements."
