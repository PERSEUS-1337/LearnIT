    "content": "Congress, through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), provides a variety of benefits and services to veterans and to certain members of their families. These benefits include disability compensation and pensions, education benefits, survivor benefits, medical treatment, life insurance, vocational rehabilitation, and burial and memorial benefits. In order to receive these benefits, a veteran (or an eligible family member) must apply for them by submitting the necessary information to a local VA office. The local VA office will make an initial determination on the application for benefits. Any veteran who is not satisfied with the local VA's determination is permitted to appeal the decision. This report provides a step-by-step breakdown of the appeal process for veterans' claims. When making an appeal on an initial determination, the claimant may choose to proceed with the traditional review process or may choose to have a Decision Review Officer (DRO) at the local VA office review the case. In the event the veteran opts for a DRO review and is not satisfied with the result, the claimant may still avail himself/herself of the traditional process and appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA). The local VA office will prepare the claim file for the appeal and provide the claimant with a blank VA Form 9\u2014a form that must be completed to make an appeal to the BVA. Claimants must follow specific procedures to request the appeal and must meet certain deadlines for submitting the proper information. The claimant may choose to have a hearing with the BVA during the appeal process. There are three different types of hearings that the claimant may choose (1) an in-person hearing with a BVA member, held in Washington, DC; (2) an in-person hearing with a BVA member, held at a local VA office; or (3) a teleconference hearing. The hearings with the BVA are informal and nonadversarial in nature. The claimant will be given the opportunity to explain the reasons for the appeal and to submit additional evidence during the hearing. The claimant may be represented during the appeal process. After the BVA reaches a decision on the appeal, there are further options the claimant may pursue if he or she is still not satisfied with the BVA decision. A claimant may file a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC). The CAVC, an Article I court, has exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the BVA. A claimant must submit a notice of appeal within 120 days of receiving the decision from the BVA. However, the Supreme Court in Henderson v. Shinseki clarified that the 120-day deadline is not a \"jurisdictional\" deadline. Therefore, an appeal to the CAVC will not necessarily be dismissed for missing the deadline. However, the claimant must have a good reason for filing late, such as an inability to meet the deadline due to mental incapacity. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has exclusive jurisdiction to hear appeals from a CAVC decision. The Federal Circuit provides the last appeal of right during the appeal process. If either party is dissatisfied with the ruling from the Federal Circuit, an appeal may be made to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court does not have to hear the case and may deny certiorari. If the Supreme Court decides to hear the case, any decision reached by the Court is final."
