    "content": "The 1996 welfare law (P.L. 104-193) gives federally recognizedIndian tribes (defined to include certain Alaska Native organizations) the option to design and operate their owncash welfare programs for needy children with funds subtracted from their state's block grant for TemporaryAssistance to Needy Families (TANF). As of September 15, 2004, 45 tribal TANF plans were in operation in 16states. Their annual rate of federal funding totaled $134.2 million. The 1996 law also appropriated $7.6 millionannually for work and training activities to tribes in 24 states that operated a pre-TANF work and trainingprogram (now named Native Employment Works -- NEW), authorized direct federal funding to Indian tribes foroperation of child support enforcement programs, and set aside a share of child care funds for them. Theoriginal TANF law was scheduled to expire September 30, 2002, but Congress extended funding through severallaws, most recently through September 30, 2004. Pending are two major TANF reauthorization bills:H.R. 4, as passed by the House, and H.R. 4, as approved by the Senate FinanceCommittee. Both bills would renew tribal TANF grants through FY2008 and make tribal organizations eligiblefor new marriage promotion grants. In addition, the Senate Committee bill would authorize some new funding(tribal improvement fund). This report will be updated for significant developments."
