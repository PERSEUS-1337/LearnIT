    "title": "An act to amend Section 5650.1 of the Fish and Game Code, and to amend Section 8670.61 of the Government Code, relating to water pollution.",
    "content": "Existing law imposes a maximum civil penalty of $25,000 on a person who discharges various pollutants or other designated materials into the waters of the state. This bill would impose an additional civil penalty of not more than $10 for each gallon or pound of material discharged. The bill would require that the civil penalty be reduced for every gallon or pound of the illegally discharged material that is recovered and properly disposed of by the responsible party. The Lempert-Keene-Seastrand Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act establishes various civil penalties for conduct in connection with the intentional or negligent discharging of oil into waters of the state. Existing law requires civil and criminal penalties provided in the act to be separate from, and in addition to, and to not supersede or limit, any and all other remedies, civil or criminal. This bill would prohibit a person from being subject to both a civil penalty described above and a civil penalty imposed pursuant to the Lempert-Keene-Seastrand Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act for the same act or failure to act."
