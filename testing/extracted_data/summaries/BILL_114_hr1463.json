    "content": "SEC Revolving Door Restriction Act of 2015 This bill amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to subject to federal criminal penalties for bribery, graft, and conflicts of interest an ex-employee of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) who, within one year after ending employment with the SEC, works for any company or individual against whom the SEC brought an enforcement action within the previous 18 months and the ex-employee participated in that action. Any employee who seeks to work for such a company or individual must first receive an ethics opinion from the SEC on whether permission to do so should be granted. Non-professional SEC staff are exempt from this employment prohibition."
