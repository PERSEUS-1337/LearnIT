    "content": "Justice for Victims of Fraud Act of 2016 This bill amends the Truth in Lending Act and the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to prohibit predispute arbitration agreements with consumers from being valid or enforceable in disputes related to credit card accounts or personal bank accounts that are not subject to a final judgment by a court if the credit card or bank account was not issued in response to a request or application for that account. The bill excludes from this prohibition accounts held by a financial institution pursuant to a bona fide trust agreement."
