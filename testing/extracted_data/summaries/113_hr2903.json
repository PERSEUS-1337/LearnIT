    "title": "NCAA Act",
    "content": "National Collegiate Athletics Accountability Act or the NCAA Act - Amends title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require schools that have an intercollegiate athletic program and are participating in title IV programs to abstain from membership in a nonprofit athletic association unless the association: requires annual baseline concussion testing of student athletes on the active roster of teams participating in contactcollision or limited-contactimpact sports before they participate in any contact drills or activities. Holds remedies for violations of its policies in abeyance until the schools and student athletes subject to those remedies have been afforded certain due process procedures. Requires athletically-related student aid provided to student athletes who play contactcollision sports to be guaranteed for the duration of their attendance at the school, up to four years, and irrevocable for reasons related to skill or injury. And does not prevent schools from paying stipends to student athletes. Makes title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 inapplicable to any activity carried out by an institution of higher education to guarantee the continuance of student aid for student athletes in compliance with such membership requirements."
