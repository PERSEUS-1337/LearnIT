    "content": "Common Sense Preble's Conservation Act - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to provide that, in any case in which the Secretary of the Interior is required to use the best scientific and commercial data available with respect to determining whether the Preble's meadow jumping mouse is an endangered or threatened species, the Secretary: (1) in evaluating comparable data, shall give greater weight to scientific or commercial data that are empirical or have been field-tested or peer-reviewed. And (2) shall include data regarding population numbers of the species. Prohibits the Secretary from determining that the Preble's meadow jumping mouse is an endangered or threatened species unless the determination is supported by data obtained by observation of the species in the field. Directs the Secretary to: (1) accept and acknowledge receipt of data regarding the status of that species that is collected by an owner of land through observation of the species on the land, and include the data in the rule-making record compiled for any determination that the species is an endangered or threatened species. (2) solicit recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences and develop and maintain a list of qualified reviewers to participate in independent scientific review of actions. And (3) appoint randomly from among the list, before any action becomes final, three qualified individuals who shall review and report to the Secretary on the scientific information and analyses on which the proposed action is based."
