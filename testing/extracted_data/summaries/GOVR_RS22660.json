    "content": "Current law prohibits the importation of a prescription drug by anyone other than its manufacturer. S. 1232 would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to change that. It would allow commercial and personal-use importation. The legislation would create a detailed set of procedures to address concerns relating to the safety and effectiveness of imported drugs, cost savings to U.S. consumers, and administration of the program. S. 1232 contains the same text as previously introduced S. 525 and H.R. 1298."
