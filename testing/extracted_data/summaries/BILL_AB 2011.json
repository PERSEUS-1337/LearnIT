    "title": "AB 2011",
    "content": "The Horse Racing Law requires, when satellite wagering is conducted on thoroughbred races at associations or fairs in the northern, central, or southern zone, that an amount not to exceed 1.25 of the total amount handled by all of those satellite wagering facilities be deducted from the funds otherwise allocated for distribution as commissions, purses, and owners\u2019 premiums and instead be distributed to an organization formed and operated by thoroughbred racing associations, fairs conducting thoroughbred racing, and the organization representing thoroughbred horsemen and horsewomen, to administer a fund to provide reimbursement for offsite stabling at California Horse Racing Board-approved auxiliary training facilities for additional stalls beyond the number of usable stalls the association or fair is required to make available and maintain, and for the vanning of starters from these additional stalls on racing days for thoroughbred horses. This bill would increase the amount that is required to be deducted to an amount not to exceed 2 in the northern, central, and southern zones, and would provide that this amount in the northern zone, if adjusted by the board, may be a different percentage of the handle for different associations and fairs, but only if all the associations and fairs agree to the differing percentages. The bill would establish an auxiliary offsite stabling and training facility and vanning program for thoroughbred races in the northern, central, and southern zones. The bill would revise and recast the provisions governing the organization formed and operated to administer the fund to include, among other things, a 50-50 percentage allocation of specified voting interests on the board of the organization, the use of funds to pay the organization\u2019s eral, or southern zone from a board-approved auxiliary offsite stabling and training facility and would authorize the organization to enter into multiyear contracts for auxiliary facilities in the northern, central, or southern zone subject to specified conditions. The bill would authorize the organization to use the funds to pay back commissions, purses, and owners\u2019 premiums to the extent that the deductions made exceed in any year the amount of the funds necessary to achieve the objectives of the organization. The bill would also authorize a thoroughbred racing association or fair in the northern zone to opt out of the auxiliary offsite stabling and training facility and vanning program, as specified. The bill would provide that the board shall reserve the right to adjudicate any disputes that arise regarding costs, or other matters, relating to the furnishing of offsite stabling or vanning, as specified. By expanding the provisions of the Horse Racing Law, a violation of which is a crime, the bill would create new crimes and would thereby impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."
