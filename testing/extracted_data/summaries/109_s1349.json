    "content": "Video Choice Act of 2005 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit a competitive video services provider (CVSP) from being required to obtain a franchise in order to provide any video programming, interactive on-demand services, other programming services, or any other video services in an area in which the CVSP has any right or authority to access public rights-of-way independent of any cable franchise obtained pursuant to any federal, state, or local law. Makes the CVSP be subject to the payment of fees to a local franchising authority based on the gross revenue of the CVSP in that area. Prohibits the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or any state or political subdivision thereof from regulating the rates or any other aspect of the services provided by a CVSP. Makes current franchise agreements entered into between a franchising authority and a CVSP exempt from this Act for the term of such agreement."
