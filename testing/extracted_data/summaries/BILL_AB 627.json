    "title": "AB 627",
    "content": "Existing law imposes specified requirements on an audit of pharmacy services provided to beneficiaries of a health benefit plan, and defines certain terms for its purposes, including, among others, pharmacy benefit manager. This bill would exempt certain contracts governing the medicines and medical supplies that are required to be provided to injured employees in workers\u2019 compensation cases from these requirements. The bill would also require a pharmacy benefit manager that reimburses a contracting pharmacy for a drug on a maximum allowable cost basis to include in a contract, initially entered into, or renewed on its scheduled renewal date, on or after January 1, 2016, information identifying any national drug pricing compendia or other data sources used to determine the maximum allowable cost for the drugs on a maximum allowable cost list and to provide for an appeal process for the contracting pharmacy, as specified. The bill would also require a pharmacy benefit manager to make available to a contracting pharmacy, upon request, the most up-to-date maximum allowable cost list or lists used by the pharmacy benefit manager for patients served by the pharmacy in a readily accessible, secure, and usable Web-based format or other comparable format. The bill would prohibit a drug from being included on a maximum allowable cost list or from being reimbursed on a maximum allowable cost basis unless certain requirements are met, including, but not limited to, that the drug is not obsolete."
