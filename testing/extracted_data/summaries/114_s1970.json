    "content": "Raising Enrollment with a Government Initiated System for Timely Electoral Registration (REGISTER) Act of 2015 This bill requires each state to designate agencies to transfer electronically to state or local election officials source information on individuals for automatic voter registration for federal elections, unless an individual disclosing information to the agency opts out of automatic registration. Such information must be transferred in a format that can be reviewed by state or local election officials and uploaded into a computerized statewide voter registration database. Registration of eligible voters not previously registered, and who have not opted out, is mandatory. A state must publish and enforce privacy and information security standards meeting specified requirements."
