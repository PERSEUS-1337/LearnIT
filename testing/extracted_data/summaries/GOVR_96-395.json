    "content": "On March 6, 2001, Congressman Don Young introduced H.R. 883 , the AmericanLand Sovereignty Act. H.R. 883 requires congressional approval to add any lands owned by the United States to the World HeritageList, a UNESCO-administered listestablished by the 1972 World Heritage Convention. Two years ago, on May 20, 1999, the House passed (by voicevote) an identical bill also numbered H.R. 883 , but the legislation did not pass in the Senate. Sponsors of that bill expressed concern that addinga U.S. site to the U.N. list, which iscurrently done under executive authority, might not protect the rights of private property owners or the states. TheClinton Administration and opponents of thebill argued that the designation has no effect on property rights and does not provide the United Nations with anylegal authority over U.S. territory. In relatedlegislation, P.L. 106-429 , in which H.R. 5526 , the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and RelatedPrograms appropriations act for 2001 wasreferenced, contained language prohibiting funding from this bill for the United Nations World Heritage Fund. TheFY2000 contribution to the Fund was$450,000. The World Heritage Fund provides technical assistance to countries requesting help in protecting WorldHeritage sites. This paper describes theoperation of the UNESCO Convention and will be updated periodically. This legislation would also affect U.S.participation in the UNESCO Man and theBiosphere Program, which includes some of the same sites. For information on that program, see CRS Report RS20220(pdf) , Biosphere Reserves and the U.S. MABProgram."
