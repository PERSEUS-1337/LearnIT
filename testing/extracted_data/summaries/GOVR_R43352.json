    "content": "The Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill provides funding for the Department of the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President (EOP), the judiciary, the District of Columbia, and more than two dozen independent agencies. Among those independent agencies are the General Services Administration (GSA), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Small Business Administration (SBA), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the United States Postal Service (USPS). The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is funded in the House through the Agriculture appropriations bill and in the Senate through the FSGG bill. CFTC funding is included in all FSGG funding tables in this report. On April 10, 2013, President Obama submitted his FY2014 budget request. The request included a total of $45.4 billion for agencies funded through the FSGG appropriations bill, including $315 million for the CFTC. On July 23, 2013, the House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 2786, the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2014. H.R. 2786 would have provided $38.3 billion for agencies funded through the House FSGG Appropriations Subcommittee. In addition, the CFTC would have received $194.6 million through the FY2014 Agriculture appropriations bill (H.R. 2410). Total FY2014 funding in the House bill was $38.3 billion, about $7.1 billion below the President's FY2014 request. On July 25, 2013, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported its FY2014 financial services bill, S. 1371. The Senate committee's bill would have provided $44.3 billion for FSGG agencies, including $315 million for the CFTC, for FY2014, $1.1 billion below the President's FY2014 request. Because none of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2014 were enacted prior to the beginning of the fiscal year, a funding gap commenced on October 1, 2013. On October 16, 2013, the Senate passed a previously passed House bill, H.R. 2775, with an amendment that, in part, provided interim continuing appropriations for the previous fiscal year's projects and activities and retitled H.R. 2775 as the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014. Later that same day, the House agreed to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2775. H.R. 2775 was signed into law on October 17, 2013 (P.L. 113-46), thus terminating the funding gap that same day. With some routine exceptions, P.L. 113-46 provided budget authority through January 15, 2014. On January 17, 2014, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (H.R. 3547/P.L. 113-76), funding the government for the rest of FY2014. The FSGG appropriations were included as Division E of P.L. 113-76. P.L. 113-76 appropriates a total of $43.2 billion for FSGG agencies, including $215 million for the CFTC, whose funding was contained in Division A of the law."
