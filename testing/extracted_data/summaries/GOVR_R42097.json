    "content": "The Constitution sets out three eligibility requirements to be President: one must be 35 years of age, a resident \"within the United States\" for 14 years, and a \"natural born Citizen.\" There is no Supreme Court case which has ruled specifically on a challenge to one's eligibility to be President (although several cases have addressed the term \"natural born\" citizen), and this clause has been the subject of several legal and historical treatises over the years, as well as more recent litigation. The term \"natural born\" citizen is not defined in the Constitution, and there is no discussion of the term evident in the notes of the Federal Convention of 1787. At the time of independence, and at the time of the framing of the Constitution, however, the term \"natural born\" with respect to citizenship was in use for many years in the American colonies, and then in the states, from British common law and legal usage. Under the common law principle of jus soli (law of the soil), persons born on English soil, even of two alien parents, were \"natural born\" subjects and, as noted by the Supreme Court, this \"same rule\" was applicable in the American colonies and \"in the United States afterwards, and continued to prevail under the Constitution ...\" with respect to citizens. In textual constitutional analysis, it is understood that terms used but not defined in the document must, as explained by the Supreme Court, \"be read in light of British common law\" since the Constitution is \"framed in the language of the English common law.\" In addition to historical and textual analysis, numerous holdings and references in federal (and state) cases for more than a century have clearly indicated that those born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction (i.e., not born to foreign diplomats or occupying military forces), even to alien parents, are citizens \"at birth\" or \"by birth,\" and are therefore \"natural born\"\u2014as opposed to \"naturalized\"\u2014U.S. citizens. There is no provision in the Constitution and no controlling American case law to support a contention that the citizenship of one's parents governs the eligibility of U.S. citizens born within the United States to be President. Although the eligibility of U.S. born citizens has been settled law for more than a century, there have been legitimate legal issues raised concerning those born outside of the country to U.S. citizens. From historical material and case law, it appears that the common understanding of the term \"natural born\" in England and in the American colonies in the 1700s included both the strict common law meaning as born in the territory (jus soli), as well as the statutory laws adopted in England since at least 1350, which included children born abroad to British fathers (jus sanguinis, the law of descent). Legal scholars in the field of citizenship have asserted that this common understanding and legal meaning in England and in the American colonies was incorporated into the usage and intent of the term in the U.S. Constitution to include those who are citizens at birth. Challenges in 2008 to the eligibility of both Senators John McCain and Barack Obama to be President, and \"ballot access\" challenges to President Obama in 2012, have prompted numerous court decisions which appear to have validated the traditional, historical, and legal meaning of the term \"natural born\" citizen as one who is entitled to U.S. citizenship \"by birth\" or \"at birth.\" This would include those born \"in\" the United States and under its jurisdiction (i.e. \"native\" born), even those born to alien parents; those born abroad to U.S. citizen-parents; or those born in other situations meeting legal requirements for U.S. citizenship \"at birth.\" Such term, however, would not include a person who was not a U.S. citizen by birth or at birth, and who was thus born an \"alien\" required to go through the legal process of \"naturalization\" to become a U.S. citizen. This report has been updated from a previous version to include recent relevant judicial and administrative decisions, and will be updated as new decisional material may warrant."
