    "content": "Integrity in Auditing Act of 2002 - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to prohibit an independent public accountant from providing: (1) management consulting or any other non-audit-related services during the same calendar year in which it provides auditing services. (2) any service that could either result in a potential conflict of interest, or impair auditor independence. Or (3) auditing or related services for an issuer for more than seven consecutive years. Bars an independent public accountant from employment in a management or other policymaking position for an issuer for whom that accountant has provided auditing services during the one-year period preceding the date of employment. Permits the performance, however, of tax consulting services contemporaneously with any auditing or related service. Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to require: (1) issuer disclosure of the nature, extent, and duration of interrelationships between the issuer and the board of directors, senior officers of the corporation, and immediate family members. And (2) the audit committee and compensation committee of an issuer to consist solely of independent directors. Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) tough enforcement, including criminal prosecution whenever possible, is the most effective deterrent to fraudulent activity. And (2) the Commission should take a firm, swift approach to wrongdoers."
