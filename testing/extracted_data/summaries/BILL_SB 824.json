    "title": "SB 824",
    "content": "Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the State Air Resources Board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of a market-based compliance mechanism relative to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Existing law continuously appropriates specified portions of the annual proceeds in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to various programs, including 5 for the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program, for expenditures to provide transit operating or capital assistance consistent with specified criteria. Existing law provides for distribution of available funds under the program by a specified formula to recipient transit agencies by the Controller, upon approval of the recipient transit agency\u2019s proposed expenditures by the Department of Transportation. This bill would require a recipient transit agency to demonstrate that each expenditure of program moneys allocated to the agency does not supplant another source of funds. The bill would authorize a recipient transit agency that does not submit an expenditure for funding under the program in a particular fiscal year to retain its funding share for expenditure in a subsequent fiscal year for a maximum of 4 years. The bill would allow a recipient transit agency to loan or transfer its funding share in any particular fiscal year to another recipient transit agency within the same region, or to apply to the department to reassign, to other eligible expenditures under the program, any savings of surplus moneys from an approved and completed expenditure under the program or from an approved expenditure that is no longer a priority, as specified. The bill would also allow a recipient transit agency to apply to the department for a letter of no prejudice for any eligible expenditures under the program for which the department has authorized a disbursement of funds, and, if granted, would allow the recipient transit agency to expend its own moneys and to be eligible for future reimbursement from the program, under specified conditions. The bill would also require a recipient transit agency to provide additional information to the department to the extent funding is sought for capital projects."
