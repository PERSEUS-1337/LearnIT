    "content": "The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, is an independent foundation that seeks to attract and rapidly disburse new resources in developing countries aimed at countering the three diseases. The Fund is a financing vehicle, not an implementing agency. The origins of the Fund as an independent entity to fight the three diseases lie partly in a French proposal made in 1998, in ideas developed in the 106th Congress, and in recommendations made by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan in April 2001. Though the Global Fund was established in January 2002, President Bush pledged $200 million to such a fund in May 2001. As of July 17, 2008, donors have pledged more than $20.2 billion to the Fund, of which more than $10.2 billion has been paid. The fund has approved support for more than 500 grants totaling some $10 billion for projects in 136 countries. Each year, the Fund awards grants through Proposal Rounds. The Fund launched its eighth Round on March 3, 2008. In 2005, the Fund approved Round 5 grants in two tranches, because initially there were insufficient donor pledges to approve all the recommended proposals. The Fund approved the first group of Round 5 proposals in September 2005 and the second in December 2005, after donors pledged to make additional contributions. The Global Fund only approves proposals if it has sufficient resources on hand to support the first two years of a proposed project. This policy is designed to avoid disruptions to projects due to funding shortages. Funding lapses can cause interruptions in treatment regiments, which could lead to treatment-resistant strains of the diseases or death. The United States is the largest single contributor to the Global Fund. From FY2001 through FY2008, Congress has made available an estimated $3.6 billion to the Fund, including $840.3 million in FY2008, the single largest U.S. contribution to date. Of those funds, $545.5 million would come from the State Department, and $294.8 million from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The President requested $500 million for a FY2009 contribution to the Global Fund. There has been some debate about the level of U.S. contributions to the Fund. Some critics argue that the United States should temper its support to the Fund, because the Fund has not demonstrated strong reporting and monitoring practices; because contributions made to the Fund in excess of the President's request are provided at the expense of U.S. bilateral HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs; and because they maintain that the Fund needs to secure support from other sources, particularly the private sector. Supporters of current funding levels counter that the Fund has improved its reporting and monitoring practices, greater U.S. contributions to the Fund parallel increases in U.S. bilateral HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, and the Fund has attempted to raise participation of the private sector through the launching of Product Red\u2122. This report, which will be periodically updated, discusses the Fund's progress to date, describes U.S. contributions to the organization, and presents some issues Congress might consider."
