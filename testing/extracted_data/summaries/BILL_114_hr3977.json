    "content": "Trash Reduction Act of 2015 This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to require retailers to pay a $0.10 excise tax on each carryout bag provided to a consumer. A quot, carryout bagquot. Means a bag of any material, commonly plastic or kraft paper, which is provided to a consumer at the point of sale to carry or cover purchases, merchandise, or other items. Reusable bags and certain other bags used for specified purposes are exempt from such tax. The bill allows retailers who establish a qualified plastic carryout bag recycling program a rebate for each recyclable bag used by the retailer. The bill establishes the Carryout Bag Trust Fund to hold tax revenues generated by this Act and directs the Department of the Treasury to make payments from such Trust Fund for the qualified plastic carryout bag recycling program and to the Land and Water Conservation Fund established by the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965. The Government Accountability Office must study and report to Congress on the effectiveness of this Act in reducing the use of carryout bags and encouraging recycling of such bags."
