    "content": "Reforming the enforcement of immigration law is a core component of the recommendations made by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (also known as the9/11 Commission). The 19 hijackers responsible for the 9/11 attacks were foreign nationals, manyof whom were able to obtain visas to enter the United States through the use of forged documents. Incomplete intelligence and screening enabled many of the hijackers to enter the United Statesdespite flaws in their entry documents or suspicions regarding their past associations. According tothe Commission, up to 15 of the hijackers could have been intercepted or deported through morediligent enforcement of immigration laws. The 9/11 Commission's immigration-related recommendations focused primarily on targeting terrorist travel through an intelligence and security strategy based on reliable identification systemsand effective, integrated information-sharing. As Congress has considered these recommendations,however, possible legislative responses have broadened to include significant and possiblyfar-reaching changes in the substantive law governing immigration and how that law is enforced,both at the border and in the interior of the United States. In response to the Commission's recommendations, several major bills were introduced proposing significant revisions to U.S. immigration law and policy. The two notable bills that wouldrevise immigration laws were H.R. 10 , the 9/11 Recommendations Implementation Act,as amended, introduced by the Speaker of the House of Representatives Dennis Hastert, and passedby the House as S. 2845 on October 8, 2004, and S. 2845 , the NationalIntelligence Reform Act of 2004, as amended, introduced by Senators Susan Collins and JosephLieberman and passed by the Senate on October 8, 2004. The Intelligence Reform and TerrorismPrevention Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ), a compromise version of these bills that included some - butnot all - of the immigration provisions under consideration, was signed on December 17, 2004. This report briefly discusses some of the major immigration areas that were under consideration in the above-mentioned comprehensive reform proposals, including asylum, biometric trackingsystems, border security, document security, exclusion, immigration enforcement, and visa issuances. It refers to other CRS reports that discuss these issues in depth and will be updated as needed."
