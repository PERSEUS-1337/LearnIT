    "content": "Urban Recreation and At-Risk Youth Act of 1994 - Amends the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Act of 1978 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide, through the urban park and recreation recovery program, at-risk youth recreation grants in neighborhoods and communities with a high prevalence of crime, particularly violent crime or crime committed by youth, for purposes including the provision of lighting, emergency phones, or other capital improvements for the security of urban parks. Directs the Secretary to give grant priority to local government programs meeting specified criteria, including: (1) targeting youth at the greatest risk of becoming involved in violence and crime, (2) teaching important values and life skills, (3) offering education and counseling in addition to recreation opportunities. And (4) showing the greatest potential of being continued with non-Federal funds or serving as models. Requires local governments, to be eligible for such grants, to include strategies to reduce crime and juvenile delinquency in their five-year action programs for park and recreation recovery. Requires no more than 25 percent of Federal grant funds made available under such Act to be used for program support. Repeals provisions limiting the duration of the urban park and recreation recovery program to five years."
