Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to immediately rescind regulations relating to the operation of such programs on a centralized basis and issue new regulations to allow the operation of such programs on a centralized or decentralized basis at the option of each State. Prohibits, until the Administrator carries out such requirements, the imposition of sanctions for failures by States to implement such programs or specified adverse actions against States by the Administrator or the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration. Requires the Administrator to consider the operation of programs on a decentralized basis as equivalent to operation on a centralized basis if the State demonstrates that such equivalency is reasonable. Title II: Redesignation of Attainment Areas - Amends the Clean Air Act to provide that if a State Governor submits a redesignation of an area from nonattainment to attainment and such designation is based upon attainment of the relevant national ambient air quality standard for three consecutive years, such redesignation shall become effective immediately upon receipt by the Administrator."
