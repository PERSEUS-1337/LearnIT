    "content": "In December 2014, Congress passed the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 (RAMIA), as Title VII of Division B of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235). President Obama signed the bill into law on December 16, 2014. RAMIA directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NMI) program within the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The act comes about two years after President Obama first proposed the establishment of a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation in his FY2013 budget. RAMIA includes provisions authorizing NIST, the Department of Energy, and other agencies to support the establishment of centers for manufacturing innovation and establishing and providing for the operation of a Network for Manufacturing Innovation. NIST is authorized to use up to $5.0 million per year of appropriated funds for FY2015-FY2024 to carry out its responsibilities under the act. The Department of Energy is authorized to transfer to NIST up to $250.0 million of appropriated funds over the same FY2015-FY2024 period. The Secretary of Commerce is also authorized to accept funds, services, equipment, personnel, and facilities from any covered entity\u2014federal department, federal agency, instrumentality of the United States, state, local government, tribal government, territory, or possession of the United States, or of any political subdivision thereof, or international organization, or any public or private entity or individual\u2014to carry out the program. The act also establishes a National Office of the Network for Manufacturing Innovation Program (also referred to in this report as the National Program Office) at NIST to oversee and carry out the program. Each center receiving financial assistance under the NMI program must submit annual reports to the Secretary. The Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress on the performance of the program. And the Comptroller General of the United States is directed to perform biennial assessments of the program, with a final assessment due by December 31, 2024. Several factors could affect the implementation of the NMI program. Although the act authorizes funding for establishment of the centers and the network, the act does not appropriate any funds. Funding availability for the program will depend on congressional appropriations, priorities, and allocations. In addition, the Department of Energy is authorized, but not required, to transfer funds to NIST to carry out the program. Another program uncertainty relates to the network of centers. While the act specifies which new and existing centers are eligible to be a part of the network and designates the National Program Office as \"a convener of the Network,\" it does not further specify the purpose, federal role, and activities of the network."
