    "title": "An act to amend Section 20583 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation.",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes the Controller, upon approval of a claim for the postponement of ad valorem property taxes, to directly pay a county tax collector for the property taxes owed by the claimant, as provided. Existing law requires all sums paid for the postponement of property taxes pursuant to these provisions to be secured by a lien in favor of the state. Amounts owed by a claimant are due if the claimant, or his or her surviving spouse, ceases to occupy the premises as his or her residential dwelling, dies, disposes of the property, or allows specified taxes and special assessments to become delinquent, as provided. Existing law requires that the residential dwelling be owned by the claimant, the claimant and spouse, or the claimant and another specified individual. Existing law requires a claimant to file a claim containing specified information, including a description of the residential dwelling, under penalty of perjury. This bill would provide that \u201cowned\u201d for these purposes includes the interest of a beneficiary of a special needs trust. This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 20583 of the Revenue and Taxation Code proposed by AB 1952 that would become operative if both bills are enacted and this bill is enacted last. By requiring a special needs trust claimant for property tax postponement to file certain information under penalty of perjury, thereby expanding the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
