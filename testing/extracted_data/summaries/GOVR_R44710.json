    "content": "Congress appropriates several billion dollars annually to support and sustain a broad footprint of military bases, reflecting both a federal investment in local communities and a local investment in national defense. Specific military construction project authorizations\u2015provided through the annual National Defense Authorization Act\u2015enable the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the Army, Air Force, and Navy to plan, program, design, and build the runways, piers, warehouses, barracks, schools, hospitals, child development centers, and other facilities needed to support U.S. military forces at home and overseas. This report describes and explains the end-to-end military construction process by which DOD and Congress act together to build that footprint, beginning with the requirement for a facility and ending with the opening of its doors for occupancy. The process encompasses several steps: determination of need by the local installation commander and engineering office, vetting and prioritization of construction projects within the military chain of command and the military department, consolidation and budgeting within the Office of the Secretary of Defense to create the infrastructure construction portion of the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP), inclusion of the final budget year list of projects in the annual President's Budget Request to Congress, review and adjustment of the list by the congressional defense committees, consideration and passage of the necessary authorization and appropriation bills and their enactment by the President, and execution of the approved construction program by the military services' executive agents\u2014Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) and Army Corps of Engineers (ACE)."
