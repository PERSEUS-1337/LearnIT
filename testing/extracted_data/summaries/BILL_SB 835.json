    "title": "SB 835",
    "content": "Existing law with respect to claims against public entities authorizes the \u201cboard,\u201d as defined, to assess a surcharge to the state entity against which an approved claim was filed in an amount not to exceed 15 of the claim. Existing law requires the surcharge to be deposited into the General Fund and provides that it may be appropriated in support of the board in the annual Budget Act. This bill would specify that the Department of General Services may assess this surcharge, would require the surcharge to be deposited into the Service Revolving Fund, and would specify that the surcharge may be appropriated to the department in the annual Budget Act. Existing law defines a human trafficking caseworker to mean a human trafficking caseworker as defined by the Evidence Code. This bill would expand that definition to include a human trafficking caseworker who is employed by a homeless services provider that serves homeless children or youth and has completed a minimum of 8 hours of training focused on victims of human trafficking from the Runaway and Homeless Youth Training and Technical Assistance Center. Existing law authorizes the State Public Works Board to issue up to $270,000,000 in revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes to finance the acquisition, design, and construction of approved adult local criminal justice facilities, setting aside $20,000,000 to be awarded to the County of Napa. This bill would require that $20,000,000 of the amount issued by the board in revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes be set aside and awarded to the County of Napa without the submission of any further adult local criminal justice facility proposal. The bill would also authorize those funds to be utilized in conjunction with a partial award made to the County of Napa pursuant to other specified provisions. Article XXXIV of the California Constitution, among other things, prohibits any state public body from developing, constructing, or acquiring a low-rent housing project before a majority of the qualified electors vote upon and approve the project. Existing law provides that the words \u201cdevelop, construct, or acquire\u201d for the purposes of that constitutional provision shall not be interpreted to include specified activities of a state public body. This bill would include in those specified activities the financing for a specified low-rent housing project by a state public body, as provided. Senate Bill 839 of the 2015\u201316 Regular Session would authorize the State Air Resources Board to enter into agreements with private entities and receive, on behalf of the state, contributions from private sources in the form of equipment or money in order to expedite the processing of applications, resolutions, and executive orders pertaining to a specified exception to the requirement that vehicles be equipped with pollution control devices or systems and the authorization to sell and install aftermarket and performance parts with a valid executive order. SB 839 would require all moneys received to be separately accounted for, be deposited into the Air Pollution Control Fund, and available to the state board for these purposes upon appropriation of the Legislature. This bill would repeal that authorization for the state board to enter into those agreements and the requirement for the deposit of those moneys received, if Section 43011.3 of the Health and Safety Code is added by Section 24 of SB 839 and SB 839 becomes effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is enacted after SB 839. This bill would appropriate $3,000,000 from the Gambling Control Fund to the Department of Justice for the purposes of addressing the backlog in investigations related to card room licensing. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill."
