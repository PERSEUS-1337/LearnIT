    "title": "An act to amend Section 1203.45 of the Penal Code, and to amend Sections 781 and 903.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to court records.",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes a person to petition the court for an order sealing the record of conviction and other official records in a case in which that person was under 18 years of age at the time of commission of a misdemeanor and is eligible for, or has previously received, specified relief. Existing law authorizes that person to be required to reimburse the court, the county, or any city for the actual cost of services rendered, as specified. This bill would only make persons 26 years of age or older liable to reimburse the court, the county, or any city for the cost of services. Existing law authorizes in a case in which a petition has been filed with a juvenile court to commence proceedings to adjudge a person a ward of the court, in a case in which a person is cited to appear before a probation officer or is taken before a probation officer pursuant to a specified provision of law, or in a case in which a minor is taken before an officer of a law enforcement agency, the person or the county probation officer to petition the court for the sealing of arrest records and records relating to the person\u2019s case in the custody of the juvenile court and the probation officer and any other agencies, including law enforcement agencies and public officials as the petitioner alleges to have custody of the records. This bill would prohibit an unfulfilled order of restitution that has been converted to a civil judgment from barring the sealing of a record pursuant to the above provisions. The bill would also prohibit outstanding restitution fines and court-ordered fees from being considered when assessing whether a petitioner\u2019s rehabilitation has been attained to the satisfaction of the court and from barring the sealing of a record pursuant to the above provisions. The bill would provide that a minor is not relieved of the obligation to pay victim restitution, restitution fines, and court-ordered fines and fees because the minor\u2019s records are sealed. The bill would provide that sealing a record does not prohibit a court from enforcing a civil judgment for an unfulfilled order of restitution, and that a victim or a local collection program may continue to enforce victim restitution orders, restitution fines, and court-ordered fines and fees after a record is sealed. By increasing the number of records local agencies would be required to seal, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing law makes a father, mother, spouse, or other person liable for the support of a minor person, the minor when he or she becomes an adult, or the estates of those persons, liable for the cost to the county and court for any investigation related to the sealing and for the sealing of any juvenile court or arrest records pursuant to the above-mentioned provisions. Existing law also authorizes those persons to be required to reimburse the court, county, or a city for the actual cost of services rendered, as specified. This bill would only require persons 26 years of age or older who petition for an order sealing his or her record, pursuant to specified provisions, to be liable for the investigative costs and to reimburse the costs of services rendered. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
