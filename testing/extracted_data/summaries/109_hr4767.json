    "title": "To require the Food and Drug Administration to conduct consumer testing to determine the appropriateness of the current labeling requirements for indoor tanning devices and determine whether such requirements provide sufficient information to consumers regarding the risks that the use of such devices pose for the development of irreversible damage to the skin, including skin cancer, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "Tanning Accountability and Notification Act of 2006 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, to determine whether: (1) the labeling requirements for indoor tanning devices provide sufficient information to consumers regarding the risks that the use of such devices pose for the development of irreversible damage to the eyes and skin, including skin cancer. (2) adding the warning suggested by the American Academy of Dermatology or any other additional warning to the current warning label would communicate such risks more effectively. And (3) there is no warning that would be capable of adequately communicating such risks. Requires the Secretary, in making such determinations, to: (1) conduct appropriate consumer testing using the best available methods for determining consumer understanding of label warnings. And (2) hold public hearings and solicit comments from the public."
