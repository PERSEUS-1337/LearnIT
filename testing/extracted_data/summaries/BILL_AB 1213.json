    "title": "AB 1213",
    "content": "Existing law requires sex offenders to wear global positioning system (GPS) devices while on parole, and requires some of those offenders to wear those devices for life. This bill would require the Department of Justice to establish an Offender Global Positioning System Database that would receive and store GPS device data for offenders monitored by criminal justice agencies throughout the state. The database would be required, among other capabilities, to receive specified data and to be able to send commands to a GPS device requiring the device to report data and to comply with other functional requirements. The department would be required to provide, at state expense, connections to the database to one sheriff\u2019s system and one probation department system in each county for purposes of submitting data to the database. By imposing additional duties on local law enforcement agencies in connection with the operation of the GPS database, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
