    "title": "AB 2261",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes any person who believes that he or she has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against in violation of any law under the jurisdiction of the Labor Commissioner to file a complaint, as specified, with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, which is within the Department of Industrial Relations, and requires the commissioner to establish procedures for the investigation of discrimination complaints. This bill would authorize the division to, with or without receiving a complaint from an employee, commence an investigation, issue a citation, or bring an action against investigation of an employer who discharges or otherwise discriminates that it suspects to have discharged or otherwise discriminated against an individual in violation of any law under the jurisdiction of the Labor Commissioner."
