    "content": "Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act of 2016 This bill expresses the sense of Congress that: foreign governments, including the governments of the Russian Federation and China, use disinformation and other propaganda tools to undermine the national security objectives of the United States and key allies and partners. The US government should develop a comprehensive strategy to counter foreign disinformation and propaganda and assert leadership in developing a fact-based strategic narrative. And an important element of this strategy should be to promote an independent press in countries that are vulnerable to foreign disinformation. The Department of State shall establish a Center for Information Analysis and Response to: lead and coordinate the collection and analysis of information on foreign government information warfare efforts. Establish a framework for the integration of critical data and analysis on foreign propaganda and disinformation efforts into the development of national strategy. And develop and synchronize government initiatives to expose and counter foreign information operations directed against US national security interests and advance fact-based narratives that support US allies and interests. When selecting participants for US educational and cultural exchange programs, special consideration shall be given to students and community leaders from populations and countries deemed vulnerable to foreign propaganda and disinformation campaigns."
