    "title": "An act to amend Section 201.3 of the Labor Code, relating to employment, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately.",
    "content": "Existing law generally requires that an employee of a temporary services employer, as defined, be paid weekly. Existing law provides that a violation of these provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor. This bill would, with certain exceptions, make the weekly pay requirement applicable to a security guard employed by a private patrol operator who is a temporary services employer, as provided. By expanding the scope of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."
