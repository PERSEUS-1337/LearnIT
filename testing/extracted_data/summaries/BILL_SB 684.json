    "title": "SB 684",
    "content": "The Corporation Tax Law imposes taxes according to or measured by net income at a rate of 8.84, or for financial institutions, at a rate of 10.84, as specified. This bill would, for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2015, revise that rate for taxpayers that are publicly held corporations, as defined, and instead impose an applicable tax rate from 7 to 13, or for financial institutions, from 9 to 15, based on the compensation ratio, as defined, of the corporation. This bill would increase the applicable tax rate by 50 for those taxpayers that have a specified decrease in full-time employees employed in the United States as compared to an increase in contracted and foreign full-time employees, as described. This bill would include a change in state statute that would result in a taxpayer paying a higher tax within the meaning of Section 3 of Article XIII A of the California Constitution, and thus would require for passage the approval of 23 of the membership of each house of the Legislature. This act provides for a tax levy within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect."
