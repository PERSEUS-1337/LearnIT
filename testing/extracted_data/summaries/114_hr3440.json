    "content": "Fusion Innovation Act of 2015 Directs the Office of Science of the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a Fusion Innovation Initiative, under which the Office shall issue a competitive, merit-reviewed funding opportunity announcement to solicit proposals for engineering designs for innovative fusion energy systems, including upgrades to existing facilities, which have the potential to demonstrate net energy production not later than seven years after the start of construction. Requires a recipient to submit the design within 18 months after receiving funding. Directs the Office to assign top priority to, and provide expedited financial support for, relevant construction activities for any design that the Office determines merits support. Directs DOE to establish open, transparent processes to share unclassified resources and information that will accelerate the advancement of fusion energy technologies among researchers from the National Laboratories , institutions of higher education, and the private sector. Directs the Office to: (1) establish processes to make unclassified, proprietary simulation codes relevant to the development of a fusion energy system, that are controlled by a National Laboratory, available to researchers from other National Laboratories, institutions of higher education, and the private sector. (2) support shared platforms for the co-development of simulation codes for fusion energy systems among such researchers. And (3) establish a process for fusion researchers from the National Laboratories to serve limited-term residencies at private sector companies working to advance fusion technologies. Directs DOE to submit a report assessing its capabilities to authorize, host, and oversee privately funded fusion prototypes with up to 20 megawatts thermal output and related demonstration facilities at DOE-owned sites."
