    "content": "High Technology Indexation Act of 1993 - Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to change from discretionary to mandatory the Secretary of Commerce's authority to establish indexing standards which provide for automatic increases in the performance levels of certain goods or technology subject to export licensing controls. Requires removal from the commodity control list of goods or technology which no longer require licensing under the increased performance level standards, unless the Secretary reports to specified congressional committees that removal of controls will permit exports detrimental to US national security or US policies. Directs the Secretary to require technical advisory committees to recommend indexing standards for certain goods or technology. Requires the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register a performance-based indexing system to ensure that the definition of supercomputer and all controls and security safeguard procedures on supercomputer exports or reexports are commensurate with technological advances. Sets forth circumstances under which such safeguards are not required."
