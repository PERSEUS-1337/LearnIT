    "content": "Generic Pharmaceutical Access and Choice for Consumers Act of 2001 -Amends the Public Health Service Act to require each grant or contract entered into under the Act that involves the provision of health care items or services to individuals to include provisions to ensure that any prescriptions provided for under such grant or contract are filled by providing the generic form of the drug involved, unless there is no approved generic form of the drug, or the nongeneric form of the drug is either specifically ordered by the prescribing provider or requested by the individual for whom the drug is prescribed. Makes similar changes under the Federal Employee Health Benefits program, Medicare program, Medicaid program, and programs affecting Indians, veterans, the uniformed services, and prisoners. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require that for each drug application filed there shall be a determination as to whether there is a therapeutic equivalent for such drug."
