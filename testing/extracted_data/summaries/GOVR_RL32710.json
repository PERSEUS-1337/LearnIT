    "content": "This report examines Germany's response to global Islamic terrorism after the September 11,2001 attacks in the United States. It looks at current German strategy, domestic efforts, andinternational responses, including possible gaps and weaknesses. It examines the state ofU.S.-German cooperation, including problems and prospects for future cooperation. This report maybe updated as needed. Although somewhat overshadowed in the public view by the strong and vocal disagreementsover Iraq policy, U.S.-German cooperation in the global fight against international terrorism hasbeen extensive. German support is particularly important because several Al Qaeda members and9/11 plotters lived there and the country is a key hub for the transnational flow of persons and goods.Domestically, Germany faces the challenge of having a sizable population of Muslims, some withextremist views, whom terrorists might seek to recruit. German counterterrorism strategy shares a number of elements with that of the United States,although there are clear differences in emphasis. Like the United States, Germany now sees radicalIslamic terrorism as its primary national security threat and itself as a potential target of attack. Today, Germany also recognizes that threats to its domestic security lie far beyond its own borders,in places such as Afghanistan. Germany has introduced a number of policy, legislative, and organizational reforms since9/11 to make the country less hospitable to potential terrorists. Despite these reforms, critics pointto continuing problems hampering Germany's domestic efforts. German law enforcement andintelligence communities face more bureaucratic hurdles, stricter constraints, and closer oversightthan those in many other countries. The German government has sent troops into combat beyond Europe for the first time sinceWorld War II. Currently Germany has about 7,800 troops based abroad of which some forty percentare directly engaged in counterterror missions. In Afghanistan, some 2,300 German soldiersparticipate in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Germany's role in Afghanistan'sstabilization and reconstruction is substantial. German military efforts have been hampered to someextent by delays in implementing military reforms to make German forces more expeditionary. A key question for U.S. German relations is whether differences on issues such as Iraq policy-- shaped by different national interests, practices, and historical experiences -- will harmU.S.-German cooperation against terrorism. Some believe that understanding and accepting thesedifferences (agreeing to disagree) may be the best approach to enhancing future U.S.-Germancooperation in the global war on terrorism. Both countries have strong incentives to make thecooperation work."
