    "content": "S. 2262 has four energy efficiency titles, which address buildings, industry, federal agencies, and certain regulatory measures. Title V would provide a budgetary offset for bill authorizations. The bill was derived directly from S. 1392, often referred to as the Shaheen-Portman bill of 2013. During the first session, floor action on S. 1392 was halted by a push for votes on controversial non-energy amendments. Many energy amendments were also prepared for S. 1392, but floor action stopped before formal consideration. In the second session, anticipating the potential for further procedural battles, bill sponsors sought to expand the S. 1392 framework. The aim of expanding the bill was to secure enough additional votes to address the potential for a filibuster by ensuring sufficient votes for cloture on debate. The expanded bill was introduced as S. 2074. It contains all the core provisions of S. 1392, and the text of 10 bipartisan amendments that had been proposed for S. 1392 in floor action during 2013. The text of S. 2262 is identical to that of S. 2074, except that the amount of budget offsets in section 501 was increased from $638 million to $720 million (for FY2014 through FY2018). This report reviews the provisions of S. 2262, highlights the most controversial bill provision, and identifies potential amendments to the bill. The most controversial provision in S. 2262 is section 431. That section is an updated version of S.Amdt. 1917 to S. 1392 (Hoeven-Manchin amendment). Section 431 would repeal an existing requirement to eliminate fossil energy use in new federal buildings by 2030. DOE has found the provision difficult to implement, and has not yet issued a rule to enforce it. In place of that requirement, section 431 would tighten energy efficiency guidelines and building codes for new federal buildings\u2014but to a lesser degree. Supporters assert that the existing prohibition is unworkable, citing DOE's inability to implement it and the \"more feasible\" goals in section 431. Opponents claim that the amendment would undermine federal leadership-by-example on net-zero energy buildings and on the effort to reduce federal greenhouse gas emissions. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), which has publicly stated support for the bill, estimates an energy-saving potential of 1.8 quadrillion Btu (quads) by 2030, with an associated cost-saving potential of $16.2 billion. S. 2262 was designed to be deficit neutral. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that it would provide a net decrease in the federal budget deficit of $12 million over the period from FY2014 through FY2024. Bill sponsors reported that over 270 businesses, associations, and trade groups\u2014from the National Association of Manufacturers to the Chamber of Commerce\u2014support S. 2262. The Obama Administration expressed support for S. 1392, but it has not yet issued a Statement of Administration Policy on S. 2262. In opposition to S. 2262, Heritage Action\u2014an advocacy group affiliated with the Heritage Foundation\u2014argues that the incentives in the bill \"would burden taxpayers and consumers alike while producing no tangible benefits.\" A cloture vote brought S. 2262 up for Senate floor action on May 6, 2014. Floor debate focused on the potential for action on five energy-related amendments, covering the issues of Keystone XL pipeline, liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, power plant carbon capture technology, social cost of carbon, and carbon tax. An effort to forge an agreement to limit amendments did not succeed. On May 12, 2014, a cloture vote to close debate failed (55-36), whereupon the Majority Leader entered a motion to reconsider the vote."
