    "content": "Prohibits the NRC and agreement States from taking any action to facilitate, implement, promulgate, or issue any administrative guidance that would allow the free release into commerce of radioactively contaminated scrap metal until such standard has been established. Mandates that: (1) radioactively contaminated equipment, devices, commodities, and other materials approved for release to persons exempt from NRC licensing requirements be released only pursuant to regulations governing the release of byproduct and source material under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. And (2) the Departments of Defense and of Energy and all other agencies that oversee or control the release of radioactively contaminated metals adopt standards no less stringent than those established by the NRC. Directs the US Customs Service to monitor and enforce such standards at US borders. Instructs the Secretary of State to work with international standard-writing bodies to adopt standards consistent with those of the NRC. Sets forth interim certification guidelines governing scrap metal imported into the United States. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of this Act.
