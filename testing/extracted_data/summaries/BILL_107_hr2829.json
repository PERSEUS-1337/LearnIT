    "content": "Sound Science for Endangered Species Act Planning Act of 2001 - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to direct the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) give greater weight to scientific and commercial data that is empirical or that has been field-tested or peer-reviewed in determining that a species is an endangered or threatened species. And (2) promulgate regulations that establish criteria for data to be used as the basis of such a determination. Prohibits the Secretary from determining that a species is endangered or threatened unless the determination is supported by data obtained by observation of the species in the field. Requires the Secretary to accept, acknowledge receipt of, and include in the rulemaking record of such a determination data collected by landowners through observation of the species on the land. Requires the Secretary to publish with the notice of a proposed regulation a description of additional scientific and commercial data that would assist in the preparation of a recovery plan, invite any person to submit such data, and describe the steps for acquiring additional data. Directs the Secretary: (1) to solicit recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences and develop a list of qualified reviewers to participate in independent scientific review actions. (2) before any proposed action becomes final, to appoint from such list three individuals who shall report on the scientific information and analyses on which such action is based. And (3) to include such report in the official record of the proposed action. Requires the Secretary, in consulting with each Federal agency and the affected States to insure that any agency action is not likely to jeopardize any endangered or threatened species or destroy the species' habitat, to: (1) consider information provided by such States. And (2) provide any person who has sought authorization or funding from a Federal agency for an action the opportunity to submit, discuss, and receive information relevant to the draft biological opinion."
