    "content": "The Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives (CAO) is an elected officer of the House, chosen at the beginning of each Congress. The office of the CAO consists of three divisions: the immediate office of the CAO, operations, and customer solutions. Together, these divisions oversee human resources, financial services, technology infrastructure, procurement, facilities management, and other House support functions. An office initially created at the beginning the 104th Congress (1995-1996), the CAO assumed the duties previously performed by the Director of Non-Legislative and Financial Services, and manages the operations of other House administrative offices and support services."
