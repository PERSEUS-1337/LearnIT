    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides benefits to veterans who meet certaineligibility rules. Benefits to veterans range from disability compensation and pensions to hospital andmedical care. VA provides these benefits to veterans through three major operating units: theVeterans Health Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and theNational Cemetery Administration (NCA). VHA is primarily a direct service provider of primarycare, specialized care, and related medical and social support services to veterans through anintegrated health care system. Veterans are enrolled in priority groups that determine payments forservice and nonservice-connected medical conditions. In FY2004, Congress appropriated $28.4billion for VHA to be spent through an account structure composed of four new accounts: medicalservices, medical administration, medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. For FY2005, the Administration submitted its budget request to Congress using a newaccount structure that consolidated several accounts into two \"business lines\": medical care, andmedical and prosthetic research. The Administration requested $29.1 billion for VHA for FY2005. On September 9, 2004, the House Committee on Appropriations reported the FY2005appropriations bill for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development,and Independent Agencies for FY2005 ( H.R. 5041 ) ( H.Rept. 108-674 ). The Committeerejected the alternative appropriations structure recommended by the Administration andrecommended $30.3 billion for VA medical programs for FY2005. This is an increase of $1.2 billionover the President's request and $1.9 billion over FY2004. On September 21, 2004, the SenateCommittee on Appropriations reported its version of the FY2005 VA-HUD appropriations bill, S. 2825 ( S.Rept. 108-353 ). Under S. 2825, as reported, VHA would havereceived $30.4 billion in FY2005. This is a $2 billion increase from FY2004, and $1.2 billion morethan the President's request. On November 20, 2004, both the House and Senate adopted theconference agreement to accompany the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 ( H.R. 4818 , P.L. 108-447 ). The bill was signed into law on December 8, 2004. Under P.L.108-447 , VHAwould receive $30.3 billion in FY2005 -- an increase of $1.2 billion over the FY2005 appropriationrequest, and $1.9 billion over FY2004. In its budget submission to Congress, the Administration also proposed several legislative andregulatory changes to increase certain copayments and other cost- sharing charges for lower-priorityveterans and to reduce copays for certain veterans. The House and Senate Committees onAppropriations, and the final conference agreement did not accept any of the Administration'scost-sharing proposals for VHA. This report will not be updated."
