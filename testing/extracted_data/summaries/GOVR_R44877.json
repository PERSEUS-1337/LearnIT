It also provides an overview of FY2017 appropriations for agencies and bureaus funded as part of annual CJS appropriations. Division B of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) provided a total of $66.360 billion (which includes $109 million in emergency-designated funding) for CJS. Under the act, the Department of Commerce received $9.237 billion, the Department of Justice received $28.962 billion, the science agencies received $27.240 billion, and the related agencies received $921 million. The Trump Administration requested a total of $62.331 billion for CJS for FY2018, a $4.029 billion (6.1%) reduction compared to the FY2017 enacted appropriation. The request included $7.817 billion for the Department of Commerce, $28.205 billion for the Department of Justice, $25.751 billion for the science agencies, and $559 million for the related agencies. The Administration's budget included cuts for most CJS accounts. In addition to the funding reductions, the Administration proposed to eliminate several CJS agencies and programs, including the Economic Development Administration, the Minority Business Development Administration, the Legal Services Corporation, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Office of Education. On July 17, 2017, the House Committee on Appropriations reported its FY2018 CJS appropriations bill (H.R. 3267). The text of the FY2018 CJS committee-reported appropriations bill was included as Division C of an omnibus appropriations bill that was passed by the House on September 14, 2017 (H.R. 3354). The House-passed bill, as amended, would have provided $65.719 billion for CJS, which is 1.0% less than the FY2017 enacted appropriation, but 5.2% greater than the Administration's request. The bill included $8.350 billion for the Department of Commerce, $29.310 billion for the Department of Justice, $27.217 billion for the science agencies, and $842 million for the related agencies. The House-passed bill would have provided funding for the agencies and programs the Administration proposed eliminating. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported its FY2018 CJS appropriations bill (S. 1662) on July 27, 2017. The committee-reported bill recommended a total of $65.991 billion for CJS for FY2018, an amount that was 0.6% less than the FY2017 enacted appropriation, but 5.7% more than the Administration's request. The committee-reported bill included $9.161 billion for the Department of Commerce, $29.068 billion for the Department of Justice, $26.846 billion for the science agencies, and $916 million for the related agencies. The Senate committee-reported bill would have provided funding for the agencies and programs the Administration proposed eliminating. For FY2018, Congress and the President provided $72.119 billion for CJS in enacted appropriations. This includes $70.921 billion in regular appropriations provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (Division B, P.L. 115-141) and $1.198 billion in emergency-designated funding provided in the Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-123). The total FY2018 enacted appropriation is $12.137 billion for the Department of Commerce, $30.384 billion for the Department of Justice, $28.609 billion for the science agencies, and $989 million for the related agencies. Nearly all CJS accounts saw an increase in funding for FY2018. In addition, Congress declined to adopt the Administration's earlier proposal to eliminate funding for several CJS agencies and programs."
