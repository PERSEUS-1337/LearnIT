    "title": "To amend the Acts popularly known as the Duck Stamp Act and the Wetland Loan Act to reauthorize appropriations to promote the conservation of migratory waterfowl and to offset or prevent the serious loss of important wetlands and other waterfowl habitat essential to the preservation of such waterfowl, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "Amends the Wetland Loan Act to extend funding for conservation of migratory waterfowl and habitat. Amends the Duck Stamp Act to increase the price of federal migratory-bird hunting and conservation stamps, and to revise procedures for disposing of unsold stamps. Provides that nothing in the Act shall be construed to require a person to affix a stamp sold under such Act to any other license as a condition of engaging in hunting under the authority of the stamp. Expresses the sense of Congress that the funds provided pursuant to this Act should be used for preserving and increasing waterfowl populations in accordance with the goals and objectives of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, and to that end, should be used to supplement and not replace current conservation funding, including funding for other federal and state habitat conservation programs. States the sense of Congress that this Act should be implemented in a manner that helps private landowners achieve their long-term land use objectives in ways that enhance the conservation of wetlands and wildlife habitat."
