    "content": "Approximately 13 years ago, in December 1988, the first military base closure commission recommended the closing and realignment of 145 U.S. domestic bases and facilities. This action wasthe consequence of the Department of Defense's broad reevaluation of its mission in conjunctionwith the weakening and ultimate collapse of the Soviet Union. There was little need, according tothe Pentagon, to continue to retain the vast Cold War-era infrastructure. Funds saved from closingdown underutilized bases, DOD further noted, could be used to enhance development of newweapons and improved readiness. The 1988 round of infrastructure reductions was followed by three additional rounds in 1991, 1993, and 1995. Since then, no further rounds of base closures and realignments have beenauthorized by Congress, despite repeated requests from the Department of Defense in recent yearsfor two additional rounds. The reasons for congressional resistance are two-fold. First, there isconcern over a likely backlash from constituents living in or near military installations. Second,many Members of Congress remain wary about a repetition of the perceived political intrusion bythe Clinton Administration that occurred in regard to the 1995 recommendations to close Kelly andMcClellan air force bases. The four base closure and realignment (BRAC) commissions recommended, individually, a total of 534 actions to close, realign, or otherwise affect specific bases, facilities, and activities. InDecember 1998, the General Accounting Office reported that the four BRAC commissions generated499 recommendations, but that in its final tally \"only 451 of these ultimately required action,primarily because 48 were changed in some manner by recommendations of a later commission.\" The closing of all 451 BRAC installations (major, minor and \"other\") from the four rounds is expected to be completed by the end of FY2001, as originally scheduled. The disposing of all theclosed property, however is expected to take many more years. The Pentagon's current estimate ofthe percentage reduction in base structure as a result of the first four rounds is 21%. This figure isused as support for additional infrastructure reductions, since other key indicators, such as thedefense budget and the force structure (personnel and units) have declined 40% and 36%,respectively. In terms of costs and savings associated with the first four rounds of closures and realignments, a DOD report (April 1998) estimated a net total savings of about $14 billion through FY2001. Itprojected that net annual savings, thereafter, would be in the vicinity of $5.6 to $5.7 billion. As forthe two new rounds currently being sought, the Pentagon has estimated an annual savings of about$3 billion after they are implemented."
