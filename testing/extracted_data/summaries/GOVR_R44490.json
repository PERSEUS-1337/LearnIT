    "content": "An essential element of the federal government's acquisition system is the capability to identify the businesses, and other types of entities, that do work for the government. Accurate identification of potential contractors and incumbent contractors facilitates a host of procurement processes while contributing to the transparency of federal government procurement. The federal government uses a proprietary system, Dun & Bradstreet's (D&B's) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS), to uniquely identify the entities with which it does business. At no cost to the applicant, D&B assigns a DUNS number\u2014a nine-digit unique identification code\u2014to prospective government contractors. (Businesses that are not would-be government contractors also may apply for a DUNS number.) The federal government's use of DUNS, however, is not limited to the identification numbers. D&B provides, pursuant to its contract with the General Services Administration (GSA), 7 types of software products and 14 data products that enable the government to use DUNS for a variety of acquisition-related functions, such as paying contractors. Furthermore, approximately 80 data systems within the federal government contain DUNS information. Congress may have concerns regarding the continued use of DUNS numbers and has expressed interest in exploring other options. At the request of a Senate subcommittee, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined the costs and data restrictions involved with using a proprietary identification system and studied alternatives for identification numbers for government contractors. The implementation of the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act; P.L. 113-101) is accompanied by similar, significant interest within Congress\u2014and within the agencies charged with implementing the act\u2014for exploring options for a nonproprietary contractor identification system. One or more possible options might involve using an existing, nonproprietary identification system created and maintained by the federal government: the commercial and government entity (CAGE) code system. CAGE codes could be used as a stand-alone system, or incorporated into a hybrid system (e.g., combine CAGE codes with vendor-provided business products and services). The CAGE Branch of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) assigns the five-character alpha-numeric identifiers to entities located in the United States and outlying areas. Regulatory changes in 2014 and 2016 potentially pave the way for the government to adopt a new system. First, in 2014, a rule was adopted in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requiring prospective contractors to obtain CAGE codes. This rule also requires the contractor to provide to the government, if applicable, the name and CAGE codes of its immediate owner and its highest-level owner. Second, a final rule issued in 2016 removed all references to the Data Universal Numbering System and DUNS numbers from the FAR and inserted the terms unique entity identifier. The preface to the proposed rule noted that the government is not ready to eliminate DUNS numbers at this time, but that removing references to a proprietary system and identifier \"will provide opportunities for future competition that can reduce costs to taxpayers.\" In early 2017, GSA initiated a process for exploring alternatives to DUNS by posting a request for information (RFI) for entity identification and validation services on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. GSA's tentative schedule is to issue a solicitation in summer 2017 and award a contract prior to the expiration of its contract with Dun & Bradstreet, which will occur in June 2018."
