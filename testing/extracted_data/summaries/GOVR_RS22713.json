    "content": "China is the largest source for U.S. imports, accounting for a 16% of total U.S. imports in 2008. China is a dominant supplier of many imported consumer products. For example, 90% of U.S. toy imports come from China. Numerous reports of unsafe products from China over the past few years, including seafood, pet food, toys, tires, drywall, and medicines have raised concern in the United States over the health, safety, and quality of imported Chinese products. The United States and China have sought to boost cooperation on health and safety issues. For example, China agreed to boost efforts to ensure that its toy exports to the United States did not violate U.S. regulations on lead content. This report provides an overview of U.S. concerns over the health and safety of Chinese products, identifies challenges China faces to develop an effective health and safety enforcement regime, summarizes U.S.-China cooperative efforts, and analyzes how this issue could impact China's economy and U.S.-China trade relations. This report will be updated as events warrant."
