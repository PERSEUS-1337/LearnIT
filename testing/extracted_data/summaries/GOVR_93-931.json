    "content": "The overthrow of Haiti's first democratically elected president in September 1991 propelledHaiti into its worst crisis since popular protests brought down the 29-year dictatorship of theDuvalier family in 1986. Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected President of Haiti in a landslidevictory on December 16, 1990, in what was widely heralded as the first free and fair election in thecountry's 186-year history. A Catholic priest of the radical left, he was inaugurated on February 7,1991, and overthrown by the military on September 30. Politics in Haiti have been generally violent and authoritarian, ever since Haiti became anindependent republic in 1804. The legacy of despotic rulers has been difficult to overcome. The United States intervened in Haiti in 1915 to stop civil strife and prevent Germany fromestablishing a foothold. The U.S. Marines occupied Haiti until 1934, overseeing public works, taxcollection, treasury management, and the development of a native Haitian Constabulary which wasHaiti's first professional military force. While many of these contributions were welcomed and muchneeded, many Haitians deeply resented the U.S. presence as an affront to Haitian sovereignty. From 1957 through 1986, Francois Duvalier and his son Jean-Claude rule Haiti for nearly30 years, leaving behind a legacy of repression and corruption. After Duvalier's ouster in 1986, aseries of short-lived governments, most military-dominated, ruled through 1990. This report provides background information on the violent and authoritarian traditions thathave characterized Haiti's political dynamics since Haiti attained independence in 1804. It examinesHaiti's difficult path toward democracy after the fall of the Duvalier regime, from numerousshort-lived governments until the election of Aristide in December 1990. Finally, the report alsobriefly surveys Aristide's rule from February 1991 until his subsequent overthrow by the Haitianmilitary 8 months later, in September 1991."
