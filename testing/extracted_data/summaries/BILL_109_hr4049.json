    "content": "Early Pest Detection and Surveillance Improvement Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into a cooperative agreement with any state department of agriculture for assisting early pest detection and surveillance efforts by such department through an array of methods, including survey, pest trapping, sampling or surveillance of domestic shipments, specimen collection, and modeling and mapping of pest populations. Requires the Secretary, in determining whether to enter into such an agreement, to consider specified factors, including: (1) the potential economic risk to the state's people, plants, livestock, property, economy, and environment due to the introduction of a pest. And (2) the likelihood that the early pest detection and surveillance activity will prevent the introduction or facilitate the eradication of a pest."
