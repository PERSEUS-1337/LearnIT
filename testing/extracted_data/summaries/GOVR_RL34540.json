On March 11, 2009, President Obama signed into law the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-8). In the Omnibus, Congress appropriated $60.538 billion for CJS agencies. This amount was $4.578 billion more than the FY2008 enacted level (an 8.2% increase) and $3.488 billion more than the amended FY2009 request (a 6.1% increase). The Omnibus included $9.268 billion for the Department of Commerce, $26.120 billion for the Department of Justice, $24.278 billion for science agencies, and $872 million for related agencies. On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5). In the ARRA, Congress appropriated $15.922 billion for CJS agencies. Among other amounts, the act provided $1.000 billion for the Census Bureau, $5.350 billion for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, $580 million for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, $830 million for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency, $4.002 billion for state and local law enforcement assistance, $1.002 billion for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and $3.004 billion for the National Science Foundation (NSF). On September 30, 2008, then-President Bush signed a continuing resolution (CR) (P.L. 110-329) that funded most CJS agencies at their FY2008 levels through March 6, 2009. Under this act, several CJS agencies were funded at rates above their FY2008 levels. For example, the Census Bureau was funded at a rate that would have equaled a full-year FY2009 appropriation of $3.109 billion\u2014more than double the amount provided for FY2008. This act also included FY2008 supplemental funding for several CJS accounts. On March 6, 2009, President Obama extended this CR through March 11, 2009, signing another resolution into law (P.L. 111-6; H.J.Res. 38). On June 20, 2008, then-President Bush signed into law the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-252; H.R. 2642). In this act, Congress appropriated $210.0 million for the Census Bureau, $449.0 million for Justice, and $62.5 million for NASA, and $62.5 million for the NSF. While the House and Senate Appropriations Committee reported FY2009 CJS appropriations bills (H.R. 7322 and S. 3182), the 110th Congress did not considered these bills further. Nevertheless, the House bill would have provided $59.657 billion for CJS departments and agencies, the Senate bill, $60.724 billion. For FY2009, the Administration initially requested $56.563 billion for CJS agencies, but later amended its request several times, increasing it to $57.050 billion. For Commerce, the FY2009 request initially included $8.217 billion, but the amended request included almost $546.0 million more for the 2010 Census that was to be offset by reducing, canceling, or shifting other amounts for Commerce and certain other entities. The amended FY2009 request included $8.664 billion for Commerce, $23.128 billion for Justice, $24.474 billion for science, and $784 million for related agencies. The amended FY2009 request was nearly was 1.9% less than the amount ($55.960 billion) appropriated by Congress for CJS departments and agencies for FY2008. This report will not be updated."
