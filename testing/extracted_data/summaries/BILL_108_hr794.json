Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to establish a mining plan period of more than 40 years upon a determination that the longer period: (1) will ensure the maximum economic recovery of a coal deposit. Or (2) the longer period is in the interest of the orderly, efficient, or economic development of a coal resource. Revises the statutory formula for the payment of advance royalties.
