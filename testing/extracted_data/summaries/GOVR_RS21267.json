    "content": "The Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) account of the National Science Foundation (NSF) supports the acquisition and construction of major research facilities and equipment that are to extend the boundaries of science, engineering, and technology. The facilities include telescopes, earth simulators, astronomical observatories, and mobile research platforms. Currently, the NSF provides approximately $1.0 billion annually in support of facilities and other infrastructure projects. While the NSF does not directly design or operate research facilities, it does have final responsibility for oversight and management. Questions have been raised by many in the scientific community and in Congress concerning the adequacy of the planning and management of NSF facilities. In addition, there has been debate related to the criteria used to select projects for MREFC support. The Administration's FY2013 budget request for the NSF is $7,373.1 million, a 4.8% increase ($340.0 million) over the FY2012 estimated level of $7,033.1 million. Included in the request total is $196.2 million for MREFC, slightly below the FY2012 estimate of $197.1 million. The FY2013 request proposes support for four projects\u2014Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory ($14.9 million), Advanced Technology Solar Telescope ($42.0 million), Ocean Observatories Initiative ($27.5 million), and the National Ecological Observatory Network ($98.2 million)."
