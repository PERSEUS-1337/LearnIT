Prohibits an officer or employee of the United States from: (1) providing assistance to the government of a foreign country for the purpose of obtaining information from an individual held in custody by that government if there is reason to believe that torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment will be utilized to obtain the information.
