    "content": "In November 2002, SARS, a new and deadly human illness suspected of having an animal origin, made its first appearance in China. Chinese leaders at first minimized the effects of the newvirus and covered up the extent of its spread. But the disease moved rapidly to other countries,prompting the World Health Organization in 2003 to label the virus a \"global health threat.\" Underintense public scrutiny, Chinese leaders in April 2003 eventually acknowledged that people weresickening and dying, apologized for their leadership failures in addressing the problem, and launcheda series of initiatives to try to contain the disease, limit its economic damage, and protect publichealth. By July 2003, the initial SARS outbreak had ended. But global disease specialists expressedconcern that the virus could recur, like influenza, or that other similarly mutating viruses could leapfrom the animal to the human world. On January 5, 2004, China confirmed the first new case ofSARS in Guangdong Province, where the 2003 outbreak had occurred. On January 27, 2004, PRCofficials acknowledged that several flocks of birds in China were infected with the same deadlystrain of avian flu that in recent weeks had ravaged bird populations and killed humans in otherAsian countries. The emergence of SARS and other new viruses has posed a steep learning curve for a new generation of Chinese officials who had assumed office in November 2002, only weeks before theoriginal SARS outbreak. In suppressing information early in the crisis, the government lostcredibility and public confidence. More reliable information was available from foreign mediasources, the Internet, and cell-phone text messages -- as many as 40 million a day during the 2003SARS crisis, according to one report. In the 2003 crisis, Chinese leaders were forced to adjust theirstrategy by publicly embracing two radical concepts: the public has a right to know aboutinformation directly concerning their daily lives, and government officials need to be accountableto the public for their performance. Officials began issuing regular briefings in 2003 about SARScases, and several top officials were fired for covering up the crisis. Since then, the government hasrevamped emergency procedures, issued rules requiring greater government transparency, andworked to reduce the deficiencies and prohibitive costs of public health care. Some observerssuggested that \"lessons learned\" from the 2003 SARS outbreak could permanently influence PRCgovernance. Some change can be seen in the more open and aggressive way officials have handled SARS cases in 2004. Officials have publicly announced both confirmed and suspected cases, ordered theextermination of many civet cats -- a culinary delicacy in China but a suspected source of animal-to-human transferof the disease -- and begun human trials of a new SARS vaccine developed inChina. Still, PRC officials in early January 2004 detained and questioned journalists from a Chinesenewspaper that first reported on the new SARS cases, suggesting that the government still seeks tocontrol information flow. And global health officials have criticized official secretiveness inaddressing the new avian flu outbreak."
