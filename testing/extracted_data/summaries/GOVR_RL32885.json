Jurisdictions for the subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees changed at the beginning of the 109th Congress. In the 108th Congress, both the House and Senate subcommittees had identical jurisdiction and produced the Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies appropriations bills. In the 109th Congress, jurisdiction for the Judiciary appropriation was removed to the Treasury, Transportation, HUD Subcommittees in the House and the Senate. Science appropriations, namely the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) were transferred to the former CJS subcommittees in both chambers. In the Senate, Appropriations for the Department of State was transferred to the Foreign Operations subcommittee, however, it remains under the jurisdiction of SSJC in the House.
