    "title": "An act to amend Section\n51210\n56000.5\nof the Education Code, relating to\npupil instruction.\nspecial education.",
    "content": "Existing law makes certain findings and declarations relating to the education of hard-of-hearing and deaf pupils. This bill would revise those findings and declarations to include nonverbal pupils. Existing law requires the adopted course of study for grades 1 to 6, inclusive, to include certain areas of study, including, among others, English, mathematics, social sciences, science, and physical education, as specified. Existing law requires that physical education have a total period of time of not less than 200 minutes each 10 schooldays, as provided. This bill would authorize a complaint that a school district or county superintendent of schools has not complied with the physical education requirements of the adopted course of study for grades 1 to 6, inclusive, to be filed with the school district or county superintendent of schools pursuant to the local complaint procedures, if any, or the Uniform Complaint Procedures, as specified. The bill would authorize a complainant not satisfied with the school district\u2019s or county superintendent of schools decision to file an appeal with the Superintendent of Public Instruction. If a school district or county superintendent of schools finds merit in the complaint, or the Superintendent finds merit in the appeal, the bill would require the school district or county superintendent of schools to provide a remedy, as provided. To the extent this bill would impose additional duties on school districts or county education officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would prohibit specified civil actions against a school district or county superintendent of schools relating to noncompliance with the physical education requirements unless the complainant first follows local complaint procedures, if any, or the Uniform Complaint Procedures, if no local complaint procedures exist. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
