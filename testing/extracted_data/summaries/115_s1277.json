    "content": "Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses Act of 2017 or the VET TEC Act of 2017 This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to carry out a five-year pilot program to provide eligible veterans with the opportunity to enroll in high technology programs of education, which are programs that are offered by entities other than institutions of higher learning, do not lead to a degree, and provide instruction in computer programming, computer software, media application, data processing, or information sciences. The VA shall enter into contracts with multiple qualified providers of such programs, under which the VA shall pay: (1) 25 of the cost of providing the program upon the enrollment of an eligible veteran, (2) 25 of such cost when the veteran completes the program, and (3) 50 of such cost upon the veteran's employment following completion in a field related to the course of study. A provider of a high technology program of education is qualified if the provider: (1) has offered, for at least two years, the credential it plans to provide under the pilot. (2) verifies that each such credential has demonstrated market value based on the employment and earnings of participants. And (3) has the ability to evaluate job placement rates and earnings through means other than survey or self-reported data. The VA shall give preference to a qualified provider that offers tuition reimbursement for any student who completes the program and does not find full-time meaningful employment within 180 days. The bill limits tuition and provides for removal of providers that increase tuition by more than 10 from the previous year. The VA shall pay a monthly housing stipend to each eligible veteran enrolled full-time in such a program."
