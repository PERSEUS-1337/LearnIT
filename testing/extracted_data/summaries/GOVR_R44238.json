    "content": "On December 3, 2015, the Senate passed an amendment to H.R. 3762. For information about the Senate amendment to H.R. 3762 and how it compares to the House-passed version of H.R. 3762, see CRS Report R44300, Provisions of the Senate Amendment to H.R. 3762, coordinated by [author name scrubbed]. This report will not be updated to reflect the Senate's actions or subsequent actions taken by the House. The FY2016 budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 11) established the congressional budget for the federal government for FY2016 and set forth budgetary levels for FY2017-FY2025. It also included reconciliation instructions for House and Senate committees to submit changes in laws to reduce the federal deficit to their respective budget committees. On October 23, 2015, the House passed H.R. 3762, a reconciliation bill containing provisions submitted by three committees\u2014Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, and Education and the Workforce\u2014pursuant to the reconciliation instructions included in the FY2016 budget resolution. The House reconciliation bill\u2014H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015\u2014would repeal several provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148, as amended). These provisions are as follows: the individual mandate; the employer mandate; the excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored coverage (the Cadillac tax); the medical device tax; the auto-enrollment requirement for large employers; and the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF). Additionally, H.R. 3762 could restrict federal funding for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) and its affiliates and clinics for a period of one year. The bill also would appropriate an additional $235 million for each of FY2016 and FY2017 to the federal health centers program. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate that the House reconciliation bill would reduce federal deficits by $78.1 billion over the 2016-2025 period. This report provides background on the reconciliation process and summarizes the provisions in H.R. 3762, including their projected budgetary impact. It then briefly examines some of the bill's policy implications. The report will be updated as necessary to reflect key legislative developments."
