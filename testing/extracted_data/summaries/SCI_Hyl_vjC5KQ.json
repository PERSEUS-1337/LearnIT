Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has attracted research interest as an approach for leveraging the hierarchical structure of a given task in reinforcement learning (RL). However, identifying the hierarchical policy structure that enhances the performance of RL is not a trivial task. In this paper, we propose an HRL method that learns a latent variable of a hierarchical policy using mutual information maximization. Our approach can be interpreted as a way to learn a discrete and latent representation of the state-action space. To learn option policies that correspond to modes of the advantage function, we introduce advantage-weighted importance sampling.  \n In our HRL method, the gating policy learns to select option policies based on an option-value function, and these option policies are optimized based on the deterministic policy gradient method. This framework is derived by leveraging the analogy between a monolithic policy in standard RL and a hierarchical policy in HRL by using a deterministic option policy.   Experimental results indicate that our HRL approach can learn a diversity of options and that it can enhance the performance of RL in continuous control tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to a variety of tasks, including board games BID13 , robotic manipulation tasks (Levine et al., 2016) , and video games (Mnih et al., 2015) . Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is a type of RL that leverages the hierarchical structure of a given task by learning a hierarchical policy BID15 Dietterich, 2000) . Past studies in this field have shown that HRL can solve challenging tasks in the video game domain BID18 BID0 and robotic manipulation BID3 BID9 . In HRL, lower-level policies, which are often referred to as option policies, learn different behavior/control patterns, and the upper-level policy, which is often referred to as the gating policy, learns to select option policies. Recent studies have developed HRL methods using deep learning (Goodfellow et al., 2016) and have shown that HRL can yield impressive performance for complex tasks BID0 Frans et al., 2018; BID18 Haarnoja et al., 2018a) . However, identifying the hierarchical policy structure that yields efficient learning is not a trivial task, since the problem involves learning a sufficient variety of types of behavior to solve a given task.In this study, we present an HRL method via the mutual information (MI) maximization with advantage-weighted importance, which we refer to as adInfoHRL. We formulate the problem of learning a latent variable in a hierarchical policy as one of learning discrete and interpretable repre-sentations of states and actions. Ideally, each option policy should be located at separate modes of the advantage function. To estimate the latent variable that corresponds to modes of the advantage function, we introduce advantage-weighted importance weights. Our approach can be considered to divide the state-action space based on an information maximization criterion, and it learns option policies corresponding to each region of the state-action space. We derive adInfoHRL as an HRL method based on deterministic option policies that are trained based on an extension of the deterministic policy gradient BID12 Fujimoto et al., 2018) . The contributions of this paper are twofold:1. We propose the learning of a latent variable of a hierarchical policy as a discrete and hidden representation of the state-action space. To learn option policies that correspond to the modes of the advantage function, we introduce advantage-weighted importance. 2. We propose an HRL method, where the option policies are optimized based on the deterministic policy gradient and the gating policy selects the option that maximizes the expected return. The experimental results show that our proposed method adInfoHRL can learn a diversity of options on continuous control tasks. Moreover, our approach can improve the performance of TD3 on such tasks as the Walker2d and Ant tasks in OpenAI Gym with MuJoco simulator. We proposed a novel HRL method, hierarchical reinforcement learning via advantage-weighted information maximization. In our framework, the latent variable of a hierarchical policy is learned as a discrete latent representation of the state-action space. Our HRL framework is derived by considering deterministic option policies and by leveraging the analogy between the gating policy for HRL and a monolithic policy for the standard RL. The results of the experiments indicate that adInfoHRL can learn diverse options on continuous control tasks. Our results also suggested that our approach can improve the performance of TD3 in certain problem domains."
