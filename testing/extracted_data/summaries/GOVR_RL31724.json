    "content": "The Supreme Court in 2004 issued three decisions related to the detention of \"enemycombatants,\" including two that deal with U.S. citizens in military custody on American soil. In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld , a plurality held that a U.S. citizen allegedly captured during combat inAfghanistan and incarcerated at a Navy brig in South Carolina is entitled to notice and anopportunity to be heard by a neutral decision-maker regarding the government's reasons for detaininghim. The Court in Rumsfeld v. Padilla overturned a lower court's grant of habeas corpus to anotherU.S. citizen in military custody in South Carolina on jurisdictional grounds. The decisions affirmthe President's powers to detain \"enemy combatants,\"including those who are U.S. citizens, as partof the necessary force authorized by Congress after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. However the Court appears to have limited the scope of individuals who may be treated as enemycombatants pursuant to that authority, and clarified that such detainees have some due process rightsunder the U.S. Constitution. This report, which will be updated as necessary, analyzes the authorityto detain American citizens who are suspected of being members, agents, or associates of Al Qaeda,the Taliban and possibly other terrorist organizations as \"enemy combatants.\" The Department of Justice argues that the recent decisions, coupled with two World War IIera cases, Ex parte Quirin and In re Territo , support its contention that the President may order thatcertain U.S. citizens as well as non-citizens be held as enemy combatants pursuant to the law of warand Article II of the Constitution. Critics, however, question whether the decisions permit thedetention of U.S. citizens captured away from any actual battlefield, in order to prevent terrorist actsor gather intelligence; and some argue that Congress has prohibited such detention of U.S. citizenswhen it enacted 18 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 4001(a). This report provides background information regarding the cases of two U.S. citizens deemed \"enemy combatants,\" Yaser Esam Hamdi, who has been returned to Saudi Arabia, and JosePadilla, who remains in military custody while the government appeals a district court order tocharge him with a crime or release him. A brief introduction to the law of war pertinent to thedetention of different categories of individuals is offered, followed by brief analyses of the mainlegal precedents invoked to support the President's actions, as well as Ex parte Milligan , which someargue supports the opposite conclusion. A discussion of U.S. practice during wartime to detainpersons deemed dangerous to the national security follows, including legislative history that mayhelp to shed light on Congress' intent in authorizing the use of force to fight terrorism. Finally, thereport briefly analyzes the proposed Detention of Enemy Combatants Act, H.R. 1076 ,which would authorize the President to detain U.S. citizens and residents who are determined to be\"enemy combatants\" in certain circumstances. The report concludes that historically, even duringdeclared wars, additional statutory authority has been seen as necessary to validate the detention ofcitizens not members of any armed forces, casting in some doubt the argument that the power todetain persons arrested in a context other than actual hostilities is necessarily implied by anauthorization to use force."
