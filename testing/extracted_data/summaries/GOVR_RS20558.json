    "content": "Although Congress described its 1997 changes to discipline provisions in theIndividuals with Disabilities EducationAct (IDEA) as a \"careful balance,\" it was not long before amendments to change the provisions surfaced. In 1999the Senate passed S. 254, 106thCong., the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999, and the House passedH.R. 1501, 106th Cong., the ChildSafety and Protection Act, both of which contained amendments to IDEA. These amendments would have changedsection 615 of IDEA to eliminate IDEA'sdifferent disciplinary procedures for children with disabilities in certain situations. In the Senate the amendmentapplied to children with disabilities who carry agun or firearm while in the House the amendment would cover a weapon. These amendments were not enacted. Two amendments relating to children with disabilities were offered and accepted during House Education andWorkforce Committee markup of H.R. 4141, 106th Cong., the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Amendments. One amendment, offered byRepresentative Norwood, concerned the discipline ofa child with a disability who carries or possesses a weapon. The other amendment, offered by RepresentativesTalent, McIntosh and Tancredo, concerned thediscipline of a child with a disability who knowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs at school or commits anaggravated assault or battery at school. Theseamendments were not enacted. This report will be updated as appropriate.
