    "content": "The demand for abstractive dialog summary is growing in real-world applications. For example, customer service center or hospitals would like to summarize customer service interaction and doctor-patient interaction. However, few researchers explored abstractive summarization on dialogs due to the lack of  suitable datasets. We propose an abstractive dialog summarization dataset based on MultiWOZ. If we directly apply previous state-of-the-art document summarization methods on dialogs, there are two significant drawbacks: the informative entities such as restaurant names are difficult to preserve, and the contents from different dialog domains are sometimes mismatched. To address these two drawbacks, we propose Scaffold Pointer Network (SPNet) to utilize the existing annotation on speaker role, semantic slot and dialog domain. SPNet incorporates these semantic scaffolds for dialog summarization. Since ROUGE cannot capture the two drawbacks mentioned, we also propose a new evaluation metric that considers critical informative entities in the text. On MultiWOZ, our proposed SPNet outperforms state-of-the-art abstractive summarization methods on all the automatic and human evaluation metrics. Summarization aims to condense a piece of text to a shorter version, retaining the critical information. On dialogs, summarization has various promising applications in the real world. For instance, the automatic doctor-patient interaction summary can save doctors' massive amount of time used for filling medical records. There is also a general demand for summarizing meetings in order to track project progress in the industry. Generally, multi-party conversations with interactive communication are more difficult to summarize than single-speaker documents. Hence, dialog summarization will be a potential field in summarization track. There are two types of summarization: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization selects sentences or phrases directly from the source text and merges them to a summary, while abstractive summarization attempts to generate novel expressions to condense information. Previous dialog summarization research mostly study extractive summarization (Murray et al., 2005; Maskey & Hirschberg, 2005) . Extractive methods merge selected important utterances from a dialog to form summary. Because dialogs are highly dependant on their histories, it is difficult to produce coherent discourses with a set of non-consecutive conversation turns. Therefore, extractive summarization is not the best approach to summarize dialogs. However, most modern abstractive methods focus on single-speaker documents rather than dialogs due to the lack of dialog summarization corpora. Popular abstractive summarization dataset like CNN/Daily Mail (Hermann et al., 2015) is on news documents. AMI meeting corpus (McCowan et al., 2005) is the common benchmark, but it only has extractive summary. In this work, we introduce a dataset for abstractive dialog summarization based on MultiWOZ (Budzianowski et al., 2018) . Seq2Seq models such as Pointer-Generator (See et al., 2017) have achieved high-quality summaries of news document. However, directly applying a news summarizer to dialog results in two drawbacks: informative entities such as place name are difficult to capture precisely and contents in different domains are summarized unequally. To address these problems, we propose Scaffold Pointer Network (SPNet). SPNet incorporates three types of semantic scaffolds in dialog: speaker role, semantic slot, and dialog domain. Firstly, SPNet adapts separate encoder to attentional Seq2Seq framework, producing distinct semantic representations for different speaker roles. Then, our method inputs delexicalized utterances for producing delexicalized summary, and fills in slot values to generate complete summary. Finally, we incorporate dialog domain scaffold by jointly optimizing dialog domain classification task along with the summarization task. We evaluate SPNet with both automatic and human evaluation metrics on MultiWOZ. SPNet outperforms Pointer-Generator (See et al., 2017) and Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) on all the metrics. 2 RELATED WORK Rush et al. (2015) first applied modern neural models to abstractive summarization. Their approach is based on Seq2Seq framework (Sutskever et al., 2014) and attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015) , achieving state-of-the-art results on Gigaword and DUC-2004 dataset. Gu et al. (2016) proposed copy mechanism in summarization, demonstrating its effectiveness by combining the advantages of extractive and abstractive approach. See et al. (2017) applied pointing (Vinyals et al., 2015) as copy mechanism and use coverage mechanism (Tu et al., 2016) to discourage repetition. Most recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been employed in abstractive summarization. RL-based approaches directly optimize the objectives of summarization (Ranzato et al., 2016; Celikyilmaz et al., 2018) . However, deep reinforcement learning approaches are difficult to train and more prone to exposure bias (Bahdanau et al., 2017) . Recently, pre-training methods are popular in NLP applications. BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and GPT (Radford et al., 2018) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many tasks, including summarization. For instance, proposed a method to pre-train hierarchical document encoder for extractive summarization. Hoang et al. (2019) proposed two strategies to incorporate a pre-trained model (GPT) to perform the abstractive summarizer and achieved a better performance. However, there has not been much research on adapting pre-trained models to dialog summarization. Dialog summarization, specifically meeting summarization, has been studied extensively. Previous work generally focused on statistical machine learning methods in extractive dialog summarization: Galley (2006) used skip-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001 ) as a ranking method in extractive meeting summarization. Wang & Cardie (2013) compared support vector machines (SVMs) (Cortes & Vapnik, 1995) with LDA-based topic models (Blei et al., 2003) for producing decision summaries. However, abstractive dialog summarization was less explored due to the lack of a suitable benchmark. Recent work (Wang & Cardie, 2016; Goo & Chen, 2018; Pan et al., 2018) created abstractive dialog summary benchmarks with existing dialog corpus. Goo & Chen (2018) annotated topic descriptions in AMI meeting corpus as the summary. However, topics they defined are coarse, such as \"industrial designer presentation\". They also proposed a model with a sentence-gated mechanism incorporating dialog acts to perform abstractive summarization. Moreover, Li et al. (2019) first built a model to summarize audio-visual meeting data with an abstractive method. However, previous work has not investigated the utilization of semantic patterns in dialog, so we explore it in-depth in our work. We adapt a dialog generation dataset, MultiWOZ to an abstractive dialog summarization dataset. We propose SPNet, an end-to-end model that incorporates the speaker role, semantic slot and dialog domain as the semantic scaffolds to improve abstractive summary quality. We also propose an automatic evaluation metric CIC that considers semantic slot relevance to serve as a complementary metric to ROUGE. SPNet outperforms baseline methods in both automatic and human evaluation metrics. It suggests that involving semantic scaffolds efficiently improves abstractive summarization quality in the dialog scene. Moreover, we can easily extend SPNet to other summarization tasks. We plan to apply semantic slot scaffold to news summarization. Specifically, we can annotate the critical entities such as person names or location names to ensure that they are captured correctly in the generated summary. We also plan to collect a human-human dialog dataset with more diverse human-written summaries. A SUPPLEMENT TO CASE STUDY Supplement Summary Transformer: You are planning your trip in Cambridge. You are looking for a place to stay. The hotel doesn't need to include internet and should include free parking. The hotel should be in the type of guesthouse. If there is no such hotel, how about one that is in the moderate price range? Once you find the hotel, you want to book it for 6 people and 4 nights starting from Sunday. Make sure you get the reference number. You are also looking forward to dine. The restaurant should be in the centre. Make sure you get the reference number."
