    "title": "SB 1159",
    "content": "Existing law establishes health care coverage programs to provide health care to segments of the population meeting specified criteria who are otherwise unable to afford health care coverage and provides for the licensure and regulation of health insurers and health care service plans. This bill would require the California Health and Human Services Agency to research the options for developing a cost, quality, and equity data atlas. The bill would require the research to include certain topics, including, among others, identification of key data submitters and a comparative analysis of potential models used in other states. The bill would authorize the agency to enter into contracts or agreements to conduct the research and would require the agency to make the results of the research available to the public no later than March 1, 2017, by submitting a report to the Assembly and Senate Committees on Health."
