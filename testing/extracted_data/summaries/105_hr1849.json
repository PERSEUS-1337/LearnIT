And (2) the Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust, as a wholly owned Government corporation, to administer the operation, maintenance, management, and interpretation of the Memorial. Requires the Trust to develop a cooperative agreement for management of lands, operations, and facilities within the Memorial. Requires the Secretary of the Interior and the Trust to enter into a cooperative agreement under which the Secretary shall provide technical assistance for the planning, preservation, maintenance, management, and interpretation of the Memorial and such maintenance, interpretation, curatorial management, and general management as mutually agreed upon by the respective parties. Authorizes appropriations. Requires amounts appropriated in any fiscal year to carry out this Act to be expended only on a matching basis in a ratio of at least one non-Federal dollar to every Federal dollar. Requires, before the construction of the Memorial, the Administrator of the General Services Administration to exchange, sell, lease, donate, or otherwise dispose of the site of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, or a portion thereof, to the Trust. Exempts such disposal from: (1) the Public Buildings Act of 1959, (2) the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. And (3) any other Federal law establishing requirements or procedures for Federal property disposal. Directs the General Accounting Office, six years after the first meeting of the Trust's Board of Directors, to study and report to specified congressional committees on the Trust's activities."
