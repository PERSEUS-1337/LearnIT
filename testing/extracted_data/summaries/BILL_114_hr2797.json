    "content": "Student Disciplinary Fairness Act of 2015 This bill amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to establish an Office of School and Discipline Policy within the Department of Justice (DOJ). The Office must collect and publish data on the arrests or incarceration of juvenile students for violations of school rules or policies. It must also collaborate with states and local governments to expand alternatives to juvenile detention and incarceration. The legislation amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Streets Act of 1968 to require state or local governments that apply for public safety and community policing grants to provide assurances that the administration of juvenile justice in their jurisdictions is consistent with constitutional guarantees, including due process and equal protection, and that probation terms for a juvenile meet certain conditions. This bill amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to authorize DOJ to issue subpoenas during investigations of law enforcement agencies for alleged patterns or practices of conduct that violate constitutional rights. The Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Education must make grants to states, local governments, and juvenile justice agencies to train elementary and secondary school teachers and administrators on de-escalation techniques to mitigate delinquent student behavior."
