    "content": "On June 14, 2004 the Supreme Court resolved a conflict among the federal circuitsconcerning the defenses, if any, that may be available toan employer against an employee's claim that she was forced to resign because of \"intolerable\" sexual harassmentat the hands of a supervisor. An employer may generally assert anaffirmative defense to supervisory harassment under the Court's 1998 rulings in Farager v. City of BocaRaton and Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth. The defense is not available,however, if the harassment includes a \"tangible employment action,\" such as discharge or demotion. InPennsylvania State Police v. Suders, the plaintiff claimed the tangible adverseaction was supervisory harassment so severe that it drove the employee to quit, a constructive discharge in effect. The Court, in an opinion by Justice Ginsburg, with only JusticeThomas dissenting, accepted the theory of a constructive discharge as a tangible employment action, but it also setconditions under which the employer could assert an affirmativedefense and avoid strict liability. The issue is of key importance for determining the scope of employers' vicariousliability in \"supervisory\" sexual harassment cases alleging a hostilework environment."
