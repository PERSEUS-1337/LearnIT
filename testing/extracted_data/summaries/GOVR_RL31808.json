    "content": "For FY2004 Congress began providing, in a single bill, appropriations for the Departments of Transportation and the Treasury, the United States Postal Service, the Executive Office of thePresident, and Related Agencies, as well as General Government provisions. On January 23, 2004, President Bush signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 ( H.R. 2673 ; P.L. 108-199 ), which included the conference version of the FY2004Transportation, Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill. On September 9, 2003, theHouse passed H.R. 2989 , the FY2004 Transportation, Treasury and IndependentAgencies Appropriations bill, which provided $85.8 billion. The major financial change from theAdministration's request was to recommend an additional $4.4 billion in highway spending (anothermajor change, the deletion of the $3.4 billion for grants-in-aid to airports, was a procedural change;funding may be restored in conference). On October 23, the Senate passed its version of the bill,which provided $91.0 billion, adding $4.5 billion in highway funding to the Administration'srequest. Conferees agreed on $89.8 billion on November 25th. The conference version of the billwas added to the Consolidated Appropriations bill, which the House passed on December 8, 2003. The Senate adjourned for the year without voting on the bill; they approved the bill on January 22,2004. The Consolidated Appropriations Act contains a 0.59% across-the-board rescission; thefigures in this report do not reflect the impact of that rescission. They also do not reflect the $55million in transportation projects and $1 billion for election reform grants projects located in the\"Miscellaneous Appropriations\" Division at the end of the Act. Prior to passage of P.L. 108-199 , FY2004 funding for agencies and programs in the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies appropriations bill was provided, at FY2003levels, through January 31, 2004 by a series of continuing resolutions. Key issues in the FY2004 appropriations bill included: pay for federal civilian employees (the White House proposed a 2% raise; the bill provides a 4.1% raise for federal civilian employees, inline with the military pay raise); outsourcing of federal work (the bill restricts the Administration'splan to increase outsourcing, but the broader restrictions contained in both House and Senate billswere dropped due to veto threats); \"cash balance\" pension plans (the bill prohibits the TreasuryDepartment from finalizing rules affecting conversion of traditional pension plans to cash balancebasis); and Cuba (the conference bill omitted provisions contained in both House and Senate billsthat constrained enforcement of travel restrictions to Cuba).
