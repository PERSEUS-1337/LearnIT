    "content": "On June 5, 2000, the National Commission on Terrorism (NTC), a congressionallymandated bi-partisan body, issueda report providing a blueprint for U.S. counter- terrorism policy with both policy and legislative recommendations.The report could be significant in shaping thedirection of U.S. policy and the debate in Congress. It generally argues for a more aggressiveU.S. strategy in combating terrorism. Critics, however, argue thatNTC conclusions and recommendations ignore competing U.S. goals and interests; i.e that a proactive strategymight lead to the curbing of individual rights andliberties, damage important commercial interests, and widen disagreements between the U.S. and its allies overusing the \"stick\" as opposed to the \"carrot\"approach in dealing with states that actively support or countenance terrorism. The NTC report is likely to stimulate strong congressional interest in counterterrorism policy in the 107th Congress. Likely areas of focus are (1) a more proactivecounterterrorism policy; (2) a stronger state sanctions policy; and (3) a more cohesive/better coordinated U.S.federal counterterrorism response. January 23, 2001press reports indicate that Rep. J.C. Watts (R-Okla) has urged House Speaker Dennis Hastert to create a HouseSelect Committee on Domestic Terrorism. In the106th Congress, H.R. 4210, which passed the House, would also give added attention todomestic terrorism by establishing a President's Council onDomestic Preparedness in the White House. Moreover, in the 106th Congress, S. 3205, the(Kyl-Feinstein) Counteterrrorism Act of 2000, whichpassed the Senate, incorporated a number of recommendations of the NTC including measures to ensure (1)enhanced policy emphasis on control of biologicalpathogens and terrorist funding raising; (2) better sharing of FBI intelligence; (3) easier recruitment of CIAcounter-terrorism informants; and (4) maintainingSyria and Iran on the list of countries that sponsor terrorism. This report will not be updated."
