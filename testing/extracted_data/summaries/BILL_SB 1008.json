    "title": "SB 1008",
    "content": "The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a lead agency, as defined, to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of an environmental impact report on a project that it proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment or to adopt a negative declaration if it finds that the project will not have that effect. Existing law, until January 1, 2017, exempts from CEQA the design, site acquisition, construction, operation, or maintenance of certain structures and equipment of the Los Angeles Regional Interoperable Communications System (LA-RICS) consisting of a long-term evolution broadband mobile data system and a land mobile radio system, if certain criteria are met at the individual project site, including that the site contains either an antenna support structure, as provided, or a public facility that transmits or receives public safety radio signals. This bill would extend that exemption until January 1, 2020, and would specify that a fire station is not a public facility for purposes of determining if that exemption applies to an individual project site. The bill would provide that the exemption does not apply if the project site is located in certain areas. The bill would require the LA-RICS Joint Powers Authority to hold a public meeting before making a determination that a project is exempted, to file the notice of exemption with the Office of Planning and Research and the county clerk in the county in which the project is located, and to post certain information on its Internet Web site. Because a lead agency, which may include a local agency, would be required to determine whether a project qualifies for this exemption and to perform additional duties, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
