    "title": "A bill to establish criminal penalties for failing to inform and warn of serious dangers.",
    "content": "Amends the federal criminal code to require a business entity and any responsible corporate officer, after acquiring actual knowledge of a serious danger associated with a product, service, or business practice of such entity: (1) within 24 hours, to verbally inform an appropriate federal agency. (2) within 15 days, to inform an appropriate federal agency in writing. And (3) as soon as practicable, to warn affected employees in writing and to inform other individuals who may be exposed to the danger if such individuals can reasonably be identified. Sets forth penalties for violations of this Act, but prohibits any fine imposed on an individual from being paid out of the assets of the business entity. Prohibits knowingly discriminating against any person in hiring, retention, or the terms or conditions of employment because the person informed a federal agency, warned employees, or informed other individuals of such a danger."
