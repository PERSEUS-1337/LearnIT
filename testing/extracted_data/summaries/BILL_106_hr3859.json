    "content": "Makes it out of order in the House or the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report if the enactment of the reported bill or resolution, the adoption and enactment of an amendment, or the enactment of a bill or resolution in the form recommended in the conference report would: (1) cause or increase an on-budget deficit for any fiscal year. Or (2) cause the on-budget surplus for any fiscal year to be less than the projected surplus of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for such year or increase the amount by which the on-budget surplus for any fiscal year would be less than such trust fund surplus for that year. Makes the point of order under (1) above inapplicable to social security reform legislation and that under (2) above inapplicable to Medicare reform legislation. Includes the receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors and Disability Insurance Trust Funds within the content of the concurrent budget resolution. Authorizes a waiver or suspension in the Senate of points of order under this Act only with a three-fifths majority. Requires the same majority to sustain an appeal on a ruling on such points of order. Requires any official Federal Government statement of the Federal or congressional budget surplus or deficit totals to exclude the outlays and receipts of the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Program under the Social Security Act. Requires such outlays and receipts to be submitted in separate social security budget documents. Prohibits the Federal Government budget submitted by the President from recommending: (1) an on-budget deficit for any covered fiscal year unless it includes proposed legislative language for social security reform legislation. Or (2) an on-budget surplus for any fiscal year that is less than the projected surplus of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for that fiscal year unless it includes proposed legislative language for Medicare reform legislation. Defines social security reform legislation and Medicare reform legislation as a bill or joint resolution to save social security or Medicare, respectively, that specifies that it is reform legislation for purposes of this Act. Applies the amendments made by this Act to FY 2001 and subsequent fiscal years. Terminates the point of order relating to: (1) the on-budget deficit and budget resolution content amendments made by this Act upon enactment of social security reform legislation. And (2) the on-budget surplus and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund upon enactment of Medicare reform legislation."
