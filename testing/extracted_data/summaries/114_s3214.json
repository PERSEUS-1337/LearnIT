    "content": "Vote by Mail Act of 2017 This bill amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to require states to allow voting in federal elections to be by mail without additional conditions or requirements, except a deadline for returning the ballot. States must mail ballots to individuals registered to vote in a federal election not later than two weeks before the election. The US Postal Service must carry ballots mailed by a state expeditiously and free of postage. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is amended to authorize automatic voter registration of individuals through state motor vehicle authorities."
