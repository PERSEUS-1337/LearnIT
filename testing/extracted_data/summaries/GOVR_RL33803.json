    "content": "The main body of this report is a series of tables and an Appendix that summarize and cite bill language that was intended to end or restrict U.S. military operations in Vietnam and Indochina, Somalia, and Kosovo. The report covers enacted provisions as well as those where there were roll call votes but the provision was not ultimately enacted. The first table outlines proposals that restrict funding and the second table describes other types of restrictions. The other legislation discussed in this report either cut off funding or called on the President to take certain military actions, such as troop withdrawals. The cutoffs generally prohibited the obligation or expenditure of funds that Congress had appropriated, and they applied to military activities ranging from combat operations to initial deployments in specified countries. Some legislative language cut off funding for certain military operations but permitted exceptions, such as the withdrawal of U.S. troops, or was contingent upon meeting certain conditions, such as the release of prisoners of war. Other language prohibited continued funding unless military operations were authorized. Congress also considered non-funding approaches that urged the President to withdraw forces, negotiate or terminate military operations, seek congressional authorization for military operations, or set a date for U.S. troop withdrawals. Another approach was congressional repeal of the August 1964 Tonkin Gulf Resolution, which authorized the President to use military force in Vietnam. Language attempting to restrict later conflicts continued to use these two main categories of approaches, funding and non-funding, adding new elements and criteria to the restrictions as the conflicts themselves evolved. In the case of Indochina, a major demarcation was the signing of the Vietnam peace accords and a cease-fire agreement between the United States and North Vietnam in January 1973 that required the total withdrawal of U.S. troops by March 1973. Congress continued to provide funds for U.S. troops as levels fell from a peak of 539,000 in June 1969 to 21,500 in January 1973. In 1974, a non-funding bill was passed to cap personnel levels in Indochina at 3,000 by the end of the year. In response to the invasion of Cambodia from April to June 1970, Congress enacted the Cooper-Church amendment in January 1971, which prohibited using any appropriated funds to introduce ground troops into Cambodia. Legislation enacted in 1973\u2014after the cease-fire agreement\u2014that cut off funds for combat \"in or over or from off the shores of North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia\" was designed to prevent President Nixon from reintroducing troops or bombing if the North Vietnamese violated the cease-fire. The 1973 legislation also terminated funding for the U.S. bombing of Khmer Rouge forces in Cambodia by August 15, 1973. The U.S. bombing did end on that date."
