    "content": "On July 22, 2004, the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States,known as the 9/11 Commission, issued its final report, detailing the events up to and including theSeptember 11, 2001 terrorist attacks upon the United States. The report contained 41recommendations on ways to prevent future catastrophic assaults, including a series of proposalsdesigned to improve the presidential appointments process as it relates to the top national securityofficials at the beginning of a new administration. On October 6, the Senate passed legislation( S. 2845 ) to implement many of the changes recommended by the 9/11 Commission. The House on October 8 passed its version of the legislation ( H.R. 10 ). The Presidentsigned the final version of the bill on December 17, 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ). Two other measuresdealing with the 9/11 Commission's recommendations ( S. 2774 and H.R. 5040 ) were introduced in early September. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the Senate adopt rules requiring hearings and votesto confirm or reject national security nominees within 30 days of their submission at the start of eachnew presidential administration. Implicit in the proposal is the assumption that there is a problemwith the process for nominating and confirming presidential appointees. Analysis of Senateconsideration of the initial nominations by Presidents William J. Clinton and George W. Bush to theposts covered by the recommendation shows that the commission's proposed timetable was not metin 14 of the 49 cases, suggesting this is an issue in a minority of cases. The Constitution gives the Senate a role in the presidential appointments process, but theparameters of that role have never been clearly defined. The current process is regulated by amixture of formal rules and informal customs, as well as by political interactions between thePresident and Senators. Implementing the commission's proposal would presumably requireinstituting procedures that guarantee committee consideration of each nomination, at least at ahearing, and a final vote on each by the full Senate. Changes of this kind would involve newrestrictions on both the power of committee chairs to control the agenda of their committees and therights of Senators to delay or block nominations through holds and extended debate. These changeswould likely also alter the relationship between the legislative and executive branches, weakeningthe negotiating posture of the Senate in relation to the President, particularly if they were to beextended to additional nominations. Procedures adequate to implement the commission's recommendation would resemble anexpedited procedure, such as those used in resolutions of approval and disapproval of executiveactions. Procedural changes of this kind could be achieved by amending the Standing Rules of theSenate, changing the Standing Orders of the Senate, passing a Constitutional Amendment enactingan expedited procedures statute, or reaching a unanimous consent agreement. This report will be updated as events warrant."
