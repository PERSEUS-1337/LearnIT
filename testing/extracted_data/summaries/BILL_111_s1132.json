Expands the definition of firearm to include ammunition not expressly prohibited by federal law or subject to the provisions of the National Firearms Act. Revises the definition of qualified retired law enforcement officer to: (1) include officers separated in good standing from service with a public agency as a law enforcement officer. And (2) reduce the years-of-service requirement for such officers from 15 to 10 years. Revises: (1) requirements for firearms certification for such separated officers to allow firearms training in accordance with the standards of the officer's former agency, the state in which such officer resides, or if such state has not established training standards, standards established by a law enforcement agency within the state or those used by a certified firearms instructor, and (2) mental health requirements for such officers."
