Raises the yearly loan amounts available to all nursing students through that Program. Modifies the definition of collegiate school of nursing to include accelerated nursing degree programs. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in the case of a nurse faculty shortage, to obligate more than 10 of traineeships for individuals in doctoral degree programs. Directs the Secretary to award grants to: (1) eligible entities to establish doctoral nursing degree programs, giving priority to such entities located in states in which there are no such programs. And (2) partnerships of eligible entities to establish doctoral nursing consortia to enhance and expand the availability of doctoral nurse faculty and education by enabling the partners to share doctoral faculty and programmatic resources. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary to award grants to partnerships composed of an accredited nursing school at an institution of higher education and a hospital or health facility to establish up to five pilot projects to enable such hospital or facility to retain its staff of experienced nurses while providing a mechanism to have these individuals become, through an accelerated nursing education program, faculty members of an accredited nursing school."
