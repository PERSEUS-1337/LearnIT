    "content": "In a nationwide address on September 7, 2003, the President announced that he would request an additional $87 billion for ongoing military operations and for reconstruction assistance in Iraq,Afghanistan, and elsewhere. On September 17, the White House submitted a formal request forFY2004 supplemental appropriations of that amount to Congress. Administration officials said theywould like to see congressional action completed some time before October 24, when aninternational donors conference was scheduled to meet in Madrid to seek pledges of economicassistance for Iraq. On October 29, House and Senate appropriators announced a conference agreement, on H.R. 3289 , a bill providing supplemental appropriations for military operations and forreconstruction assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. The House approved the conference agreementby a vote of 298-121 on October 31, and the Senate approved the measure by voice vote onNovember 3. The President signed the bill into law, P.L. 108-106 , on November 6. The key issue in Congress was whether to provide reconstruction assistance to Iraq entirely as grants or partly as loans. The conference committee rejected a Senate proposal to provide about halfof the Iraq reconstruction assistance as loans. On other issues, conferees eliminated a Senateprovision adding 10,000 troops to the Army for peacekeeping duties; agreed to a modified versionof a Senate provision to provide health insurance through the DOD TRICARE program fornon-activated military reservists not eligible for employer-provided health insurance; cut theAdministration request for reconstruction assistance to Iraq by $1.655 billion as in the House billrather than by $1.855 million as in the Senate bill; agreed to provide $400 million more forAfghanistan than the Administration requested, as in the House bill; agreed to provided $245 millionfor assessed costs of U.N. peacekeeping in Liberia, as in the House bill; agreed to provide anadditional $100 million for Liberia and $10 million for Sudan for humanitarian assistance;eliminated a House provision to require that Iraq reconstruction be coordinated by aSenate-confirmed official; and did not include $1.3 billion for veterans health benefits that was inthe Senate bill (which may be provided instead in the pending VA-HUD-independent agenciesappropriations bill). The conference agreement also provides $500 million for the FederalEmergency Management Agency (FEMA) for disaster relief for Hurricane Isabel and the Californiawildfires. In earlier floor action, Congress rejected proposals to roll back tax cuts to pay for the bill; to shift funds from Iraq reconstruction to domestic programs; to make release of funds conditional onspecific requirements; and to transfer control of Iraq reconstruction from the Defense Departmentto the State Department."
