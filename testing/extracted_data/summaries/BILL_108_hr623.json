Allows schools of allied health, as well as health care institution-based programs training medical laboratory personnel, to receive such awards. Requires the Secretary to give preference, in making awards of grants and contracts to increase the number of individuals trained in allied health professions, to entities with programs training medical laboratory personnel. Directs the Secretary to develop and issue public service announcements advertising medical laboratory personnel careers and encouraging individuals to enter the medical laboratory field. Directs the Secretary to make grants for training to increase the number of cytotechnologists available for screening women for cervical cancer."
