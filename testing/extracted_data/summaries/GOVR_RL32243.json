    "content": "This report, which is updated periodically, covers recent events in Liberia and related U.S. policy. In 2003, Liberia began a post-conflict transition process to achieve enduring peace,socio-economic reconstruction and democratic governance. This process resulted from the signingof a peace accord and the resignation of then-president Charles Taylor in August 2003, after monthsof international mediation. The accord ended a civil war that burgeoned in 2000 which pitted theforces of Taylor against two armed anti-Taylor rebel groups. The war led to an extreme deteriorationin political, economic, humanitarian, and human rights conditions in Liberia. It also affectedneighboring states, from which anti-Taylor forces operated; against which the Taylor regimesponsored acts of armed aggression; and in which large numbers of Liberians sought refuge. Liberia's security situation, though periodically volatile, has improved steadily since August 2003. A disarmament and demobilization program, which encountered repeated initial difficulties,has inducted over 95,000 ex-combatants to date. This process is jointly supervised by the UnitedNations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and the National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL),which received over $522 million in aid pledges at a February 2004 donor conference. UNMILbegan operations on October 1, 2003. The NTGL, formed under the August accord and installed onOctober 14, 2003, is mandated with re-establishing government authority and preparing for electionsin late 2005. The transition faces many challenges, most related to the socio-economic effects ofwar; the dominant role within the NTGL of former armed factions, which are prone to internaldissension; and limited state capacities. UNMIL has reached full force strength, and has deployedpeacekeepers to most areas of the country, but insecurity remains a challenge in many rural areas.Implementation of the peace accord and of the NTGL's mandate have been beset by disagreementsover the allocation of positions, accusations of corruption, and leadership rivalries within the NTGL. The legal status of Taylor, who is living in exile in Nigeria and is under indictment by the SpecialCourt for Sierra Leone for war crimes related to his alleged involvement in war crimes in SierraLeone, remains unresolved. U.S. legislation urges Nigeria to hand Taylor over to the court. Considerable public and congressional debate over possible U.S. intervention in Liberia occurred in mid-2003. The United States did not intervene militarily, but it did: deploy limitedmilitary forces to Liberia to bolster U.S. security interests; assist an the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS) military force to deploy to Liberia prior to UNMIL; help mediatethe August accord; and provide International Disaster and Famine Assistance (IDFA) ($200 million)and support for UNMIL ($250 million). In addition to H.R. 4818 , the ForeignOperations FY2005 Appropriations bill, current Liberia-related bills pertain to proposals to changethe immigration status of certain Liberian nationals and to cancel certain Liberian national debts.Liberia-related bills introduced in the 108th Congress include H.Con.Res. 240 ; H.Con.Res. 233 ; H.Con.Res. 255 ; H.J.Res. 2 ; H.R. 2673 ; H.R. 1930 ; H.R. 3918 ; H.R. 3289 ; H.R. 2800 ; H.R. 4511 ; H.R. 4793 ; H.R. 4818 ; H.R. 4885 ; S. 2812 ; S. 1426 ; and S. 656 ."
