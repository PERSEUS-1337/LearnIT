    "content": "The capability of making interpretable and self-explanatory decisions is essential for developing responsible machine learning systems. In this work, we study the learning to explain the problem in the scope of inductive logic programming (ILP). We propose Neural Logic Inductive Learning (NLIL), an efficient differentiable ILP framework that learns first-order logic rules that can explain the patterns in the data. In experiments, compared with the state-of-the-art models, we find NLIL is able to search for rules that are x10 times longer while remaining x3 times faster. We also show that NLIL can scale to large image datasets, i.e. Visual Genome, with 1M entities. In this work, we propose Neural Logic Inductive Learning, a differentiable ILP framework that learns explanatory rules from data. We demonstrate that NLIL can scale to very large datasets while being able to search over complex and expressive rules. More importantly, we show that a scalable ILP method is effective in explaining decisions of supervised models, which provides an alternative perspective for inspecting the decision process of machine learning systems."
