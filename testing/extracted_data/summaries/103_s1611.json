    "content": "Atlantic Tunas Convention Authorization Act of 1993 - Amends the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975 to authorize appropriations to carry out the Act. Regulates operational matters for the advisory committee established by the Act, including regarding quorums, a chairman, meetings, and administrative and technical support. Mandates a report on governmental and nongovernmental research on Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly migratory species. Amends Federal law to remove a provision authorizing appropriations for a currently-mandated biennial report on bluefin tuna. Mandates a comprehensive research program to support the conservation and management of Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly migratory species, including identifying and defining the range of stocks. Declares the sense of the Congress regarding: (1) such conservation and management. (2) foreign compliance with recommendations and agreements adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, (3) possible certification under the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967. (4) prohibitions by other countries on the importation of such species into those countries from countries whose vessels fish without regard for the recommendations and agreements. (5) exploration of the hypotheses that stocks can be divided by lines of latitude or longitude. And (6) if stocks are divided, application of the recommendations and agreements to tuna fishing within a specified distance of the line."
