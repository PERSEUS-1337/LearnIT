    "content": "Unanimous consent agreements are fundamental to the operation of the Senate. The institution frequently dispenses with its formal rules and instead follows negotiated agreements submitted on the floor for lawmakers' unanimous approval. Once entered into, unanimous consent agreements can only be changed by unanimous consent. Their objectives are to waive Senate rules and to expedite floor action on measures or matters. Typically, these accords (sometimes called time-limitation agreements) restrict debate and structure chamber consideration of amendments. Given their importance to chamber operations, it is worthwhile to understand the background, or origin, of unanimous consent agreements. The purpose of this report is to examine how and why these informal agreements became special orders of the Senate enforceable by the presiding officer. This report will be updated as circumstances warrant. Further information on unanimous consent agreements can be found in CRS Report 98-225, Unanimous Consent Agreements in the Senate, by [author name scrubbed]; CRS Report RS20594, How Unanimous Consent Agreements Regulate Senate Floor Action, by [author name scrubbed]; and CRS Report 98-310, Senate Unanimous Consent Agreements: Potential Effects on the Amendment Process, by [author name scrubbed]."
