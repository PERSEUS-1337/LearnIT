Expresses the sense of Congress regarding full commitment of the United States to a multifaceted engagement with Ukraine. Applies to Ukraine to the same extent as to the People's Republic of China, so long as the 1992 trade agreement between the United States and Ukraine remains in force, the requirement of the Trade Act of 1974 that the President proclaim increased duties or other import restrictions with respect to any product of Ukraine being imported into the United States in such increased quantities or under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market disruption to US producers of a like or directly competitive product. Sets forth procedures with respect to: (1) notification by the President to Congress regarding US entry into a bilateral agreement with Ukraine on the terms of accession by Ukraine to the World Trade Organization, (2) a congressional oversight resolution regarding such agreement, and (3) procedures for consideration of the resolution."
