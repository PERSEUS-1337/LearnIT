    "content": "Existing law, as of July 1, 2010, exempts the sale of, and the storage, use, or other consumption of, motor vehicle fuel from specified sales and use taxes and increases the excise tax on motor vehicle fuel, as provided. Existing law requires the State Board of Equalization, for the 2011\u201312 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, on or before March 1 of the fiscal year immediately preceding the applicable fiscal year, to adjust the motor vehicle fuel tax rate in that manner as to generate an amount of revenue equal to the amount of revenue loss attributable to the sales and use tax exemption on motor vehicle fuel, based on estimates made by the board. Existing law also requires, in order to maintain revenue neutrality, the board to take into account actual net revenue gain or loss for the fiscal year ending prior to the rate adjustment date. Existing law requires this determined rate to be effective during the state\u2019s next fiscal year. This bill would, for the 2016\u201317 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter to the 2020 \u201321 fiscal year, inclusive, on or before May 15 of the fiscal year immediately preceding the applicable fiscal year , instead require the Department of Finance to adjust the motor vehicle fuel tax rate as described above, and would require the department to notify the board of the rate adjustment effective for the state\u2019s next fiscal year, as provided. Existing law, as of July 1, 2011, increases the taxes on the sale of, and the storage, use, or other consumption of, diesel fuel, and reduces the excise tax on diesel fuel. Existing law requires the board, for the 2012\u201313 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, on or before March 1 of the fiscal year immediately preceding the applicable fiscal year, to adjust the diesel fuel tax rate by reducing it in that manner as to result in a revenue loss that will equal the amount of revenue gain attributable to the increase in the sales and use tax rate, based on estimates made by the board. Existing law also requires, in order to maintain revenue neutrality, the board to take into account actual net revenue gain or loss for the fiscal year ending prior to the rate adjustment date. Existing law requires this determined rate to be effective during the state\u2019s next fiscal year. This bill would, for the 2016\u201317 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter to the 2020 \u201321 fiscal year, inclusive, on or before May 15 of the fiscal year immediately preceding the applicable fiscal year , instead require the Department of Finance to adjust the diesel fuel excise tax rate as described above, and would require the department to notify the board of the rate adjustment effective for the state\u2019s next fiscal year, as provided."
