    "content": "World Trade Organization Dispute Settlement Review Commission Act - Establishes the World Trade Organization Dispute Settlement Review Commission to review: (1) all reports of dispute settlement panels or the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in proceedings initiated by other parties to the WTO that are adverse to the United States and that are adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body. And (2) upon the request of US Trade Representative or specified congressional officials, any other report of a dispute settlement panel, or the Appellate Body that is adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body. Requires the Commission, with respect to such reports that are adverse to the United States and adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body, to conduct a review and determine whether the panel or Appellate Body: (1) exceeded its authority or its terms of reference. (2) added to the obligations, or diminished US rights under the Uruguay Round Agreement that is the subject of the report. (3) acted arbitrarily or capriciously, engaged in misconduct, or demonstrably departed from the procedures specified for panels and Appellate Bodies in the applicable Uruguay Round Agreement. And (4) deviated from the applicable standard of review, including in antidumping, countervailing duty, and other unfair trade remedy cases, the standard of review set forth in Article 17.6 of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), 1994. Requires the Commission, if it makes an affirmative determination about the action of a panel or an Appellate Body, to determine further whether the action materially affected the outcome of the report."
