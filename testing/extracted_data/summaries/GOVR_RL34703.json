    "content": "Conscience clause laws allow medical providers to refuse to provide services to which they have religious or moral objections. In some cases, these laws are designed to excuse such providers from performing abortions. While substantive conscience clause legislation, such as the Abortion Non-Discrimination Act, has not been approved, appropriations bills that include conscience clause provisions have been passed. This report describes the history of conscience clauses as they relate to abortion law and provides a legal analysis of the effects of such laws. The report also discusses the issuance of a new rule to implement some of the existing conscience clause laws, and recent efforts to rescind that rule. Finally, the report reviews the conscience protection provisions of the House- and Senate-passed health reform measures, H.R. 3962 and H.R. 3590."
