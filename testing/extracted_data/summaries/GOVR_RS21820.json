The Bush Administration maintains that the handover was a success and will begin atransition todemocracy and stability. Critics assert that the handover does not appear to have diminished the anti-U.S.insurgency, threateningthe transition roadmap developed by the United States and United Nations. Legal issues may arise regarding thevalidity of lawsissued during the occupation, as well as the status of U.S. troops in Iraq.
