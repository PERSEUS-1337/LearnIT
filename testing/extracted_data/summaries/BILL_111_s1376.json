    "content": "International Adoption Simplification Act - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to include in the definition of child, and thus in the exemption from required admissions vaccination documentation, certain children who have been adopted in a foreign country that is a signatory to the Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption or who are emigrating from such a country for US adoption. Includes in such definition and exemption a child who is under the age of 18 at the time an immediate relative status petition is filed on his or her behalf, has been adopted abroad or is coming for US adoption, and is the natural sibling of: (1) an adopted child from a Hague Convention signatory country. (2) a child adopted under the age of 16 who has lived with the adoptive parents for at least two years, or a child who has been abused. Or (3) an orphan who was under the age of 16 at the time an immediate relative status petition was filed on his or her behalf. Makes such provisions effective on the date of enactment of this Act, except that such an alien sibling who has attained the age of 18 on or after April 1, 2008, shall be deemed to meet the age requirement if a petition for classification of the alien as an immediate relative is filed not later than two years after the date of the enactment of this Act."
