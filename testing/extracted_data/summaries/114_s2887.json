    "content": "Missile Defense Defend and Deter Act of 2016 This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) Missile Defense Agency to administer an intercept flight test of the ground-based midcourse defense element of the ballistic missile defense system at least once each fiscal year. Each test shall provide for: validation of the defense element's operational effectiveness. Use of assets in their operational configuration against an inventory of targets to assess performance in a variety of flight test regimes, use of operational doctrine and real-world constraints, evaluation of new concepts of operations, tactics, and techniques. And mechanisms to assure the confidence of members of the Armed Forces in the basic design of the ground-based midcourse defense element, its hit-to-kill effectiveness, and its operational capability. The Agency may forgo a test if: it would jeopardize national security, not be successful due to specific ground-based midcourse defense components needing a non-intercept test, and likely fail due to impractical time considerations. Or funding is insufficient. The Agency also may forgo a test if DOD determines that the testing is detrimental to US national security interests and provides notice to Congress."
