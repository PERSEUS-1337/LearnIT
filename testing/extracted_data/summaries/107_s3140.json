    "title": "A bill to assist law enforcement in their efforts to recover missing children and to clarify the standards for State sex offender registration programs.",
    "content": "Prevention and Recovery of Missing Children Act of 2002 - Amends the Crime Control Act of 1990 to require each State reporting on missing children to: (1) ensure that no law enforcement agency within the State establishes or maintains any policy that requires the removal of an entry from its State law enforcement system or the National Crime Information Center computer network based solely on the person's age. And (2) provide that any relevant information shall be entered within two hours of receipt . Revises the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act to require the responsible official to obtain from a sex offender who is required to register: (1) information regarding the offender's anticipated future residence, employer's name and address, license plate number and vehicle, and student enrollment. And (2) fingerprints and a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sample, unless they were obtained within the previous three months. Sets forth requirements regarding State: (1) procedures involving offenders intending to move to another State. (2) timetables for the verification of registry information and the taking of photographs. And (3) procedures requiring offenders to obtain a driver's license or identification card from the State department of motor vehicles at the time of registration. Requires States to: (1) designate a failure to comply with the registration and verification requirements as a felony and permit such failure to be grounds for the immediate issuance of an arrest warrant. And (2) consider a failure to comply as an ongoing offense and a failure to register each item of changed registry information as a separate offense."
