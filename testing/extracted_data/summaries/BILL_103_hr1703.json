    "content": "Equitable Health Care for Neurobiological Disorders Act of 1993 - Sets standards for the nondiscriminatory and equitable treatment by employer health benefit plans of individuals with neurobiological disorders , including coverage that is no more restrictive than that provided for other major physical illnesses. Deems a plan to meet such standards if it provides for: (1) stop-loss protection for catastrophic expenses, (2) coverage of facility-based care and specified outpatient medical management. (3) coverage of visits for psychological, therapeutic, and rehabilitative services, with coinsurance and fees to ensure effective cost control. And (4) coverage of prescription drugs and medically necessary services for comorbidity of other disorders. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose an excise tax on the failure of a heath insurance carrier or an employer health benefit plan to comply with standards under this Act."
