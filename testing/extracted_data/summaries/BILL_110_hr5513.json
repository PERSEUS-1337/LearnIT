Requires such states to require any person engaged in the business of distributing tobacco products at retail to implement a program to: (1) notify its employees that state law prohibits the sale or distribution of tobacco products to minors and the purchase, receipt, or possession in a public place of a tobacco product by a minor. And (2) ensure compliance with such law. Directs such states to provide for a civil monetary penalty or community service for violations. Requires such states to have established goals for reducing the rate of retailer violations. Allows states to use minors to test compliance under certain conditions.
