    "content": "S. 147 / H.R. 309 , companion bills introduced in the 109th Congress,represent an effort to accord to Native Hawaiians a means of forming a governmental entity thatcould enter into government-to-government relations with the United States. This entity would beempowered to negotiate with the State of Hawaii and with the federal government regarding thetransfer of land and the exercise of governmental power and jurisdiction. There was similarlegislation in the 106th, 107th, and 108th Congresses; the House passed a Native Hawaiian recognitionbill, H.R. 4904 , in the 106th Congress. While the Senate did not pass H.R.4904, the bill would have been enacted through a provision in the Consolidated Appropriations Act,2001 ( H.R. 4577 , P.L. 106-554 ), until a Senate concurrent resolution removed theprovision by correcting the enrollment of H.R. 4577 ( S.Con.Res. 162 ). This report describes the provisions of the reported version of S. 147 ; outlinessome federal statutes and recent cases which might be relevant to the issue of federal recognition ofa Native Hawaiian entity; and recounts some legal arguments that have been presented in the debateon this legislation. It includes a brief outline of the provisions of a substitute amendment expectedto be offered in lieu of the reported version of S. 147, when Senate debate, which wasinterrupted by the filing of a cloture motion on July 29, resumes. The substitute amendment is theproduct of discussions that have included congressional, executive, and State of Hawaii officials. S. 147 has again been placed on the Senate Calendar. This report will be updated aswarranted by legislative activity."
