    "content": "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes funding for civil projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of the Interior'sBureau of Reclamation (BuRec), most of the Department of Energy (DOE), and a number of independent agencies. The Administration requested $22.7 billionfor these programs for FY2001 compared with $21.2 billion appropriated in FY2000. The House bill, H.R. 4733 , passed on June 28, 2000, allocated$21.74 billion. The Senate passed its version of H.R. 4733 September 7, appropriating $22.5 billion. Theconference bill, reported September 27,appropriated a total of $23.3 billion. That bill was vetoed, largely for non-fiscal reasons, and the Senate October12 added a new version of the conference bill,with essentially the same funding but without the veto-drawing measure, to the VA/HUD appropriations measure, H.R. 4635 . On October 18, H.R. 5483 was introduced in the House, containing the Energy and Water appropriations provisions includedin the Senate-passed version. On thesame day the conference report to H.R. 4635 was filed, including the provisions of H.R. 5483 . TheHouse and the Senate agreed to theconference report on October 19, and the President signed the bill October 27 ( P.L. 106-377 ). Key issues involving Energy and Water Development appropriations programs include: authorization of appropriations for major water/ecosystem restoration initiatives for the Florida Everglades and California\"Bay-Delta\"; reform or review of Corps study procedures and agency management practices; spending for solar and renewable energy to address global climate change issues; a pending decision by DOE on the electrometallurgical treatment of nuclear spent fuel for storage and disposal, a process that opponentscontend raises nuclear proliferation concerns; implementation of the new National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA); an expanded Threat Reduction Initiative aimed at ending Russia's production of plutonium that can be used to make nuclear weapons;and DOE management of its Spallation Neutron Source Project (SNS).
