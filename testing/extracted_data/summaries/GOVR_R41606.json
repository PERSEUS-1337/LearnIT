    "content": "Jared Lee Loughner was arrested for the attempted murder of Representative Gabrielle Giffords, the murder of United States District Court Judge John Roll, and the murder or attempted murder of several federal employees. The arrest brings several features of federal law to the fore. Federal crimes of violence are usually violations of the law of the state where they occur; an offender may be tried in either federal or state court or both. Ordinarily, federal crimes must be tried where they occur, but in extraordinary cases a defendant's motion for a change of venue may be granted. In capital cases, the decision to seek the death penalty rests with the Attorney General. Should a defendant elect to assert an insanity defense, he must provide pretrial notification. In the face of that notice, the court may order an examination to determine the defendant's competence to stand trial. Federal law affords victims, including families of the deceased or incapacitated, the right to confer with prosecutors, and to attend the trial and other public judicial proceedings. Defendants, convicted of a murder for which the prosecution seeks the death penalty, are entitled to a jury determination of whether they acted with the intent necessary to qualify for the death penalty and whether the balance of aggravating and any mitigating factors are sufficient to warrant the jury's recommendation that the defendant be put to death. Defendants, convicted of attempted murder or some other noncapital offense, are sentenced by the court without the benefit of a jury. Sentencing in such cases begins with the federal Sentencing Guidelines, from whose recommendations a sentencing court may depart only with reasonable justification. Comparable provisions of state law are beyond the scope of this report."
