    "title": "An act to amend Sections 30301 and 30604 of, and to add Sections 30013 and 30107.3 to, the Public Resources Code, relating to coastal resources.",
    "content": "Existing law, the California Coastal Act of 1976, establishes the California Coastal Commission and prescribes the membership and functions and duties of the commission. Existing law provides that the commission consists of 15 members. This bill would require one of the members of the commission appointed by the Governor to reside in, and work directly with, communities in the state that are disproportionately burdened by, and vulnerable to, high levels of pollution and issues of environmental justice, as defined. The bill would require that the Governor appoint a member who meets these qualifications to a vacant position from the appointments available no later than the fourth appointment available after January 1, 2017. Existing law requires any person, as defined, wishing to perform or undertake any development, as defined, in the coastal zone to obtain a permit, except as provided. Existing law prescribes a process for the certification of local coastal programs in the state and requires, after certification of the local coastal program, a coastal development permit to be issued if the issuing agency, or the commission on appeal, finds that the proposed development is in conformity with the certified local coastal program. This bill would authorize the issuing agency, or the commission on appeal, to consider environmental justice, as defined, or the equitable distribution of environmental benefits in communities throughout the state, when acting on a coastal development permit."
