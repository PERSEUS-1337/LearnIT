    "content": "The Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill includes funding for the Department of the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President (EOP), the judiciary, the District of Columbia, and more than two dozen independent agencies. The House and Senate FSGG bills fund the same agencies, with one exception. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is funded through the Agriculture appropriations bill in the House and the FSGG bill in the Senate. This structure has existed since the 2007 reorganization of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. On February 9, 2016, then-President Obama submitted his FY2017 budget request. The request included a total of $46.5 billion for agencies funded through the FSGG appropriations bill, including $330 million for the CFTC. On June 15, 2016, the House Committee on Appropriations reported a Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2017 (H.R. 5485, H.Rept. 114-624). Total FY2017 funding in the reported bill would have been $43.5 billion, with another $250 million for the CFTC included in the Agriculture appropriations bill (H.R. 5054, H.Rept. 114-531), which was reported on April 26, 2016. The combined total of $43.8 billion would have been about $2.8 billion below the President's FY2017 request. After a number of amendments on the floor, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5485 on July 7, 2016. Although funding was shifted among some FSGG agencies, the overall level remained unchanged. On June 16, 2016, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported the Financial Services and General Government Act, 2017 (S. 3067, S.Rept. 114-280). S. 3067 would have appropriated $44.4 billion for FY2017, about $2.2 billion below the President's request. S. 3067 was not considered on the Senate floor during the 114th Congress. No FY2017 FSGG appropriations were enacted prior to the end of FY2016. On September 29, 2016, the President signed P.L. 114-223. Division C of this act provided for continuing appropriations through December 9, 2016, generally termed a continuing resolution (CR). P.L. 114-223 provided funding for most FSGG agencies at the FY2016 funding rate subject to an across-the-board decrease of 0.496% (pursuant to Section 101(b) of Division C). This was followed by a second CR, P.L. 114-254, which provided funding through April 28, 2017, and a third, P.L. 115-30, which provided funding through May 5, 2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31/H.R. 244) was enacted on May 5, 2017, following House passage on May 3 and Senate passage on May 4. FSGG appropriations, including the CFTC, were provided in Division E. FY2017 FSGG appropriations totaled $43.3 billion, approximately $3.2 billion below the President's request. Although financial services are a major focus of the FSGG appropriations bills, these bills do not include funding for many financial regulatory agencies, which are funded outside of the appropriations process. The FSGG bills do, however, often contain additional legislative provisions relating to such agencies."
