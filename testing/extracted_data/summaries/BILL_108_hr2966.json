(2) the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966, with respect to National Wildlife Refuge System lands. And (3) the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, with respect to National Forest System lands . Prohibits: (1) the Secretary from refusing to issue a permit for a new use of pack and saddle stock animals, including use by a commercial outfitter or guide, without complying with applicable resource management plans and planning processes required under each such law regarding public lands described above or any other provision of law. (2) limiting the Secretary's authority to impose a temporary emergency closure of a trail, route, or area to pack and saddle stock animals or issue special permits. Or (3) creating a preference for one recreational use for any unit of the National Park System, without consideration of the unit's stated purpose.
