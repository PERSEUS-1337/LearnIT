    "content": "Founded in 1961, the Peace Corps has sought to meet its legislative mandate of promoting world peace and friendship by sending American volunteers to serve at the grassroots level in villages and towns in all corners of the globe. As of the end of September 2017, about 7,376 volunteers were serving in 65 nations. In 2018, the 115th Congress has considered and may again consider several issues related to the Peace Corps, including the President's annual funding request for the Peace Corps and changes to the Peace Corps authorization legislation. The Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act of 2018, P.L. 115-256, signed into law on October 9, 2018, includes provisions to improve volunteer medical care, both at post and after service; extend the allowable period of service for certain Peace Corps positions; establish the frequency, scope, and reporting requirements for impact surveys of volunteers; and improve advocacy for volunteers who are the victims of crimes, among other things. Current issues include the extent to which there is available funding for Peace Corps expansion, whether volunteers are able to function in a safe and secure environment, volunteer access to abortion, and other issues."
