And (2) any written statement submitted under this Act by a victim or by a Federal, State, or local law enforcement official, investigator, prosecutor, probation officer, judge, or prison official. Directs the AG, in preparing such report: (1) to inform the victims of each offense that is the subject of the potential grant of clemency that they may submit written statements for inclusion in the AG's report and to make every effort to determine their opinions regarding the potential grant of clemency. (2) to determine the opinions of law enforcement and judicial officials as to the propriety of granting clemency, particularly whether the person poses a danger to any person or society and has expressed remorse and accepted responsibility for his or her criminal conduct. (3) to determine the opinions of Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials as to whether the person may have information relevant to any ongoing investigation or prosecution, or any effort to apprehend a fugitive. And (4) to determine the opinions of Federal, State, and local law enforcement or intelligence agencies regarding the effect that a grant of clemency would have on the threat of terrorism or other ongoing or future criminal activity. Requires the AG to notify the victims of: (1) the undertaking by the AG of any investigation or review of a potential grant of clemency in a particular matter or case. (2) the submission to the President of a report under this Act. And (3) the President's decision to deny any petition or request for clemency. Directs the AG, if the President grants clemency, to notify the victims as soon as practicable and, if such grant will result in the release of any person from custody, such notice shall be prior to that release."
