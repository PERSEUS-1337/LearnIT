Requires each disease or illness identified that becomes manifest in a Gulf veteran to be presumed to be service-connected. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the updating of presumed exposures. Enumerates the pesticides, agents, compounds, particulates, radiation, and pollutants to which Gulf veterans shall be presumed to have been exposed.
