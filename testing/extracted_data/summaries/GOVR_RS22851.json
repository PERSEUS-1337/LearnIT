    "content": "The Internal Revenue Service considers payments received under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) self-employment income even though they are called \"annual rental payments,\" and rental income from real property is generally excluded from self-employment income. Bills have been repeatedly introduced before Congress to statutorily exclude the CRP payments from self-employment tax, but these bills generally have died in committee. In the 110 th Congress, the Senate passed H.R. 2419 , which contains a provision that would exclude the payments from self-employment income in some, but not all, cases. Unlike most previously introduced legislation, it would also provide a tax credit as an optional alternative to the current annual rental payments. This credit would be subject to neither income tax nor self-employment tax."
