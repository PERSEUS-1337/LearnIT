    "content": "Department of Defense Anthrax Vaccination Moratorium Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) a single protection measure such as the mandatory anthrax vaccine immunization program should not be implemented by the Department of Defense (DOD) without regard to its effect on morale, retention, recruiting, and budget. And (2) an insufficiently proven vaccine should not be advocated as a substitute for research, development, and production of truly effective vaccines and antibiotics, adequate protective equipment, and nonproliferation measures. Directs the Secretary of Defense to suspend implementation of the DOD anthrax vaccination program. Requires: (1) an independent study of the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine used. And (2) a report from the Director of the National Institutes of Health to specified congressional committees on study results. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study and comment to Congress on the vaccine program and the effect of the use of contractor-operated facilities for such program. Requires expedited consideration by the respective Boards for Correction of Military Records for current or former military personnel for remedies for adverse personnel actions that were the result of the vaccine program. States that if the Director determines that the vaccine used in the DOD program meets specified criteria, the Secretary may resume such program. Provides that if such program is resumed, the Secretary may use only newly produced vaccine for vaccinations after such resumption."
