    "content": "During the last few decades, consumers in the United States have shown a significant interest in purchasing consumer products and packaging that appear to be beneficial\u2014or at least not harmful\u2014to the natural environment. In response to consumers' willingness to pay a premium for these products, manufacturers and others have increasingly touted the positive environmental attributes of their products in marketing materials, such as in advertising or on product labels. These environmental marketing claims may concern a single environmental attribute or relate to the environmental impacts of a product during all or part of its life cycle, such as the effect on the environment of the product's manufacture, distribution, use, or disposal. Some commentators have suggested that certain environmental marketing messages have the potential to deceive consumers, and that the prevalence of such messages in the marketplace may discourage companies from competing to create more environmentally beneficial products. Currently, federal regulation of environmental marketing claims consists primarily of the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) case-by-case enforcement approach under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce. The commission has issued nonbinding guidelines that explain how it might enforce Section 5 in the environmental marketing context. The FTC and other federal agencies also enforce federal laws and regulations that address specific types of environmental claims such as \"dolphin-safe\" or \"organic\" claims. Finally, in some cases, the federal government has required manufacturers to disclose certain information about the environmental attributes of their products. The EnergyGuide labeling program administered by the FTC and Department of Energy (DOE) serves as one example. Federal regulation of environmental marketing claims raises certain legal issues including questions involving the First Amendment, international trade law, and federal preemption of state law. For example, legislation that regulates how manufacturers or sellers make certain claims about their products in advertisements or on labels may raise questions about the constitutional limits of regulating commercial speech. Requiring manufacturers to disclose certain information relating to the environmental characteristics of their products in advertisements and on labels may raise questions about the constitutionality of legislation that compels speech. In addition, laws regulating environmental marketing claims that appear on product labels could potentially raise issues concerning the United States' obligations under international trade law. For example, such measures could potentially be subject to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement), which generally requires WTO Members preparing, adopting, and applying a measure to adhere to obligations concerning nondiscrimination; trade-restrictiveness; transparency; and reliance on international standards as a basis for regulation. However, the extent to which the TBT Agreement applies to measures that regulate claims made on labels that address so-called \"non-product-related processes and production methods\" (e.g., the amount of carbon dioxide emitted during manufacture of a product) is unclear. Another issue that might arise is the degree to which federal laws and regulations governing environmental marketing claims should expressly preempt state laws."
