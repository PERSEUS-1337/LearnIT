Requires the Secretary to accept or reject a redevelopment plan within 60 days of its submission, with appropriate notification to the RA. Allows an RA whose plan has been rejected to submit a revised plan for consideration within 90 days after such notification, and requires the Secretary to accept or reject such revised plan within 30 days of submission, with appropriate RA notification. Provides for disposal of an installation's buildings and property to another Federal department or agency, or in accordance with an accepted redevelopment plan, as appropriate. Allows the Secretary to postpone or extend any deadline provided under this Act if determined to be in the best interests of the communities affected by the closure of the installation."
