    "title": "AB 2695",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes, during the pendency of any juvenile proceeding, the minor\u2019s counsel or the court to express a doubt as to the minor\u2019s competency. Existing law requires proceedings to be suspended if the court finds substantial evidence raises a doubt as to the minor\u2019s competency. Existing law requires the court to appoint an expert, as specified, to evaluate whether the minor suffers from a mental disorder, developmental disability, developmental immaturity, or other condition and, if so, whether the condition or conditions impair the minor\u2019s competency. This bill would revise and recast these provisions to, among other things, expand upon the duties imposed upon the expert during his or her evaluation of a minor whose competency is in doubt, as specified. The bill would authorize the district attorney or minor\u2019s counsel to retain or seek the appointment of additional qualified experts with regard to determining competency, as specified. The bill would require the Judicial Council to adopt a rule of court relating to the qualifications of those experts, as specified. The bill would require the question of the minor\u2019s competency to be determined at an evidentiary hearing, except as specified, and places the burden on the minor to establish a presumption of competency, unless it is proven by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she is incompetent. The bill would require the court, upon a finding of incompetency, to refer the minor to services designed to help the minor attain competency. If the court finds that the minor will not achieve competency, competency within a reasonable period of time, the bill would require the court to dismiss the petition. The bill would authorize the court to invite specified persons and agencies to discuss any services that may be available to the minor after the court\u2019s jurisdiction is terminated, and would require the court to make certain referrals for the minor. The bill would require, among others, the presiding judge of a juvenile court, the probation department, and the county mental health department to develop a written protocol describing the competency process and a program to ensure that minors who are found incompetent receive appropriate remediation services. By Notwithstanding these provisions, the bill would prohibit remediation services from exceeding certain time periods, as specified. By imposing additional duties on local officials, the this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
