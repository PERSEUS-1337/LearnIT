    "content": "Sacramento, California, is among the U.S. cities most vulnerable to flooding, and regional growth is increasing the potential losses from flooding. A major flood could inundate developed and agricultural areas, disrupting the economy and damaging infrastructure and property. How to reduce flood risks in developed and developing areas is a problem faced by communities nationwide, and is receiving increased attention as the reliability of existing infrastructure is reevaluated in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Sacramento's flood protection system, which includes levees on the American and Sacramento Rivers as well as Folsom Dam on the American River, has been crucial in protecting the city over the last 50 years. Storms in 1986 and 1996 prompted increased attention to Sacramento flood concerns from the federal government, which subsequently has contributed efforts to reduce the city's flood vulnerability. Beginning in 1987, Congress authorized and appropriated funds for several studies by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to investigate flood protection in the Sacramento area. These studies showed that the city's flood damage reduction system provided less than 100-year flood protection (i.e., a greater than 1% annual chance of flooding). The studies suggested a number of options to augment flood protection, including improvements to local levees, various changes and additions to the federally constructed Folsom Dam, and a dam upstream from Folsom Dam on the American River (Auburn Dam). Since 1992, Congress has authorized a variety of actions, including improving levees and modifying Folsom Dam. Although Congress authorized plans to expand Folsom Dam's capacity to regulate larger floods, some planned activities have become problematic due to changes in cost estimates. Current studies are exploring additional potential options addressing flood control in the area. Congress is likely to revisit issues relating to authorization, cost, and oversight of Sacramento flood protection projects. Reconsideration of Auburn Dam on the American River (also known as the Auburn-Folsom South Unit) or another dam near the Auburn site also may be debated. In addition to structural changes at Folsom Dam, Congress also has authorized and implemented dam operational changes. Some actions to rehabilitate and improve levees on the American and Sacramento Rivers are currently under construction; others have been delayed and are undergoing reevaluation. This report briefly outlines recent major federal involvement in flood control in the Sacramento region of California, with particular attention to recent changes and developments in the construction of projects at Folsom Dam. It outlines recent congressional and agency actions intended to strengthen flood control in this region, and provides an update on the status of these actions."
