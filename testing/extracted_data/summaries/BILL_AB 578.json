    "title": "AB 578",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board in the Department of Industrial Relations to adopt, amend, or repeal employment safety standards and laws. Existing law authorizes the board, upon the application of an employer, to grant a permanent variance from an occupational standard or order after specified notice and hearing requirements are met. The California Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1973 also authorizes an employer to apply to the Division of Occupational Safety and Health, that enforces employment safety laws, for a temporary order granting a variance from an occupational safety or health standard and requires the order to be granted only if the employer\u2019s application satisfies specified requirements. Existing law provides that a temporary order may be granted only after notice to employees and an opportunity for a hearing. Existing law specifies the information that an application for a temporary order is required to contain. This bill would require an employer to also give notice to workers at the place of employment who will be affected by a permanent or temporary variance, or representatives of affected workers, who may be affected by or exposed to the hazards by the permanent or temporary variance from an occupational safety and health standard. The bill would require any affected worker, or representative of affected workers, upon request, to be granted party status to the variance proceedings. The bill would require the variance application to include a certification that the employer has given notice to affected workers as required. Because a violation of the new requirements for employers would be a crime under certain circumstances, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
