    "content": "Consumer Products Safe Testing Act - Sets forth Federal policy requiring Federal departments and agencies to encourage the development and use of product testing procedures that do not rely upon animals yet accurately reflect the acute health effects on humans of certain products, including consumer products and products containing hazardous or toxic substances. Requires each Federal department or agency head to: (1) evaluate any regulation, guideline, or recommendation issued by that agency which requires, recommends, or encourages the use of the Draize or other animal acute toxicity test to evaluate the safety of a regulated product. (2) evaluate nonanimal alternatives with the potential for partial or full replacement of such test. And (3) promulgate regulations, guidelines, or recommendations that specify a nonanimal acute toxicity test or battery of tests that should be used instead of an animal test unless the nonanimal test is less likely to predict the acute health effects of a product on humans. Provides that any Federal agency head who finds that regulations requiring or recommending animal tests should not be amended, to publish in the Federal Register an explanation of options considered and the justification for continuing the animal test. Requires each Federal agency head, at least every two years, after considering the most recent technological advances available, to determine whether continued use of any animal test is justified. Makes this Act inapplicable to regulations, guidelines, or recommendations related to medical research."
