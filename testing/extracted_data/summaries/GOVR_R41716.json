    "content": "The Social Security Administration (SSA) is responsible for administering a number of federal entitlement programs that provide income support (cash benefits) to qualified individuals. These programs are Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI), commonly known as Social Security; Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled; and Special Benefits for Certain World War II Veterans. In FY2017, SSA's programs are projected to pay a combined $1.0 trillion in federal benefits to 68.4 million recipients. Spending on administrative costs for these programs is projected to be about 1.3% of benefit outlays. Although benefit payments for SSA's programs are considered mandatory spending and thus are not controlled by the annual appropriations process, the agency requires annual discretionary appropriations to carry out its programs and to support the administration of non-SSA programs, such as Medicare. SSA's funding is part of the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (LHHS) appropriations bill. The FY2017 President's budget request for SSA's limitation on administrative expenses (LAE) account, which funds virtually all of SSA's operations, is $13.1 billion. Of this amount, $1.8 billion is for program integrity activities, which include continuing disability reviews (CDRs) and SSI non-medical redeterminations. The total FY2016 appropriation for SSA's LAE account was $12.2 billion, with $1.4 billion dedicated to program integrity work. This report provides an overview of SSA's mandatory spending but focuses primarily on discretionary appropriations for the agency's administrative expenses."
