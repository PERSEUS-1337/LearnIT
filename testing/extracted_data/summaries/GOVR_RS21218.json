    "content": "The Army has been seeking to enhance its self-propelled 155mm artillery capabilitiessince the late 1970's. In additionto several programs to modify the M109 artillery system, culminating in the current M109A6 Paladin, since 1987these efforts have focused on what is now calledthe XM2001 Crusader. Initially begun in order to match the mobility and firepower of Soviet artillery, the Crusaderprogram is now the center of a controversyover whether it is an appropriate investment given the Army's on-going transformation to a lighter, more mobileforce. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld hasannounced his intent to terminate the program, however the Crusader's supporters in the House and Senate ArmedServices Committees are seeking legislativeprovisions to maintain the program until at least May 2003 while an assessment of alternatives is conducted. Thisreport will be updated as further events occur."
