    "title": "AB 2626",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training and requires it to develop and disseminate guidelines and training for law enforcement officers, as described. This bill would require the commission to develop and disseminate guidelines and training for peace officers on principled policing, which would include the subjects of procedural justice and implicit bias, as defined. The bill would require this training as part of the basic training course for for specified peace officers. The bill would also require the commission to develop and disseminate guidelines and training certify and make training available to train peace officers to teach the course of basic training on principled policing to other officers in their agencies. The bill would require the commission to offer the basic principled policing course and the training course semiannually quarterly commencing in June 2017. The bill would require the commission, no later than June 1, 2018, to evaluate its current course of basic training and promulgate a plan to incorporate the concepts of principled policing into its course of basic training and would require each peace officer to complete a refresher course no less than every 5 years. By requiring additional basic training for peace officers, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
