    "content": "Appropriations earmarks for the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Energy Efficiency andRenewable Energy (EERE) programs have tripled from FY2003 to FY2006. According to theExecutive Office of the President and the private American Association for the Advancement ofScience (AAAS), this affects the conduct of programs and may delay the achievement of goals. Further, the Administration has proposed new funding for hydrogen, biomass/biorefinery, and solarenergy initiatives proposed under the American Competitiveness Initiative/Advanced EnergyInitiative (AEI). The report discusses the potential impact of congressional earmarks on EERE research anddevelopment (R&D) programs and, in particular, whether continued high levels of earmarks couldlead to new cuts in staff and dilute the desired impact of the AEI initiatives under EERE, shouldCongress decide to fund them. The congressional debate over earmarks centers on the transparency of the process, with afocus on earmarks not initially approved in either chamber that appear in a bill's conference report. Opponents contend that the earmarking process is not open, fair, or competitive. Proponents say itis a legitimate practice and is justified by policymakers' knowledge of local needs, as it spreadsresearch money to deserving states and institutions. The appropriation figures cited as \"earmarks\" in this report are those labeled by DOE budgetrequests as \"congressionally directed activities\" and, for FY2006, appear to be completely consistentwith figures in the FY2006 Energy and Water Development (E&W) conference report that arelabeled as \"congressionally directed projects.\" In this regard, the earmark figures in this reportappear consistent with the definition of a congressional appropriations earmark as \"funds set asidewithin an account for individual projects, locations, or institutions.\" This report will be updated as events warrant."
