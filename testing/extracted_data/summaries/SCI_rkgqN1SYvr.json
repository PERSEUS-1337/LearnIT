    "content": "The selection of initial parameter values for gradient-based optimization of deep neural networks is one of the most impactful hyperparameter choices in deep learning systems, affecting both convergence times and model performance. Yet despite significant empirical and theoretical analysis, relatively little has been proved about the concrete effects of different initialization schemes. In this work, we analyze the effect of initialization in deep linear networks, and provide for the first time a rigorous proof that drawing the initial weights from the orthogonal group speeds up convergence relative to the standard Gaussian initialization with iid weights. We show that for deep networks, the width needed for efficient convergence to a global minimum with orthogonal initializations is independent of the depth, whereas the width needed for efficient convergence with Gaussian initializations scales linearly in the depth. Our results demonstrate how the benefits of a good initialization can persist throughout learning, suggesting an explanation for the recent empirical successes found by initializing very deep non-linear networks according to the principle of dynamical isometry. Through their myriad successful applications across a wide range of disciplines, it is now well established that deep neural networks possess an unprecedented ability to model complex real-world datasets, and in many cases they can do so with minimal overfitting. Indeed, the list of practical achievements of deep learning has grown at an astonishing rate, and includes models capable of human-level performance in tasks such as image recognition (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) , speech recognition , and machine translation (Wu et al., 2016 ). Yet to each of these deep learning triumphs corresponds a large engineering effort to produce such a high-performing model. Part of the practical difficulty in designing good models stems from a proliferation of hyperparameters and a poor understanding of the general guidelines for their selection. Given a candidate network architecture, some of the most impactful hyperparameters are those governing the choice of the model's initial weights. Although considerable study has been devoted to the selection of initial weights, relatively little has been proved about how these choices affect important quantities such as rate of convergence of gradient descent. In this work, we examine the effect of initialization on the rate of convergence of gradient descent in deep linear networks. We provide for the first time a rigorous proof that drawing the initial weights from the orthogonal group speeds up convergence relative to the standard Gaussian initialization with iid weights. In particular, we show that for deep networks, the width needed for efficient convergence for orthogonal initializations is independent of the depth, whereas the width needed for efficient convergence of Gaussian networks scales linearly in the depth. Orthogonal weight initializations have been the subject of a significant amount of prior theoretical and empirical investigation. For example, in a line of work focusing on dynamical isometry, it was found that orthogonal weights can speed up convergence for deep linear networks (Saxe et al., 2014; Advani & Saxe, 2017) and for deep non-linear networks Xiao et al., 2018; Gilboa et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2018; Pennington et al., 2017; Tarnowski et al., 2019; Ling & Qiu, 2019) when they operate in the linear regime. In the context of recurrent neural networks, orthogonality can help improve the system's stability. A main limitation of prior work is that it has focused almost exclusively on model's properties at initialization. In contrast, our analysis focuses on the benefit of orthogonal initialization on the entire training process, thereby establishing a provable benefit for optimization. The paper is organized as follows. After reviewing related work in Section 2 and establishing some preliminaries in Section 3, we present our main positive result on efficient convergence from orthogonal initialization in Section 4. In Section 5, we show that Gaussian initialization leads to exponentially long convergence time if the width is too small compared with the depth. In Section 6, we perform experiments to support our theoretical results. In this work, we studied the effect of the initialization parameter values of deep linear neural networks on the convergence time of gradient descent. We found that when the initial weights are iid Gaussian, the convergence time grows exponentially in the depth unless the width is at least as large 4 We choose X \u2208 R 1024\u00d716 and W * \u2208 R 10\u00d71024 , and set Y = W * X. Entries in X and W * are drawn i.i.d. from N (0, 1). as the depth. In contrast, when the initial weight matrices are drawn from the orthogonal group, the width needed to guarantee efficient convergence is in fact independent of the depth. These results establish for the first time a concrete proof that orthogonal initialization is superior to Gaussian initialization in terms of convergence time."
