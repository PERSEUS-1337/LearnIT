    "content": "The ability to decompose complex multi-object scenes into meaningful abstractions like objects is fundamental to achieve higher-level cognition. Previous approaches for unsupervised object-oriented scene representation learning are either based on spatial-attention or scene-mixture approaches and limited in scalability which is a main obstacle towards modeling real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose a generative latent variable model, called SPACE, that provides a uni\ufb01ed probabilistic modeling framework that combines the best of spatial-attention and scene-mixture approaches. SPACE can explicitly provide factorized object representations for foreground objects while also decomposing background segments of complex morphology. Previous models are good at either of these, but not both. SPACE also resolves the scalability problems of previous methods by incorporating parallel spatial-attention and thus is applicable to scenes with a large number of objects without performance degradations. We show through experiments on Atari and 3D-Rooms that SPACE achieves the above properties consistently in comparison to SPAIR, IODINE, and GENESIS. Results of our experiments can be found on our project website: https://sites.google.com/view/space-project-page One of the unsolved key challenges in machine learning is unsupervised learning of structured representation for a visual scene containing many objects with occlusion, partial observability, and complex background. When properly decomposed into meaningful abstract entities such as objects and spaces, this structured representation brings many advantages of abstract (symbolic) representation to areas where contemporary deep learning approaches with a global continuous vector representation of a scene have not been successful. For example, a structured representation may improve sample efficiency for downstream tasks such as a deep reinforcement learning agent (Mnih et al., 2013) . It may also enable visual variable binding (Sun, 1992) for reasoning and causal inference over the relationships between the objects and agents in a scene. Structured representations also provide composability and transferability for better generalization. Recent approaches to this problem of unsupervised object-oriented scene representation can be categorized into two types of models: scene-mixture models and spatial-attention models. In scenemixture models (Greff et al., 2017; Burgess et al., 2019; Engelcke et al., 2019) , a visual scene is explained by a mixture of a finite number of component images. This type of representation provides flexible segmentation maps that can handle objects and background segments of complex morphology. However, since each component corresponds to a full-scale image, important physical features of objects like position and scale are only implicitly encoded in the scale of a full image and further disentanglement is required to extract these useful features. Also, since it does not explicitly reflect useful inductive biases like the locality of an object in the Gestalt principles (Koffka, 2013) , the resulting component representation is not necessarily a representation of a local area. Moreover, to obtain a complete scene, a component needs to refer to other components, and thus inference is inherently performed sequentially, resulting in limitations in scaling to scenes with many objects. In contrast, spatial-attention models (Eslami et al., 2016; Crawford & Pineau, 2019) can explicitly obtain the fully disentangled geometric representation of objects such as position and scale. Such features are grounded on the semantics of physics and should be useful in many ways (e.g., sample efficiency, interpretability, geometric reasoning and inference, transferability). However, these models cannot represent complex objects and background segments that have too flexible morphology to be captured by spatial attention (i.e. based on rectangular bounding boxes). Similar to scene-mixture models, previous models in this class show scalability issues as objects are processed sequentially. In this paper, we propose a method, called Spatially Parallel Attention and Component Extraction (SPACE), that combines the best of both approaches. SPACE learns to process foreground objects, which can be captured efficiently by bounding boxes, by using parallel spatial-attention while decomposing the remaining area that includes both morphologically complex objects and background segments by using component mixtures. Thus, SPACE provides an object-wise disentangled representation of foreground objects along with explicit properties like position and scale per object while also providing decomposed representations of complex background components. Furthermore, by fully parallelizing the foreground object processing, we resolve the scalability issue of existing spatial attention methods. In experiments on 3D-room scenes and Atari game scenes, we quantitatively and qualitatively compare the representation of SPACE to other models and show that SPACE combines the benefits of both approaches in addition to significant speed-ups due to the parallel foreground processing. The contributions of the paper are as follows. First, we introduce a model that unifies the benefits of spatial-attention and scene-mixture approaches in a principled framework of probabilistic latent variable modeling. Second, we introduce a spatially parallel multi-object processing module and demonstrate that it can significantly mitigate the scalability problems of previous methods. Lastly, we provide an extensive comparison with previous models where we illustrate the capabilities and limitations of each method. We propose SPACE, a unified probabilistic model that combines the benefits of the object representation models based on spatial attention and the scene decomposition models based on component mixture. SPACE can explicitly provide factorized object representation per foreground object while also decomposing complex background segments. SPACE also achieves a significant speed-up and thus makes the model applicable to scenes with a much larger number of objects without performance degradation. Besides, the detected objects in SPACE are also more intuitive than other methods. We show the above properties of SPACE on Atari and 3D-Rooms. Interesting future directions are to replace the sequential processing of background by a parallel one and to improve the model for natural images. Our next plan is to apply SPACE for object-oriented model-based reinforcement learning. Joseph Redmon, Santosh Divvala, Ross Girshick, and Ali Farhadi.
