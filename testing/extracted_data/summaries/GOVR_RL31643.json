    "content": "The National Security Education Program (NSEP), authorized by the David L. BorenNational Security Education Act of 1991 (NSEA, Title VIII of P.L. 102-183 ), provides aid forinternational education and foreign language studies by American undergraduate and graduatestudents, plus grants to institutions of higher education. The statement of purpose for the NSEAemphasizes the needs of federal government agencies, as well as the Nation's postsecondaryeducation institutions, for an increased supply of individuals knowledgeable about the languages andcultures of foreign nations, especially those which are of national security concern and have nottraditionally been the focus of American interest and study. Three types of assistance are authorized and currently provided by the NSEA: (a) David L.Boren Scholarships for undergraduate students to study in \"critical\" foreign countries; (b) grants toinstitutions of higher education to establish or operate programs in \"critical\" foreign language andarea studies areas, including a National Flagship Language Initiative-Pilot Program; and (c) DavidL. Boren Fellowships to graduate students for education abroad or in the U.S. in \"critical\" foreignlanguages, disciplines, and area studies. Individuals who receive NSEP fellowships and scholarshipsare obligated for a limited period of time to seek employment in a national security position with afederal agency. Grant recipients who demonstrate that such positions are not available may fulfillthe requirement through work in any federal agency or in the field of higher education in an area ofstudy for which the scholarship or fellowship was awarded. The NSEP is intended to complement, and not duplicate, other federal programs of aid forforeign language and area studies education, such as those authorized under Title VI of the HigherEducation Act and the Fulbright-Hays Act. Distinctive elements of the NSEP, compared to mostother federal programs of aid to international education or exchange, include the service requirementfor aid recipients, administration by the Department of Defense (rather than the Departments ofEducation or State), and support for international travel by American undergraduate students. Therecent establishment of the NSEP pilot program, the National Flagship Language Initiative,distinguishes it even further from Title VI programs. The NSEP is administered by the Departmentof Defense's National Defense University, under the guidance of a Presidentially appointed NationalSecurity Education Board. Several bills passed in the 107th and 108th Congressional sessions that would have altered theNSEP's funding and administration. In addition, the intelligence reform bill ( P.L. 108-458 ) signedby the President on December 17, 2004, amends Title X of the National Security Act to create a newIntelligence Community Scholarship Program (ICSP) that is quite similar to the NSEP (\u00c2\u00a71042). Thisreport provides background information on the NSEP and an analysis of related issues including theICSP. It will be updated in response to major legislative developments."
