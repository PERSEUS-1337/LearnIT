    "content": "Supporting America's Young Entrepreneurs Act of 2016 This bill amends title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to make eligible for deferment and cancellation under the Federal Direct Loan program a borrower who is an employee or founder of a small business start-up in a distressed area. It also amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from an individual's gross income the amount of such canceled student loan debt. The bill establishes a Federal Direct Refinanced Private Loan program to refinance private education loans. Finally, it establishes a young entrepreneurs business center within the Small Business Administration to certify small business start-ups, identify distressed areas, and approve loan cancelation for founders of small business start-ups."
