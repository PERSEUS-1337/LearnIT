Includes the wife or husband of a member serving on extended active duty within the federal veterans' employment preference. Allows members who have completed two terms of service and have reenlisted for a third term to transfer a portion of their entitlement to basic educational assistance under the Montgomery GI Bill. Requires studies on: (1) the development of an education grant program for training military spouses in health care and early childhood development careers. And (2) creating work opportunities for undergraduate- and graduate-educated military spouses during the active-duty service of their spouses."
