    "title": "A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify the tax treatment of certain life insurance contract transactions, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the tax treatment of certain life insurance contract transactions, to require reporting to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of: (1) information identifying persons who acquire a life insurance contract, or any interest therein, in a reportable policy sale. (2) information identifying a seller who transfers an interest in a life insurance contract and the seller's investment in the contract. And (3) reportable death benefit payments. Requires a basis adjustment for mortality, expense, or other reasonable charges incurred under an annuity or life insurance contract. Exempts from rules limiting the exclusion from gross income of life insurance death benefit amounts any amounts realized from the transfer of a life insurance contract, or any interest therein, that is a reportable policy sale. Defines reportable policy sale as the acquisition of an interest in a life insurance contract, directly or indirectly, if the acquirer has no substantial family, business, or financial relationship with the insured apart from the acquirer's interest in such life insurance contract."
