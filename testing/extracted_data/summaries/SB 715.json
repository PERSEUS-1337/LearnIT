    "title": "An act to add Article 4.3 (commencing with Section 111547) to Chapter 6 of Part 5 of Division 104 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to drugs and devices.",
    "content": "Existing law, the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, prohibits a person from introducing into interstate commerce any new drug unless the drug has been approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Existing law requires the sponsor of a new drug to submit to the FDA an investigational new drug application and to then conduct a series of clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug in human populations and submit the results to the FDA in a new drug application. Existing law, the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law, regulates the packaging, labeling, and advertising of drugs and devices and is administered by the State Department of Public Health. A violation of that law is a crime. The Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law prohibits, among other things, the sale, delivery, or giving away of a new drug or new device unless either the department has approved a new drug or device application for that new drug or new device and that approval has not been withdrawn, terminated, or suspended or the drug or device has been approved pursuant to specified provisions of federal law, including the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Medical Practice Act provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians and surgeons by the Medical Board of California and requires the board to take action against a licensee who is charged with unprofessional conduct. The Osteopathic Act provides for the licensure and regulation of osteopathic physicians and surgeons by the Osteopathic Medical Board of California and requires the board to enforce the Medical Practice Act with respect to its licensees. This bill, among other things, would permit a manufacturer of an investigational drug, biological product, or device to make the product available to eligible patients with terminal illnesses, as specified. The bill would authorize, but not require, a health benefit plan, as defined, or governmental agency to provide coverage for any investigational drug, biological product, or device made available pursuant to these provisions or the associated costs. The bill would prohibit the Medical Board of California and the Osteopathic Medical Board of California from taking any disciplinary action against the license of a physician based solely on the physician\u2019s recommendation to an eligible patient regarding, or prescription for or treatment with, an investigational drug, biological product, or device, provided that the recommendation or prescription is consistent with medical standards of care. The bill would prohibit a state agency from altering any recommendation made to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding a health care provider\u2019s certification to participate in the Medicare or Medicaid program based solely on the recommendation from an individual health care provider that an eligible patient have access to an investigational drug, biological product, or device. The bill would prohibit an official, employee, or agent of the state from blocking an eligible patient\u2019s access to the investigational drug, biological product, or device pursuant to the bill\u2019s provisions."
