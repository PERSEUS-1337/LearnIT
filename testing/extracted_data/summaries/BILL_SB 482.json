    "title": "SB 482",
    "content": "Existing law classifies certain controlled substances into designated schedules. Existing law requires the Department of Justice to maintain the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES) for the electronic monitoring of the prescribing and dispensing of Schedule II, Schedule III, and Schedule IV controlled substances by all practitioners authorized to prescribe, administer, furnish, or dispense these controlled substances. Existing law requires dispensing pharmacies and clinics to report specified information for each prescription of a Schedule II, Schedule III, or Schedule IV controlled substance to the department. This bill would require a health care practitioner authorized to prescribe, order, administer, or furnish a controlled substance to consult the CURES database to review a patient\u2019s controlled substance history no earlier than 24 hours, or the previous business day, before prescribing a Schedule II, Schedule III, or Schedule IV controlled substance to the patient for the first time and at least once every 4 months thereafter if the substance remains part of the treatment of the patient. The bill would exempt a veterinarian and a pharmacist from this requirement. The bill would also exempt a health care practitioner from this requirement under specified circumstances, including, among others, if prescribing, ordering, administering, or furnishing a controlled substance to a patient receiving hospice care, to a patient admitted to a specified facility for use while on facility premises, or to a patient as part of a treatment for a surgical procedure in a specified facility if the quantity of the controlled substance does not exceed a nonrefillable 5-day supply of the controlled substance that is to be used in accordance with the directions for use. The bill would require, if a health care practitioner authorized to prescribe, order, administer, or furnish a controlled substance is not required to consult the CURES database the first time he or she prescribes, orders, administers, or furnishes a controlled substance to a patient pursuant to one of those exemptions, the health care practitioner to consult the CURES database before subsequently prescribing a Schedule II, Schedule III, or Schedule IV controlled substance to the patient and at least once every 4 months thereafter if the substance remains part of the treatment of the patient. This bill would provide that a health care practitioner who fails to consult the CURES database is required to be referred to the appropriate state professional licensing board solely for administrative sanctions, as deemed appropriate by that board. The bill would make the above-mentioned provisions operative 6 months after the Department of Justice certifies that the CURES database is ready for statewide use and that the department has adequate staff, user support, and education, as specified. This bill would also exempt a health care practitioner, pharmacist, and any person acting on behalf of a health care practitioner or pharmacist, when acting with reasonable care and in good faith, from civil or administrative liability arising from any false, incomplete, inaccurate, or misattributed information submitted to, reported by, or relied upon in the CURES database or for any resulting failure of the CURES database to accurately or timely report that information. Existing law requires the operation of the CURES database to comply with all applicable federal and state privacy and security laws and regulations. Existing law authorizes the disclosure of data obtained from the CURES database to agencies and entities only for specified purposes and requires the Department of Justice to establish policies, procedures, and regulations regarding the use, access, disclosure, and security of the information within the CURES database. This bill would authorize a health care practitioner to provide a patient with a copy of the patient\u2019s CURES patient activity report if no additional CURES data is provided. The bill would also prohibit a regulatory board whose licensees do not prescribe, order, administer, furnish, or dispense controlled substances from obtaining data from the CURES database."
