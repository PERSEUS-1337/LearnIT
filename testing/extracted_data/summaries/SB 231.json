    "title": "An act to amend Sections 75212 and 75230 of the Public Resources Code, relating to transportation, and making an appropriation therefor.",
    "content": "Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the State Air Resources Board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of a market-based compliance mechanism relative to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Existing law continuously appropriates specified portions of the annual proceeds in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to various programs including 5 for the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program and 20 for the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program. This bill would include water-borne transit as an eligible project that may be funded under these 2 programs. Because the bill would expand the allowable purposes for which the continuously appropriated funds allocated to the program may be expended, it would thereby make an appropriation."
