    "content": "Camera Authorization and Maintenance Act of 2014 or the CAM Act of 2014 - Prohibits a state or local government that does not require its law enforcement officers to use body-worn cameras from receiving any grant from the Attorney General in the following fiscal year, subject to a financial hardship waiver. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to make grants to states, local governments, and Indian tribes for the acquisition, operation, and maintenance of body-worn cameras for law enforcement officers. Sets forth requirements for the wearing and use of such body cameras and for recordings made. Requires funds to be awarded to each qualifying local government with fewer than 100,000 residents, with any remaining funds awarded to other qualifying applicants on a pro rata basis. Establishes in the Department of Justice (DOJ) a task force to: provide recommendations on community policing, develop proper body-worn camera training protocol. Study the impact that citizen review boards could have on investigating cases of alleged police misconduct. And conduct a survey, one year after implementation of the body camera requirement policy, to determine best practices and policy effectiveness. Directs the Comptroller General to submit a report on the Department of Defense Excess Personal Property Program that includes information on which jurisdictions equipment is sent to, the value of equipment sent to each jurisdiction, the level of training provided, and how the equipment is used."
