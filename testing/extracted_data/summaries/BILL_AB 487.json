    "title": "AB 487",
    "content": "Existing law provides that, one year prior to the minimum eligible parole release date of an inmate serving an indeterminate sentence, a panel of 2 or more commissioners or deputy commissioners of the Board of Parole Hearings shall meet with the inmate and set a parole release date, as specified. Existing law, as amended by Proposition 9, the Victim\u2019s Bill of Rights Act of 2008: Marsy\u2019s Law, at the November 4, 2008, statewide general election, establishes procedures at all hearings for the purpose of reviewing a prisoner\u2019s parole suitability, or the setting, postponing, or rescinding of parole dates, and provides prisoners and victims specified rights at these hearings. This bill would require notification of the district attorney of the county in which the offense was committed, or his or her designee, to receive notification of specified parole proceedings. This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 3041.5 of the Penal Code proposed by SB 230 that would become operative if this bill and SB 230 are both chaptered and this bill is chaptered last."
