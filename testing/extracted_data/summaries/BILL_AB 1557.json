    "content": "Existing law, known as the Civic Center Act, authorizes the governing board of a school district to grant the use of school facilities or grounds as a civic center, for specified purposes, upon terms and conditions deemed proper by the governing board of the school district. The act requires the governing board of a school district to authorize the use of school facilities or grounds by a nonprofit organization, or by a club or an association organized to promote youth and school activities, including, but not necessarily limited to, the Girl Scouts, the Boy Scouts, Camp Fire USA, the YMCA, a parent-teacher association, or a school-community advisory council. The act authorizes and requires the governing board of a school district to charge certain fees for use of its school facilities or grounds. This bill would specifically authorize a governing board of a school district to authorize the use of school facilities or grounds by a nonprofit organization, or by a club or an association organized to promote youth and school activities, that is a recreational youth sports league that charges participants an average of no more than $60 per month."
