    "content": "Bring Small Businesses Back Tax Reform Act This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish new maximum individual tax rates for qualified business income that does not exceed $1 million . The maximum rates are: (1) 10 of such income not exceeding $150,000, and (2) 20 for income that exceeds $150,000 and is not more than $1 million. The rates apply to up to $1 million of qualified business income that is: (1) gross earnings derived by an individual from any active trade or business carried on by the individual, excluding deductions attributable to the trade or business. And (2) the taxpayer's distributive or pro rata share of pass-through income from entities such as a partnership or S corporation. Qualified business income does not include capital gains, interest, dividends, or royalties. For taxpayers that are not a corporation or a partnership with a corporation as a partner, the bill repeals the annual limitation on the election to deduct certain depreciable business assets. The bill also permits certain small businesses whose average gross receipts do not exceed $25 million to use the cash accounting method without limitations and exempts such businesses from inventory rules."
