    "content": "Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 to require the Principal Cyber Advisor (PCA) to establish and submit to Congress a comprehensive list of cyber and information technology ranges and facilities of the Department of Defense (DOD). Defines quot, cyber and information technology ranges and facilitiesquot. As cyber ranges, test facilities, test beds, and other DOD means for testing, training, and developing software, personnel, and tools for accommodating DOD's mission. Requires the PCA to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether listed ranges and facilities should be managed centrally to increase efficiency, should provide capability or capacity to more DOD elements, or both. Directs the Secretary to establish or designate an entity to coordinate such ranges and facilities that the PCA determines should be centrally managed. Requires the head of such entity to: (1) manage and identify opportunities for integration of such ranges and facilities. And (2) assist the military departments, the National Guard, and elements of DOD to gain access to such ranges and facilities. Requires the PCA to establish and maintain a list of commonly used terms relating to cyber matters to improve the coordination and cooperation among the military departments and other federal agencies. Directs the head of the coordination entity to carry out one or more pilot programs to demonstrate commercially available, cloud-based cyber training, exercise, and test environments that are accessible to defense laboratories, the National Guard, academia, and the private sector."
