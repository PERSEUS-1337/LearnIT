    "content": "U.S. relations with India depend largely on India's political leadership. India's 2004 nationalelections ended governance by the center-right coalition headed by Prime Minister Atal BihariVajpayee and brought in a new center-left coalition led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Following the upset victory for the historically-dominant Indian National Congress Party led bySonia Gandhi, Gandhi declined the post of Prime Minister in the new left-leaning United ProgressiveAlliance (UPA) coalition government, instead nominating her party lieutenant, Oxford-educatedeconomist Manmohan Singh, for the job. As Finance Minister from 1991-1996, Singh was thearchitect of major Indian economic reform and liberalization efforts. On May 22, thewidely-esteemed Sikh became India's first-ever non-Hindu Prime Minister. The defeated BharatiyaJanata Party now sits in opposition at the national level, led in Parliament by former Deputy PrimeMinister Lal Advani. A coalition of communist parties supports the UPA, but New Delhi'seconomic, foreign, and security policies are not expected to be significantly altered. The newgovernment has vowed to continue close and positive engagement with the United States in all areas. This report, which will not be updated, provides an overview of the elections, key parties, and U.S.policy interests."
