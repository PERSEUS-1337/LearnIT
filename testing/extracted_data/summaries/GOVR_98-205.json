    "content": "Congress completed action on FY1999 defense authorization and appropriations bills on October 1. The House approved the conference report on the defense authorization bill( H.R. 3616 ) on September 24 and the Senate on October 1. The President signed thebill into law ( P.L. 105-261 ) on October 17. The House approved the conference report on thedefense appropriations bill ( H.R. 4103 ) on September 28 and the Senate on September29. The President signed the bill into law ( P.L. 105-262 ) on October 17, as well. Later Congressapproved additional funding for defense programs in the FY1999 Omnibus Consolidated andEmergency Supplemental Appropriations Act ( H.R. 4328 , P.L. 105-277 ), which theHouse approved on October 20 and the Senate on October 21, and which the President signed laterthat day. The authorization conference agreement resolved a number of contentious issues, include restrictions on technology transfers to China in the House bill; gender-integrated basic training,which the House wanted to restrict, while the Senate supported the current system; restrictions onbase consolidation included in the Senate bill; options for producing tritium for nuclear weapons;and a few major weapons issues, including funding for the Theater High Altitude Area Defense(THAAD) system and Senate provisions requiring more testing of the F-22 fighter. The appropriations conference decided to leave a key issue -- funding for Bosnia -- for action in later legislation. The Senate-passed appropriations bill included $1.9 billion in emergencyfunding for Bosnia, as the Administration had requested, but the House bill did not. Funding forBosnia was subsequently provided in a supplemental appropriations measure approved as part of theOmnibus Appropriations bill. The supplemental measure also included funding for Year 2000(Y2K) fixes in the Defense Department, for military readiness, for drug interdiction, for missiledefense, and for counter-terrorism activities. Other key issues that Congress addressed this year include base closures, Bosnia policy, and congressional war powers. In action on the defense authorization bill, neither the House nor theSenate agreed to an Administration request to approve a new round of military base closures, so theissue has been put off for renewed debate next year. Both the House and the Senate also debated theU.S. mission in Bosnia. Neither House approved any binding restrictions on the mission, though theauthorization conference agreement includes a sense of the Congress statement urging the Presidentto reduce troops levels. The House-passed appropriations bill included a war powers-relatedprovision that would prohibit the expenditure of funds for offensive military actions without advancecongressional approval, while the Senate rejected the same language. The Administration threateneda veto if that provision was not removed in conference, and the conference agreement did not toinclude the measure. Key Policy Staff"
