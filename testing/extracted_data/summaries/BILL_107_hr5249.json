    "content": "Safe Overseas Human Testing Act - Declares it is the policy of Congress to control the export of drugs and other test articles intended for overseas clinical investigations involving human participants in order to foster public health and safety, prevent injury to US foreign policy, and preserve the credibility of the United States as a responsible trading partner. Requires a license approved by the President for the export of such test articles. Sets forth certain export license requirements, including that the license applicant shall: (1) identify each clinical investigation for which the test article is intended. And (2) submit proof that each of the protocols for every clinical investigation has been reviewed by an institutional review board and has, at a minimum, met substantially the same standards for the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects as that required for Institutional Review Boards approval of protocols for clinical investigations of test articles pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act."
