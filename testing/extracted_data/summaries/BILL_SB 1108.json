    "title": "SB 1108",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes a county board of supervisors to appoint a committee, composed of county residents, to study the matter of changing the boundaries of its supervisorial districts. Existing law directs a committee created pursuant to that provision to report its findings to the board of supervisors, as specified, and it expressly states that recommendations of the committee are advisory only. Existing law similarly authorizes a city council to appoint a committee, composed of city residents, to study the matter of changing the boundaries of its council districts, directs a committee so created to report its findings to the city council, and expressly states that recommendations of the committee are advisory only. This bill would delete those provisions and instead authorize a county or general law city to establish a commission, composed of residents of the county or city, to either change the boundaries of the districts or recommend to the governing body changes to the boundaries of the districts. The bill would also require an advisory commission that recommends changes to district boundaries to report to the governing body its findings on the need for changes to the boundaries. For a commission empowered to change district boundaries, this bill would prohibit the appointment of a person or family member, as defined, of a person who engaged in specified activities during the preceding 8 years, and it would also prohibit commission members from engaging in specified activities while serving and for a specified period of time after serving."
