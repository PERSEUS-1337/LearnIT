    "content": "A 2014 study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics within the U.S. Department of Education (ED) found that 53% of public elementary and secondary schools need to spend money on repairs, renovations, and modernizations to put their onsite buildings in good overall condition. The study estimated that the nationwide spending necessary to reach this standard would be approximately $197 billion, or about $4.5 million per school that needs improvements. This report provides a description of and background for selected provisions in the Rebuild America's Schools Act of 2019 ( H.R. 865 / S. 266 ), which would provide federal funding for public school construction. H.R. 865 was ordered to be reported by the House Committee on Education and Labor on February 26, 2019. As no action has been taken on the identical companion bill S. 266 since it was introduced in the Senate, this report addresses H.R. 865 . While the construction, renovation, repair, and maintenance of public school facilities are typically the responsibility of state and local governments, the federal government has provided some funding for construction and renovation for specific purposes. H.R. 865 proposes to authorize $70 billion in grants and facilitate $30 billion in school infrastructure tax credit bonds to be used toward the construction and repair of public elementary and secondary school facilities. Funds would be allocated to states proportionally based on their prior-year share of grant allocations under Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), a grant program designed to provide educational and related services to low-achieving and other students attending schools with relatively high concentrations of students from low-income families. States are directed to award grant funds provided through the bill to local educational agencies (LEAs) with the highest numbers or percentages of students who are \"counted\" in the formulas used to allocate ESEA Title I-A grants\u00e2\u0080\u0094and among LEAs meeting this criterion, to those prioritizing improvement of facilities of public schools that serve the highest percentages of students who qualify for free or reduced price lunches. Additional consideration in the awarding of grants to LEAs may be given to those with school facilities that pose a severe health or safety threat. Funds would also be authorized under H.R. 865 for Impact Aid construction for FY2020 through FY2023 at levels substantially higher than current authorization of appropriations levels. H.R. 865 would place certain restrictions on how funds from grants or bonds may be used. For instance, it specifies for each fiscal year a certain percentage of covered funds that must be used for construction or renovation that is consistent with \"green\" standards. Additionally, LEAs that receive covered funds from grants or bonds authorized by the bill would be required to ensure that any iron, steel, and manufactured products used in projects are produced in the United States. However, the Secretary of Education would have authority to waive this requirement under certain circumstances. The bill would also require the Institute of Education Sciences to carry out and submit to the appropriate congressional committees a comprehensive study of the physical condition of all public schools in the United States at least once every five years. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that enactment of H.R. 865 would result in an increase of approximately $8.4 billion in direct spending, a decrease of approximately $1.2 billion in revenues, and an increase of approximately $55.6 billion in outlays subject to appropriation in the period from FY2019 to FY2029."
