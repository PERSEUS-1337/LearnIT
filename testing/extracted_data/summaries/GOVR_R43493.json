    "content": "Charter schools are public schools of choice that are created in accordance with state laws and are publicly funded and tuition free. They are operated according to the terms of charters or contracts granted by public chartering agencies. The terms of charters typically provide charter school operators with increased autonomy over the operation of schools, often including exemptions from, or flexibility in the application of, many of the state or local regulations otherwise applicable to public schools. Enrollment in charter schools is normally open to applicants on a local educational agency (LEA)-wide or even statewide basis, and parents must actively choose to enroll their children in charter schools. Under Title V-B-1 and V-B-2 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), federal support is provided to assist with the opening of new charter schools and for the funding of charter school facilities. ESEA Title V-B-1 authorizes the Charter Schools Program, which provides grants to state educational agencies (SEAs), or charter school developers if a state's SEA chooses not to apply for a grant, to support the planning, program design, and initial implementation of public charter schools. Funds may also be used to provide dissemination grants to successful charter schools. ESEA Title V-B-1 authorizes the Secretary of Education to reserve funds for national activities, such as evaluation, technical assistance, and dissemination of best practices. ESEA Title V-B-1 authorizes the Per-Pupil Facilities Aid Program (more commonly referred to as the State Charter School Facilities Incentive Grants Program). Under this program, the Secretary provides competitive grants to states to pay the federal share of establishing or enhancing, and administering, a program that will provide facilities assistance to charter schools on a per-pupil basis. ESEA Title V-B-2 authorizes the Credit Enhancement Initiatives to Assist Charter School Facility Acquisition, Construction, and Renovation program (more commonly known as the Credit Enhancement program). Under this program, ED awards competitive grants to public or private nonprofit entities to demonstrate innovative ways to help charter schools acquire appropriate facilities. While the charter school programs have not been reauthorized since the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB; P.L. 107-110) in 2002, they continue to receive funding through the annual appropriations process. In addition, since FY2010, substantive changes have been made to the programs through annual appropriations acts, including allowing or requiring the Secretary to make grants to nonprofit charter management organizations (CMOs) and other nonprofit entities for the replication and expansion of successful charter school models. During the 112th and 113th Congresses, Congress has actively pursued both a comprehensive reauthorization of the ESEA, which would include amending and reauthorizing the Title V-B charter school programs, and stand alone legislation to reauthorize and amend the Title V-B programs independent of a comprehensive ESEA reauthorization. Most recently, the House Education and Workforce Committee ordered reported the Success and Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act (H.R. 10) by a vote of 36-3 on April 8, 2014. The bill would provide for a reauthorization of the Title V-B charter school programs and make numerous changes to the current programs. While a brief discussion of the changes that H.R. 10 would make to the charter school programs is included, it is generally beyond the scope of this report to discuss amendments that would be made to the charter school programs by these reauthorization bills."
