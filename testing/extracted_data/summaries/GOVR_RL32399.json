    "content": "The United States now has a unified inspections operation at the borders; a single inspectoris charged with examining people, animals, plants, goods, and cargo upon entry to the country. Thetransfer of these functions to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) marks a significant policyshift for all of these functions, clarifying that -- although there are important commercial, economic,health, humanitarian, and immigration responsibilities -- ensuring the security of our borders is thetop priority. The decision by DHS officials to further integrate the inspection duties so that there is\"one face at the border\" now means that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) inspectors areessentially interchangeable and responsible for all primary inspections. A range of legal,administrative, and policy issues have emerged with unified border inspections. Legislationimplementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations -- the National Intelligence Reform Act of2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ) -- had various provisions affecting border inspections. CBP inspectors are charged with enforcing a host of laws. Immigration law requires theinspection of all aliens who seek entry into the United States, and every person is inspected todetermine citizenship status and admissibility. All goods being imported into the United States aresubject to a customs inspection, but an actual physical inspection of all goods is not required. Therealso are laws that subject animals and plants to border inspections. This report provides a discussionof these various laws and the procedural differences in what constitutes an \"inspection.\" Border inspections conducted each year number in the hundreds of millions. Prior to thecreation of CBP, the Department of Justice's immigration inspectors did most passenger inspections-- peaking at 534 million in FY2000 -- since all foreign nationals seeking entry into the United Statesmust be inspected. In terms of customs inspections, approximately 22.6% of rail containers; 5.2%of sea containers; and 15.1% of trucks entering the United States were physically inspected. Unlikecustoms and immigration inspections data, animal and plant health inspections data enumerate onlythose passengers referred to secondary inspections for the purpose of an agricultural inspection. There were 44 million animal and plant inspections in FY2002. Border inspections are funded through a combination of federal discretionary appropriationsand user fees. In FY2004, CBP was given budget authority of $2,496 million for border security,inspections, and trade facilitation at ports of entry. Historic funding data for inspections are notcomparable across the \"legacy\" agencies as the budget data often included activities in addition tothe inspection functions. Some argue that this reorganization of border inspections has been long needed and isresulting in a more streamlined and efficient set of procedures at the border with a clear, single, chainof command. Others warn that the different types of inspections are quite complex in their own rightand that the reorganization is exacerbating the conflicting priorities at the border, ultimately resultingin many more people and goods being sent to secondary inspections.
