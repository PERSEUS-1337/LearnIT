    "title": "An act to amend Sections 17406 and 17407 of, and to add Section 17407.5 to, the Education Code, and to amend Section 20111.6 of the Public Contract Code, relating to school facilities.",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school district, without advertising for bids, to lease real property for a minimum rental of $1 per year if the instrument by which this property is leased requires the lessee to construct, or provide for the construction of, a building to be used by the school district and provides that the title to the building shall vest in the school district at the end of the lease. Existing law, until January 1, 2019, also requires the instrument, if funds for the instrument derive from the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998 or from any future state school bond for a public project that involves a projected expenditure of $1,000,000 or more, to provide that the person, firm, or corporation that constructs the building shall comply with specified prequalification requirements. Existing law also authorizes the governing board of a school district to enter into an agreement with the lowest responsible bidder to construct, or provide for the construction of, a building to be leased and used by the school district upon a designated site if the instrument provides that the title to the building and site shall vest in the school district at the end of the lease. Existing law, until January 1, 2019, requires the agreement, if funds for the agreement derive from the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998 or from any future state school bond for a public project that involves a projected expenditure of $1,000,000 or more, to provide that the person, firm, or corporation that constructs the building shall comply with specified prequalification requirements. This bill would, until January 1, 2019, require the instrument and agreement to provide that the person, firm, or corporation that constructs the building to comply with specified prequalification requirements in this context regardless of the funding source for the public project. The bill would require that certain conditions relating to the use of a skilled and trained workforce on the project or contract be satisfied before the governing board of a school district may enter into a contract with any entity for the construction, or for providing for the construction of, a building to be leased or used by the school district. Existing law requires, until January 1, 2019, the governing board of a school district that enters into a contract for a public project, as defined, for which the board uses moneys received pursuant to the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998 or moneys from future state school bonds for a public project that involves a projected expenditure of $1,000,000 or more, to require prospective bidders for a construction contract to complete and submit a standardized prequalification questionnaire and financial statement, as provided. This bill would impose these requirements on a public project if funding for the project includes reimbursement from any future state school bond."
