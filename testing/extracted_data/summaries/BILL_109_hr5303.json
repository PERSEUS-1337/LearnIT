And (2) will not jeopardize the health of civilian populations in the area of such use. Suspends federal approval of the foreign sale or export of munitions containing depleted uranium until the Secretary of HHS has made such certification. Limits future exports to stocks certified free of transuranic matter by the Secretary of Defense. Requires the Comptroller General to investigate and report to Congress on the contamination of stocks of depleted uranium munitions with transuranic elements. Requires the Director of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention jointly to conduct a comprehensive study of the health effects of exposure to depleted uranium munitions on veterans and on their children born after their respective exposures to uranium.
