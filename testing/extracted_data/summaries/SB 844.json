    "title": "An act to add Chapter 3.132 (commencing with Section 15820.94) to Part 10b of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, relating to correctional facilities, and making an appropriation therefor, to take effect immediately, bill related to the budget.",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes the Board of State and Community Corrections or the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the State Public Works Board, and a participating county, as defined, to acquire, design, and construct an adult local criminal justice facility approved by the Board of State and Community Corrections, or to acquire a site or sites owned by, or subject to a lease option to purchase held by, a participating county. Existing law authorizes the State Public Works Board to issue up to $500,000,000 in revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes to finance the acquisition, design, and construction of approved adult local criminal justice facilities. The funds derived from those revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes are continuously appropriated for those purposes. This bill would enact provisions similar to the provisions described above authorizing the Board of State and Community Corrections or the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the State Public Works Board, and a participating county, as defined, to acquire, design, and construct an adult local criminal justice facility, as defined. The bill would authorize the State Public Works Board to issue up to $270,000,000 in revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes to finance the acquisition, design, and construction of approved adult local criminal justice facilities, setting aside $20,000,000 to be awarded to Napa County, and would continuously appropriate the funds for those purposes. Because the bill would continuously appropriate funds for these purposes, it would make an appropriation. The bill would establish procedures for approving and funding these projects. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill."
