    "content": "Screening With Dignity Act of 2018 This bill directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to develop procedures to appropriately and respectfully screen self-identified transgender air passengers and begin training of all TSA Officers on such procedures. The TSA must implement protections for transgender passengers including prohibiting human viewing of passenger images and conducting pat-downs by an officer of the gender requested by the passenger. The TSA shall separately study and report on: (1) the cost and feasibility of retrofitting advanced image technology screening equipment to distinguish between foreign objects and human body parts in a manner that is gender neutral, and (2) the impact of imaging technology on transgender passengers."
