    "content": "Second Amendment Preservation Act of 1999 - Amends the Federal criminal code to limit amounts paid in plaintiff's attorney's fees for settlement or adjudication of a civil action brought to curtail the sale or availability of firearms for legal purposes to the lesser of: (1) $150 per hour for each hour spent productively, plus actual expenses incurred by the attorney in connection with the action. Or (2) ten percent of the amount that the plaintiff receives under the action. Directs the court, if it finds that the defendant in such an action is not wholly or primarily liable for the damages sought, to require the plaintiff to reimburse the defendant for reasonable attorney's fees and court costs incurred in litigating the action, unless the court finds that special circumstances make such reimbursement unjust. Provides that any court decision that the Constitution does not confer on Congress the power to enact this Act shall be directly appealable to the Supreme Court."
