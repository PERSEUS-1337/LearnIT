    "content": "Veterans Claims Procedures Improvement Act of 2003 - Prohibits payment or furnishing of veterans' benefits, if the Secretary of Veterans Affairs notifies a benefit claimant that certain information is necessary to complete the claimant's application and such information is not received by the Secretary within one year after such notification. Requires written notification to a claimant by the Secretary of additional information or evidence needed to complete a claim application. Requires the claimant to submit to the Secretary such additional information or evidence within the time period specified by the Secretary, which period shall end not less than 60 days after the date of such notification or one year from the date of application, whichever is later. Allows the Secretary to: (1) extend the time limits for good cause. And (2) decide a claim before the end of such limits. Revises appellate review procedures applicable to filing a notice of disagreement with the Board of Veterans Appeals to require a claimant to be notified in writing to provide clarification on whether or not appellate review is desired or what issue or issues are being appealed."
