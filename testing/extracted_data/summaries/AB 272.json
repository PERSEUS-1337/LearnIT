    "title": "An act to amend Section 830.6 of the Penal Code, relating to employment.",
    "content": "Under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, it is unlawful to engage in specified discriminatory practices in employment or housing accommodations on the basis of certain specified characteristics, including race, creed, or national origin. Existing law defines these characteristics and other terms for purposes of the act. Under existing law, a person deputized or appointed as a reserve or auxiliary sheriff or city police officer, a reserve deputy sheriff, a reserve deputy marshal, a reserve police officer of a transit district, a reserve park ranger, a reserve harbor or port police officer, or a reserve officer of a school district, among others, by the proper authority, who is assigned specific police functions by that authority or is designated by local ordinance or resolution, and who meets specified requirements, is a peace officer. This bill would make a person deputized or appointed by the proper authority as a peace officer pursuant to the above provisions an employee for purposes of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. The bill would also update an obsolete cross-reference."
