    "content": "The Agriculture appropriations bill\u2014formally known as the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act\u2014funds the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), excluding the U.S. Forest Service. Congress enacted the FY2018 agriculture appropriation in March 2018 as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141, Division A). Both the House and the Senate Appropriations Committees have reported Agriculture appropriations bills for FY2019 (H.R. 5961, S. 2976). The Senate amended and passed its version as Division C of a four-bill minibus (H.R. 6147). Numerous federal, state, and local agencies share responsibilities for regulating the safety of the U.S. food supply. Federal responsibility for food safety rests primarily with FDA, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, and also the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), an agency of USDA. FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of the majority of all domestic and imported food products\u2014except for meat and poultry products, which are within USDA's jurisdiction to oversee meat, poultry, and processed egg products. Combined appropriations covering food safety activities at both FDA and USDA totaled nearly $2.1 billion in FY2018. Congressional appropriations at both FDA and USDA are augmented by existing (currently authorized) user fees. FDA user fees authorized by the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA, P.L. 111-353) have generated between $10 million and $18 million annually in recent years. At FSIS, user fees have generated between $180 million and $250 million per year. At FDA, ongoing efforts to improve food safety include implementation of FSMA. FSMA was enacted by the 111th Congress and was the largest expansion of FDA's food safety authorities since the 1930s. Since FSMA became law in 2011, congressional appropriators have increased annual funding for the FDA Foods Program by $204.3 million\u2014an increase of about 24% between FY2011 and FY2018\u2014largely in an effort to support FDA's implementation of FSMA. The enacted FY2018 appropriation for FDA's Foods Program provided $1,041.6 million. Currently, FDA funding for its food safety oversight activities is roughly similar to those of FSIS (Figure 1). FDA's total budget for food safety programs and activities extends beyond the agency's Foods Program, encompassing other food and veterinary medicine programs at FDA. Food-safety-related activities at FSIS include continuous inspections at federal meat and poultry plants. The enacted FY2018 appropriation provided $1,056.8 million to carry out this function. Compared to FY2011\u2014the year FSMA was enacted\u2014annual congressional appropriations for FSIS have increased by $48.3 million (+5%). For FY2019, congressional appropriators would increase funding for federal food safety activities, whereas the Administration's budget proposal would reduce food safety funding below FY2018 levels at both FDA and FSIS."
