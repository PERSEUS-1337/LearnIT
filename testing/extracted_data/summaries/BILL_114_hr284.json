    "content": "Medicare DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Improvement Act of 2015 Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act with respect to the Medicare durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) competitive acquisition program. Prohibits an entity from submitting a bid for a competitive acquisition area, during calendar 2017-2019, unless it has obtained a bid surety bond of between $50,000 and $100,000 for each such area. Requires the forfeit of any bid bond submitted for a competitive acquisition area if the bidding entity does not accept a contract offered for any product category when its composite bid was at or below the median composite bid rate for all bidding entities included in the calculation of the single payment amounts for the product category and the area. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to collect on the forfeited bond. Requires return of a bid bond within a specified 90-day period to a bidding entity that does not meet such bid forfeiture conditions. Prohibits the Secretary from awarding a contract to any entity that does not meet state licensure requirements. Directs the Government Accountability Office to study the effect of this bid surety bond requirement on the participation of small suppliers in the Medicare DMEPOS competitive acquisition program."
