These requirements include the completion of designated coursework in grades 9 to 12, inclusive. The coursework requirements include, among others, the completion of one course in visual or performing arts, foreign language, or, commencing with the 2012\u201313 school year and continuing until the end of the 2016\u201317 school year on July 1, 2017, or until the occurrence of a specified event relating to career technical education requirements of the University of California and the California State University, whichever occurs earlier, career technical education, as specified.
