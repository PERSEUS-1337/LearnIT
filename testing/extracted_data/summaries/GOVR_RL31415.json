    "content": "The relationship of military readiness activities of the Department of Defense (DOD) to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) and to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was the subject oflegislative proposals in the 107th Congress and again in the 108th. P.L. 107-314 was silent as to ESA issues, but does contain MBTA provisions. Section 315 of that act directs that regulations be developed to exempt the Armed Forces from MBTA penalties forthe incidental taking of migratory birds during military readiness activities. Until such regulationsare finalized, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 315 provides that the prohibitions of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act do not apply tothe incidental taking of migratory birds by a member of the Armed Forces during military readinessactivities, but the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, is tominimize and mitigate, to the extent practicable, adverse impacts of the readiness activities onaffected migratory birds. Proposed regulations were published on June 2, 2004 that would exemptDOD military readiness activities and those of the Coast Guard in the Department of HomelandSecurity from MBTA penalties, but this authorization can be withdrawn or suspended under certaincircumstances. Under the ESA, the Secretary of the Interior (and in some circumstances the Secretary of Commerce) can designate \"critical habitat\" after taking into account economic or \"any relevantimpacts.\" P.L. 108-136 , the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, precludesdesignation of critical habitat on DOD lands \"subject to\" an Integrated Natural ResourcesManagement Plan (INRMP) prepared under the Sikes Act if the Secretary determines in writing thatthe plan provides a benefit to the species for which critical habitat is proposed for designation. Also,consideration of impacts on national security must now be considered when critical habitat isdesignated. Agency compliance with the consultation and prohibition sections of the ESA isretained. This report provides background on the provisions and statutes involved and will be updated as circumstances warrant."
