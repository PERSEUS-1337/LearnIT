    "content": "This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to eliminate the funding mechanism for the transitional reinsurance program. Currently, issuers of individual, group, and self-funded plans are required to pay a fee in 2014, 2015, and 2016 to fund the three-year transitional reinsurance program. Under the transitional reinsurance program, non-grandfathered individual market plans that enroll high-cost individuals are eligible for reinsurance payments. This bill eliminates the requirement for issuers to pay a fee in 2015 and 2016. Instead, it authorizes appropriations for the program. This bill also requires the Government Accountability Office to audit 2014 expenditures under the transitional reinsurance program."
