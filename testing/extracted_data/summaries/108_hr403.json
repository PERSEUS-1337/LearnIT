    "content": "Child Support Reserve Trust Act - Amends part D of title IV of the Social Security Act to require a State plan for child and spousal support to provide that, as of January 1, 2001, the State agency will have in effect a State reserve trust system that requires: (1) the use of certain procedures. And (2) establishes a State reserve trust unit to implement them. Requires a State reserve unit to: (1) withhold the net proceeds from the sale or refinancing of real property in the State against which a lien exists for overdue child support by the seller or refinancer, without regard to whether such lien has ever been extinguished. (2) hold a certain amount of such proceeds in trust for the benefit of the child or children for whom the person has a support obligation. And (3) apply such amounts to satisfy such overdue child support, if all other available remedies are insufficient to do so."
