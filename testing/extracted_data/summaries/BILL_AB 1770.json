    "title": "AB 1770",
    "content": "Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to establish the Food Assistance Program for certain immigrants residing in this state, including, among others, a battered immigrant spouse or a Cuban or Haitian entrant, as described in specified provisions of federal law. This bill would provide that a noncitizen is eligible for aid under the Food Assistance Program if he or she is lawfully present in the United States. To the extent this bill would expand eligibility for the Food Assistance Program, which is administered by the counties, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
