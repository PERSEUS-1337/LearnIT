    "content": "Due to the success of deep learning to solving a variety of challenging machine learning tasks, there is a rising interest in understanding loss functions for training neural networks from a theoretical aspect. Particularly, the properties of critical points and the landscape around them are of importance to determine the convergence performance of optimization algorithms. In this paper, we provide a necessary and sufficient characterization of the analytical forms for the critical points (as well as global minimizers) of the square loss functions for linear neural networks. We show that the analytical forms of the critical points characterize the values of the corresponding loss functions as well as the necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve global minimum. Furthermore, we exploit the analytical forms of the critical points to characterize the landscape properties for the loss functions of linear neural networks and shallow ReLU networks. One particular conclusion is that: While the loss function of linear networks has no spurious local minimum, the loss function of one-hidden-layer nonlinear networks with ReLU activation function does have local minimum that is not global minimum. In the past decade, deep neural networks BID8 have become a popular tool that has successfully solved many challenging tasks in a variety of areas such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and natural language processing, etc. As the understandings of deep neural networks from different aspects are mostly based on empirical studies, there is a rising need and interest to develop understandings of neural networks from theoretical aspects such as generalization error, representation power, and landscape (also referred to as geometry) properties, etc. In particular, the landscape properties of loss functions (that are typically nonconex for neural networks) play a central role to determine the iteration path and convergence performance of optimization algorithms.One major landscape property is the nature of critical points, which can possibly be global minima, local minima, saddle points. There have been intensive efforts in the past into understanding such an issue for various neural networks. For example, it has been shown that every local minimum of the loss function is also a global minimum for shallow linear networks under the autoencoder setting and invertibility assumptions BID1 and for deep linear networks BID11 ; BID14 ; Yun et al. (2017) respectively under different assumptions. The conditions on the equivalence between local minimum or critical point and global minimum has also been established for various nonlinear neural networks Yu & Chen (1995) ; BID9 ; BID15 ; BID17 ; BID6 under respective assumptions.However, most previous studies did not provide characterization of analytical forms for critical points of loss functions for neural networks with only very few exceptions. In BID1 , the authors provided an analytical form for the critical points of the square loss function of shallow linear networks under certain conditions. Such an analytical form further helps to establish the landscape properties around the critical points. Further in BID13 , the authors characterized certain sufficient form of critical points for the square loss function of matrix factorization problems and deep linear networks.The focus of this paper is on characterizing the sufficient and necessary forms of critical points for broader scenarios, i.e., shallow and deep linear networks with no assumptions on data matrices and network dimensions, and shallow ReLU networks over certain parameter space. In particular, such analytical forms of critical points capture the corresponding loss function values and the necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve global minimum. This further enables us to establish new landscape properties around these critical points for the loss function of these networks under general settings, and provides alternative (yet simpler and more intuitive) proofs for existing understanding of the landscape properties.OUR CONTRIBUTION 1) For the square loss function of linear networks with one hidden layer, we provide a full (necessary and sufficient) characterization of the analytical forms for its critical points and global minimizers. These results generalize the characterization in BID1 to arbitrary network parameter dimensions and any data matrices. Such a generalization further enables us to establish the landscape property, i.e., every local minimum is also a global minimum and all other critical points are saddle points, under no assumptions on parameter dimensions and data matrices. From a technical standpoint, we exploit the analytical forms of critical points to provide a new proof for characterizing the landscape around the critical points under full relaxation of assumptions, where the corresponding approaches in BID1 are not applicable. As a special case of linear networks, the matrix factorization problem satisfies all these landscape properties.2) For the square loss function of deep linear networks, we establish a full (necessary and sufficient) characterization of the analytical forms for its critical points and global minimizers. Such characterizations are new and have not been established in the existing art. Furthermore, such analytical form divides the set of non-global-minimum critical points into different categories. We identify the directions along which the loss function value decreases for two categories of the critical points, for which our result directly implies the equivalence between the local minimum and the global minimum. For these cases, our proof generalizes the result in BID11 under no assumptions on the network parameter dimensions and data matrices.3) For the square loss function of one-hidden-layer nonlinear neural networks with ReLU activation function, we provide a full characterization of both the existence and the analytical forms of the critical points in certain types of regions in the parameter space. Particularly, in the case where there is one hidden unit, our results fully characterize the existence and the analytical forms of the critical points in the entire parameter space. Such characterization were not provided in previous work on nonlinear neural networks. Moreover, we apply our results to a concrete example to demonstrate that both local minimum that is not a global minimum and local maximum do exist in such a case. In this paper, we provide full characterization of the analytical forms of the critical points for the square loss function of three types of neural networks, namely, shallow linear networks, deep linear networks, and shallow ReLU nonlinear networks. We show that such analytical forms of the critical points have direct implications on the values of the corresponding loss functions, achievement of global minimum, and various landscape properties around these critical points. As a consequence, the loss function for linear networks has no spurious local minimum, while such point does exist for nonlinear networks with ReLU activation. In the future, it is interesting to further explore nonlinear neural networks. In particular, we wish to characterize the analytical form of critical points for deep nonlinear networks and over the full parameter space. Such results will further facilitate the understanding of the landscape properties around these critical points."
