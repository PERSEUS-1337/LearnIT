    "content": "Safety and Fuel Economy (SAFE) Act - Amends Federal transportation law to direct the Secretary of Transportation to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to prescribe a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard to improve the crash safety of automobiles and light trucks in collisions. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations that require motor vehicle manufacturers to disclose CRAGG index ratings to purchasers of new motor vehicles after model year 2005. Establishes the CRAGG index as one that: (1) measures a motor vehicle's aggressivity, (2) takes into account its stiffness, structure height, and mass. And (3) substantially improves the present crash safety of automobiles and light trucks by reducing their aggressivity. Defines aggressivity as the degree to which the front of a motor vehicle in a collision with another motor vehicle inflicts damage to the other vehicle and causes injury to its occupants. Sets forth average fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles and light trucks manufactured after model years 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2011."
