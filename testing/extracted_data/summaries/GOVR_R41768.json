    "content": "Two important components of access to mental health and substance use disorder services are their insurance coverage and the terms under which they are covered. Federal mental health parity law addresses the terms under which mental health and substance use disorder services are covered in comparison with medical and surgical services in those plans that choose to offer coverage of these services. Federal law requires parity in annual and aggregate lifetime limits, treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network covered benefits. However, federal parity law does not mandate the coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA, P.L. 111-148), as amended, contains provisions that address both the coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services and the terms under which these services are covered. Specifically, the ACA includes provisions that require (1) compliance with federal parity law by certain plans and (2) the coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services by certain plans. The ACA does not change the federal mental health requirements at all. However, it extends applicability of these requirements to three new plan types: (1) Qualified Health Plans (QHPs, offered through the state Exchanges); (2) plans offered through the individual market; and (3) Medicaid benchmark and benchmark equivalent plans that are not managed care plans. The ACA also requires certain plans to offer coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services, by requiring these plan types to cover the Essential Health Benefits (EHB), which are defined to include mental health and substance use disorder services. The ACA requires coverage of the EHB, and therefore at least some mental health and substance use disorder services, by the following plan types: (1) QHPs; (2) new plans offered through the individual or small group market; and (3) Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans."
