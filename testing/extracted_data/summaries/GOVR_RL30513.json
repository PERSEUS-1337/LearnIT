The Administration's proposed budget includes $ 445 million in federal payments and assistance tothe District of Columbia. On March 13, 2000, D.C. Mayor Anthony Williams submitted hisproposed budget for FY2001. The proposed budget included $4.7 billion in general fundexpenditures and $695 million in enterprise funds. The District of Columbia Financial Responsibilityand Management Assistance Authority (Authority), on June 7, 2000, approved a budget compromisereached by the city council and the mayor, which includes $137 million more in funding for publiceducation than appropriated for FY2000, and $47 million more than requested by the mayor. Inaddition, the city's budget appropriates $214.6 million for economic development, which is $24million more than appropriated in FY2000, and $197.8 million for governmental support activities,which is $62.0 million more than appropriated in FY2000. The District budget, which must be approved by Congress, requests $445 million in special federal payments. On September 27, 2000, the Senate completed action on its version of theDistrict's Appropriations Act for FY2001, H.R. 4942 (previously S. 3041 ) , which includes $445 million in special federal payments. On September 14, 2000, the Housepassed its version of the District's appropriation bill, H.R. 4942 , which includes $414million in special federal payments to the District. On October 26, 2000, the House approved aconference version of H.R. 4942 , which included appropriations for the Departmentsof Commerce, Justice, and State. The conference bill includes $448 million in special paymentsto the District. Earlier this year District residents approved by referendum an amendment to the District's home rule charter that restructures the city's Board of Education. The charter amendment reconfigures theschool board from an 11 member panel with eight members elected by ward and 3 at-large to a boardcomprising five elected members and four members appointed by the mayor. The referendum, whichwas approved by voters on June 27, 2000, will give the mayor greater influence over educationpolicy, funding, and resource allocation through his appointed members on the Board of Education. It also means the mayor assumes greater accountability for the state of the city's public schools. In addition, the council must complete its work on revising sentencing guidelines governing convicted felons as mandated by the National Capital Revitalization Act of 1997, P.L. 105-33 . The1997 Act transferred to the federal government funding responsibility for criminal justice activities. These activities account for $244.9 million (55%) of the total $445 million in requested specialfederal payments. This report will be updated to reflect the latest action affecting the District'sFY2001 appropriations. Key Policy Staff DSP= Domestic Social Policy Division, GF=Government and Finance Division"
