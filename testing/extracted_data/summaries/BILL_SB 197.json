    "title": "SB 197",
    "content": "Existing law, the California Finance Lenders Law, provides for the licensure and regulation of finance lenders by the Commissioner of Business Oversight. Existing law makes a willful violation of the law by any person a crime. Existing law defines a finance lender as any person who is engaged in the business of making consumer loans or commercial loans. Existing law defines a commercial loan as a loan of a principal amount of $5,000 or more, or any loan under an open-end credit program, whether secured by either real or personal property, or both, or unsecured, the proceeds of which are intended by the borrower for use primarily for purposes other than personal, family, or household. This bill would authorize a licensed finance lender to compensate an unlicensed person in connection with the referral, as defined, of one or more prospective borrowers to the licensee for a commercial loan if certain requirements are met. These requirements would include, among other things, that the referral leads to the consummation of a commercial loan, the loan contract provides for an annual percentage rate that does not exceed a certain percentage, the licensed finance lender obtains documentation from the prospective borrower documenting the borrower\u2019s commercial status, and that the licensee maintains records of compensation paid to an unlicensed person, as specified. The bill would make a licensee paying compensation to an unlicensed person in connection with a referral liable for any misrepresentation made to a borrower in connection with that loan made to that borrower by that licensee. The bill would authorize the commissioner to adopt regulations imposing conditions on this referral activity, as specified. The bill would also require a licensed finance lender who receives an application for a commercial loan from a prospective borrower who has been referred by an unlicensed person to provide a specified statement to the borrower regarding the referral arrangement. The bill would prohibit any person receiving compensation in connection with a referral that leads to the consummation of a commercial loan from engaging in specified acts and would authorize the commissioner to order this person to desist and refrain from engaging in the business or further violating those provisions governing such referral. By creating new requirements, the willful violation of which would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
