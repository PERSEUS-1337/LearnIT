(2) such circumstances are the result of a natural disaster, an Act of God, a pipeline or refinery equipment failure, or another unforeseeable event. And (3) it is in the public interest to grant the waiver. Permits such a waiver only if specified requirements are met. States that the Administrator shall have no authority, when considering a SIP or SIP revision regarding State controls or prohibitions on motor vehicle fuel or fuel additives, to approve any fuel: (1) if doing so would increase the total number of approved and fully implemented fuels as of September 1, 2004, in all SIPs. And (2) unless that fuel was approved and fully implemented in at least one SIP in the applicable Petroleum Administration for Defense District . Requires the Administrator and the Secretary of Energy jointly to study and report to Congress on the effects of SIPs adopted pursuant to CAA provisions regarding State controls or prohibitions on motor vehicle fuel or fuel additives."
