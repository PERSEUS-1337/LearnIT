    "content": "Amber Alerts (also referred to as AMBER plans) were created to disseminate information about child abductions in a timely manner. Research has found that most abducted children murdered by their kidnappers are killed within three hours of the abduction. Prompt response to child abductions is therefore deemed critical by many. Amber Alert plans are voluntary partnerships including law enforcement agencies, highway departments, and companies that support emergency alerts. Technologies used for alerts include the Emergency Alert System (EAS), highway message boards, telephone alert systems, the Internet, text messaging, and e-mail. All 50 states have statewide Amber Alert programs. Because kidnappers can cross state lines with their victims, the Department of Justice will often be involved in responding to an abduction. For this and other reasons, there is increased federal involvement in and support of Amber Alert plans. The National Center for Missing Adults is another example of an alert program that receives support from the U.S. Department of Justice. Amber Alert and related technologies are in place for other at-risk programs as well. For example, a number of states have created Silver Alert programs to assist in locating missing adults with cognitive impairments. Government, non-profit, and volunteer programs use alert technologies as tools to meet their larger goals. Participants choose among the tools available to them. From the perspective of technology policy, more thought might be given by the various program managers, and policy-makers in general, as to how to ensure that the development paths of these technologies mesh. Ideally program alerts should be interoperable \u2013 able to exchange information seamlessly across different systems. Planning for state and national emergency alert systems might provide gateways that would ensure access for alerts from all certified programs. Among the new systems being developed, with federal support, that could provide such gateways are the Commercial Mobile Alert System, for cell phone alerts, and new networks using Internet protocols to support 911 call center and other non-commercial communications needs."
