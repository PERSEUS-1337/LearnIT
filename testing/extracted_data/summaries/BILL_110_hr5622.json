    "content": "Veterans Timely Access to Health Care Act - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a five-year pilot program to ensure that, for each veteran seeking primary care from a participating medical facility, the standard for access to such care, determined from the date that the veteran contacts the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) seeking an appointment until a visit with a primary-care provider is completed, is 30 days. Directs the Secretary to periodically review the performance of VA health-care facilities in meeting such standards. Authorizes the Secretary to contract for health care services in non-VA facilities when the Secretary is unable to meet access standards."
