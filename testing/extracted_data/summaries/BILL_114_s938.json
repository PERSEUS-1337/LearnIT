    "content": "America Star Act This bill directs the Secretary of Labor to establish within the Department of Labor a voluntary America Star program under which the Secretary annually shall designate certain companies, based on specified performance categories, as America Star companies for their support for the US workforce. Companies are ineligible to participate in the program if they commit serious, repeated, or willful violations of specified federal labor law. The Secretary shall: (1) market the America Star program annually to the public through the Department's website, and (2) design a label for designated America Star companies to use by displaying it next to the company's logo. The Federal Trade Commission shall treat as an unfair or deceptive practice the use of a label by a company not designated as an America Star company in violation with the requirements of this Act."
