    "content": "Many see Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf as currently facing the most serious challenges to his authority since he wrested control of Pakistan's government in a 1999 coup. Set off by the March 9, 2007 suspension of the chief justice, Pakistan's citizenry has grown vocal in its objections to Musharraf. Subsequent restrictions on the media increased the outrage, and journalists have joined thousands of lawyers and social activists in the streets to demonstrate against the president and demand his resignation. Pro-government groups have countered, resulting in factional fighting and bloodshed. In addition, long hours without electricity and safe water, historically high temperatures, and natural disasters, have much of Pakistan's population of 165 million on edge. On top of this, \"Talibanization\" has spread throughout the tribal areas and into major cities. Militant mosques make demands on the government, while village groups blow up shops that sell such agents of Westernization as music CDs and movie videos. Many reporters and analysts believe the federal government has lost its command of much of the country and speculate on a post-Musharraf government. Conflicts with neighboring countries include cross-border fighting, infiltration by militants, and territorial disputes. Gunfights with foreign militants and border patrols plague Pakistan's border with Afghanistan. Spring thaws have heightened tensions with India along the Line of Control. For additional analysis, see CRS Report RL33498, Pakistan-U.S. Relations, by [author name scrubbed]. This report will be updated as warranted."
