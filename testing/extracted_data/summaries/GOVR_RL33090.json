Such declarations open the way for a wide range of federal resources to be madeavailable to assist in dealing with the emergency or major disaster involved. The Stafford Actstructure for the declaration process reflects the fact that federal resources under this act supplementstate and local resources for disaster relief and recovery. Except in the case of an emergencyinvolving a subject area that is exclusively or preeminently in the federal purview, the Governor ofan affected state, or Acting Governor if the Governor is not available, must request such adeclaration by the President. This report will review the statutory and regulatory requirementsapplicable to the affected state seeking the declaration and to the Presidential declaration, and willnote the different types of resources that may be made available in the response to the two types ofdeclarations. This report will updated as needed."
