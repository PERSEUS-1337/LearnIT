Sets constraints upon retail sales of electric power by TVA within an area assigned by law as the distributor service area. Sets forth prerequisites for a FERC certification of public convenience and necessity in connection with any proposed TVA acquisition, construction, or sales of electric generation capacity. Directs FERC to conduct an evidentiary hearing, according to specified requirements, to determine the value of TVA-owned property whose cost was incurred to provide electric service to TVA distributors and customers. Mandates filing and full disclosure of TVA documents in the same manner as is required of other public utilities. Amends the Tennessee Valley Authority Act to provide that TVA shall be deemed to be a person and not a government, for purposes of the antitrust laws . Denies TVA the power to provide any services related to construction equipment, contracting, and engineering services. Mandates that proceeds received from disposition of its used construction equipment be applied to TVA debt reduction. Revamps TVA authority to issue bonds to finance its power program so as to: (1) reduce in annual increments the total authorized amount of TVA indebtedness. (2) mandate annual TVA certification that its cumulative indebtedness is less than its bond authorization. And (3) mandate specific authority granted by an act of Congress as a precondition to TVA contracts for power sales or delivery which would have the effect of making TVA a power supply source outside the area for which it was the primary source of power as of 1957."
