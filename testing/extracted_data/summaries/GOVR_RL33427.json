    "content": "The structure of the Committees on Appropriations were changed at the beginning of the 109th Congress, altering jurisdictions over the appropriations covered in this report, including military construction, military housing allowances, military installation maintenance and operation, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other veteran-related agencies, rested in the House Committee on Appropriations with the new Subcommittee on Military Quality of Life and Veterans Affairs. In the Senate Committee on Appropriations, jurisdiction for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other veteran-related agencies were vested in the Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, while military housing allowances and military installation maintenance and operation are the responsibility of the Subcommittee on Defense. At the opening of the 110th Congress, the House subcommittee structure was again adjusted, returning some non-construction defense activities to the Subcommittee on Defense. Authorization jurisdictions lie with the two Committees on the Armed Services and Committees on Veterans Affairs. Key issues in congressional action to date include: Military Construction: The changing structure of the Army, the redeployment of troops from overseas garrisons to domestic bases, and implementation of the current BRAC round have drawn committee attention during the appropriation process. To fund the activities included in the military construction and family housing portion of this bill, the President requested $16.7 billion, the House appropriated $15.9 billion, and the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $16.3 billion. Veteran Benefits: Entitlement spending is rising as the number of beneficiaries is increasing, education benefits are being augmented, and annual cost of living adjustments are being granted. Benefits such as disability compensation, pensions, and education are mandatory payments and constitute more than half ($37.2 and $41.4 billion, respectively) of the VA appropriation of approximately $71 billion for FY2006 and almost $78 billion proposed for FY2007. Veteran Medical Care: The Administration has again requested legislative changes to increase certain co-payments and other cost sharing fees for veterans in lower priority categories. The House passed version of H.R. 5385 provides $32.7 billion for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) for FY2007, about the same amount as the President's request. On July 20, 2006, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported out of committee its version of H.R. 5385. H.R. 5385, as amended, provides $32.7 billion for VHA for FY2007, almost equivalent to the House-passed amount and the President's request. The House-passed bill and the Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bill do not include any provisions that would give VA the authority to implement fee increases."
