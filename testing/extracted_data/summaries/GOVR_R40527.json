    "content": "This report will present an overview of issues regarding the implementation of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). In addition to strengthening the regulatory and enforcement authority of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the new law established new safety standards, such as those for lead content and phthalates, and testing and certification requirements, focusing particularly on children's products. A range of implementation issues have arisen, including uncertainty about possible exemptions to and appropriate compliance with new standards, compliance with testing and certification requirements, disputes about Commission interpretation of new standards, and the particular concerns of small businesses and of non-profit resellers. For a summary of the provisions in the CPSIA, including those not described in this report, see CRS Report RL34684, Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008: P.L. 110-314, by [author name scrubbed]."
