    "content": "Assistance to Firefighters Grant Reauthorization Act of 2004 - Amends the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 to modify provisions regarding firefighter assistance to make the Administrator of the United States Fire Administration responsible for such assistance. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to volunteer emergency medical service squads and to provide assistance for firefighter safety research and development. Includes within authorized uses of grants the funding of such squads that are not affiliated with a fire department, hospital, or for-profit entity. Makes specified funds available for research to improve firefighter health and life safety. Grants priority for certain earmarked funds to organizations that focus on prevention of injuries to high risk groups from fire, as well as research programs that demonstrate the potential to improve firefighter safety. Allows the Administrator to provide assistance only if the applicant agrees to match with an equal amount of non-Federal funds 20 percent of the assistance received for any fiscal year. Modifies grant recipient limitations. Directs the Administrator to: (1) convene an annual meeting of non-Federal fire service experts to recommend criteria for awarding grants and necessary administrative changes. (2) publish each year in the Federal Register guidelines that describe the grant application process and award criteria. (3) appoint fire service personnel to conduct peer review of applications. And (4) re-conduct a study to define the current role and activities associated with fire services."
