    "content": "The Supreme Court issued its decision in Altria Group., Inc. v. Good on December 15, 2008. The Court, by a vote of 5-4, held that the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA) neither expressly nor impliedly preempted state law claims of fraud. In this decision the Court examined the preemptive effect of section 5(b) of the act (15 U.S.C. \u00a71334(b)) with regard to the claim that light or low-tar nicotine descriptors in cigarette advertising violated the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act. The decision resolved a split between the circuits\u2014the First Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled that the FCLAA did not preempt the plaintiffs' claim and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, hearing a similar case, ruled that the FCLAA preempted such state-law claims. This report provides an overview of section 5 of the FCLAA and how it was amended in 1969; additionally, it examines the previous Supreme Court cases, Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc. and Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, that interpreted the preemptive scope of section 5. Both parties in Good relied on these cases to argue that the FCLAA either preempts or does not preempt state law claims of fraud. This report also discusses the lower court decisions that were issued prior to examining the Court's decision in Good. Finally, there is a discussion of potential issues that may arise out of the Court's decision, such as its impact on future litigation and preemption jurisprudence, in addition to the effect that H.R. 1256, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, may have upon the Court's ruling."
