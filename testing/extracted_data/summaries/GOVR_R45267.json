In the United States, export health certificates are issued primarily by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) for live animals, raw fruits and vegetables, and some grain products. APHIS ensures that U.S. exporters have met animal and plant health requirements for export. Other federal agencies, not discussed here, have authority over agricultural products outside of APHIS's jurisdiction, such as oversight of processed foods and processed meats. APHIS serves as the principal U.S. scientific authority on verification of the animal and plant export health certificates when communicating with foreign governments. Animal and plant export health certificates assure foreign countries that their health requirements (e.g., disease-free livestock and plants) have been met and aim to keep diseases from crossing international borders. In FY2017, APHIS issued almost 675,000 export health certificates that helped facilitate more than $50 billion in plant and animal product exports. A major driver of the volume of agricultural exports was meeting key \"sanitary and phytosanitary\" (SPS) measures established by international organizations such as the World Trade Organization. SPS measures are the rules that governments employ to protect against diseases, pests, toxins, and other contaminants. These SPS measures are verified in animal and plant health certificates, which in turn help to facilitate agricultural trade. Failure to meet export health certificate requirements can result in shipments being rejected or delayed, resulting in additional expense to the exporter. Therefore, export health certification allows both parties to agree to mutual trade terms and in so doing facilitates agricultural trade. Congress has direct interest in export health certificates through annual appropriations for APHIS activities. The President's proposed FY2019 budget for APHIS is $742 million (including building and facility costs), down 25% from FY2018 appropriations (P.L. 115-141). This proposed reduction decreases APHIS funding for \"Safeguarding and Emergency Preparedness/Response,\" which provides technical support for both exported and imported agricultural products. In addition to facilitating U.S. agricultural exports, this item also supports APHIS enforcement of animal and/or plant health requirements that protect the United States against the unintended introduction of animal and/or plant pests and diseases. Limiting APHIS's ability to issue export health certificates could negatively impact U.S. agricultural exports. In May 2018, both the House and the Senate proposed roughly $1 billion for the APHIS FY2019 appropriations, an increase from FY2018, or roughly $260 million over the Administration's request. Potential issues for congressional oversight include preparation for animal disease outbreaks, opening export markets, and potential U.S. agricultural trade barriers. The Trump Administration has entered into, or is currently negotiating, regional and bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) that address SPS measures and export health certificates. Each importing country can have different import requirements\u2014which sometimes result in \"non-tariff measures\" (NTMs). SPS requirements by individual countries can become the source of a trade dispute and may be used by some countries as a way to protect local markets, thereby discouraging U.S. exports.
