    "content": "The federal government administers a number of programs, through multiple federal agencies, that are targeted to assisting people who are experiencing homelessness by providing housing, services, and supports. Some programs target specific populations, such as veterans and youth, while others serve all people who are homeless. Available assistance may also depend on how programs define \"homelessness.\" There is no single federal definition of homelessness. A number of programs, including those overseen by the Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Veterans Affairs (VA), Homeland Security (DHS), and Labor (DOL), use the definition enacted as part of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (P.L. 100-77), as amended. The McKinney-Vento definition largely considers someone to be homeless if they are living in a shelter, are sleeping in a place not meant to be used as a sleeping accommodation (such as on the street or in an abandoned building), or will imminently lose their housing. Definitions for several other programs, such as the Department of Education (ED), are broader, and may consider someone living in a precarious or temporary housing situation to be homeless. Programs that serve people experiencing homelessness include the Education for Homeless Children and Youths program administered by ED and the Emergency Food and Shelter program, a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) program run by DHS. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers several programs that serve homeless individuals, including Health Care for the Homeless, Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness, and the Runaway and Homeless Youth program. The Department of Justice administers a transitional housing program for victims of domestic violence. HUD administers the Homeless Assistance Grants, made up of grant programs that provide housing and services for homeless individuals ranging from emergency shelter to permanent housing. The VA operates numerous programs that serve homeless veterans. These include Health Care for Homeless Veterans, Supportive Services for Veteran Families, and the Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem program, as well as a collaborative program with HUD called HUD-VASH, through which homeless veterans receive Section 8 vouchers from HUD and supportive services through the VA. The Department of Labor also operates a program for homeless veterans, the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program. The federal government, through the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, has established a goal of ending homelessness among various populations, including families, youth, chronically homeless individuals, and veterans (the VA also has its own goal of ending veteran homelessness). Point-in-time counts of those experiencing homelessness in 2017 show overall reductions among homeless people, as well as reductions among chronically homeless individuals, people in families, and veterans compared to recent years. At the same time, however, homelessness in some parts of the country, particularly areas with high housing costs, has increased. The chart to the right shows trends in targeted federal homelessness funding, broken down by federal agency, from FY2012-FY2017."
