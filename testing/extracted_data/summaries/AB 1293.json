    "title": "An act to amend Section 19130 of the Government Code, relating to civil service.",
    "content": "The California Constitution provides that the civil service includes every officer and employee in the state except as otherwise provided in the Constitution. Existing law, the State Civil Service Act, however, permits the use of personal services contracts by state agencies if specified conditions are met. In this regard, a state agency may use a personal service contract to achieve cost savings if, among other conditions, the contract does not cause the displacement, as defined, of civil service employees. Existing law also permits the use of personal services contracts in response to particular conditions, including during emergencies, if the contract is for a new state function and the Legislature has mandated or authorized the performance of work by independent contractors, or to protect against a conflict of interest, among others. This bill would make the use of personal services contracts in response to particular conditions, as described above, conditional on the contract not causing the displacement, as defined, of civil service employees."
