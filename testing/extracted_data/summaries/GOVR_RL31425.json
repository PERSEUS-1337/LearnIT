    "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) indicates it is undertaking a major alteration in its capabilities, from a force designed to fight the Soviet Union to one tailored to 21st centuryadversaries including terrorism. This shift has been prompted by the perception of a changing threatand improved technology, especially information technology. As the military services attempt toincrease the agility and versatility of their weapon systems, they also see a need to increase thecapabilities of military intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) to support the newweapon systems and operating methods against these new threats. To judge whether service activities are likely to help the military \"transform,\" the head of DOD's Office of Force Transformation, retired Vice Admiral Arthur Cebrowski (U.S. Navy) hasproposed three criteria-whether the proposed capability can communicate and operate easily inconjunction with the other services, whether it helps the military develop new methods ofwarfighting, and whether it will be useful against a wide range of threats. In addition, ISR activitiesshould, in the aggregate, provide a world-wide perspective of the threat, \"fuse\" all types ofintelligence into one picture, access extensive details about the enemy, and monitor specific targetsfor long periods of time. All of the services are planning ISR programs which exhibit at least some attributes of transformation. Many observers believe military ISR has already achieved some transformation, asshown in the war in Afghanistan by the military's ability to detect a target and destroy it withinminutes. The military's ability to move intelligence quickly has improved dramatically. However,many observers are concerned that analysis may be lagging behind. Proposals to make revolutionarychanges in analysis include using contractors to produce competing unclassified analyses, developingartificial intelligence capabilities for database work, and establishing more operations analysiscenters. The military intelligence community is supported by the national intelligence community, which even before the September 11 attacks was under intense scrutiny. Therefore, the aspects ofthe national intelligence community's operations in which Congress has expressed interest directlyaffect the quality of military intelligence. In addition, DOD's plans for improving its ISRcapabilities raise potential issues for Congress with regard to cost, the balancing of potentiallycompeting efforts to improve the flow of intelligence and the quality of the data, and the support ofmilitary leadership. Finally, the consequences of the military's role in homeland defense, andintelligence community reform may generate concern. Discussion of these issues is provided asbackground as Congress considers ISR programs as part of defense and intelligence authorizationand appropriations legislation. This report will not be updated."
