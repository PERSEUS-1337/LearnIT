    "title": "A bill to expand child support enforcement through means other than programs financed at Federal expense.",
    "content": "Amends title III of the Social Security Act (SSA) to set as a prerequisite to certification for Federal payments that the State agency charged with administration of State law: (1) disclose the wage information contained in its records upon the request of any child support enforcement entity. And (2) require each new applicant for unemployment compensation to disclose the identity and location of the entity enforcing such applicant's child support obligations. Authorizes such State agency to require payments for its administrative costs incurred for child support obligations enforced by an entity other than a state or local child support enforcement agency. Amends SSA title IV part D to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) promote enforcement of child support obligations through activities conducted by either a private attorney or a public entity not providing services under a title IV-D plan. (2) provide access to specified enforcement remedies and resources to a State or local governmental enforcement agency not providing title IV-D enforcement services. And (3) develop registration procedures for non-title IV-D public child support enforcement agencies, and for private attorneys. Requires State plans for child and spousal support to prescribe procedures for electronic transfer or direct deposit of funds at the financial institution of the individual entitled to receive payment of child support collections or the individual's designee, without regard to whether the child support obligation is being enforced under a title IV-D plan."
