    "content": "For FY1999, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) requested total funding of approximately $43 billion, a 1% increase over the FY1998 enacted level of $39 billion. The FY1999budget request for the DOT was similar in many respects to the FY1998 appropriation. There are many \"macro\" issues or factors that are influencing the debate over the Administration's FY1999 budget request. Some of them have been carried over from the previousfiscal year. Complicating the budget process had been the delay associated with reauthorizing manyof the Department's programs. The recently concluded reauthorization of surface transportation programs will dramatically effect the FY1999 appropriations process. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century ( P.L.105-178 , TEA-21) provides for an increase in spending at a level above that contemplated in theAdministration budget request. In addition, the new legislation provides a new budget environmentfor highway and transit programs that limits the ability of the appropriations process to alter spendingfor these activities. In its FY1999 request, the Administration reiterated that safety is its highest priority, followed by technology development, environmental enhancement, infrastructure needs, and innovativefinancing. The budget proposal included requests of: $3.1 billion for direct safety funding; $30.0billion for infrastructure investments; $1.1 billion for transportation research and development(R&D); and $0.6 billion for Amtrak (See CRS Issue Brief 97030). On July 15, 1998, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 2307 ( S.Rept. 105-249 ). The committee recommended total funding of approximately $47 billion forFY1999. S. 2307 was passed by the Senate on July 24, 1998. Few amendments weremade, excepting one controversial proposal to bar the use of federal funds to impose \"project laboragreements\" on highway and transit fund projects. A compromise substitute was offered. The House Appropriations Committee reported its own bill ( H.R. 4328 , H.Rept. 105-648 ) which would have provided a total of $46.9 billion, an amount $4.8 billion greater thanFY1998 and $3.9 billion greater than the amount requested by the Administration. The committeevoiced its objections to the impact of TEA-21 legislation, whose \"firewalls\" significantly limited itslatitude in funding. According to the report, \"These 'firewalls' make it virtually impossible for theAppropriations Committee to make downward adjustments to those funding levels in the annualappropriations process over the next 5 years.\" By July 31, both the House and Senate had passed their respective bills; the House bill was referred to the Senate; the Senate substituted its own language; and the House requested a conferenceon the substitute amendment.
