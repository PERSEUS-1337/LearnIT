    "content": "This report consists of a chart of selected federal excise taxes that apply to sales of goods and services. The chart is divided into two columns. The first indicates how the taxes are imposed, and the second contains a general listing of statutory exemptions, with a special emphasis on whether there are statutory exemptions for federal agencies. This report does not cover such details as how the tax revenues are used, tax rates, effective dates, or sunset dates. The report does not cover payroll taxes such as social security, Medicare, or unemployment taxes, nor does it include excise taxes which are used to regulate tax-exempt organizations or the excise tax on greenmail. The report does not cover expired taxes, such as those known as the superfund taxes. If available, CRS Reports containing more detailed information are cited in connection with each tax mentioned."
