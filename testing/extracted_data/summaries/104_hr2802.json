Requires the administering authority to initiate a countervailing duty investigation with respect to such products.

And (2) that such determinations shall be subject to judicial review in the same manner as determinations made with respect to non-free trade area countries. Declares further that: (1) such negotiations shall not affect the rights of the United States or a free trade area country to apply its domestic antidumping and countervailing duty laws to the imports of another country. And (2) if an agreement has been entered into pursuant to such negotiations, the President shall submit implementing legislation to the Congress. Extends fast track procedures to such legislation.
