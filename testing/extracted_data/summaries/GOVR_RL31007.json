The Bush Administration requested $22.5billion for these programs for FY2002 compared with $23.6 billion appropriated in FY2001. The House bill,( H.R. 2311 ), passed on June 28, 2001,allocated $23.7 billion for these programs. The Senate approved its version of the bill July 19, 2001, with $25.0billion. The final bill appropriating $25.086billion was approved by both houses on November 1, 2001 and enacted on November 12, 2001 as P.L. 107-66 . Key issues involving Energy and Water Development appropriations programs included: authorization of appropriations for major water/ecosystem restoration initiatives for the Florida Everglades and California\"Bay-Delta\"; general provisions concerning operation of federal water projects on the Missouri River; proposed reductions in spending for solar and renewable energy; the electrometallurgical treatment of nuclear spent fuel for storage and disposal, a process that opponents contend raises nuclear proliferationconcerns; cost and management of the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in DOE's Nuclear Weapons Stewardship program; restricted funding of physical sciences research in DOE contrasted with major increases in life sciences research in the National Institutes ofHealth; and proposed higher funding for DOE's civilian nuclear waste management program as the Department nears a decision on building a wasterepository under Nevada's Yucca Mountain.
