    "title": "SB 263",
    "content": "Existing federal law, the Federal Aviation Administration Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, provides for the integration of civil unmanned aircraft systems, commonly known as drones, into the national airspace system by September 30, 2015. Existing federal law requires the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to develop and implement operational and certification requirements for the operation of public unmanned aircraft systems in the national airspace system by December 31, 2015. Existing state law generally authorizes a court to issue an order for the protection of certain persons, including, among others, the victims of domestic violence, elder and dependent adult abuse, workplace violence, and civil harassment. Under existing law, an intentional and knowing violation of those types of protective orders is a misdemeanor. If the violation results in physical injury, or occurs within specified time periods of a previous violation, existing law imposes additional penalties. Existing law also makes the crime of stalking another person, as defined, punishable as a misdemeanor or felony. Existing law makes it a felony to commit that offense when there is a temporary restraining order, injunction, or any other court order in effect prohibiting the behavior. This bill would specifically prohibit a person subject to certain protective orders, when the person is prohibited by the protective order from coming within a specified distance of another person, from operating an unmanned aircraft system in a way that causes an unmanned aircraft, as those terms are defined, to fly within the prohibited distance of the other person, or from capturing images of the other person by using an unmanned aircraft system. By creating a new crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. Existing law makes certain findings and declarations regarding fire protection of the public trust resources on lands in state responsibility areas, including that the costs of fire prevention activities aimed at reducing the effects of structures in state responsibility areas should be borne by the owners of the structures. This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to this law."
