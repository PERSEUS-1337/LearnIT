    "content": "African Elephant Conservation and Legal Ivory Possession Act of 2015 This bill revises and reauthorizes the African Elephant Conservation Act through FY2020. Raw or worked ivory may be imported or exported under that Act and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 if: (1) the ivory is for a museum. (2) the ivory was lawfully importable into the United States on February 24, 2014, regardless of when it was acquired. Or (3) the worked ivory was previously lawfully possessed in the United States. This bill authorizes: (1) commerce in African elephant ivory or in products containing African elephant ivory that have been lawfully imported or crafted in the United States. And (2) the importation of a sport-hunted African elephant trophy if the trophy was taken from certain elephants populations that at the time were not necessarily threatened with extinction, but may have become so unless trade was closely controlled. Interior may station one US Fish and Wildlife Service law enforcement officer in each African country that has a significant population of African elephants to assist local wildlife rangers in protecting the elephants and facilitating the apprehension of individuals who illegally kill them or assist in killing them. The President may embargo any products from a country if it is a significant transit or destination point for illegal ivory trade. In providing financial assistance under the African Elephant Conservation Act, Interior must prioritize projects for facilitating the acquisition of equipment and training to wildlife officials in ivory-producing countries to be used in anti-poaching efforts."
