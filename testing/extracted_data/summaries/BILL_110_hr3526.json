Requires the federal banking agencies to prescribe such regulations: (1) jointly to the extent practicable. And (2) in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Authorizes the FTC, with respect to entities within its jurisdiction, to commence a rulemaking proceeding and prescribe regulations whenever such banking agencies commence a rulemaking proceeding. Requires the FTC, whenever it commences such a rulemaking proceeding, to consult and coordinate with the federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) Board so that the regulations prescribed by each such agency are consistent with and comparable to the regulations prescribed by the agencies to the extent practicable. Instructs the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the status of regulations of the federal banking agencies and the NCUA regarding unfair and deceptive acts or practices by depository institutions."
