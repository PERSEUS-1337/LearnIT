    "title": "A bill to provide for the compilation and reporting of participation data relating to Federal rulemaking.",
    "content": "Regulatory Information Reporting Act of 2011 - Requires federal agencies, prior to publishing a final rule in the Federal Register, to submit to the Regulatory Information Service Center (RISC) of the General Services Administration (GSA) or another office within GSA as designated by the Administrator of GSA a list of all non-federal participants who provided public comments to an agency promulgating a rule. Requires such list to provide the participant's name and address, the participant's organizational affiliation, whether the participant represents an economic interest, a non-economic interest, a citizen interest, or an unknown interest, and whether any comment of the participant affected or did not affect the content of the final rule. Requires the RISC to: (1) compile and keep current such information obtained on non-federal participants in a searchable database made publicly available on the Internet, (2) make available quarterly trend and overview statistics, and (3) submit annual reports to Congress summarizing data received from agencies promulgating a rule."
