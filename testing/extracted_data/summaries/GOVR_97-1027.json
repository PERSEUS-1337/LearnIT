    "content": "Congress established the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program in 1991, authorizing the use of Defense Department funds to assist with the safe and secure transportation,storage, and dismantlement of nuclear, chemical and other weapons in the former Soviet Union. Initially, many supported U.S. assistance as an emergency response to fears about a loss of controlover nuclear weapons in the disintegrating Soviet Union. Now, many see the CTR program as a partof a more comprehensive threat reduction and nonproliferation effort. Congress has demonstrated continuing support for the CTR programs, providing between $300 million and $400 million in Defense Department funds each year between FY1992 and FY1998; andbetween $403 and $475 million each year between FY 1999 and FY2004. Congress has alsoincreased its oversight efforts and added numerous reporting requirements. Many of these changesreflected congressional concern with the slow pace of implementation during the first few years andwith the U.S. ability to account for its expenditures and progress on CTR projects. The ClintonAdministration resolved most of the issues raised during the first few years of program, but thecongressional debate over funding in recent years has revealed new concerns about the focus of someprojects in the CTR program. The Clinton Administration credited the CTR program with significant achievements in reducing threats from the former Soviet Union. Some Members of Congress disagree and believethat the CTR programs have diminished U.S. national security by subsidizing the Russian defenseestablishment. Others have argued that Clinton Administration claims of success are exaggeratedand that the programs have produced more limited results. On the other hand, some Members ofCongress believe that the program could do much more to protect the United States fromproliferation and terrorist threats. Congress added funds to the FY1997 budget to expand efforts toenhance the security of nuclear and other weapons materials in the former Soviet Union. But, inFY2000 and FY2001, it refused to authorize the use of CTR funds for the construction of a chemicalweapons dismantlement facility. Members of Congress have also questioned the Administration's spending priorities for CTR programs. Most support efforts to dismantle nuclear weapons. However, Congress has prohibitedthe use of CTR funds for defense conversion projects, environmental restoration projects, andhousing for retired officers, and, beginning in FY2000, in prohibited their use for the elimination ofconventional weapons. Some Members of Congress have also argued that U.S. assistance to Russiashould be linked to a number of areas of Russian military and foreign policy. Others, however, haveargued that efforts to link CTR assistance to a wider range of Russian activities would backfire, withRussia forgoing the assistance and retaining its nuclear weapons while continuing the policies thatbrought U.S. objections. These issues were discussed at length during the House debate on FY1997funding, but they were not included in the final legislation. In recent years, Congress has approvedalmost all of the Administration's request for CTR funding, but it continues to express concernsabout the focus of some CTR projects."
