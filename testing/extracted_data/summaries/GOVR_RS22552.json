    "content": "A number of issues of interest to U.S. agriculture are expected to be addressed by the 110th Congress. At the top of the agenda, Congress will be considering the unfinished business of FY2007 funding levels for U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs and activities in the annual agriculture appropriations bill. Separately, attempts might be made to reconsider a multi-billion dollar emergency farm disaster assistance package that was debated but not passed in the 109th Congress. Since most provisions of the current omnibus farm bill expire in 2007, the 110th Congress will be making decisions about the content of a new farm bill. Commodity price and income support policy is usually the focus of a farm bill, but other agricultural issues, such as conservation, rural development, trade, and biofuels also will be debated. Other agricultural issues likely to be either considered or monitored by the 110th Congress include multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations; concerns about agroterrorism, food safety, and animal and plant diseases; federal energy policy; agricultural marketing matters; the reauthorization of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and farm labor issues. This report will be updated as significant developments ensue."
