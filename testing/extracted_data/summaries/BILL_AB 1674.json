    "title": "AB 1674",
    "content": "Existing law, subject to exceptions, prohibits a person from making more than one application to purchase a handgun within any 30-day period. Violation of that prohibition is a crime. Existing law exempts from that prohibition a firearms transaction where neither of the parties is a firearms dealer if the transaction is completed through a dealer. Existing law prohibits a firearms dealer from delivering a handgun to a person whenever the dealer is notified by the Department of Justice that within the preceding 30-day period the purchaser has made another application to purchase a handgun that does not fall within an exception to the 30-day prohibition. A violation of that delivery prohibition by the dealer is a crime. This bill would make the 30-day prohibition and the dealer delivery prohibition described above applicable to all types of firearms. The bill would delete the private party transaction exemption to the 30-day prohibition and instead would exempt from that prohibition the transfer of a firearm conducted through a licensed firearms dealer if the firearm is being transferred by bequest or intestate succession, the purchase of a firearm that is not a handgun or a finished frame or receiver by a licensed hunter, and the purchase of a firearm from a nonprofit entity conducting an auction or similar event, as specified. The bill would make additional conforming changes and technical, nonsubstantive changes. By expanding the scope of existing crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. This bill would incorporate changes to Sections 26835 and 27535 of the Penal Code proposed by both this bill and SB 894, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
