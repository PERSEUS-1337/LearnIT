    "content": "Child Support Reform Amendments Act of 1994 - Amends Federal law to require a Federal agency to comply with a child support enforcement order by garnishing an employee's pay upon receipt of legal process. Amends Federal law with respect to specified retirement funds to authorize an individual owed a child support arrearage to attach such funds without the requirement of a second separate order if the relevant State provides notice and expedited hearings procedures. Conditions Federal benefits and employment to an individual who is more than three months in arrears for child support upon such individual's compliance with a plan to pay the arrearage. Instructs the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to assess the feasibility of denying Federal benefits and employment to persons with child support arrears exceeding three months. Authorizes the Secretary of State to refuse, revoke, restrict, or limit a passport with respect to a noncustodial parent who is the subject of an outstanding State arrest warrant for nonpayment of child support where the amount in controversy is at least $10,000."
