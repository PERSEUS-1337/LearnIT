    "content": "Energy Efficient Manufactured Home Act of 2015 This bill authorizes the Department of Housing and Urban Development to carry out a program to provide grants and loans to assist low-income owners of manufactured homes constructed before December 31, 1994, in decommissioning their dated homes and replacing them with Energy Star-qualified manufactured or modular homes. Grants or loans may be made only to a low-income owner of a dated manufactured home who has used that home as a primary residence on a year-round basis for at least the preceding 24 months. Each household may only receive one grant or loan under the program. The bill sets forth requirements with respect to: (1) ownership of the land on which the new manufactured or modular home is to be sited, and (2) the decommissioning of a dated home."
