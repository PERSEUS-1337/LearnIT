    "content": "Health Care Choice Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to provide that the laws of the primary State apply to individual health insurance coverage offered by that issuer both in the primary State and in any secondary State. Exempts health insurance issuers from any State law or regulation that would: (1) regulate the operation of the health insurance issuer in the secondary State, except for certain activities, including paying taxes and registering with the State insurance commissioner. (2) require any individual health insurance coverage issued by the issuer to be countersigned by an agent or broker residing in the secondary State. Or (3) discriminate against the issuer issuing insurance in both primary and secondary States. Allows States to require brokers to obtain a license from that State, but not to impose any requirements that discriminate against nonresident brokers. Requires health insurance issuers offering coverage in more than one State to submit to the insurance commissioner of each State a copy of a plan of operation or a feasibility study, written notice of any change in designation of its primary State, and an annual financial statement. Declares that this Act does not affect the authority of Federal or State courts to enjoin the sale of health insurance coverage to any person or group who is not eligible for such insurance or by a health insurance issuer that is in hazardous financial conditions. Sets forth requirements for primary States. Gives sole jurisdiction to primary States to enforce the covered laws in primary and secondary States. Sets forth procedures for resolving disputes."
