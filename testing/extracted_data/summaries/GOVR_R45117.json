The forecast decline in 2018 net farm income is the result of a small increase in gross returns (up $5.8 billion or +1.3%)\u2014including the initial tranche of payments under the trade aid package announced by USDA in July 2018\u2014offset by higher production expenses (up $14.9 billion or +4.2%). Net farm income is calculated on an accrual basis. Net cash income (calculated on a cash-flow basis) is also projected lower in 2018 (-8%) to $93.4 billion. The 2018 net farm income forecast is substantially below the 10-year average of $86.9 billion (in nominal dollars)\u2014primarily the result of the outlook for continued weak prices for most major crops. Commodity prices are under pressure from a record soybean and near-record corn harvest and from diminished export prospects due to an ongoing trade dispute with China. U.S. farm income experienced a golden period during 2011 through 2014 due to strong commodity prices and robust agricultural exports. Most crops and livestock product prices remain significantly below the average for 2011-2014, when prices for many major commodities attained record or near-record highs. Net farm income is projected down 46% since its record high of $123.7 billion in 2013. Net cash income is projected down 31% from its 2013 high of $135.6 billion. Farm-sector production expenses have risen 2.5% over that same period, thus contributing to lower aggregate income totals. Government payments are projected up nearly 18% from 2017 at $13.6 billion\u2014the highest total since 2006 and due largely to market facilitation payments by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) of approximately $4.6 billion in response to the U.S.-China trade dispute. Ad hoc disaster assistance and crop insurance indemnity payments were also larger in 2018. Since 2008, U.S. agricultural exports have accounted for a 20% share of U.S. farm and manufactured or processed agricultural sales. In 2018 total agricultural exports are forecast up 2% at $143.4 billion. However, abundant supplies in international markets, strong competition from major foreign competitors, and the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute are expected to shift trade patterns and diminish U.S. export prospects in 2019. In spite of the lower farm income outlook, farm wealth is projected up 1.4% from 2017 to $3.0 trillion. Farm asset values reflect farm investors' and lenders' expectations about long-term profitability of farm sector investments. Farmland values are projected up 1.9% in 2018 following a 2.3% rise in 2017. Because they comprise such a significant portion of the U.S. farm sector's asset base (81%), change in farmland values is a critical barometer of the farm sector's financial performance. At the farm household level, average farm household incomes have been well above average U.S. household incomes since the late 1990s. However, that advantage has narrowed in recent years. In 2014, the average farm household income (including off-farm income sources) was about 77% higher than the average U.S. household income. In 2017 (the last year with comparable data), that advantage is expected to decline to 27%. The outlook for lower net farm income and relatively weak prices for most major program crops signals the likelihood of continued relatively lean times ahead. The U.S. agricultural sector's well-being remains dependent on continued growth in domestic and foreign demand to sustain prices at current modest levels. In addition to commodity prices, the financial picture for the agricultural sector as a whole heading into 2019 will hinge on both domestic and international macroeconomic factors, including interest rates, economic growth, and consumer demand. This report incorporates USDA's November 30, 2018, farm income projections and its November 29, 2018, U.S. agricultural trade outlook update."
