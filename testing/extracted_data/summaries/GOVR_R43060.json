    "content": "Many agree that the U.S. tax system is in need of reform. Congress continues to explore ways to make the U.S. tax system simpler, fairer, and more efficient. Identifying and enacting policies that will result in a simpler, fairer, and more efficient tax system remains a challenge. On December 10, 2014, the chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means introduced a comprehensive tax reform proposal, the Tax Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 1). The bill proposed substantial changes to both the individual and corporate income tax systems, reducing statutory tax rates for many taxpayers, while repealing dozens of credits, deductions, and other tax preferences. While no further action was taken on H.R. 1 in the 113th Congress, the proposal continues to inform the ongoing tax reform debate. There are various policy options for achieving comprehensive tax reform. One option is a base-broadening, rate-reducing tax reform, in the spirit of the Tax Reform Act of 2014. An alternative approach would be to substantially revise or eliminate the current tax system, instead relying on an alternative tax base for revenues. Tax reform legislation introduced early in the 114th Congress has tended to take the latter approach, proposing a retail sales tax at the federal level or a flat tax. Similar proposals were introduced in the 112th and 113th Congresses, and did not advance. A cash flow tax for businesses has also been introduced in the 114th Congress. Both Congress and the Administration have indicated interest in tax reform through their respective budget processes. The budget resolution for FY2016 (S.Con.Res. 11) communicates congressional support for action on tax reform. The President's FY2017 budget proposes a number of tax policy changes, similar to the President's FY2016 budget, including substantial changes in the international tax system. The prevailing framework for evaluating tax policy considers equity (or fairness), efficiency, and simplicity. Equity examines the distribution of the tax burden across different groups. This information can then be used to assess the \"fairness\" of the tax system. A tax system that is economically efficient generally provides neutral treatment, minimizing economic distortions and maximizing output. A tax system that is simple reduces administrative and compliance costs while also promoting transparency. Oftentimes, there are trade-offs to be considered when evaluating tax policy options. For example, shifting toward a consumption tax might enhance economic efficiency. However, taxing consumption rather than income tends to put an increased tax burden on lower-income taxpayers relative to higher-income taxpayers, reducing the progressivity of the tax system. Policymakers may want to consider the trade-off between equity and efficiency when evaluating tax policy options."
