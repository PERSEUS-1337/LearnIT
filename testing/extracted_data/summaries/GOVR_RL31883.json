    "content": "Troubled by reported lapses in security and counterintelligence (CI) at the Department ofEnergy (DOE), the Congress in 1999 established a semi-autonomous agency -- the National NuclearSecurity Administration (NNSA) -- to oversee DOE's national security-related programs ( P.L.106-65 ). Within NNSA, Congress created the Office of Defense Nuclear Counterintelligence to implement CI policy at NNSA facilities. DOE retained a separate Office of Counterintelligence,which develops CI policy for DOE and NNSA, but, implements it only at non-NNSA facilities. Though representing separate organizations, the two CI offices share resources and personnel forsome programs. Although DOE has taken steps to strengthen CI practices, some observers havequestioned whether the Department's bifurcated CI structure is the most effective in counteringcontinuing efforts by foreign intelligence services, friendly and hostile, to target DOE and NNSAfacilities. Several organizational approaches have been discussed, including the following. One approach is to maintain the status quo. Proponents suggest that the current structureis necessary if CI is to receive the attention it warrants. Opponents counter that dual offices lead toinefficiencies that could undermine CI effectiveness. Under a second approach, DOE and NNSA CI programs could be completely separated. Proponents suggest that this approach would establish clearer lines of authority. Opponents counterthat this arrangement would produce chaos at the field level and lead to coordination andcommunication problems. A third approach would be to give NNSA authority to implement all CI programming, whilepreserving for DOE all CI policymaking responsibility. Proponents suggest that doing so wouldresult in integrated and coordinated CI operational activity. Opponents counter that this approachstill would leave in place two separate CI offices and lead to continuing confusion over roles andmission. Finally, Congress could consolidate the two CI programs, either under the direct control ofthe Energy Secretary, or under the supervision of the NNSA administrator. Proponents of DOEcontrol assert that the importance of CI argues for a consolidated office that answers directly to theDOE Secretary. Opponents contend consolidation within DOE would contravene Congress's intentto maximize NNSA autonomy in all areas, including CI, because of DOE's perceived deeply rootedanti-security culture. They recommend that all CI programs be consolidated, but under the NNSAAdministrator rather than the Energy Secretary. Former DOE Secretary Spencer Abraham proposed consolidating the two CI programs intoa single office reporting directly to the Energy Secretary. Congress, however, continues to supportthe bifurcated program. Energy Secretary Samuel W. Bodman is reviewing various legislativeproposals, including one that would consolidate the two CI programs under DOE control. Thisreport will be updated as warranted."
