    "content": "The anthrax mailings of 2001 increased public and governmental awareness of the threat ofterrorism using biological weapons. The federal response to this threat includes increases incountermeasure research funding, greater investment in public health infrastructure, and greaterpreparation of first responders who might be the first to encounter such weapons in an event. Thenew Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made preparation against biological weaponattack a priority and deployed the BioWatch Program to provide early warning of a mass pathogenrelease. The BioWatch Program uses a series of pathogen detectors co-located with EnvironmentalProtection Agency air quality monitors. These detectors collect airborne particles onto filters, whichare subsequently transported to laboratories for analysis. It is expected that this system will provideearly warning of a pathogen release, alerting authorities before victims begin to show symptoms andproviding the opportunity to deliver treatments earlier, decreasing illness and death. The BioWatch Program, funded and overseen by DHS, has three main elements eachcoordinated by different agencies, sampling, analysis, and response. The Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) maintains the sampling component, the sensors that collect airborne particles. TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) coordinates analysis, the laboratory testing of thesamples, though testing is actually carried out in state and local public health laboratories. Localjurisdictions are responsible for the public health response to positive findings. The Federal Bureauof Investigation (FBI) is designated as the lead agency for the law enforcement response if abioterrorism event is detected. The BioWatch Program has raised concerns in some quarters, withquestions about its general effectiveness, the siting of pathogen detectors, the reliability of its results,its cost and workforce requirements, and the ability of public health officials to respond to BioWatchresults. Efforts to develop integrated response plans, lower the system cost, and developcomplementary and next-generation systems continue. Some aspects of the BioWatch Program may be of particular interest to policymakers. Forexample, Congress may be interested in whether these types of detection systems can substitute foror supplement other mechanisms in protecting the general populace; whether this detection systemwas implemented optimally; how the success of this system is to be evaluated; whether theimplementation, operational, and expansion costs for the BioWatch Program make it a cost-effectivefederal investment; and how to optimize and streamline performance in the future. Since theBioWatch Program is a federal program implemented using state infrastructure, Congress may wishto examine how this new program coordinates with already existing public health andcounterterrorism programs, as well as consider the roles and responsibilities of the federalgovernment and coordination with state governments in an actual bioterrorism event."
