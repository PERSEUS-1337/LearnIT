    "content": "Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require food that is not a raw agricultural commodity, and that is, or intentionally bears or contains, a major food allergen, to state that information on its label by January 1, 2006. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to give priority to increasing the number of inspections under the Act to ensure that foods comply with practices to reduce or eliminate cross-contact with major food allergen residues and to ensure that major food allergens are properly labeled on foods. Requires the Secretary, through the National Institutes of Health, to convene a panel of nationally recognized experts to review basic and clinical research efforts related to food allergies and to develop a plan for expanding, intensifying, and coordinating such research. Directs the Secretary, in the Conference for Food Protection, as part of its cooperative activities between the States under the Public Health Service Act, to pursue certain revisions of the Food Code to provide guidelines for preparing allergen-free foods in food establishments. Requires the Secretary to include assistance relating to the use of different modes of treatment for and prevention of allergic responses to foods when providing technical assistance relating to trauma care and emergency medical services under the Public Health Service Act."
