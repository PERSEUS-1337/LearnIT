    "title": "An act to amend Section 3003.5 of, and to add Section 3003.51 to, the Penal Code, relating to sex offenders, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately.",
    "content": "Existing law, as amended by Proposition 83 at the November 7, 2006, statewide general election, prohibits any person who is required to register pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act from residing within 2,000 feet of any public or private school, or park where children regularly gather. This bill would require that the 2,000-foot residency restriction be measured by the shortest practical pedestrian or vehicle path. The bill would limit the residency restriction to persons convicted of specified offenses. The bill would clarify that the state parole authority shall enforce the residency restriction except under specified conditions. The bill would permit a person who is subject to the residency restriction to petition the superior court of the county within which he or she resides for relief from the requirement. The bill would provide that original jurisdiction for the petition would lie with the appellate division of the superior court in which the petition is filed. The bill would require the petitioner to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a pervasive lack of compliant housing in the county, that the petitioner is among a substantial proportion of sex offenders subject to the residency restriction who are unable to find compliant housing, and that the housing restriction is the principal reason that those without a residence have been unable to find housing. The bill would allow relief to modify the residential distance restrictions if that relief is narrowly crafted, and would allow the court to bifurcate the application of residency restrictions so as to apply discrete restrictions to those who have been convicted of child molestation or other felony sex offenses involving victims under 18 years of age. The bill would prohibit a subsequent petition from being heard if relief is granted or denied, unless the petitioner establishes in the petition, to the satisfaction of the court, that circumstances regarding compliant housing have changed, as provided. Proposition 83 permits the Legislature, by a vote of 23 of the membership of each house and in accordance with specified procedures, to amend the provisions of the act. By amending Proposition 83, this bill would require a 23 vote. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."
