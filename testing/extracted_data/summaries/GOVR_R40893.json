    "content": "The authorization of the Museum and Library Services Act expired with FY2009. Its reauthorization may be considered by the 111th Congress. It was last reauthorized by P.L. 108-81, the Museum and Library Services Act of 2003 (MLSA), signed into law on September 25, 2003. MLSA authorizes funding for Library Services and Technology (LST) and for Museum Services. MLSA is administered by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). P.L. 108-81 authorized $232 million for LST in FY2004, and such sums as may be necessary for FY2005-FY2009. It authorized $38.6 million for Museum Services in FY2004, and such sums as may be necessary for FY2005-FY2009. The bulk of LST funding is distributed to states via formula grants. Funding is also provided for library services for Native Americans and for national activities. Participating states are required to develop five-year plans that set goals and priorities consistent with LST purposes (i.e., to enhance information-sharing networks and target library services to disadvantaged populations). The plans must provide for independent evaluations of federally assisted library services. A wide variety of types of libraries\u2014public, public school, college or university, research (if they provide public access to their collections), and (at state discretion) private libraries\u2014may receive LST aid. P.L. 108-81 provided for an increase in initial state grants for LST from $340,000 to $680,000 if the amount appropriated for a year, and available for state grants, exceeds the amount of grants to all states in FY2003. In addition, initial grants for outlying areas were increased to $60,000 if appropriations in a given year are sufficient to meet the higher initial state grant of $680,000. FY2009 was the first year appropriations were sufficient to trigger the higher initial state grant amounts authorized by P.L. 108-81. Funding for Museum Services is administered by IMLS, Office of Museum Services (OMS), through competitive grant programs and cooperative agreements. Funding is used by museums to pay the federal share of the cost of museum services (i.e., not more than 50%). Under Museum Services, the OMS currently administers five grant programs (Museums for America, Museum Professionals for the 21st Century, Conservation Project Support, Native American and Native Hawaiian Museum Services, and National Leadership Grants for Museums) and two cooperative agreements (Museum Assessment Program and Conservation Assessment Program). The OMS also administers a related program, the African American Museum Services program, authorized separately through the African American History and Culture Act (P.L. 108-184). This report will be updated in response to legislative developments."
