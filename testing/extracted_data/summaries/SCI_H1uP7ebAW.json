    "content": "The field of medical diagnostics contains a wealth of challenges which closely resemble classical machine learning problems; practical constraints, however, complicate the translation of these endpoints naively into classical architectures. Many tasks in radiology, for example, are largely problems of multi-label classification wherein medical images are interpreted to indicate multiple present or suspected pathologies. Clinical settings drive the necessity for high accuracy simultaneously across a multitude of pathological outcomes and greatly limit the utility of tools which consider only a subset. This issue is exacerbated by a general scarcity of training data and maximizes the need to extract clinically relevant features from available samples -- ideally without the use of pre-trained models which may carry forward undesirable biases from tangentially related tasks. We present and evaluate a partial solution to these constraints in using LSTMs to leverage interdependencies among target labels in predicting 14 pathologic patterns from chest x-rays and establish state of the art results on the largest publicly available chest x-ray dataset from the NIH without pre-training. Furthermore, we propose and discuss alternative evaluation metrics and their relevance in clinical practice. Medical diagnostics have increasingly become a more interesting and viable endpoint for machine learning. A general scarcity of publicly available medical data, however, inhibits its rapid development. Pre-training on tangentially related datasets such as ImageNet BID4 ) has been shown to help in circumstances where training data is limited, but may introduce unintended biases which are undesirable in a clinical setting. Furthermore, most clinical settings will drive a need for models which can accurately predict a large number of diagnostic outcomes. This essentially turns many medical problems into multi-label classification with a large number of targets, many of which may be subtle or poorly defined and are likely to be inconsistently labeled. In addition, unlike the traditional multi-label setting, predicting the absence of each label is as important as predicting its presence in order to minimize the possibility of misdiagnosis. Each of these challenges drive a need for architectures which consider clinical context to make the most of the data available.Chest x-rays are the most common type of radiology exam in the world and a particularly challenging example of multi-label classification in medical diagnostics. Making up nearly 45% of all radiological studies, the chest x-ray has achieved global ubiquity as a low-cost screening tool for a wealth of pathologies including lung cancer, tuberculosis, and pneumonia. Each scan can contain dozens of patterns corresponding to hundreds of potential pathologies and can thus be difficult to interpret, suffering from high disagreement rates between radiologists and often resulting in unnecessary follow-up procedures. Complex interactions between abnormal patterns frequently have significant clinical meaning that provides radiologists with additional context. For example, a study labeled to indicate the presence of cardiomegaly (enlargement of the cardiac silhouette) is more likely to additionally have pulmonary edema (abnormal fluid in the extravascular tissue of the lung) as the former may suggest left ventricular failure which often causes the latter. The presence of edema further predicates the possible presence of both consolidation (air space opacification) and a pleural effusion (abnormal fluid in the pleural space). Training a model to recognize the potential for these interdependencies could enable better prediction of pathologic outcomes across all categories while maximizing the data utilization and its statistical efficiency.Among the aforementioned challenges, this work firstly addresses the problem of predicting multiple labels simultaneously while taking into account their conditional dependencies during both the training and the inference. Similar problems have been raised and analyzed in the work of BID30 BID1 with the application of image tagging, both outside the medical context. The work of BID26 for chest x-ray annotations are closest to ours. All of them utilize out-of-the-box decoders based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to sequentially predict the labels. Such a naive adoption of RNNs is problematic and often fails to attend to peculiarities of the medical problem in their design, which we elaborate on in Section 2.3 and Section 3.3.1.In addition, we hypothesize that the need for pre-training may be safely removed when there are sufficient medical data available. To verify this, all our models are trained from scratch, without using any extra data from other domains. We directly compare our results with those of that are pre-trained on ImageNet. Furthermore, to address the issue of clinical interpretability, we juxtapose a collection of alternative metrics along with those traditionally used in machine learning, all of which are reported in our benchmark. To improve the quality of computer-assisted diagnosis of chest x-rays, we proposed a two-stage end-to-end neural network model that combines a densely connected image encoder with a recurrent neural network decoder. The first stage was chosen to address the challenges to learning presented by high-resolution medical images and limited training set sizes. The second stage was designed to allow the model to exploit statistical dependencies between labels in order to improve the accuracy of its predictions. Finally, the model was trained from scratch to ensure that the best application-specific features were captured. Our experiments have demonstrated both the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach. Indeed, our baseline model significantly outperformed the current state-of-the-art. The proposed set of metrics provides a meaningful quantification of this performance and will facilitate comparisons with future work.While a limited exploration into the value of learning interdependencies among labels yields promising results, additional experimentation will be required to further explore the potential of this methodology both as it applies specifically to chest x-rays and to medical diagnostics as a whole. One potential concern with this approach is the risk of learning biased interdependencies from a limited training set which does not accurately represent a realistic distribution of pathologies -if every example of cardiomegaly is also one of cardiac failure, the model may learn to depend too much on the presence of other patterns such as edemas which do not always accompany enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. This risk is heightened when dealing with data labeled with a scheme which mixes pathologies, such as pneumonia, with patterns symptomatic of those pathologies, such as consolidation. The best approach to maximizing feature extraction and leveraging interdependencies among target labels likely entails training from data labeled with an ontology that inherently poses some consistent known relational structure. This will be the endpoint of a future study."
