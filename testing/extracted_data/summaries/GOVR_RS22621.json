    "content": "The Administration's FY2008 budget request for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) includes $92.2 billion in budget authority. Proposed discretionary budget authority would increase 1.6% from FY2007 levels to $20.3 billion. Mandatory budget authority would remain nearly steady at $71 billion; formula-driven increases in crop insurance and domestic food assistance would offset decreases in commodity program payments. The Administration's 2007 farm bill proposal is largely separate from its budget request, although a $500 million per year placeholder for new spending is included in the FY2008 budget amounts. In its FY2008 request, the Administration proposes to use foreign assistance funds to purchase food in foreign markets. For agricultural research, competitive funding would replace some formula funding. Several conservation and rural development programs would be reduced or cut. Food safety and animal health protection programs would increase. This report will not be updated, but will be followed by a CRS report tracking the FY2008 agriculture appropriations bill."
