    "title": "AB 2012",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes the board of supervisors in specified counties, as part of a pilot jail industry program not to exceed 4 years, to establish, with the concurrence of the county sheriff, a Jail Industry Commission for that county. Existing law also requires the county board of supervisors, upon the establishment of a commission, to create a Jail Industries Fund, as specified, which may be used to fund specified purposes. Existing law specifies the composition of these commissions. This bill would repeal the authorization to create a Jail Industry Commission as a pilot program, and would instead authorize the board of supervisors of the Counties of Lake, Los Angeles, Madera, Sacramento, San Diego, San Joaquin, San Luis Obispo, Sonoma, Stanislaus, Tulare, Tuolumne, and Ventura to authorize the county sheriff or county director of corrections to create a Jail Industry Authority, as specified. The bill would also make conforming changes. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Counties of Lake, Los Angeles, Madera, Sacramento, San Diego, San Joaquin, San Luis Obispo, Sonoma, Stanislaus, Tulare, Tuolumne, and Ventura."
