    "content": "Right To Know About Airport Pollution Act of 1999 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to study, and report to Congress on: (1) the feasibility of regulating air, noise, water, and solid waste pollution from all sources in and around airports using airport bubbles. And (2) the feasibility and desirability of strengthening EPA air pollutant emissions standards for airplane engines. Defines an airport bubble as an area: (1) in and around an airport within which sources of pollution and levels of pollution from those sources are to be identified and reduced. And (2) containing a variety of types of air, noise, water, and solid waste sources of pollution in which the aggregate of each type of pollutant from the respective source is regulated as if the various sources were a single source. Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations requiring each airport that regularly serves commercial or military jet aircraft to report, under toxic chemical release reporting provisions of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986 and source reduction and recycling data collection provisions of the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, releases and other waste management activities associated with the manufacturing, processing, or other use of toxic chemicals listed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986."
