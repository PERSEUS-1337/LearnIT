    "content": "This report tracks and provides an overview of actions taken by the Administration and Congress to provide FY2018 appropriations for the International Trade Administration (ITA), the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), and the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR). These three trade-related agencies are funded through the annual Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) appropriations act. This report also provides an overview of three trade-related programs administered by ITA, USITC, and USTR. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) provided a total of $636.5 million for the three agencies, including $483.0 million for ITA, $91.5 million for USITC, and $62.0 million for USTR for FY2017. For FY2018, the Administration requested a total of $587.7 million for the three trade-related agencies. The total included $442.5 million for ITA, $87.6 million for USITC, and $57.6 million for USTR. The Administration's request for all three agencies is less than the FY2017-enacted appropriations. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported CJS proposals in July 2017 (H.R. 3267 and S. 1662). The House incorporated H.R. 3267 into Division C of the Consolidated Appropriations bill, H.R. 3354, which passed the House on September 14, 2017. House-passed H.R. 3354 recommended a total of $627.5 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies. It included $467.0 million for the ITA in direct appropriations, $92.5 million for USITC, and $68.0 million for USTR, of which $15 million would be derived from the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund. The Senate reported S. 1662 on July 27, 2017, and included a total of $631.1 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies. It included $482.0 million for the ITA in direct appropriations, $91.5 million for USITC, and $57.6 million for USTR, of which $10 million would be derived from the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund. On March 23, 2018, Congress passed and the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141). The act provides $482.0 million for ITA, $93.7 million for USTIC, and a total of $72.6 million for USTR, of which $15 million is to be drawn from the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund. The FY2018 appropriation for the three CJS trade-related agencies is $648.3 million, an amount 1.9% greater than the FY2017 appropriations, and 10.3% more than the Administration's request."
