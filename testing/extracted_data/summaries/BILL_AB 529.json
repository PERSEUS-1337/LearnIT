    "title": "AB 529",
    "content": "Existing law requires the Attorney General to establish and maintain an online database, the Prohibited Armed Persons File, to cross-reference persons who have ownership or possession of a firearm on or after January 1, 1996, and who, subsequent to the date of that ownership or possession, fall within a class of persons who are prohibited from owning or possessing a firearm. Existing law restricts the access of that database to specified entities, including, among others, the courts, and specified law enforcement and prosecutorial entities. This bill would require the Department of Justice to allow the Department of Motor Vehicles to access the database in connection with the registration of vehicles and the issuance and renewal of driver\u2019s licenses. Existing law prescribes certain instances when the Department of Motor Vehicles is required to refuse registration, or renewal or transfer of registration, of a vehicle, including, among others, when the application contains a false or fraudulent statement, or the required fee has not been paid. This bill would additionally require the department to refuse registration, or renewal or transfer of registration, of a vehicle, when the department determines that the person to whom the vehicle is, or will be, registered is listed as a prohibited person in the Prohibited Armed Persons File. The bill would require the department, before registering a vehicle, or renewing or transferring the registration of a vehicle, to access the Prohibited Armed Persons File to determine if the person to whom the vehicle is, or will be, registered is listed as a prohibited person. Existing law prescribes certain instances when the Department of Motor Vehicles is required to refuse to issue or renew a driver\u2019s license, including, among others, when the person seeking the license is not of legal age to receive a driver\u2019s license. This bill would additionally require the department to refuse to issue or renew the driver\u2019s license of a person who the department determines is listed as a prohibited person in the Prohibited Armed Persons File. The bill would require the department, before issuing or renewing a driver\u2019s license, to access the Prohibited Armed Persons File to determine if the person applying for, or renewing, the driver\u2019s license is listed as a prohibited person."
