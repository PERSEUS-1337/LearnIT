    "content": "This report provides a brief outline of the FY2014 appropriations legislation for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Administration requested $39.0 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2014, as part of an overall budget of $60.0 billion (including fees, trust funds, and other funding that is not appropriated or does not score against the budget caps). Congress did not enact annual FY2014 appropriations legislation prior to the beginning of the new fiscal year. From October 1, 2013, through October 16, 2013, the federal government (including DHS) operated under an emergency shutdown furlough due to the expiration of annual appropriations for FY2014. More than 31,000 DHS employees were furloughed. Tens of thousands of others that were excepted from furlough, and those whose salaries were paid through annual appropriations, worked without pay until the lapse was resolved by passage of a short-term continuing resolution. From October 17, 2013, to January 17, 2014, the federal government operated under the terms of two consecutive continuing resolutions: P.L. 113-46, which lasted until its successor was enacted on January 15, 2014; and P.L. 113-73, which lasted until the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76), was enacted on January 17, 2014. Division F of P.L. 113-76 is the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014, which includes $39,270 million in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS. This is $922 million more than DHS reportedly received in its annual appropriation for FY2013 after taking into account the impact of sequestration. The act also included an additional $5.6 billion requested by the Administration for FEMA in disaster relief funding as defined by the Budget Control Act, and an additional $227 million for the Coast Guard to pay the costs of overseas contingency operations. Those additional costs are compensated for by adjustments in the discretionary spending limits outlined through the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act as amended. For a more detailed discussion of policy matters and legislative details beyond funding levels, see CRS Report R43147, Department of Homeland Security: FY2014 Appropriations, coordinated by [author name scrubbed]. This report will be updated as events warrant."
