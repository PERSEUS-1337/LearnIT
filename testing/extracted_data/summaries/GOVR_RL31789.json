The agreement went into effect on January 1,2004. In late July 2003, the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act hadpassed the House by a vote of 272-155 and the Senate by a vote of 66-32. The Free Trade Agreement(FTA) will, with a phase-in period, eliminate tariffs on all goods traded between them, cover tradein services, and protect intellectual property rights. In July 2003, the House Ways and MeansCommittee, Senate Finance Committee, and House and Senate Judiciary Committees held mockmarkups on the draft implementing legislation. On July 15, the United States-Singapore FTAImplementation Act ( H.R. 2739 (Delay) and S. 1417 (Grassley)) wasintroduced and by July 17 had received committee approval. The agreement has received support from the business community and consumerorganizations but has been criticized by labor and some environmental interests. Some of thespecific concerns raised deal with the restrictions on penalties for unresolvable disputes over laborand environmental issues, the Integrated Sourcing Initiative, potential capital controls, temporaryvisas, and access for U.S. exports of chewing gum. A basic policy issue with respect to the FTA iswhether the United States should pursue free trade and investment relations on a bilateral basis ratherthan maintaining existing trade and investment practices on both sides or pursuing more liberalizedtrade relations through other means. Also at issue is the extent to which the FTA language shouldbe used as a model for other agreements. Negotiations for the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement were launched under the ClintonAdministration in December 2000. The FTA would be the fifth such agreement the United Stateshas signed and the first with an Asian country. According to the U.S. Trade Representative, the FTAhas broken new ground in electronic commerce, competition policy, and government procurement. It also includes what the U.S. Trade Representative reportedly considers to be major advances inintellectual property protection, environment, labor, transparency, customs cooperation, andtransshipments. The U.S.-Singapore FTA required congressional implementation under expedited TradePromotion Authority legislative procedures. It continues the trend toward greater trade liberalizationand globalization, contains a new approach to imposing penalties for unresolvable environmentaland labor disputes; and may affect certain trade flows that would, in turn, affect U.S. businesses. Since Singapore is a relatively small economy, the economic effects of the U.S.-SingaporeFree Trade Agreement, by themselves, are not likely to be great. The debate over implementationof the FTA is falling between business and free trade interests who would benefit from moreliberalized trade, particularly in services, and labor or anti-globalization interests who oppose moreFTAs because of the overall impact of imports on jobs and the general effects of globalization onincome distribution, certain jobs, and the environment. Specific provisions of the agreement alsohave generated debate. This report will be updated as circumstances warrant."
