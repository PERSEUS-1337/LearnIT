    "content": "Federal highway construction and safety programs are currently authorized through September 30, 2020, under the five-year Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act; P.L. 114-94 ). For the 1,027,849-mile system of federal-aid highways, the FAST Act provided an average of $45 billion annually. Although there are exceptions, federally funded projects are generally limited to this system that includes roughly 25% of all U.S. public road mileage. Of these funds, nearly 93% are distributed to the states via formula. The states have nearly complete control over the use of these funds, within the limits of federal planning, eligibility, and oversight rules. Money is not provided up front. A state is reimbursed after work is started, costs are incurred, and the state submits a voucher to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The highway program focuses on highway construction and planning, and does not support operations or routine maintenance. The federal share of project costs is generally 80%, but 90% for Interstate System projects. Nearly all highway funding comes from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). The excise taxes on gasoline and diesel, which are the main support of the HTF, are fixed in terms of cents per gallon (18.3 cents for gasoline and 24.3 cents for diesel), and do not adjust for inflation or change with fuel prices. The rates were last raised in 1993. These taxes no longer raise enough money to support the programs Congress has authorized. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections estimate that the HTF shortfall for a five-year reauthorization bill, FY2021-FY2025, will be $68.8 billion, of which the highway portion will be $46.5 billion. The funding shortfall is a major issue framing the reauthorization debate. The FAST Act transferred $70 billion in general Treasury funds to the HTF, $51.9 billion of which were for highways. Congress could deal with the shortfall that is projected to persist over the coming years in three ways: again transfer money from the Treasury general fund; cut spending by roughly 25%; and raise revenue dedicated to the HTF. Widely discussed revenue options include increasing the rates of existing gasoline, diesel, and truck taxes or imposing new charges such as a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) charge. Other issues likely to be considered by Congress include the following: Whether any additional federal spending for highways should be distributed by formula, giving the states greater control, or through discretionary programs that distribute funds based on Administration or congressional priorities. Whether to retain the current highway funding formula, which links states' annual apportionments to their funding shares in past years, or to introduce such formula factors as each state's lane miles, population growth, or VMT. Whether to create stand-alone programs to address issues such as bridge conditions or climate change mitigation and adaptation. Whether the stand-alone National Highway Freight Program, a formula program that has been highly popular with the states, should be funded at a higher level relative to the other formula programs. Whether the Emergency Relief program should be expanded to cover a wider range of resilience needs. Whether states should be permitted to place tolls on free Interstate Highway lanes, and whether to regulate the use of tolls. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW) reported the America ' s Transportation Infrastructure Act of 2019 (ATIA; S. 2302 ) on August 1, 2019 . The bill includes the highway elements of surface transport ation reauthorization under EPW' s jurisdiction. It is the only active FAST Act reauthorization bill to date."
