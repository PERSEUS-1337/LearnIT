    "content": "The lifetime appointment of the Chief Justice of the United States is an event of majorsignificance in American politics because of the enormous power that the Supreme Court exercisesas the highest appellate court in the federal judiciary. The Chief Justice, like each of the Court'sother eight Justices, casts one vote when the Court rules on cases. However, the Chief Justice is also\"first among equals\" and exercises a unique leadership role as the presiding officer of the Court, asthe manager of the Court's overall operations, and as head of the federal judicial branch ofgovernment. There is no formal list of qualifications for the job; the Constitution's only mention ofthe Chief Justice is as presiding officer of the Senate during an impeachment trial of the President. Chief Justice appointments occur infrequently, with only 16 individuals having served in thatposition since 1789 -- an average tenure of 13\u00c2\u00bd years per Chief Justice. The process for appointing a Chief Justice is the same as for appointing Associate Justicesand typically involves a sharing of responsibilities between the President, who nominates theJustices, and the Senate, which provides \"advice and consent.\" (Exceptions to this have been rareinstances when the President has made temporary \"recess appointments\" to the Court, which do notrequire the Senate's approval.) Vacancies on the Court can occur as a result of death, retirement, orresignation of a Justice. Chief Justice nominees may be selected from the ranks of sitting AssociateJustices (as three of the 16 Chief Justices were) or from outside the Court, with each approach, fromthe perspective of the President, having certain advantages and disadvantages. The criteria thatPresidents use in selecting a Supreme Court nominee vary, but typically involve policy and politicalconsiderations as well as a desire to select a person with outstanding professional qualifications andunquestioned integrity. Leadership qualities may also be important when the Chief Justice positionis involved. Presidents have also varied in the degree to which they have sought or used advice fromSenators in selecting Supreme Court nominees. As part of Senate consideration, the Judiciary Committee holds hearings on the nominee andvotes on whether to report the nomination favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation. Regardless of the outcome of that vote, the reporting of a Supreme Court nomination sends it to thefull Senate for debate and a vote. Like the President, Senators may evaluate the nominee by suchstandards as professional excellence, integrity, and leadership qualities, but may also (again, as thePresident is free to do) focus on the nominee's judicial philosophy, views on constitutional issues,or how they believe the appointment might affect the Court's future direction on major legal andconstitutional issues. Under any circumstances, the appointment of a new Chief Justice will command the attentionof Congress, especially the Senate, which votes on whether to confirm judicial nominations. Evenmore attention could be expected concerning such an event in the current political environment, inlight of the controversy that has recently surrounded the judicial appointment process and theimportance the President and Senators of both parties have attached to upcoming Supreme Courtappointments."
