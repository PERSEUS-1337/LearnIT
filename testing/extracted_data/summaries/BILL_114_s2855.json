    "content": "Small Business Innovation Research and Technology Transfer Inclusive Outreach Improvement Act of 2016 This bill amends the Small Business Act to empower the Small Business Administration (SBA) to coordinate with participating federal agencies on efforts to increase outreach and awards under each of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs to small business concerns owned and controlled by women and socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns. Each federal agency required to establish an SBIR or an STTR program shall enhance its program by extending an outreach program to small business concerns, especially those owned and controlled by women and socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns. The SBA shall modify its STTR policy directive to enhance these outreach efforts. The SBIRSTTR Reauthorization Act of 2011 is amended to require the Interagency SBIRSTTR Policy Committee to meet at least twice a year, and if it discusses outreach and technical assistance activities to increase the participation of underrepresented small business concerns to invite to the meeting a representative of the Minority Business Development Agency as well as relevant stakeholders that advance the interests of small business concerns owned and controlled by women and socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns. The SBA shall establish a Diversity and STEM Workforce Development Pilot Program under which a federal agency participating in the SBIR program or STTR program may make a $15,000 per fiscal year grant to one or more eligible entities for the costs of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics internships."
