    "content": "Enacted on January 17, 2014, Title II of Division G of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76, H.R. 3547) provided $8.20 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for FY2014. The act appropriated funding for the full fiscal year through September 30, 2014, for all of the 12 regular appropriations acts, including EPA within Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. Total discretionary appropriations available in FY2014 for all federal departments and agencies were based on a cap of $1.012 trillion set in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-67). The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) determined that this spending level in FY2014 would not trigger sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25), as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA; P.L. 112-240). Unlike FY2013, the FY2014 appropriations therefore were not reduced through sequestration. The total FY2014 enacted appropriations of $8.20 billion for EPA were $47.0 million (0.6%) more than the President's FY2014 request of $8.15 billion, and $298.9 million (3.8%) above the FY2013 enacted appropriations of $7.90 billion (post-sequestration and rescission) provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) as reported by EPA in its FY2013 Operating Plan. The FY2014 enacted appropriations are a $278.4 million (3.3%) decrease compared to the total FY2013 appropriations of $8.48 billion for EPA, when accounting for the $577.3 million (post-sequestration) in supplemental funds provided in the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-2). These supplemental funds were dedicated to water infrastructure, cleanup, and other recovery efforts in areas of states affected by Hurricane Sandy in late October 2012. No regular FY2014 appropriations bill for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies was introduced in the House or Senate prior to the start of the fiscal year on October 1, 2013. On July 31, 2013, the House Appropriations Committee began, but did not conclude, markup of an FY2014 Interior appropriations bill. On August 1, 2013, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies released a draft FY2014 Interior appropriations bill with an accompanying explanatory statement to serve as a starting point for debate in the Senate. No regular appropriations bills for FY2014 were enacted prior to the beginning of that fiscal year. Following a temporary lapse in funding through October 16, 2013, EPA and other federal departments and agencies operated under two continuing resolutions (P.L. 113-46 and P.L. 113-73) prior to the enactment of P.L. 113-76 to fund the full fiscal year. Considerable attention during the debate and hearings on the EPA's appropriations for FY2014 focused on federal financial assistance to states for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects, various categorical grants to states to support general implementation and enforcement of federal environmental programs as delegated to the states, funding for implementation and research support for air pollution control requirements, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, and funding for environmental cleanup. In addition to funding for specific programs and activities, several recent and pending EPA regulatory actions received attention during hearings on FY2014 appropriations for EPA, similar to the debate regarding appropriations for the agency for recent fiscal years. Although a number of provisions to prohibit or restrict the use of FY2014 appropriations for certain EPA actions were considered in the House Appropriations Committee markup, most of these provisions were not included in the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee draft, the partial-fiscal year continuing resolutions noted above, or P.L. 113-76 that provided funding for the full fiscal year. This report summarizes actions on FY2014 appropriations for EPA and presents a breakout of the FY2014 enacted appropriations for the agency by each of the nine appropriations accounts and by selected programs and activities within those accounts that received more prominent attention in the congressional debate. The discussions and tables presented in this report compare the FY2014 enacted appropriations for EPA to the President's FY2014 budget request, and the FY2013 enacted appropriations (post-sequestration and rescission), including funding provided in P.L. 113-6 and the disaster relief supplemental funds provided P.L. 113-2."
