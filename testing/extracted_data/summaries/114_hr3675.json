    "content": "Student Borrower Fairness Act This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to permit student loan borrowers to refinance their loans at interest rates offered on loans to banks by the Federal Reserve System. The cost of this bill is offset by an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code that increases the corporate income rate on companies that pay their chief executive officers or highest paid employees more than 100 times the median compensation of all their employees."
