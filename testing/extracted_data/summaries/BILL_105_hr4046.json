    "content": "Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to prohibit transfers or discharges of residents of nursing facilities as a result of a facility's voluntary withdrawal from participation in the Medicaid program as long as such residents resided in the facility before the withdrawal. Requires a withdrawn facility to provide appropriate notice to new residents who begin residence after the withdrawal that the facility: (1) is not participating in the Medicaid program with respect to that resident. And (2) may transfer or discharge the resident from the facility at such time as the resident is unable to pay the charges of the facility, even though the resident may have become eligible for Medicaid's nursing facility services."
