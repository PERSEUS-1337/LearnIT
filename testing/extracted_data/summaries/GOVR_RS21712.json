    "content": "In World Trade Organization (WTO) Negotiations on agriculture, a group of Africancountries have proposed that all subsidies for cotton be eliminated by the end of four years. The proposal alsoadvocatescompensating African cotton producing countries for revenues estimated to be lost due to cotton subsidies. TheUnited States, whichprovides substantial production-related subsidies to cotton producers, agrees that cotton subsidies distort trade, butmaintains that theissue should be negotiated in a comprehensive manner. Disagreement over the African cotton initiative has blockedprogress on anagreement on agriculture in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations known as the Doha DevelopmentAgenda (DDA). How to tackle the question of cotton subsidies -- either as a stand-alone initiative or as part of a broader agreementto reducetrade-distorting farm subsidies -- will be on the agenda as DDA negotiations continue in 2004. If the initiative wereagreed to asproposed, U.S. cotton producers would no longer be receiving 2002 farm bill marketing loan, loan deficiency, orcounter-cyclicalpayments after four years. Under a U.S. alternative proposal for reduction in trade distorting subsidies, cottonproducers could stillreceive payments under those programs but in reduced amounts. This report will be updated."
