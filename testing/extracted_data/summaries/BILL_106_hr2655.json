States, with exceptions, that a presidential order neither constitutes nor has the force of law and is limited in application and effect to the executive branch. Authorizes both Houses of Congress, a Senator or Representative, certain State and local officials, and certain aggrieved persons to bring an action to challenge the validity of any presidential order which exceeds the power granted to the President by the relevant authorizing statute or the Constitution."
