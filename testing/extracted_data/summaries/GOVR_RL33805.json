    "content": "Federal support for child care and education comes in many forms, ranging from grant programs to tax provisions. Some programs serve as specifically dedicated funding sources for child care services (e.g., the Child Care and Development Block Grant, or CCDBG) or education programs (e.g., Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Title I, Part A; Early Reading First; Even Start; the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program; the Early Childhood Educator Professional Development program; and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\u2014Preschool Grants program and Infants and Toddlers program), while for others (e.g., Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF), child care is just one of many purposes for which funds may be used. In many cases, federal programs target low-income families in need of child care, but in the case of certain tax provisions, the benefits reach middle- and upper-income families as well. This report provides an overview of federal child care, early education, and related programs, and their funding status. Funding for many child care, early education, and related programs is provided each year as part of the annual appropriations process for the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Education (ED). Fiscal year (FY) 2007 appropriations bills for those departments did not receive floor action in the House or Senate during the 109th Congress, despite the 2007 fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2006. After three continuing resolutions (CRs) provided temporary funding for government operations, a fourth CR, providing funding through the end of FY2007, was ultimately signed into law (P.L. 110-5) on February 15, 2007, shortly after the President's budget request for FY2008 was released. For several but not all of the programs covered by this report, the FY2007 funding levels mirrored those included in the FY2006 appropriations (P.L. 109-149). Funding for Head Start was increased, as was that for Early Reading First. Even Start funding was cut, but not eliminated as had been proposed by the President. The FY2008 appropriations process, which included a series of continuing resolutions that provided temporary funding (at FY2007 levels) and a vetoed conference agreement (H.Rept. 110-424), ultimately culminated in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 (H.R. 2764) being signed into law (P.L. 110-161) by the President on December 26, 2007. The legislation includes an across-the-board cut (1.747%) to the program funding level amounts contained in the act's language. (The levels included in this report reflect the across-the-board reduction.) On February 4, 2008, the President released his budget request for FY2009. The 110th Congress has not addressed all of the expired (or soon expiring) reauthorizations in the area of early childhood education and care. The CCDBG (expired with FY2002) remains funded without authorization. No Child Left Behind was granted an automatic one-year extension (through FY2008) under the General Education Provisions Act. Head Start reauthorization legislation (H.R. 1429) was approved by this Congress in November 2007, and signed into law (P.L. 110-134) by the President on December 12, 2007."
