    "content": "The Department of Energy's Office of Science conducts basic research in six overarching program areas: advanced scientific computing research, basic energy sciences, biological and environmental research, fusion energy sciences, high-energy physics, and nuclear physics. Through primarily these programs, the Department of Energy was the third-largest federal funder of basic research and the largest federal funder of research in the physical sciences in FY2014. This budget and appropriations tracking report describes selected major items from the Administration's FY2016 budget request for the Office of Science and tracks legislative action on FY2016 appropriations for the office. It also provides selected historical funding data. This report has been updated to include House-passed and Senate-proposed amounts for FY2016. It will be updated to include Senate-passed (if available) and final enacted FY2016 appropriations. Overall, the Obama Administration requests $5.340 billion for Science in FY2016, a $272 million (5%) increase over the FY2015 enacted level of $5.068 billion. By dollar amount, the largest increase is for Basic Energy Sciences (BES), which would gain $116 million (7%). The largest decrease is for Fusion Energy Sciences (FES), which would be reduced by $48 million (-10%). By percentage, the largest increase among Science's research programs would go to Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR), which would receive $80 million (15%) more in FY2016. The House-passed Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016 (H.R. 2028) would provide $5.100 billion for the Science account in FY2016. This amount is $29 million (1%) more than the FY2015 enacted funding level and $240 million (-4%) less than the Administration's request. By dollar amount, the largest increase (over FY2015) in the House recommendation is for Basic Energy Sciences ($37 million). The largest percentage increase in the House recommendation is for Nuclear Physics (3%). Biological and Environmental Research would be reduced the most, measured by both amount and percentage change (-$54 million or -9%). The White House Office of Management and Budget issued a \"Statement of Administration Policy\" opposing H.R. 2028, in part due to Office of Science funding levels. As amended and reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, H.R. 2028 would provide $5.144 billion for the Science account in FY2016. This amount is $73 million (1%) more than the FY2015 enacted funding level, $196 million (-4%) less than the FY2016 Administration request, and $44 million (1%) more than the House-passed funding level. By dollar amount, the largest increase (over FY2015) in the Senate Appropriations Committee recommendation is for Basic Energy Sciences ($111 million); by percentage, the largest increase is for Advanced Scientific Computing Research (15%). The largest decrease\u2014by both amount and percentage\u2014is for Fusion Energy Sciences ($197 million, -42%). The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends U.S. withdrawal from the international fusion energy project known as ITER."
