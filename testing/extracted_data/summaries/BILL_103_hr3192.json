    "content": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code with respect to political organizations to establish a campaign contribution limitation scheme applicable to the campaign committee of a candidate for election to the House of Representatives. Provides that excess campaign contributions received by such an organization shall be included in its gross income. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 and Federal postal service law to condition the lowest unit charge for campaign ads upon a candidate's certification of compliance with such contribution limitation. Expresses the sense of the Congress that additional costs incurred by the United Postal Service in providing reduced rates of postage pursuant to this Act should be funded out of revenues attributable to this Act."
