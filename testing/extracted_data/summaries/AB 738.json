    "title": "An act to amend Sections 102025, 102053, and 102054 of, to add Section 102056 to, and to repeal and add Sections 102052.5 and 102055 of, the Public Utilities Code, relating to public transit.",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the creation of the Sacramento Regional Transit District, with specified powers and duties relative to the provision of public transit services. Existing law describes the authorized boundaries of the district, as specified, and provides that the boundaries of the district, at any point in time, shall consist of the area of any city or county within the authorized boundaries where the governing board of the city or county has declared a need for the district to operate. Existing law authorizes the district to operate in any city or county where the need for the district to operate has been declared, except that the district has no power to levy an ad valorem property tax unless a city or county adopts a specified resolution. Existing law provides for a city or county to annex to the district through a written request to the district and approval by the Sacramento Area Council of Governments. This bill would revise and recast these provisions. The bill would provide that the boundaries of the district, at any point in time, shall consist of specified areas, including a city or county that has acted to annex to the district, and a city incorporated on or after January 1, 2016, if the newly incorporated city consists of territory that was included in the district prior to incorporation. The bill would require an annexation to be subject to an agreement between the annexing city or county and the district board specifying the terms and conditions of annexation, and would delete the requirement for approval of annexation by the Sacramento Area Council of Governments. The bill would provide procedures for detachment of territory within the district by a specified supermajority vote of the district board and a majority vote of the governing body of the territory proposed to be detached."
