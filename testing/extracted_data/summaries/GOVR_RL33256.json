    "content": "Congress annually funds the nuclear weapons complex (the Complex), those sites thatdevelop, maintain, manufacture, and dismantle nuclear weapons. In hearings held in 2004, theHouse Appropriations Committee pressed the Secretary of Energy \"for a systematic review ofrequirements for the weapons complex over the next twenty-five years.\" The committee expressedits concern that the Complex is not well suited to the post-Cold War situation, and should reflectpresidential decisions on the stockpile as well as issues of cost, security, and Complex size. Inresponse, the Nuclear Weapons Complex Infrastructure Task Force of the Secretary of EnergyAdvisory Board prepared a report, released in final form in October 2005. The report indicated that the Complex had redundant facilities, security concerns, high cost,excessive competition between the weapons labs, and inadequate equipment for the productionplants. To redress these problems, the Task Force proposed restructuring the Complex. It wouldshift much production and some R&D to a new nuclear production center, probably close one ormore plants, contract out some nonnuclear work, shrink the labs, consolidate facilities, and take stepsto make governance more effective. It was concerned that current warheads, produced during theCold War, are inappropriate for the current situation because they have more yield and efficiencythan is needed, yet are more vulnerable to terrorist threats than is desirable, are hard to manufacture,are designed close to failure points, and will probably become harder to maintain. It recommendsrestructuring the nuclear arsenal by producing new-design Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRWs)with characteristics deemed more suitable to the current environment. The report links Complex andwarheads: in the Task Force's view, RRWs would be easier to produce and maintain, permitting asmaller, more efficient, and less costly Complex. Observers familiar with the current Complex raise several concerns. From their perspective,closing Complex sites and facilities might meet fatal political opposition. They maintain that thereport seems to downplay the value of investments in Complex facilities over six decades, andprojects large cost savings through 2030 based on questionable assumptions. They fear that shiftingkey tasks that the nuclear weapons labs perform to other sites could disrupt the labs' ability to dotheir work. The recommendation to proceed immediately with RRW deals with restructuringweapons rather than the Complex and, in this view, may go beyond the Task Force's mandate. ADepartment of Defense official stated that a Department of Defense-Department of Energy agencydid not approve the Task Force's proposed 3-step transition to RRW, despite the report's strongimplication to the contrary. While any final decision on deploying RRWs must await completionof studies that might possibly reject RRW, the Task Force assumes RRW will proceed and does notexamine how its restructured Complex would support current warheads. Some express concern thatTask Force recommendations may be at odds with U.S. nuclear nonproliferation policy. This report will not be updated."
