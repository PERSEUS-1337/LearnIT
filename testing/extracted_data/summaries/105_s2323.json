    "content": "Home Health Access Preservation Act of 1998 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA), as amended by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, with respect to the computation formula of the interim system of limited payments for services provided by home health agencies, in order to mandate a new interim system, as of October 1, 1998, with a revised formula and specific amounts for the agency-specific per beneficiary annual limitation, according to the census division in which an agency is located. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) estimate the amount of savings to Medicare resulting from this Act for each fiscal year beginning after FY 1998 and before the first fiscal year in which the prospective payment system (PPS) for home health agencies applies. (2) prescribe rules for increased payments to such an agency, if there will be estimated savings. And (3) establish procedures to provide heightened scrutiny of claims for reimbursement under Medicare for items and services provided to certain agency beneficiaries. Amends SSA title XVIII to provide for a three percent increase in per visit cost limits for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997. Directs the Secretary to meet every 90 days with appropriate congressional committee staff to provide informal updates of progress in implementing the PPS above."
