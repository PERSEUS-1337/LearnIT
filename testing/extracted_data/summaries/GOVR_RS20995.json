    "content": "In 1998, India and Pakistan each conducted tests of nuclear explosive devices, drawingworld condemnation. TheUnited States and a number of India's and Pakistan's major trading partners imposed economic sanctions in response. Most U.S. economic sanctions werelifted or eased within a few months of their imposition, however, and Congress gave the President the authority toremove all remaining restrictions in 1999. The sanctions were lifted incrementally. President Bush issued a final determination on September 22, 2001,to remove the remaining restrictions, finding that denying export licenses and assistance was not in the national security interests of the United States. Today, four Indian and 20 Pakistani entities (and their subsidiaries) remain on the Commerce Department's listof entities for which export licenses arerequired. By comparison, restricted entities numbered in the hundreds in the wake of the 1998 nuclear tests. Anexport license is still required to ship missiletechnology-controlled or nuclear proliferation-controlled items to users in either country, but the Department ofCommerce no longer views such licenseapplications with a presumption of denying their issuance. Apart from the sanctions imposed following the nuclear tests, the United States prohibited foreign aid toPakistan when that country fell into arrears in servicingits debt to the United States in late 1998, a prohibition reenforced when Pakistan's military forces overthrew thedemocratic government in late 1999. Post-September 11 cooperation between the United States and Pakistan included a rescheduling of the debt and newlegislation to waive the so-calleddemocracy sanctions. Pakistan thus became eligible to receive U.S. foreign assistance through FY2003 when, unlessit holds free and fair elections, restrictionson foreign aid could be reimposed."
