    "content": "Skin Cancer Prevention, Education, and Consumer Right-To-Know Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to deem a drug that is a sunscreen product whose labeling violates this Act to be adulterated. Prohibits the labeling of a drug that is a sunscreen product that fails to meet the standards adopted under this Act from: (1) describing the product using the term broad-spectrum. Or (2) including a specified symbol adopted to indicate broad-spectrum. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to adopt: (1) a standard for broad-spectrum protection in sunscreen products. And (2) an easily recognized symbol for inclusion in the labeling of sunscreen products meeting such standards. Sets forth minimum standards that the Secretary shall adopt for such broad-spectrum protection, including a minimum ratio of UVA protection factor to sun protection factor, a minimum level of UVB radiation protection, and specified truth in labeling requirements. Requires sun protection factors to be measured using standardized, reproducible testing methods that take photo-degradation into account. Requires the Secretary to implement an education campaign identifying the risks posed by sun exposure without the use of a sunscreen providing broad-spectrum protection."
