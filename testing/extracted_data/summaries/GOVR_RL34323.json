    "content": "The criminal law proposals found in H.R. 3887 as it passed the House include newly assigned sex trafficking offenses, a sex tourism offense, a coerced services offense, obstruction of justice offenses, an importation of prostitutes offense, a false statement offense, and provisions for civil liability, victim assistance, forfeiture, extraterritorial jurisdiction, Justice Department reorganization, and a model state statute. H.R. 3887's new sex trafficking offense would expand federal jurisdiction to reach persuasion, inducement, or enticement to engage in unlawful prostitution when it occurs in or affects interstate or foreign commerce, even in the absence of a child victim or of coercion, fraud, or force. Its amended version of 18 U.S.C. 1592 (seizure of documents in aid of trafficking) would outlaw the use of financial coercion to gain control of an individual's labor or sexual services. Its new sex tourism offense would cover arranging or attempt to arrange sex tours even when the underlying travel is not itself a federal crime. The bill also prohibits various obstructions of justice and false statements committed in connection with the employment of foreign workers. Procedurally, H.R. 3887 would enlarge the civil cause of action available to victims of violations of the involuntary servitude and trafficking provisions under an explicit 10-year statute of limitations. It would expand the availability of Crime Victim Fund programs for the benefit of the victims of sex trafficking. It would rename the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section and expand the responsibilities of the Innocence Lost Task Forces to include sex trafficking offenses involving sexually exploited adults.
