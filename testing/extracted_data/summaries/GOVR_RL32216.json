    "content": "On November 15, 2002, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced the first steps inimplementing the new 2005 base realignment and closure (BRAC) law. These includeddevelopment of a force structure plan, comprehensive inventory of military installations, andestablishment of criteria for selecting bases for closure and realignment. The Secretary of Defense submitted a report to Congress on March 23, 2004, confirming theneed for a further BRAC round and certifying that an additional round of closures and realignmentswould result in annual net savings, over a period ending no later than FY2011. On May 20, 2004, the House of Representatives voted 259 to 162 to delay base closings until2007. In response to this action, the White House immediately released a statement declaring thatthe Secretary of Defense, and other senior advisers, would urge the President to veto any bill that\"weakened, delayed, or repealed\" the current base closure authority. On October 8, 2004, Senate and the House conferees reached agreement on the NationalDefense Authorization Act for FY2005, which included continued support of DOD's authority toconduct a round of closures and realignments in 2005. Senator John Warner stated that it wasessential to allow DOD to complete its effort to reduce the size of its infrastructure. On March 15, 2005, the President appointed nine members to serve on the 2005 BRACCommission. In doing so, he consulted with leading Members of Congress. In addition, thePresident chose Anthony A. Principi to serve as the chairman of the new BRAC Commission. Once formally in-place, the Commission's next step was to institute a series of local, D.C.area hearings to collect general information on DOD's force structure needs and goals. It will befollowed later by regional hearings at locations throughout the country. At least one commissionerwill be required to visit each base on DOD's designated list. On May 13, 2005, the Pentagon announced that it would close 33 major U.S. military basesand realign 29 others -- in a move to consolidate forces and save almost $50 billion over 20 years. The overall number of existing U.S. major bases, according to DOD, is 318. In addition, 775 smallerfacilities are expected to be closed or realigned. This report will be updated as needed."
