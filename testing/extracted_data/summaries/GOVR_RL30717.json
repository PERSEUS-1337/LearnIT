    "content": "DNA technology can provide useful identifying information in many situations, such as in solving crimes, determining paternity, and identifying human remains. Research is resulting inimprovements in sensitivity and power and reductions in cost. Such use and improvements areraising several policy issues. The use of DNA in identification results from its unique characteristics: It is a complex molecule, containing much information. Each person has billions of identical copies. The structureof the molecule varies from person to person and is inherited, so the DNA of relatives is more similarthan that of unrelated people. Also, DNA is easily preserved with the structure intact. Identification requires comparing DNA whose source has not been determined with DNA whose source is known. The first step is to characterize corresponding DNA sequences fromsamples. The resulting profiles are then compared. If they differ, the samples did not have the sameorigin. If they match, then they could have come from the known source, or from someone else whohas an identical profile. The science of population genetics provides ways of estimatingquantitatively the chances that the matched DNA could have come from another source. Databases or indexes are often used in DNA identification. They might contain profiles of persons whose identity is known, such as convicted felons, or whose identity is not known, such asfrom crime scene samples or unidentified remains. The Combined DNA Index System (CODIS),administered by the FBI, contains both kinds. When a profile is obtained from a relevant sample,the database can be searched to determine if a match is found. Thus, a suspect may be identifiedwhen a profile from a crime-scene sample is searched against profiles of convicted felons. Congress has enacted several laws relating to DNA evidence. The DNA Identification Act of 1994 ( P.L. 103-322 ) authorized CODIS and a grants program for state and local laboratories, andaddressed quality control and privacy issues. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of1996 ( P.L. 104-132 ) expanded CODIS and established a grants program that required states, to beeligible, to collect DNA samples from persons convicted of felony sex crimes. The CrimeIdentification Technology Act of 1998 ( P.L. 105-521 ) established a grants program that funds abroad range of activities, including several related to DNA typing. The National Institute of Justice(NIJ) and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) administer those and other relevant grantsprograms. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Armed Forces Instituteof Pathology (AFIP), and the Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory (USACIL) also havesignificant DNA identification activities. Policy issues raised by the use of DNA in identification include how best to eliminate the large backlog of samples awaiting processing for CODIS, whether to broaden the offenses that qualify,how to respond to the increasing number of requests for postconviction DNA analysis, how toaddress privacy issues, and what impacts the broadening applications of the technology may have."
