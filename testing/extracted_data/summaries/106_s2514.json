(2) a former reserve member under 60 years of age who would be eligible for retired pay except for being under such age. And (3) dependents of the above. Limits the required identification for such travel. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations authorizing a reserve member traveling to inactive duty training at least 50 miles from home to be eligible for billeting (housing) in DOD facilities on the same basis as active-duty personnel traveling under orders away from such member's duty station. Requires proof of the reason for such travel. Increases the maximum number of reserve retirement points that may be credited in a year for reserve service from 75 to 90 for years during and subsequent to the date of enactment of the Reserve Component Equity Act of 1999. Authorizes the Secretary of the military department concerned to provide civil legal services to reserve personnel not otherwise entitled to such services following a release from active duty under a call or order to such duty for more than 30 days under a mobilization authority, but only for a period that is not in excess of twice the length of the duty period served."
