    "content": "Since the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010, controversy has surrounded the applicability of requirements for health plans and health insurers to cover certain recommended preventive health services, including a range of contraceptive services, without cost sharing. The U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury have issued regulations that provide an exemption from ACA for certain religious employers who have religious objections to contraceptives. The exemption appears to cover churches and church associations, but potentially does not extend to other religiously affiliated employers, such as universities and hospitals. The scope of the exemption has been the subject of intense debate and has raised questions of the legal protections for religious institutions. Both constitutional and statutory rules govern whether a religious exemption from the coverage requirement is required and what the scope of that exemption may be. Courts have generally held that exemptions to legal mandates that conflict with religious beliefs are permissible, but not required under the First Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court has indicated in several decisions that a religious exemption is not required for neutral laws of general applicability, and state courts have applied the Court's analysis to state contraceptive requirements. The Court has explicitly noted, however, that an exemption may be included or broadened at the discretion of Congress. As a statutory protection, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) requires that any federal action that substantially burdens religious exercise must (1) further a compelling interest and (2) use the least restrictive means to further that interest. Because the contraceptive coverage requirement is a federal action subject to RFRA, a court must find that the requirement serves a compelling interest and is implemented to burden as few religious objectors as possible without undermining that interest. Courts, including state courts considering challenges to similar provisions in state law, have recognized at least two of the stated purposes of the requirement\u2014public health and gender equity\u2014as compelling interests. State courts have also upheld exemptions that are essentially identical to the one included in the federal rule as sufficient accommodations which use the least restrictive means to avoid undermining that interest. Employers with health plans that fail to offer the required coverage of contraceptives and do not qualify for an exemption may be subject to penalties or other liability. With respect to the preventive health services requirement, ACA does not expressly include a means of enforcing the provision. However, if a health plan or health insurer does not provide contraceptive coverage, it is possible that enforcement mechanisms found in the Employer Retirement Income Security Act, the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code could be applied. Furthermore, employers who do not cover contraceptives may be subject to liability for sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, even if the employer qualifies for the religious exemption. This report provides an overview of the preventive health services requirements and the exemption for religious employers. It analyzes the legal protections for religious organizations with objections to the requirements and examines state court decisions upholding similar requirements. The report also discusses the implications of non-compliance for organizations that do not qualify for the exemption and fail to provide the required coverage. Finally, the report analyzes several legislative proposals for statutory exemptions (H.R. 3897/S. 2043; H.R. 1179/S. 1467) and provides examples of religious exemptions in other federal laws and in state contraceptive coverage laws."
