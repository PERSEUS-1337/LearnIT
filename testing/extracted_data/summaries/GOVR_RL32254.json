    "content": "The federal tax burden on small firms and its effects on their formation and growth have long been matters of legislative concern for Congress. This abiding interest has helped pave the way for the enactment of a series of tax laws in recent years that included targeted tax relief for a number of small businesses. This report describes the main federal tax preferences that benefit small firms and examines the main arguments for and against government support for small firms in general and for tax benefits targeted at such firms in particular. It addresses the tax preferences that can be claimed only by small firms in a wide range of industries and excludes those targeted at small firms in specific industries, such as the special deduction for small life insurance companies under Section 806 of the federal tax code. The small business tax preferences discussed here reflect the changes in the tax code under P.L. 115-97. The following small business tax benefits are examined here: Expensing allowance for machinery and equipment under Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code; Cash-basis accounting under Section 446; Tax credit for a portion of the costs incurred by small firms in establishing pension funds for employees under Section 45E; Tax credit for costs incurred by small firms in complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act under Section 44; Full exclusion from the capital gains tax on the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock under Section 1202; Exemption from the limitation on the deduction for business interest expenses under Section 163; Tax credit for small firms that offer qualified health insurance coverage to employees under Section 45R; Simplified dollar-value last-in-last-out accounting under Section 474; Deduction for and amortization of business start-up expenses under Section 195; Ordinary income treatment of losses on the sale of certain small business stock under Section 1244; Treating losses on the sale of Small Business Investment Company stock as ordinary losses under Section 1242; Exemption from the uniform capitalization rule under Section 263A; and Use of research tax credit to reduce payroll tax for certain small firms under Section 41. While available information does not allow for an estimate of the federal revenue cost of the small business tax preferences examined here, a recent estimate by the Joint Committee on Taxation suggests that the cost might exceed $17 billion in FY2018. Tax preferences for small businesses raise several policy issues. For some, a key question is whether they can be justified on economic grounds. In the absence of such a justification, small business tax benefits, while promoting the survival and growth of firms that can take advantage of them, may cause more economic harm than good by distorting the allocation of domestic economic resources."
