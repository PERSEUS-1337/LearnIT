Enrolled in the public schools and the state-accredited private schools within each local agency's geographic jurisdiction. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) allow payment of home school expenses from Coverdell education savings accounts. (2) remove the dollar limitation on contributions to Coverdell education savings accounts and require such accounts to provide adequate safeguards to prevent contributions from exceeding the amount necessary to provide for the qualified education expenses of the account beneficiary. And (3) allow tax-exempt qualified tuition programs to pay qualified pre-kindergarten, elementary, and secondary education expenses."
