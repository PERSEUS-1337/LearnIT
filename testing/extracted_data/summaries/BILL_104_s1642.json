    "content": "Denies monthly cash disability benefits under titles II (OASDI) and XVI (SSI), respectively, of the Social Security Act for drug addicts and alcoholics whose substance abuse is a contributing factor material to their disability. Allows such individuals, instead, to elect to undergo treatment for their substance abuse. Revises OASDI and SSI program representative payee requirements to require the payment of program benefits through a representative payee if it is in the interest of an otherwise disabled individual with an alcohol or drug addiction condition who is incapable of managing such benefits. Preserves the Medicaid eligibility of SSI recipients denied cash disability benefits because of the connection between their drug addiction or alcoholism and their disability."
