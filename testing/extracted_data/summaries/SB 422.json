    "title": "An act to amend Sections 35100, 35101, 35103, 35120, 35152, and 35153 of, to amend the heading of Division 26 (commencing with Section 35100) of, and to add Section 35122 to, the Public Resources Code, relating to the Santa Clara Valley Open-Space Authority.",
    "content": "Existing law creates the Santa Clara County Open-Space Authority, and prescribes the jurisdiction and functions and duties of the authority. Existing law authorizes the authority, among other things, to acquire, hold, and dispose of real and personal property, within the authority\u2019s jurisdiction, necessary to the full exercise of its powers. Existing law further authorizes the authority to take by eminent domain any property necessary or convenient to accomplish the purposes of the authority, with the exception of lands in active ranching, lands in agricultural production, and lands in timberland production zones that are not threatened by imminent conversion to developed uses. Existing law provides that the maximum jurisdiction of the authority shall include all areas within the county, as provided. This bill would authorize the authority to acquire, but not to take by eminent domain, interests in real property that are without the authority\u2019s jurisdiction, necessary to the full exercise of its powers. The bill would also authorize the authority\u2019s boundaries to be altered by the annexation of contiguous territory, in the unincorporated area of a neighboring county, as provided. The bill would change the name of the authority to the Santa Clara Valley Open-Space Authority and make conforming changes."
