    "content": "American Indian Equal Justice Act - Amends Federal law concerning the jurisdiction of US district courts to make it a requirement that an Indian tribe, tribal corporation, or member of an Indian tribe collect and remit to a State any excise, use, or sales tax imposed by the State on nonmembers of the Indian tribe as a consequence of the purchase of goods or services by nonmembers from the Indian tribe, tribal corporation, or member. Permits a State to bring an action in a US district court to enforce the requirement. Grants US district courts: (1) original jurisdiction in any civil action or claim against an Indian tribe, in matters arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. (2) jurisdiction of any civil action or claim against an Indian tribe for liquidated or unliquidated damages for cases not sounding in tort that involve any contract made by the governing body of the Indian tribe or on behalf of an Indian tribe. And (3) subject to Indian tribe tort claims procedure provisions under this Act, jurisdiction of civil actions in claims against an Indian tribe for money damages, accruing on or after the enactment of this Act for loss of property, personal injury, or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of an Indian tribe under circumstances in which the Indian tribe, if it were a private individual or corporation, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the State where the act or omission occurred. Sets forth Indian tort claims procedure provisions. Excepts any case relating to a controversy about membership in an Indian tribe. Grants consent to institute a civil cause of action against an Indian tribe in a State court on a claim arising within the State, including a claim arising on an Indian reservation or Indian country, in any case in which the cause of action: (1) arises under Federal or State law. And (2) relates to tort claims or claims not sounding in tort that involve any contract made by the governing body of an Indian tribe on or behalf of a tribe. Provides, in any tort action brought in a State court against an Indian tribe, for that tribe to be liable to the same extent as a private individual or corporation under like circumstances, but not to be liable for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages. Amends title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 to grant US district courts jurisdiction in any civil rights action alleging a failure to comply with rights secured by the requirements under such title."
