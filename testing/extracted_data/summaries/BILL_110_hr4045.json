    "content": "Improving Teacher Diversity Act - Amends title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to certain minority-serving institutions of higher education (IHEs), or partnerships between such IHEs and other IHEs, to establish centers of excellence for teacher education. Requires the use of such grants to ensure that current and future teachers are highly qualified by: (1) reforming teacher preparation programs so that teachers are able to understand scientifically-based research and use advanced technology effectively in the classroom. (2) providing preservice clinical experience and mentoring to prospective teachers, and increased interaction between IHE faculty and new and experienced elementary and secondary school teachers and administrators. (3) implementing initiatives to promote the retention of highly qualified teachers and principals, (4) awarding need-based scholarships for students in teacher preparation programs, (5) disseminating information on effective teacher preparation practices, and (6) conducting certain other activities authorized under title II."
