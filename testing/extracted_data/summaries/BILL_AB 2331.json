    "title": "AB 2331",
    "content": "The Dental Practice Act provides for the licensure and regulation of dentists and associated professions by the Dental Board of California within the Department of Consumer Affairs. The act requires each applicant for a license to practice dentistry to successfully complete specified examinations, including receiving a passing score on either a portfolio examination, as specified, or a clinical and written examination administered by the Western Regional Examining Board, which determines the passing score for that examination. This bill would additionally allow an applicant to satisfy that examination requirement by receiving a passing score on the clinical and written examination developed by the American Board of Dental Examiners, Inc. subject to prior review and approval of the examination by the Office of Professional Examination Services, as provided, delivery of this review to the Dental Board of California, and payment of specified expenses incurred by the board. Existing law authorizes the Director of Finance to accept on behalf of the state any gift of real or personal property whenever he or she deems the gift and the terms and conditions thereof to be in the best interest of the state. Existing law establishes the Special Deposit Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, which consists of money that is paid into it in trust pursuant to law when no other fund has been created to receive that money. This bill would authorize the Department of Finance to accept funds for the purposes of reviewing and analyzing the dental examination developed by the American Board of Dental Examiners, Inc. described above. Because these funds would be deposited in the Special Deposit Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, this bill would make an appropriation. This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 1632 of the Business and Professions Code proposed by SB 1478 that would become operative if this bill and SB 1478 are enacted and this bill is enacted last."
