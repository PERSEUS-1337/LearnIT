    "content": "Military Families Leave Act of 2003 - Amends the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to entitle an eligible employee to 12 work weeks of leave during any 12-month period because a spouse, son, daughter, or parent of the employee is a member of the Armed Forces who is either on active duty in support of a contingency operation or has been notified of an impending call or order to such status. Allows such leave only for issues relating to or resulting from such family member's military duty. Amends Federal law to grant leave under the same conditions to civil service employees."
