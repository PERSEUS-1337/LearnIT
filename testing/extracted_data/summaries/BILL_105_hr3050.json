Prohibits any change in selection, or verification of such a change, without the affirmative request of the subscriber. Requires the FCC to complete rulemaking for enforcement of such verification requirements within two years after the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Provides a private right of action for any subscriber whose service is changed in violation of such requirements. Authorizes the appropriate State court to increase damage awards by up to three times the maximum allowable award for willful and knowing violations. Title II: Regulation of Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices in Connection With Slamming - Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to prescribe rules to prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices in any advertisement for or solicitation of any change in a subscriber's selection of a service provider. Requires a carrier to clearly and conspicuously disclose that the offer seeks to change the subscriber's service provider, as well as the total cost for such new service. Permits States to bring civil actions on behalf of residents to enjoin unlawful exchange practices, to enforce carrier compliance with FTC rules, or to obtain damages or other appropriate relief."
