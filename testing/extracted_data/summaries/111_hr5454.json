Prescribes requirements for timing and packaging of rescission requests. Authorizes OMB, subject to a specified time limit, to withhold funding from obligation temporarily if the President proposes a rescission. Prohibits the President from invoking such expedited procedures or such authority to withhold funding on more than one occasion for any Act providing funding. Sets forth procedures for expedited congressional consideration of proposed rescissions. States that, if budget authority or funding is rescinded under the ICA, the amount so rescinded shall revert to the fund whence it came , except to the extent legislation specifies otherwise."
