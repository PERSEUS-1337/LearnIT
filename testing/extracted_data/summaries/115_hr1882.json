    "content": "Stop AIDS in Prison Act of 2017 This bill directs the Bureau of Prisons to develop a comprehensive policy to provide HIV testing, treatment, and prevention for federal inmates in prison and upon reentry. It amends the federal criminal code: to require an HIV test for each convicted federal offender sentenced to prison for any length of time regardless of risk factors, unless the individual declines. To make the HIV test part of the routine health screening conducted at intake. And to require a pre-release HIV test, unless the individual declines."
