    "content": "Homeowners' Protection Act of 2008 - Amends the federal bankruptcy code to eliminate the pre-petition credit counseling requirement for a debtor under chapter 13 who is facing foreclosure, if the debtor submits to the court a certification that the debtor has received notice that the holder of a claim secured by the debtor's principal residence may commence foreclosure. Allows modification of the rights of claim holders, in the event of a foreclosure notice for a chapter 13 debtor, among other means by: (1) reducing a claim to equal the value of the debtor's interest in the residence securing such claim, and any adjustments to a related adjustable rate of interest, (2) waiving early repayment or prepayment penalties. And (3) extending the repayment period. Denies debtor liability for certain fees and charges incurred while the bankruptcy case is pending and arising from a debt secured by the debtor's principal residence, unless the claim holder observes specified requirements. Adds to conditions for court confirmation of a plan in bankruptcy that: (1) the holder of a claim secured by the debtor's principal residence retain the lien securing the claim until the later of the payment of such claim as reduced and modified or the discharge of a debtor from all debts. And (2) the plan modifies the claim in good faith. Excludes from final discharge of a debtor from all debts: (1) any payments to claim holders whose rights are modified under this Act, and (2) any unpaid portion of a claim as reduced."
