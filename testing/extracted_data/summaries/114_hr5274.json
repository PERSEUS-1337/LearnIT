    "content": "Student Loan Refinancing and Recalculation Act This bill amends title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to direct the Department of Education to establish a program to refinance the outstanding principal, interest, and late charges on Federal Direct Loans (DLs) and Federal Family Education Loans (FFELs). A refinanced loan has a fixed interest rate equal to the 10-year Treasury note rate plus 1 percentage point. Additionally, the bill modifies the formula to calculate interest rates on new Direct Subsidized, Unsubsidized, and PLUS Loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2017. Finally, it eliminates the origination fee on Direct Subsidized, Unsubsidized, and PLUS Loans disbursed after enactment of this bill."
