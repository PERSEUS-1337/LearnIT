    "content": "Fairness in Medigap Options Act of 2010 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to make eligible for guaranteed issue of Medicare supplemental (Medigap) policies: (1) all Medicare beneficiaries. (2) Medicare Advantage plan enrollees who disenroll from the plan and elect to receive benefits through the original Medicare fee-for-service program. And (3) Medicaid plan enrollees who have lost eligibility for such medical assistance. Allows individuals with end stage renal disease (ESRD) to receive Medicare benefits through enrollment in a MedicareChoice plan. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to specify an annual period during which individuals enrolled in a Medigap policy with a particular benefit package may change to another such policy if the other policy: (1) is offered by a different issuer and is available for issuance to new enrollees. And (2) has the same benefit package or a benefit package with lesser benefits."
