    "content": "Internet Spyware (I-SPY) Prevention Act of 2005 - Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit intentionally accessing a protected computer without authorization, or exceeding authorized access, by causing a computer program or code to be copied onto the protected computer and intentionally using that program or code: (1) in furtherance of another federal criminal offense. (2) to obtain or transmit personal information with intent to defraud or injure a person or cause damage to a protected computer. Or (3) to impair the security protection of that computer. Prohibits any person from bringing a civil action under state law premised upon the defendant's violating this Act. Provides that this Act does not prohibit any lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activity of a law enforcement agency or a US intelligence agency. Authorizes appropriations to the Attorney General for prosecutions needed to discourage the use of spyware and the practices commonly called phishing and pharming. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Department of Justice should vigorously prosecute those who use spyware to commit crimes and those that conduct phishing or pharming scams."
