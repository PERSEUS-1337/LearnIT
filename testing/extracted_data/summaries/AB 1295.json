    "title": "An act to amend Sections 23363.1, 23771, and 23772 of, and to add Article 6 (commencing with Section 23500) to Chapter 3 of Division 9 of, the Business and Professions Code, relating to alcoholic beverages.",
    "content": "The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act contains various provisions regulating the application for, the issuance of, the suspension of, and the conditions imposed upon, alcoholic beverage licenses by the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. Existing law provides for various annual fees for the issuance of alcoholic beverage licenses, depending upon the type of license issued. This bill, the Craft Distillers Act of 2015, would authorize the department to issue a craft distiller\u2019s license to manufacture distilled spirits, subject to specified conditions, including that the licensee manufacture no more than 100,000 gallons of distilled spirits per fiscal year, excluding brandy the craft distiller manufactures or has manufactured for them. The bill would allow the craft distiller\u2019s licensee to sell distilled spirits to specified consumers, to own interests in on-sale retail licenses, and to sell beer, wines, brandies, and distilled spirits to consumers for consumption on the premises of a bona fide eating place, as provided. The bill would impose an original fee and an annual renewal fee for the license, which would be deposited in the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund. The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act authorizes a licensed distilled spirits manufacturer to conduct tastings of distilled spirits produced or bottled by, or produced or bottled for, the licensee, on the licensed premises, under specified conditions, including that tasting not be given in the form of a cocktail or mixed drink. This bill would extend that authorization to a licensed craft distiller and would revise the tasting conditions by allowing a tasting to be given in the form of a cocktail or mixed drink. Existing law prohibits a distilled spirits manufacturer\u2019s or distilled spirits manufacturer\u2019s agent\u2019s license from being held by a person that holds any ownership or interest in any distilled spirits wholesaler\u2019s, rectifier\u2019s, or retailer\u2019s license, as specified. This bill would additionally prohibit a distilled spirits manufacturer\u2019s or distilled spirits manufacturer\u2019s agent\u2019s license from being held by a person that holds any ownership or interest in a craft distiller\u2019s license."
