Provides redeployment exceptions with respect to: (1) special operations forces performing counter-terrorism operations or support operations for Iraqi security forces, (2) military liaison teams, (3) air support operations for Iraqi security forces, (4) counter-terrorism operations in Iraq. And (5) security for US diplomatic missions in Iraq. Allows funds appropriated to the Department of Defense (DOD) for Operation Iraqi Freedom to be obligated or expended after such deadline only for personnel performing such excepted operations.
