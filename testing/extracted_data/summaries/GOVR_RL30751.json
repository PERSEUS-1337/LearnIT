    "content": "In several diamond-rich countries affected by armed conflict, notably in Africa, belligerents have funded their military activities by mining and selling diamonds, and competition over the useand control of diamond wealth has contributed significantly to the depth and extended duration ofthese conflicts. Diamonds used in this fashion, labeled \"conflict diamonds,\" were estimated to havecomprised an estimated 3.7 % to 15% of the value of the global diamond trade in 2000. The presentvolume of such trade appears is difficult to estimate. Several diamond-related conflicts have ended,but others have burgeoned. Policy makers' attention has also increasingly focused on the possiblerole that diamonds may play in the financing of terrorist operations. In response to public pressure to halt trade in conflict diamonds, and due to the persistence of several diamond-related conflicts, governments and multilateral organizations have pursued effortsto end such trade. Several international policy forums, national legislatures, and diverse privateparties have proposed various reforms and legislation to achieve such goals. Effective regulation ofthe diamond trade is difficult. Diamonds are a highly fungible, concentrated form of wealth, and theglobal diamond industry is historically insular and self-regulating. The illicit diamond trade exploitsthese factors. Proposals to end illicit trading generally center on legally identifying the origin ofdiamonds and requiring the registration, identification, and monitoring of cross-border trade indiamond, as is common for trade in other goods. Methods for achieving such ends include thecataloging of unique physical diamond features; the \"tagging\" of diamonds with minute markings;and the creation of certification-of-origin laws to document the origin of diamonds. The Clinton Administration worked to create a certificates of origin-based international diamond trade regime, but sought to ensure that such efforts would not negatively affect thelegitimate industry. It also backed marketing reforms and regulatory capacity building in diamond-rich Africancountries, consulted with the diamond industry, pushed for U.N. sanctions to end theconflict diamond trade, and created an inter-agency group on conflict diamonds. The BushAdministration has pursued policies that broadly mirror those of its predecessor. The United States participates in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, a global diamond trade regulation framework. The Administration began implementing the Scheme in the UnitedStates with voluntary interim compliance measures, prior to the passage of H.R. 1584 (see below). Several congressional hearings have addressed trade in conflict diamonds. Potentiallinks between terrorism financing and trade in diamonds have garnered increasing congressionalattention. The 106th and 107th Congresses considered several diamond-related bills. The108thCongress passed H.J.Res. 2 in February 2003; it contained several conflictdiamond-related provisions. Other conflict diamond bills introduced in the 108th Congress include H.Con.Res. 239 (Watson); S. 760 (Grassley), H.R. 1415 (Houghton), and H.R. 1584 (Houghton). The latter three bills shared many goals incommon with H.R. 1584 , an amended version of which was passed by both chambersand signed into law by President Bush, becoming P.L. 108-19 ."
