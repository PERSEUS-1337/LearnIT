    "content": "Tenant Protection Act This bill amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to prohibit a consumer reporting agency from creating a report containing a landlord-tenant court or other housing court record unless: the case resulted in a judgment of possession, the decision is not being appealed, and the record is not more than three years old. If a person takes an adverse action against a consumer based upon a housing court record, the person must provide the consumer a free copy of the report. A person who willfully creates a housing court report that contains an inaccuracy is civilly liable to the consumer. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must: (1) issue regulations that direct tenant rating agencies to create a central source for consumers to obtain reports and submit disputes, and (2) report on tenant rating agency compliance."
