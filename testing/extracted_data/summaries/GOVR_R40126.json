    "content": "Chile, located along the Pacific coast of South America, is a politically stable, upper-middle-income nation of 18 million people. In 2013, Michelle Bachelet and her center-left \"New Majority\" coalition won the presidency and sizeable majorities in both houses of the Chilean Congress after campaigning on a platform of ambitious reforms designed to reduce inequality and improve social mobility. Since her inauguration to a four-year term in March 2014, President Bachelet has signed into law significant changes to the tax, education, and electoral systems. She has also proposed a number of other economic and social policy reforms, as well as a process for adopting a new constitution. Although a significant majority of the public initially supported the reforms, Chileans have grown more divided over time, with some groups pushing for more far-reaching policy changes and others calling for Bachelet to scale back her agenda. Disapproval of the reforms, a corruption scandal that implicated her son, and Chile's slowing economy have taken a toll on President Bachelet's approval rating, which has declined to 29%. Chile's economic growth has slowed considerably in recent years, falling to 1.9% in 2014. Analysts have largely attributed the slowdown to the end of the global commodity boom and the coinciding drop in copper prices, which have a significant impact on the Chilean economy. There are also indications that the Bachelet Administration's policy reforms may have reduced business confidence and dampened growth. In order to stimulate the economy, the Chilean government has implemented expansive fiscal and monetary policies over the past year. Growth is forecast to accelerate slightly to 2.3% in 2015 and gradually increase in the following years. President Obama and President Bachelet have sought to build upon the long-standing partnership between the United States and Chile. Commercial ties are particularly strong. Total trade in goods and services reached $31 billion in 2014, more than quadrupling since the implementation of a free trade agreement in 2004. Trade and investment flows could increase if the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, which includes the United States, Chile, and 10 other nations in the Asia-Pacific region, is approved. The United States and Chile also work together to address regional and global security challenges, such as instability in Haiti. The United States provided Chile with an estimated $1 million in foreign aid in FY2015 to strengthen the capabilities of Chilean security forces and foster closer security ties. The countries' mature partnership includes additional collaboration on issues such as energy development and scientific research. The 114th Congress is currently considering several measures related to U.S.-Chilean relations. Congress may consider implementing legislation for the TPP agreement under the rules and procedures set forth in the Bipartisan Comprehensive Trade Priorities Act (P.L. 114-26, \"trade promotion authority\"), which both houses passed and the President signed into law in June 2015. The Senate also may consider a bilateral income tax treaty with Chile (Treaty Doc. 112-8), which was signed in 2010, submitted to the U.S. Senate for its advice and consent in 2012, and reported favorably by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on November 10, 2015. An extradition treaty with Chile (Treaty Doc. 113-6), which was signed in 2013 and submitted to the Senate in September 2014, also awaits the Senate's advice and consent."
