    "content": "Gasoline demand in the United States has grown consistently during the past decade,increasing by a total of 20%. Between 1999 and 2003, gasoline consumption grew by 500,000barrels per day, accounting for all of the increase in petroleum consumption during that period. While 2004 may see growth slow down because of high prices, during the first seven months of theyear gasoline demand was up by another 1.9%. The fact that gasoline supply has not kept up with demand has been reflected in pump pricesthat have risen from $1.50 at the start of 2004 to as high as $2.06 per gallon in late May. Whensupply and demand become out of sync with their previous relationship, prices change to establisha new balance. The outcome has been a period of volatile gasoline prices, which have set recordhighs that have become a focal point for consumers and policy makers, and raised concerns abouttheir impact on the economy. Gasoline is supplied both by U.S. and foreign refiners. Domestic producers' capacity islimited. As a result, nearly 1 million barrels per day of gasoline and its components are imported.Imported blending components -- especially those used in ethanol-blended fuel -- are increasinglyimportant to total U.S. supply. Without this supplemental supply, gasoline would be less availableand prices likely higher. Imports most recently have come from Canada and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which supplyone-third of the off-shore supply. Argentina, the Netherlands, Russia, the United Kingdom, andVenezuela provide another third. Imports peaked in March 2004, took a dip, and reached new highsin July. Increased imports may have contributed to pump prices backing off their May highs in latesummer. New gasoline blending components from Venezuela and the rehabilitation of a refinery inAruba may also contribute to enhanced gasoline component supply later this year. Gasolinecomponent availability -- which has increased during 2004 -- gives domestic refiners an addedmeasure of flexibility in using their capacity, and contributes to enhanced supplies of fuels neededto meet demand for ethanol-based gasoline and other specialized regional blends. Potential policy concerns raised by growing reliance on gasoline imports include theavailability of foreign supplies that meet U.S. specifications, whether incremental foreign suppliescan be provided quickly enough to meet shifting demand, and the delivered price of importedgasoline. Two legislative efforts were debated in the House regarding gasoline supply issues during2004. One, H.R. 4517 , has passed the House but not been taken up in the Senate. Itwould provide for easier permitting for refinery capacity expansion. And H.R. 4545 ,which did not pass the House, would have limited the growth of special regional fuel blends, oftencalled \"boutique fuels.\" This report will be updated as events warrant."
