    "content": "Department of State Rewards Program Update and Technical Corrections Act of 2012 - Expresses the sense of Congress that the Department of State rewards program should be expanded to: (1) address the threat to US interests from transnational criminal activity. And (2) target individuals indicted by international, hybrid, or mixed tribunals for genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity. Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to include in the program's purpose the prevention of acts of transnational organized crime and violations of international humanitarian law. Provides rewards for the arrest or conviction of persons involved in such activities. Eliminates program references to the reward for the capture or death of Osama bin Laden."
