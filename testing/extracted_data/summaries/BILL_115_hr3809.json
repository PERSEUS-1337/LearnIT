    "content": "Sustainable Farmland for the Future Act This bill amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to modify the conservation compliance provisions that apply to farmers who receive certain Department of Agriculture (USDA) benefits and have land that is highly erodible or a wetland. The bill modifies the compliance provisions to: apply the requirements to cropland that is planted to a row crop rather than highly erodible cropland, modify the requirements for a conservation system. Modify the compliance requirements for farmers who receive crop insurance premium subsidies. Expand the authority and requirements for USDA to review conservation plans. Require USDA to use specified funds to provide technical assistance, conduct status reviews, and carry out other tasks needed to implement the conservation requirements, and revise the enforcement procedures for wetlands."
