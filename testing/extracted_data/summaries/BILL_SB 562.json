    "title": "SB 562",
    "content": "The Local Agency Public Construction Act prescribes procedures for contracting by local public agencies, including specific provisions for cities. Existing law permits a governmental agency to solicit proposals and enter into agreements with private entities for the design, construction, or reconstruction by, and may lease to, private entities, for specified types of fee-producing infrastructure projects. Existing law permits these agreements to provide for the lease of, or ownership of, infrastructure facilities owned by a governmental entity, but constructed by a private entity, to that private entity for a period of up to 35 years. This bill, notwithstanding the act and any other law, would authorize the City of Long Beach to contract and procure a project for the revitalization and redevelopment of the Long Beach Civic Center, as defined, in accordance with prescribed procedures for proposal evaluation and contract award. The bill would authorize the lease of all or a portion of the project to, or ownership by, a private entity or entities, for a term of up to 50 years. The bill would make a statement that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique and special circumstances surrounding the existing Long Beach Civic Center, and the need to immediately, quickly, and efficiently develop the project, and to resolve property issues potentially delaying the project."
