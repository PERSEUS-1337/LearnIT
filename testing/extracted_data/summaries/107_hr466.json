    "content": "Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to establish a grants program for Resource Staff for Students. Direct the Secretary of Education to make such grants to local educational agencies for recruiting, training, and hiring 100,000 individuals to serve as school-based resource staff who have documented competence and training in mental health, as well as other specified minimum qualifications. Requires such resource staff to work with students to: (1) reduce the student-to-counseling ratios nationally, in grades 6-12, to an average of one such staff member for every 250 students. (2) help address the mental, emotional, and developmental needs of public school students. And (3) support other school staff and teachers in reaching students early before problems arise, conducting behavioral interventions to improve school discipline, and developing the awareness and skills to identify early warning signs of violence and the need for mental health services."
