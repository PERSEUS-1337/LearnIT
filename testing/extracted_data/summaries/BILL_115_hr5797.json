    "content": "Individuals in Medicaid Deserve Care that is Appropriate and Responsible in its Executionnbsp. Act or the IMD CARE Act This bill temporarily allows states to apply to receive federal Medicaid payment for services provided in institutions for mental diseases (IMDs) and for other medically necessary services for enrollees with opioid-use or cocaine-use disorders. Services may be covered for a total of up to 30 days in a 12-month period for an eligible enrollee. States must include specified information in their applications, including plans to improve access to outpatient care. Current law generally prohibits federal payment under Medicaid for services provided in IMDs for individuals under the age of 65 . Additionally, the bill temporarily eliminates the enhanced federal matching rate for Medicaid expenditures regarding specified medical services provided by certain managed care organizations."
