    "content": "Robert Stodola Homeless Veterans Assistance Act - Amends the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act to require each city, county, State, and Indian tribe which is provided assistance under the following programs to ensure that not less than 20 percent of the total amount received by such entity is used for activities benefiting homeless veterans: (1) the emergency shelter grants program, (2) the supportive housing program, (3) the safe havens for homeless individuals demonstration program, (4) a program for single room occupancy dwellings, (5) the shelter plus care program. And (6) the rural homelessness grant program. Provides an identical requirement with respect to the innovative homeless initiatives demonstration program under the HUD Demonstration Act of 1993. Allows a waiver of such requirement in each case upon a determination that general program funds will remain unused for an unreasonable period of time unless the waiver is permitted."
