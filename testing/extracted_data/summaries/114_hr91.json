    "content": "This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on June 22, 2015. Veteran's Identification Card Act of 2015 Directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to issue a veteran's identification card to a requesting veteran who is neither entitled to military retired pay nor enrolled in the VA system of patient enrollment. Requires such card, among other things, to: (1) display the veteran's name and photograph, and (2) serve as proof that the veteran has a DD-214 form or other official document in his or her military personnel file that describes the veteran's military service. Directs VA to charge a card fee. States that such card shall not serve as proof of entitlement to any benefits."
