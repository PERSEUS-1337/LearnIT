    "content": "Relief to Victims of Hurricane Katrina and Other Natural Disasters Act - Amends federal bankruptcy law governing cases commenced as of October 17, 2005 . Excludes from the accounting of current monthly income those payments made to victims of a natural disaster by a governmental unit, or by a qualified religious or charitable entity or organization, solely on account of their status as victims of such natural disaster. Defines victim of a natural disaster as one whose financial condition is materially adversely affected by a natural disaster due to: (1) damage sustained to the principal residence as a result of such disaster, (2) an inability to remain at such principal residence. Or (3) an inability to work at the principal place of employment of that person, as a result of such disaster. Permits debtor status for a debtor unable to complete credit counseling because of a natural disaster. Modifies requirements governing the statutory deadline for completion of debtors' duties. Authorizes the court to extend any such time period if: (1) the debtor is a victim of a natural disaster. And (2) the debtor's status as a victim of a natural disaster necessitates such extension of time. Includes within the permissible monthly expenses of a chapter 7 debtor the actual reasonably necessary expenses incurred as a result of being a victim of a natural disaster if the debtor provides the requisite documentation. Modifies requirements governing conversion or dismissal of either a Chapter 7 Liquidation case, a Chapter 11 Reorganization case, or Chapter 13 Regular Income case, where the debtor is a victim of a natural disaster. Authorizes the court to grant an extension of time for filing small business bankruptcy documentation if the debtor's inability to meet the statutory deadline is warranted by a natural disaster. Amends the federal judicial code to authorize an alternative venue if the debtor is not able to reside in the requisite district due to the natural disaster."
