And (2) investment advisers of private funds, each of which has assets under management in the United States of less than $150 million.

And (2) provide for registration and examination procedures for such advisers which reflect the level of systemic risk posed by the funds. Modifies SEC rulemaking authority. Authorizes the SEC to ascribe different meanings to terms, but prohibits including in the term client an investor in a private fund managed by an investment adviser with whom the private fund has entered into an advisory contract. Directs the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to promulgate rules jointly for the mandatory reports filed by certain registered investment advisers. Directs the Comptroller General to assess the annual costs on industry members and their investors because of the registration requirements and ongoing reporting requirements of this Act. Amends the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 with respect to SEC authority to exempt any person or transaction from certain investment advisory contract requirements to the extent that the exemption relates to an investment advisory contract with any person that the Commission determines does not need the protections of such requirements. Requires the SEC, with respect to any factor involving a dollar amount test it uses to make such a determination, to adjust that test for inflation every five years."
