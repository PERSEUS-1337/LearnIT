    "title": "AB 2738",
    "content": "The California Constitution limits the maximum amount of any ad valorem tax on real property to 1 of the full cash value of the property. The California Constitution states that the 1 limitation for ad valorem taxes does not apply to ad valorem taxes or special assessments to pay the interest and redemption charges on bonded indebtedness incurred by a school district, community college district, or county office of education for the construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities approved by 55 of the voters if the proposition includes specified accountability requirements. Existing law requires the proceeds of the sale of the bonds, exclusive of any premium received, to be deposited in the county treasury to the credit of the building fund of the school district, or community college district as designated by the California Community Colleges Budget and Accounting Manual. This bill would prohibit the proceeds from the sale of bonds from being withdrawn by the school district or community college district for investment outside the county treasury."
