    "content": "Congress has completed action on the FY2003 defense authorization ( H.R. 4546 ) and defense appropriations ( H.R. 5010 ) bills. The President signed the FY2003 defenseappropriations act into law on October 23 ( P.L. 107-248 ), and he signed the FY2003 defenseauthorization act into law on December 2 ( P.L. 107-314 ). In addition, Congress has approved, andthe President has signed, the military construction appropriations bill ( H.R. 5011 , P.L.107-249 ). The House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not, however, take up bills toprovide $10 billion that the Administration requested as a contingency fund for costs ofcounter-terrorism operations in FY2003. The conference agreement on the defense appropriations bill establishes final funding levels for key defense programs, and it resolves a number of matters that were at issue during the year. Asthe Administration requested, the bill eliminates funds for development of the Crusader artillerysystem and instead provides increased funding for other Army indirect fire programs. Confereesadded funds to develop an alternative tube artillery system to be deployed by 2008. Earlier, theconference report on the FY2002 supplemental appropriations bill ( H.R. 4775 , P.L.107-206 ) directed the Army to enter into a follow-on contract to use Crusader technology indeveloping such a system. Conferees on the defense authorization bill reached agreement on several contentious issues, though some may recur next year. The key issue, which held up the conference agreement until afterthe mid-term elections, was whether to permit concurrent receipt of military retired pay and veteran'sdisability benefits. The Senate authorization bill included a provision to allow immediate, fullconcurrent receipt, while the House bill phased in a program to allow concurrent receipt for thosewith 60% or greater disabilities. The White House threatened to veto a bill that included eitherprovision. The conference agreement provides a new benefit, paid by the Defense Department, tomilitary retirees who have a disability determined to be caused by a combat or combat-related injury. The conference agreement on the defense authorization also resolved a number of other issues. The agreement includes amended versions of Senate provisions tightening oversight of missiledefense programs; it drops a House provision concerning application of the Endangered Species Actto defense facilities, but includes a provision concerning the Migratory Bird Treaty Act; it prohibitsFY2003 funds from being used to develop nuclear armed interceptors for missile defense; it providesfunds for developing a nuclear-earth penetrator warhead, but only after the Defense Departmentsubmits a report on the project that includes a review of non-nuclear alternatives; and it drops aSenate provision permitting service members to have access to abortions at military facilitiesoverseas.
