    "title": "AB 3",
    "content": "The Community Services District Law authorizes the establishment of community services districts and specifies the powers of those districts including, among others, the power to acquire, construct, improve, maintain, and operate community facilities, as specified. Existing law authorizes the formation of the Isla Vista College Community Services District within the unincorporated area of Santa Barbara County known as Isla Vista for the performance of various services, including, but not limited, to public parks, police protection, and transportation facilities. This bill would authorize the establishment of the Isla Vista Community Services District by requiring the Board of Supervisors of the County of Santa Barbara to submit a resolution of application to the Santa Barbara County Local Agency Formation Commission, and, upon direction by the commission, place the questions of whether the district should be established and whether a utility user tax should be imposed on the ballot at the next countywide election following the completion of the review by the commission. By imposing new duties on the County of Santa Barbara, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would provide that if a utility user tax is not passed by the voters of the district on or before January 1, 2023, the district would be dissolved. The bill would set forth the board of directors of the district and would specify the services that district would be authorized to provide, including, among others, the power to create a tenant mediation program and to exercise the powers of a parking district. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Isla Vista Community Services District. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
