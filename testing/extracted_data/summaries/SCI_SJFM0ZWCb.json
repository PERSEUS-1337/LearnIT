    "content": "Unsupervised learning of timeseries data is a challenging problem in machine learning. Here, \nwe propose a novel algorithm, Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC), a fully unsupervised method, to naturally integrate dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering into a single end to end learning framework. The algorithm starts with an initial cluster estimates using an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a novel temporal clustering layer for cluster assignment. Then it jointly optimizes the clustering objective and the dimensionality reduction objective. Based on requirement and application, the temporal clustering layer can be customized with any temporal similarity metric. Several similarity metrics are considered and compared.   To gain insight into features that the network has learned for its clustering, we apply a visualization method that generates a heat map of regions of interest in the timeseries. The viability of the algorithm is demonstrated using timeseries data from diverse domains, ranging from earthquakes to sensor data from spacecraft. In each case, we show that our algorithm outperforms traditional methods. This performance is attributed to fully integrated temporal dimensionality reduction and clustering criterion. Deep learning has become the dominant approach to supervised learning of labeled data BID12 BID17 . However, in many applications the data labels may not be available or be reliable. A variety of techniques have been developed for unsupervised learning where the algorithms draw inferences from unlabeled data. However, the progress in learning of complex structure in the data has so far been largely restricted to labeled datasets, while relatively little attention was paid to learning of complex, high-level structure and features of unlabeled data. The standard unsupervised techniques include clustering approaches which organize similar objects into clusters. Such techniques differ in the method for organizing the data as well as the metrics to measure similarity. While clustering techniques have been successfully applied to static data, their extension to time series data remains an open problem. This has left a gap in technology for accurate unsupervised learning of time series data which encompass many areas of science and engineering such as financial trading, medical monitoring, and event detection BID0 .The problem of unsupervised time series clustering is particularly challenging. Time series data from different domains exhibit considerable variations in important properties and features, temporal scales, and dimensionality. Further , time series data from real world applications often have temporal gaps as well as high frequency noise due to the data acquisition method and/or the inherent nature of the data BID1 ).To address the issues and limitations of using standard clustering techniques on time series data, we present a novel algorithm called deep temporal clustering (DTC) . A key element of DTC is the transformation of the time series data into a low dimensional latent space using a trainable network, which here we choose to be a deep autoencoder network that is fully integrated with a novel temporal clustering layer. The overview of our method is illustrated in Figure 1 . The latent representation is compatible with any temporal similarity metric.The proposed DTC algorithm was designed based on the observation that time series data have informative features on all time scales. To disentangle the data manifolds , i.e., to uncover the latent dimension(s) along which the temporal or spatio-temporal unlabeled data split into two or more classes, we propose the following three-level approach. The first level, implemented as a CNN, reduces the data dimensionality and learns the dominant short-time-scale waveforms. The second level, implemented as a BI-LSTM, reduces the data dimensionality further and learns the temporal connections between waveforms across all time scales. The third level performs non-parametric clustering of BI-LSTM latent representations, finding one or more spatio-temporal dimensions along which the data split into two or more classes. The unique ability of this approach to untangle the data manifolds without discarding the information provided by the time course of the data (e.g., in contrast to PCA-based methods) allows our approach to achieve high performance on a variety of real-life and benchmark datasets without any parameter adjustment.DTC also includes an algorithm to visualize the cluster-assignment activations across time, a feature not available in traditional clustering algorithms. This allows the localization of events in unlabeled time series data, and provides explanation (as opposed to black-box approaches) regarding the most informative data features for class assignment.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the application of deep learning in temporal clustering. The main contribution of our study is the formulation of an end-to-end deep learning algorithm that implements objective formulation to achieve meaningful temporal clustering. We carefully formulated the objective to encompass two crucial aspects essential for high clustering accuracy: an effective latent representation and a similarity metric which can be integrated into the learning structure. We demonstrate that the end-to-end optimization of our network for both reconstruction loss and clustering loss offers superior performance compared to cases where these two objectives are optimized separately. We also show that DTC outperforms current state-of-theart , k-Shape BID15 and hierarchical clustering with complete linkage, when evaluated on various real world time series datasets. In this work we addressed the question of unsupervised learning of patterns in temporal sequences, unsupervised event detection and clustering. Post-hoc labeling of the clusters, and comparison to ground-truth labels not used in training, reveals high degree of agreement between our unsupervised clustering results and human-labeled categories, on several types of datasets. This indicates graceful dimensionality reduction from inputs with extensive and complex temporal structure to one or fewdimensional space spanned by the cluster centroids. As most natural stimuli are time-continuous and unlabeled, the approach promises to be of great utility in real-world applications. Generalization to multichannel spatio-temporal input is straightforward and has been carried out as well; it will be described in more detail in a separate paper."
