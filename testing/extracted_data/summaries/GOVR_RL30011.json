    "content": "The Medal of Honor (MOH) is the nation's highest award for military valor. It is presented by the President in the name of Congress and is often called the Congressional Medal of Honor. Since its first presentation in 1863, nearly 3,500 MOHs have been awarded. In 1973, the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs issued a committee print, Vietnam Era Medal of Honor Recipients 1964-72, followed by the committee print, Medal of Honor Recipients: 1863-1978, in 1979. Both committee prints list recipients and provide the full text of the citation, which describes the actions that resulted in the awarding of the medal. This report covers additions and changes to the list of recipients of the medal since the release of the committee print. For further information, see CRS Report 95-519, Medal of Honor: History and Issues, by [author name scrubbed]. The official citations are not always consistent in wording for all recipients. Some of the citations do not contain information such as company, division, date of birth, or place of birth. An asterisk (*) indicates those individuals who were awarded their medal posthumously."
