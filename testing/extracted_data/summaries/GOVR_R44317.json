Health insurance-related programs and activities under Social Security include Title XI of the Social Security Act (SSA; P.L. 74-271), General Provisions, Peer Review, and Administrative Simplification; SSA Title XVIII, Medicare; SSA Title XIX, Medicaid; and SSA Title XXI, CHIP. This report includes only those expiring provisions for which congressional action would be needed to extend the application of a provision once the deadline is reached. Additionally, this report provides a list of Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and private health insurance provisions that have expired during the 114th Congress. Although the Congressional Research Service (CRS) has attempted to be comprehensive, it cannot guarantee that every relevant provision is included here. The report defines what constitutes an expiring provision, clarifies which issues do not meet the definition of an expiring provision, and lists the legislative history of each relevant program and policy that already has expired in the 114th Congress or is scheduled to expire between the date of this report and the end of the 114th Congress (i.e., after December 31, 2016). It also includes future deadlines, when applicable, for those programs and policies."
