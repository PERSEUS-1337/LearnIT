    "title": "AB 989",
    "content": "Existing law subjects any person under 18 years of age who commits a crime to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may adjudge that person to be a ward of the court, except as specified. Under existing law, juvenile court proceedings to declare a minor a ward of the court are commenced by the filing of a petition by the probation officer, the district attorney after consultation with the probation officer, or the prosecuting attorney, as specified. Existing law requires the juvenile court to order the petition of a minor who is subject to the jurisdiction of the court dismissed if the minor satisfactorily completes a term of probation or an informal program of supervision, as specified, and requires the court to seal all records in the custody of the juvenile court pertaining to that dismissed petition, except that the prosecuting attorney and the probation department of any county may have access to the records for the limited purpose of determining whether the minor is eligible for deferred entry of judgment. This bill would additionally authorize the prosecuting attorney and the probation department to have access to the records for the limited purpose of determining a minor\u2019s eligibility for informal supervision and would authorize the probation department of any county to have access to the records for the limited purpose of meeting federal Title IV-B and Title IV-E compliance. The bill would also authorize the probation department to access the records for the limited purpose of identifying the minor\u2019s previous court-ordered programs or placements, as specified. The bill would also authorize a law enforcement agency, probation department, court, or other local agency that has custody of the sealed record to access the record, as specified. This bill would incorporate changes to Section 786 of the Welfare and Institutions Code proposed by both this bill and AB 666, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, and this bill is chaptered last."
