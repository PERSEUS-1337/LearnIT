    "content": "The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA, P.L.93-406) protects the interests of participants and beneficiaries inprivate-sector employee benefit plans. It was passed in response to instances in which employers had failed toprudently manage pension funds, had terminated pension plans withoutsufficient assets to pay the benefits employees had earned, or had created impediments to earning a pension, suchas onerous age and service requirements. ERISA covers a number offringe benefits provided by employers, but most of its provisions deal with pension plans. Pension plans sponsoredby the federal, state, and local governments, or by churches generallyare exempt from ERISA. (This report will be updated for amendments to ERISA.)"
