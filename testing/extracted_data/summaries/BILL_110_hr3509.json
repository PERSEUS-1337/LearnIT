Limits the non-economic damages that an individual may recover to: (1) $250,000 from health care practitioners, (2) $250,000 from any single health care institution. And (3) $500,000 from the class of liable health care institutions. Limits the total damages, including compensatory damages, that a person may recover from any single liable health care practitioner to $1,400,000. Provides that an insurer of a health care practitioner or health care institution is not liable for damages in excess of the liability of the insured for rejecting a reasonable settlement offer within policy limits. Sets forth requirements for qualified expert reports. Allows periodic or accrual payment for future damages. Prohibits a jury from awarding punitive or exemplary damages against a health care practitioner or health care institution unless the jury is unanimous. Makes each person liable only for a proportionate share of the total damages that directly corresponds to that person's responsibility. Makes a person seeking damages liable for litigation costs incurred after rejection of a settlement offer if such person receives a judgment at trial that is significantly less favorable than the terms of the settlement offer. Requires claims to be brought: (1) within two years after the act or omission if the affected individual is over the age of 12. Or (2) before an affected individual under 12 attains the age of 14. Sets the statute of repose at no later than 10 years after the act or omission. Makes a health care practitioner or health care institution that provides emergency health care on a Good Samaritan basis immune from liability for damages caused by that care, except for willful or wanton negligence or more culpable misconduct."
