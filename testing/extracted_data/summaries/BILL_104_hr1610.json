    "content": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to imposition of the excise tax for failure of group health plans to meet certain requirements, to require any preexisting condition limitation period with respect to an individual who commences coverage after December 31, 1995, to be reduced by the aggregate of the individual's prior periods of coverage under a plan. Treats a period as zero if a break in coverage of greater than 60 days has occurred between the most recent qualified coverage and commencement of the current coverage. Prohibits, with respect to an individual whose periods of previous coverage are greater than zero, the establishment by a plan of eligibility, continuation, enrollment, or contribution requirements based on factors directly related to health status, medical condition, claims experience, receipt of health care, medical history, disability, or evidence of insurability."
