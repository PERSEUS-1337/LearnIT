Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to issue regulations to establish minimum standards to ensure that graduated percentages of civil turbojets weighing over 75,000 pounds comply with the stage 4 noise levels by specified dates. Requires the Secretary to request the International Civil Aviation Organization to add to its Work Programme the consideration of international standards for the phase-out of aircraft not complying with stage 4 noise levels. Declares that the requirements of this Act shall not apply to civil turbojet aircraft that operate outside of the 48 contiguous states."
