    "title": "An act to amend Sections 261 and 262 of the Penal Code, relating to rape.",
    "content": "Under existing law, rape is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished under certain circumstances, including, among others, circumstances in which sexual intercourse is accomplished where the person was prevented from resisting because of intoxication or where the person is incapable of resisting because the victim was unconscious of the nature of the act. This bill would instead provide that rape is accomplished where the person was incapable of giving consent because of intoxication or where the person is incapable of giving consent because the victim was unconscious of the nature of the act. By changing the definition of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
