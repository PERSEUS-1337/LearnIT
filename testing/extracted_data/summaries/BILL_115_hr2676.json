The Department of Justice (DOJ) may reduce by up to 10 the JAG allocation of a state or Indian tribe that fails to comply. The bill authorizes DOJ to make grants to law enforcement agencies to comply with reporting requirements, establish reporting systems, promote public awareness, and train law enforcement personnel with respect to use-of-force incidents."
