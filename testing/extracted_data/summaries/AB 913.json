    "title": "An act to amend Section 67381 of, and to add Section 67381.1 to, the Education Code, relating to student safety.",
    "content": "The Kristin Smart Campus Safety Act of 1998 requires the governing boards of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions, as defined, to adopt rules requiring each of their respective campuses to enter into a written agreement with local law enforcement agencies relating to certain violent crimes. These agreements are required to designate the law enforcement agency that will have operational responsibility for the investigation of these crimes. Existing law provides that these provisions do not apply to the University of California except to the extent that the regents, by appropriate resolution, make the provisions applicable. This bill would, for the Trustees of the California State University, the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions, and, subject to appropriate resolution, the Regents of the University of California, require these written agreements to designate the law enforcement agency that will have operational responsibility for the investigation of each sexual assault and hate crime, as defined, and require these written agreements to be reviewed, updated if necessary, and made available to the public by July 1, 2016, and every 5 years thereafter. Upon the governing board of a community college district adopting a rule requiring its campuses to update these agreements, the bill would subject the community college district and its campuses to the requirements imposed on other postsecondary institutions by the bill. The bill would encourage the governing board of each community college district to adopt a rule requiring its respective campuses to update these agreements. By expanding the duties of community college districts and local law enforcement agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
