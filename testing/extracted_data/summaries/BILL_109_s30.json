Prohibits a US agent or attorney from conditioning a civil or criminal charging decision relating to an organization on one or more specified actions, or from using one or more such actions as a factor in determining whether an organization or affiliated person is cooperating with the government. Numbers among the actions a US agent or attorney may not use as a charging decision condition or a cooperation-determining factor: (1) any valid assertion of the attorney-client privilege or privilege for attorney work product. (2) the provision of counsel to, or contribution to the legal defense fees or expenses of, an employee of the organization. (3) entry into a joint-defense, information-sharing, or common-interest agreement with an employee of the organization if the organization determines it has a common interest in defending against the investigation or enforcement matter, (4) the sharing of relevant information with an employee. Or (5) a failure to terminate an employee's employment, or otherwise sanction an employee, because of the employee's decision to exercise his or her constitutional rights or other legal protections in response to a government request. Prohibits a US agent or attorney from demanding or requesting that an organization or an affiliated person not take any such action."
