    "content": "Hong Kong Reversion Act - Directs the President to consider the performance of the Hong Kong Government and the actions of the Chinese Government when determining whether Hong Kong is not sufficiently autonomous to justify treatment under a particular US law different from that accorded China as required under the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. Directs the Secretary of State to include in each annual report to the Congress on conditions in Hong Kong, among other things, assessments of: (1) Hong Kong's or China's cooperation in securing certain agreements with the United States. And (2) the autonomy of Hong Kong and its customs territory . Authorizes extension of the International Organizations Immunities Act to the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices in the same manner as such Act may be extended to a public international organization in which the United States participates pursuant to any treaty or Act of the Congress. Authorizes the President to apply to such Offices certain provisions of the Agreement on State and Local Taxation of Foreign Employees of Public International Organizations."
