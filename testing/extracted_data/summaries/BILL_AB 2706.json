    "title": "AB 2706",
    "content": "Existing law establishes a system of public elementary and secondary schools in this state, and authorizes local educational agencies throughout the state to operate schools and provide instruction to pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive. This bill would appropriate, without regard to fiscal years, $2,000,000 from the General Fund to the Superintendent of Public Instruction to be allocated to specified local educational agencies for the purpose of implementing a pilot program to train teachers teaching kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, to more effectively utilize technology and digital resources within their instructional day, while also measuring and teaching the critical 21st century skills pupils need to succeed on California\u2019s next-generation online assessments, as well as to prepare pupils for college and career objectives, thereby making an appropriation. The bill would require the Superintendent to develop an application process for the allocation of funds appropriated for the implementation of the pilot program that gives priority to applicant local educational agencies that serve a large percentage of pupils eligible for free or reduced-price meals. The bill would authorize any local educational agency in the state to apply to the Superintendent for funding to implement the pilot program, as specified. The bill would specify topics to be included in the training provided to teachers and pupils participating in the pilot program. Funds appropriated by this bill would be applied toward the minimum funding requirements for school districts and community college districts imposed by Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution. Existing law requires the Commission on Teacher Credentialing to issue a 5-year preliminary multiple subject teaching credential authorizing instruction in a self-contained classroom, a 5-year preliminary single subject teaching credential authorizing instruction in departmentalized classes, or a 5-year preliminary education specialist credential authorizing instruction of special education pupils to an out-of-state prepared teacher who meets specified requirements, including that the teacher possess a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited institution of higher education. This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to those provisions and other related provisions."
