    "title": "An act to amend Section 273.5 of the Penal Code, relating to domestic violence.",
    "content": "Existing law makes it a crime, punishable by a fine, by imprisonment, or by both a fine and imprisonment, for a person to willfully inflict corporal injury injury, including, but not limited to, by strangulation or suffocation, resulting in a traumatic condition upon a person with whom the defendant has been in a specified domestic relationship. This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions. This bill would make it a crime, punishable by a fine, by imprisonment, or by both a fine and imprisonment, for a person to willfully inflict corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition by strangulation or suffocation upon a person with whom the defendant has been in a specified domestic relationship. By increasing the duties of local prosecutors, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
