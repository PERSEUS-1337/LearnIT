And (2) honor the nameless and forgotten men, women, and children who have gone unrecognized for their undeniable and weighty US contribution. Expresses the sense of Congress that the memorial should be situated in a specified area near the Lincoln Memorial. Requires the Secretary of the Interior and the National Capital Memorial Commission to determine a location for the memorial."
