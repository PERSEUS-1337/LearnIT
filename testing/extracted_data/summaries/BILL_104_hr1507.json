    "content": "Fair Pay Act of 1995 - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to prohibit discrimination in the payment of wages on account of sex, race, or national origin. Directs courts, in any action brought under this section for violation of such prohibition, to allow expert fees as part of the costs awarded to prevailing plaintiffs. Allows any such action to be maintained as a class action. Requires employers subject to such prohibition to preserve records which document and support the method, system, calculations, and other bases used by the employer in establishing, adjusting, and determining the wages paid to their employees, for periods of time prescribed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and make reports to the EEOC. Directs the EEOC to: (1) undertake studies and provide information and technical assistance to employers, labor organizations, and the general public concerning effective means available to implement the provisions of this Act. (2) carry on a continuing program of research, education, and technical assistance with specified components related to the purposes of this Act. And (3) include a separate evaluation and appraisal regarding the implementation of this Act in its annual report to the Congress."
