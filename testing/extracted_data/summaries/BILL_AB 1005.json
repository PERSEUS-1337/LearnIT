    "title": "AB 1005",
    "content": "Existing law, the California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act, requires a distributor to pay a redemption payment for every beverage container sold or offered for sale in the state by the distributor to the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery for deposit in the California Beverage Container Recycling Fund. Moneys in the fund are continuously appropriated to the department for certain payments, including market development payments. Existing law authorizes the department, until that authorization is repealed on January 1, 2017, to (1) annually expend up to $10,000,000 from the fund to make market development payments to an entity certified by the department as a recycling center, processor, or dropoff or collection program for empty plastic beverage containers that are subsequently washed and processed into flake, pellet, or other form, and made usable for the manufacture of a plastic product, or to a product manufacturer for empty plastic beverage containers that are subsequently washed and processed into flake, pellet, or other form, and used by that product manufacturer to manufacture a product, and to (2) expend additional amounts to make market development payments, calculated as provided. This bill would postpone that repeal until January 1, 2018. By extending the term of a continuous appropriation, this bill would make an appropriation."
