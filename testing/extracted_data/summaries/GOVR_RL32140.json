    "content": "During the drive to settle the western portion of the United States, Congress sought toencourage the expansion of railroads, at first through generous grants of rights of way and lands tothe great transcontinental railroads between 1862 and 1871, and later through the enactment of ageneral right of way statute. The 1875 General Railroad Right of Way Act permitted railroads toobtain a 200-foot federal right of way by running tracks across public lands. Some railroads alsoobtained rights of way by private purchase or through the exercise of state or federal powers ofeminent domain. Therefore, not all railroad rights of way are on federal lands, and the propertyinterest of a railroad in a right of way may vary. The courts have characterized the interest held bya railroad pursuant to a federally granted right of way variously: as a \"limited fee\" in the case of aland grant right of way, or as an easement in the case of a right of way under the 1875 Act. As railroads closed rail lines, questions arose as to the disposition of the lands within theformer rights of way. Many individual instances were resolved in separate legislation. In 1922,Congress enacted a general law to provide that federal railroad rights of way on federal lands becomethe property of the adjacent landowner or municipality through which the right of way passed. Thislaw is unclear in several respects -- for example, as to what procedures are sufficient to constitutean abandonment of a right of way, and on what authority Congress could provide for theestablishment of highways within the right of way after abandonment of the rail line. In 1988, inwhat is popularly known as the Rails to Trails Act, Congress opted to bank rail corridors, keepingthem available for possible future use as railroads and making them available for interim use asrecreational trails. Some cases have held that Rails to Trails results in takings of private property whennon-federal easements were involved. In the context of federal rights of way, recent cases have heldthat the federal government did not retain any interest in federal railroad rights of way when theunderlying lands were conveyed into private ownership, and therefore if an abandoned rail corridoris held for interim trail use, compensation is owed the adjacent landowners. However, Congress haslegislated numerous times over the years regarding federal railroad rights of way, as though Congressbelieved it had continuing authority over their ultimate disposition. Issues may continue to arisesurrounding the disposition of federal railroad rights of way, possibly involving, for example, theauthority of Congress over the rights of way, the nature of the interest held by the railroad, thevalidity of attempts by the railroad to convey all or part of that interest, and disputes betweenadjacent landowners over perceived entitlements to lands within a particular right of way. This report discusses the history of federal railroad rights of way and some of the casesaddressing them. It will be updated from time to time as circumstances warrant."
