    "title": "Common Sense Superfund Liability Relief Act of 1999",
    "content": "Adds provisions related to defenses to liability of an owner of property acquired after April 15, 1994, to deem a person to have made appropriate inquiry into the property's previous ownership and uses if the person establishes that an environmental site assessment was conducted which meets specified requirements and the person fulfills certain responsibilities concerning information compilation, exercise of appropriate care with respect to hazardous substances at the facility, and cooperation with those conducting response actions. Absolves from liability for response actions certain bona fide prospective purchasers or operators of facilities owned by such purchasers to the extent liability at a facility for a release or threat thereof is based solely on ownership or operation of a facility. Gives a lien upon a facility to the United States in any case in which there are unrecovered response costs not inconsistent with the National Contingency Plan incurred by the United States for which the owner is not liable by reason of this section and the action increases the facility's fair market value."
