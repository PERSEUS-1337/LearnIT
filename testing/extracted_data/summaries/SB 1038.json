    "title": "An act to amend Section 87408.6 of the Education Code, relating to community colleges.",
    "content": "Existing law prohibits a person from being employed by a community college in an academic or classified position unless the person has submitted to a tuberculosis examination within the past 60 days to determine that he or she is free of active tuberculosis. This bill would instead prohibit employment unless the person, within 60 days, has submitted to a tuberculosis risk assessment and, if tuberculosis risk factors are identified, has undergone a tuberculosis examination."
