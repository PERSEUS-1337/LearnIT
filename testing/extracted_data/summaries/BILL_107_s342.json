(2) school construction assistance to relieve overcrowded classrooms and reduce the use of portable classrooms. (3) hiring of additional experienced teachers who specialize in core subjects to provide increased individualized instruction. (4) alternative programs to educate and discipline chronically violent and disruptive students. And (5) assistance to help the LEA to establish a year-round school schedule that will allow increased pay for veteran teachers and reduce the need to hire additional teachers or construct new facilities. Provides for reservation of funds for Indian tribes. Requires allocation of grant funds to eligible LEAs as follows: (1) 80 percent in proportion to the number of children from families with incomes below the poverty line in the school district served. And (2) 20 percent in proportion to relative enrollments in public and private schools within LEA boundaries. Authorizes the Secretary to impose sanctions on violators of this Act or regulations under it, including reimbursement or ineligibility for additional funds for a period of years, depending on the severity of the misuse of funds."
