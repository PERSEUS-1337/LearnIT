    "content": "The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a laboratory of the Department of Commerce, is mandated to provide technical services to facilitate the competitiveness of U.S. industry. NIST is directed to offer support to the private sector for the development of precompetitive generic technologies and the diffusion of government-developed innovation to users in all segments of the American economy. Laboratory research is to provide measurement, calibration, and quality assurance techniques that underpin U.S. commerce, technological progress, improved product reliability, manufacturing processes, and public safety. President Trump requested $725.0 million in discretionary funding for NIST in FY2018. In March 2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) was enacted, providing $1,198.5 million in funding for NIST for FY2018. President Trump requested $629.1 million in discretionary funding for NIST in FY2019, $569.4 million (47.5%) below the FY2018 enacted level. The House-reported appropriations level for FY2019 is $985.0 million; the Senate-reported level is $1,037.5 million. In the absence of a year-long appropriation act for FY2019, NIST was funded under two continuing resolutions, first through December 7, 2018 (under P.L. 115-245), then through December 21, 2018 (under P.L. 115-298). NIST has been without appropriations since December 22, 2018. Following the start of the 116th Congress, the House passed H.R. 21, which would provide funding for each of the NIST accounts at the same levels as the Senate committee-passed bill from the 115th Congress (S. 3072). Concerns about the adequacy of federal funding for physical science and engineering research led to efforts by successive Presidents and Congresses to double funding for the NIST laboratory and construction accounts, together with the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy Office of Science. However, appropriations did not keep pace with authorization levels or presidential requests. In addition, the appropriations authorizations for the accounts targeted for doubling lapsed at the end of FY2013. Appropriations for the targeted NIST accounts increased by 42.3% from FY2006 to FY2016. Funding for NIST extramural programs directed toward increased private sector commercialization has been a topic of congressional debate. Some Members of Congress have expressed skepticism over a \"technology policy\" based on providing federal funds to industry for development of precompetitive generic technologies. This approach, coupled with pressures to balance the federal budget, led to significant reductions in funding for NIST. The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), which accounted for over 50% of the FY1995 NIST budget, were subsequently proposed for elimination. In 2007, ATP was terminated and replaced by the Technology Innovation Program (TIP). TIP was subsequently defunded in the FY2012 appropriations legislation. President Trump has proposed the elimination of funding for the MEP program in FY2019. In December 2014, Congress enacted the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 (Title VII of Division B of P.L. 113-235), establishing a Network for Manufacturing Innovation (also referred to as the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation or NNMI). The explanatory statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) directed NIST to use an open competition to select the technological focus areas of industry-driven manufacturing institutes. Upon completion of its first competition, NIST announced its selection of the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL) in December 2016. Congress appropriated $15 million in FY2018 funding for NIST to continue its support for NIIMBL and to coordinate network activities. In total, 14 NNMI institutes have been established by the Department of Defense (8), Department of Energy (5), and Department of Commerce (1)."
