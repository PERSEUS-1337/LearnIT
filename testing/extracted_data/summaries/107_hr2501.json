    "content": "Appalachian Regional Development Reauthorization Act of 2001 - Amends the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 to direct the President to establish the Interagency Coordinating Council on Appalachia. Authorizes the Appalachian Regional Commission to provide technical assistance and make grants, enter into contracts, and otherwise provide funds to: (1) increase affordable access to advanced telecommunications in the region. (2) provide education and training for people, businesses, and governments in the region in the use of telecommunications technology. (3) develop relevant technology readiness programs for industry groups and businesses in the region. And (4) support entrepreneurial opportunities in information technology in the region. Eliminates the growth center criteria as a factor in considering programs and projects to be given assistance under the Act. Directs that, for each fiscal year, at least half of the grant expenditures approved by the Commission support activities or projects that benefit counties for which distressed county designations are in effect. Modifies Act provisions to direct that not more than 75 percent of the costs of any activity eligible for financial assistance for a development district that includes one or more counties for which a distressed county designation is in effect be provided from funds appropriated to carry out the Act. Adds Edmonson, Hart, and Metcalfe ( Kentucky), and Grenada, Montgomery, and Panola (Mississippi) to the counties included in the Appalachian region. Reauthorizes appropriations and extends the Act until October 1, 2006."
