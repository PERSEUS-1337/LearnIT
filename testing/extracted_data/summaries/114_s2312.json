    "content": "DME Access and Stabilization Act of 2015 This bill amends titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to modify provisions relating to payment for durable medical equipment (DME) under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. With respect to DME furnished in areas that are not competitive acquisition areas, current regulations require the Centers for Medicare amp, Medicaid (CMS) to phase in, over a two-year period,nbsp, Medicare payment adjustments using information from competitivenbsp. Acquisition programs. The bill codifies this requirement and specifies that CMSnbsp. Shall adjust fee schedule amounts to the lesser of: (1) a specified percentage of the regional amount. And (2) the amount that would otherwise be determined according to the fee schedule, with specifiednbsp, adjustments. In determiningnbsp, Medicare paymentnbsp, adjustments for areas that are not competitive acquisition areas,nbsp, CMS shallnbsp. Solicit stakeholder input and take into account several specified factors. CMSnbsp, may not establishnbsp. A ceiling on competitive bids submitted for DME that is less than the amount that would otherwise be paid under Medicare. The Medicare Beneficiary Ombudsman shall evaluate the impact of the competitivenbsp, acquisitionnbsp. Program on beneficiary health status and health outcomes. The bill limits federal Medicaid reimbursement rates to states for DME to the rates that would be paid for such items under Medicare."
