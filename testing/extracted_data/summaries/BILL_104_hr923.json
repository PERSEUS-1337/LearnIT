Requires the Official Mass Mailing Allowance to be: (1) available only for postage for any mass mailing sent by a Member as franked mail, (2) the sole source of funding for any such postage. And (3) available in a session of Congress in an amount that does not exceed the total amount allocated to the Official Mail Allowance of a Member in such session. Treats the Official Mass Mailing Allowance and mass mailings separately from the Official Mail Allowance. Continues the applicability of current provisions of law relating to mass mailings sent by a Member or Member-elect subject to certain conditions. Sets forth requirements for the submission of samples of mass mailings to the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards. Revises the formula for determining the Official Mail Allowance . Prohibits the transfer of any amount to or from the Official Mail Allowance of a Member."
