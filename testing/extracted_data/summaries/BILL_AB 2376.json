    "content": "The County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 (CERL) establishes retirement plans, known as Retirement Plan D and Retirement Plan E, that are applicable in the retirement system in Los Angeles County and prescribes procedures for members to transfer between those plans. CERL defines \u201cRetirement Plan E\u201d to mean the noncontributory retirement plan established by specific provisions, and defines \u201cRetirement Plan D\u201d to mean the contributory retirement plan otherwise available to new members of the retirement system on the transfer date. This bill would revise the definition of Retirement Plan D to, instead, refer to the contributory retirement plan otherwise available to members of the system between June 1, 1979, and December 31, 2012, inclusive. CERL provides for the retirement system in Los Angeles County specific ages and pension allowances for normal and early retirement. Under CERL, a member of a CERL retirement system who is eligible to retire at 50 years of age pursuant to specified statute, or who is required to retire because of age while a member of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (PERS), a CERL retirement system in another county, the State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System (STRS), or a retirement system of any other public agency of the state that has established reciprocity with PERS subject to certain conditions, but who cannot retire concurrently from PERS, a CERL retirement system in another county, STRS, or a retirement system of any other public agency of the state that has established reciprocity with PERS subject to certain conditions, is entitled to have final compensation and service determined under specific statutes as if the member had retired concurrently under that other system . Provisions of CERL specifically applicable to Los Angeles County, among other things, apply reciprocal benefits, including the concurrent retirement exception, to the retirement system in Los Angeles County. This bill would amend provisions of CERL specifically applicable to Los Angeles County to provide that the concurrent retirement exception applies to a member of the retirement system in Los Angeles County eligible to retire at 55 years of age and would state that the amendment is declaratory of existing law. CERL sets forth the membership composition for boards of retirement, as specified. Under that law, the retirement board in specified counties is comprised of 9 members and an alternate member, as specified. That law also authorizes specified counties to appoint an alternate retired member to the office of the 8th member of the board and authorizes the alternate retired member to vote as a member of the board only in the event the 8th member is absent from a board meeting for any cause. This bill would additionally authorize the alternate retired member to vote as a member of the board if the 8th member is present and both the 2nd and 3rd, both the 2nd and 7th, or both the 3rd and 7th members are absent for any cause. Under CERL, except as specified, the management of a retirement system is vested in the board of retirement. CERL authorizes such a board to make regulations not inconsistent with that law, and requires that the regulations include specific provisions, including provisions for the filing of a sworn statement by every person who is or becomes a member, showing date of birth, nature and duration of employment with the county, compensation received, and other information as is required by the board. This bill would authorize those regulations, in lieu of a sworn statement, to provide for the submission by a member\u2019s employer to the retirement association of the information otherwise required in a sworn statement, in a form determined by the retirement association."
