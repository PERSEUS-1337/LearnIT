    "content": "Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish final numerical sediment quality criteria for the ten toxic, persistent, or bioaccumulative substances that are most likely to adversely affect human health and the environment. Provides for review and revision of the list of such substances every three years. Directs the Administrator to revise the hazard ranking system to ensure that the system more accurately assesses the health and environmental risks from aquatic sites with contaminated sediments (as such term is applied under provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act . Prohibits such assessment from including consideration of costs of carrying out response actions or requiring identification of the source of a hazardous substance release. Authorizes the Administrator to expend up to $3 million per fiscal year out of the Hazardous Substance Superfund to carry out response and other corrective actions at facilities containing contaminated sediments . Requires the Administrator, from the national survey of data regarding aquatic sediment quality conducted under the Water Resources Development Act of 1992, to identify the 20 facilities containing contaminated sediments that are most likely to adversely affect health and the environment and that have not been the subject of Federal or State response actions or other corrective actions. Directs the Administrator to prepare and submit to the Congress a comprehensive scoring package under the hazard ranking system for each facility unless a State or remedial action planning committee objects to the assessment necessary for scoring in an area or watershed under its jurisdiction. Provides that criteria for determining priorities among hazardous substance releases for purposes of taking remedial action shall not be based on the extent to which the President can identify potentially responsible parties or specific sources of a release. Requires the Administrator to report to the Congress on the extent to which the hazard ranking system has achieved certain objectives regarding accurate assessment of health and environmental risks posed by facilities and water contamination risks."
