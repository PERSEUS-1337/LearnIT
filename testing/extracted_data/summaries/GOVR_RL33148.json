    "content": "On August 16, 2004, President Bush announced a program of sweeping changes to thenumbers and locations of military basing facilities at overseas locations, now known as theIntegrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy (IGPBS) or Global Posture Review. Roughly 70,000personnel would return from overseas locations from Europe and Asia to bases in the continentalUnited States (CONUS). Other overseas forces would be redistributed within current host nationssuch as Germany and South Korea, while new bases would be established in nations of EasternEurope, Central Asia, and Africa. In the Department of Defense's (DOD) view, these locationswould be better able to respond to potential trouble spots. The second session of the 109th Congresscould have to consider approval of the DOD proposal, or review appropriations requests forconstruction of infrastructure, increased impact aid to local communities, and new acquisitionprograms for mobility and logistics capabilities (such as airlift). Finally, the Senate may have toconsider ratification of new or revised treaties. In August 2005, the congressionally mandated Commission on the Review of OverseasMilitary Facility Structure of the United States (also known as the \"Overseas Basing Commission\")formally reported its findings. It disagreed with the \"timing and synchronization\" of the DODoverseas re-basing initiative. It also saw the initiative as potentially at odds with stresses on the forcefrom operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and possibly hampering recruiting and retention. TheCommission questioned whether sufficient interagency coordination had occurred. It expresseddoubts that the military had enough airlift and sealift to make the strategy work, and noted that DODhad likely underestimated the cost of all aspects associated with the moves (DOD budgeted $4billion, the Commission estimated $20 billion). DOD disagreed with much of the Commission'sanalysis. Meanwhile, some have voiced concern that the DOD plan would harm long-standingalliance relationships, while others questioned DOD's plans to accommodate the thousands of troopsreturning to the U.S. Critics also argued that the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)round, which entered into force on November 9, 2005, and the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR),which is to be completed in early 2006, should have been finalized before completing the overseasbasing plan. Congress acted on some of its concerns with the re-basing plan in the FY2006 DefenseAuthorization Act, tasking DOD with follow-on studies of overseas basing criteria and mobilityrequirements. It also directs DOD to further examine the state and local impacts on installationsgaining personnel from the re-basing implementation. Recent international diplomatic and security developments could further influence debate onoverseas basing. Uzbekistan, one of the test cases for the new strategy, recently evicted U.S. forcesfrom the base in that Central Asian nation. Some analysts argue this eviction was prompted byRussia and China, who have begun to express concern with U.S. expansion of influence in theregion. This report will be updated as necessary."
