    "content": "The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), signed into law on February 9, 2018, creates a new joint select committee of the House and Senate. The Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans, made up of 16 Members of the House and Senate\u2014four chosen by each of the chambers' party leaders\u2014is intended to formulate recommendations and legislative language that will \"significantly improve the solvency of multiemployer pension plans and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\" The law directs the joint select committee to, no later than November 30, 2018, vote on a report, which, if approved, is to be submitted along with legislative language to the President, Vice President, the Speaker of the House, and the majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate. The legislative recommendations of the joint select committee are subject to consideration under expedited procedures in the Senate, which differ slightly from the procedures the Senate normally uses to process most legislation. These procedures are intended to allow the Senate to reach a timely vote on whether to consider legislation embodying the recommendations of the joint select committee. Under the terms of the act, the Senate is directed to vote on a motion to consider any reported joint committee bill before the conclusion of the 115th Congress (2017-2018). The support of at least three-fifths of the Senate would be necessary to take up and approve the measure. The act does not provide any special procedures governing House consideration of such legislation. This report discusses the structure, powers, and funding of the Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans and provides an overview of the parliamentary procedures the chambers may use to consider its work product. The report includes contact information for CRS policy analysts who work on issues related to the structure and policy work of the panel.
