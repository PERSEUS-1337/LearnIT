    "content": "On October 5, 2004, Chiron (pronounced K\u00c4\u00ab\u00cc\u0081-ron), a California-based biotechnologycompany, notified U.S. health officials that British regulatory authorities had suspended productionof influenza (\"flu\") vaccine in its plant in Liverpool, England, due to vaccine safety concerns. Theplant was slated to provide between 46 million and 48 million doses of flu vaccine for the U.S.market for the imminent 2004-2005 flu season, almost half the expected nationwide supply. The announcement of Chiron's suspension prompted the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) and its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to re-define thegroups most at risk, to be given priority for the available vaccine doses. CDC coordinatednationwide tracking of available vaccine, high-priority individuals who might need it, and infectionssignaling the start of the winter flu season. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sent a teamto the Liverpool plant to determine whether any of the Chiron vaccine lots could be salvaged (theylater determined that they could not) and sought additional sources of vaccine from othermanufacturers, domestically and abroad. States launched plans to locate and re-distribute or rationvaccine, and responded to reports of price-gouging. The response of local, state, and federalagencies was limited because most of the U.S. flu vaccine market is in private hands. Several bills were introduced in response to the shortage, and proposals introduced earlierin the 108th Congress, in response to flu vaccine supply problems during the 2003-2004 season,received renewed attention. Two hearings on influenza vaccine were held immediately prior toannouncement of the shortage, indicating Congress's ongoing interest in this issue. Additionalhearings were held after the shortage was announced. Congress also passed (in P.L. 108-357 , theAmerican Jobs Creation Act of 2004) a provision adding flu vaccine to the National Vaccine InjuryCompensation Program (VICP), and provided $100 million in FY2005 funding for influenzapreparedness, which could be used to purchase flu vaccine. The shortage illustrates the challenges that the federal government faces in responding topublic health threats. Much of the responsibility for preventing or managing the shortage rests withthe states or with the private sector, and the threshold over which the federal government wouldwrest control from either appears high. As a result, the federal government may appear disorganizedor unresponsive. The shortage also raises questions about the role and effectiveness of governmentin rationing a scarce health resource. As communities across the country saw long lines of sick and elderly citizens waiting in vainfor flu vaccine, and concerns about the supply for the 2005-2006 season emerged as well,policymakers asked why the system to provide this potentially life-saving product was so unreliable,and what could be done about it. Some have expressed concern that this situation bodes ill forpreparedness for an influenza pandemic or a large-scale bioterrorism event. This report will describethe system of flu vaccine production and delivery, the causes of supply problems, and options forimprovement. It will be updated as circumstances warrant."
