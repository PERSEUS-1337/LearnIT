    "content": "The General Services Administration (GSA) controls more than 8,700 owned and leased buildings with 422 million square feet of floor space, which represents about 12.6% of the government's 3.354 billion total building square footage .Sometimes referred to as the \"government's landlord,\" GSA has the authority to acquire, operate, and dispose of real property on behalf of other federal agencies, including the judiciary. Its portfolio includes courthouses, land ports of entry, and federal office space. Prior to seeking appropriations, GSA is required to obtain congressional authorization for constructing, purchasing, leasing, or renovating real property. To that end, GSA submits a prospectus to two committees\u2014the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure\u2014for each proposal that exceeds $2.85 million. The prospectus provides detailed information about the project, including its location and estimated cost. By law, a project that exceeds the $2.85 million threshold may not receive appropriations unless both committees pass resolutions approving of the prospectus. While the prospectus process provides Congress an opportunity to evaluate GSA real property activities, oversight may be limited by data that are not available to the authorizing committees. GSA's prospectuses, for example, do not always include a comparison of the costs of leasing versus owning space over time, which means Congress is making decisions without knowing whether a proposed project is the most cost effective option. Similarly, many lease prospectuses do not include the cost of altering space to meet agency needs, such as upgraded security, which means authorizing committees may not be aware of the full costs of the projects they are considering. In addition, there are instances where GSA fails to submit prospectuses for projects that exceed the threshold. Several bills in the 113th Congress propose reforms to the real property process, particularly the process for disposing of unneeded buildings. Examples include the Excess Federal Building and Property Disposal Act (H.R. 328), the Federal Real Property Asset Management Reform Act (S. 1398), and the Civilian Property Realignment Act (H.R. 695 and S. 1715). Another bill, the Public Building Service Savings and Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 2612) proposes changing the prospectus approval process. The bill would require GSA to include in its prospectuses a plan to offset any new space acquired by eliminating an equal amount of existing space from its inventory. It would also require GSA to ensure it is obtaining the best possible rental rate for leases that fall below the prospectus threshold. Other provisions would require GSA to provide the authorizing committees with an annual report listing all of the leases it entered into during the previous fiscal year; to notify Congress if a project's costs increased by 5% or more; and, when requesting authorization to acquire space, to explain why existing federal space could not be used. H.R. 2612 could mitigate several long-standing weaknesses in the prospectus process. The bill proposes to help control costs by ensuring that the authorizing committees have access to comparative cost data, and by requiring GSA to provide cost estimates of alterations associated with a new lease that are not included in the estimate of rent. In addition, H.R. 2612 might enhance oversight by requiring GSA to provide a more detailed justification for requesting new space, and to notify Congress when a project exceeds the cost and size parameters established in the prospectus. This report will be updated as events warrant."
