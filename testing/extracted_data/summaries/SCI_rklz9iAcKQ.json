    "content": "We present Deep Graph Infomax (DGI), a general approach for learning node representations within graph-structured data in an unsupervised manner. DGI relies on maximizing mutual information between patch representations and corresponding high-level summaries of graphs---both derived using established graph convolutional network architectures. The learnt patch representations summarize subgraphs centered around nodes of interest, and can thus be reused for downstream node-wise learning tasks. In contrast to most prior approaches to unsupervised learning with GCNs, DGI does not rely on random walk objectives, and is readily applicable to both transductive and inductive learning setups. We demonstrate competitive performance on a variety of node classification benchmarks, which at times even exceeds the performance of supervised learning. We have presented Deep Graph Infomax (DGI), a new approach for learning unsupervised representations on graph-structured data. By leveraging local mutual information maximization across the graph's patch representations, obtained by powerful graph convolutional architectures, we are able to obtain node embeddings that are mindful of the global structural properties of the graph. This enables competitive performance across a variety of both transductive and inductive classification tasks, at times even outperforming relevant supervised architectures."
