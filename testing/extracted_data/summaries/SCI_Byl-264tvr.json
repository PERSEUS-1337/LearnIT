    "content": "Relational reasoning, the ability to model interactions and relations between objects, is valuable for robust multi-object tracking and pivotal for trajectory prediction. In this paper, we propose MOHART, a class-agnostic, end-to-end multi-object tracking and trajectory prediction algorithm, which explicitly accounts for permutation invariance in its relational reasoning. We explore a number of permutation invariant architectures and show that multi-headed self-attention outperforms the provided baselines and better accounts for complex physical interactions in a challenging toy experiment. We show on three real-world tracking datasets that adding relational reasoning capabilities in this way increases the tracking and trajectory prediction performance, particularly in the presence of ego-motion, occlusions, crowded scenes, and faulty sensor inputs. To the best of our knowledge, MOHART is the first fully end-to-end multi-object tracking from vision approach applied to real-world data reported in the literature. Real-world environments can be rich and contain countless types of interacting objects. Intelligent autonomous agents need to understand both the objects and interactions between them if they are to operate in those environments. This motivates the need for class-agnostic algorithms for tracking multiple objects-a capability that is not supported by the popular tracking-by-detection paradigm. In tracking-by-detection, objects are detected in each frame independently, e. g. , by a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) such as YOLO (Redmon et al. (2016) ), and then linked across frames. Algorithms from this family can achieve high accuracy, provided sufficient labelled data to train the object detector, and given that all encountered objects can be associated with known classes, but fail when faced with objects from previously unseen categories. Hierarchical attentive recurrent tracking (HART) is a recently-proposed, alternative method for single-object tracking (SOT), which can track arbitrary objects indicated by the user (Kosiorek et al. (2017) ). This is done by providing an initial bounding-box, which may be placed over any part of the image, regardless of whether it contains an object or what class the object is. HART efficiently processes just the relevant part of an image using spatial attention; it also integrates object detection, feature extraction, and motion modelling into one network, which is trained fully end-to-end. Contrary to tracking-by-detection, where only one video frame is typically processed at any given time to generate bounding box proposals, end-to-end learning in HART allows for discovering complex visual and spatio-temporal patterns in videos, which is conducive to inferring what an object is and how it moves. In the original formulation, HART is limited to the single-object modality-as are other existing end-to-end trackers (Kahou et al. (2017); Rasouli Danesh et al. (2019) ; Gordon et al. (2018) ). In this work, we present MOHART, a class-agnostic tracker with complex relational reasoning capabilities provided by a multi-headed self-attention module (Vaswani et al. (2017) ; Lee et al. (2019) ). MOHART infers the latent state of every tracked object in parallel, and uses self-attention to inform per-object states about other tracked objects. This helps to avoid performance loss under self-occlusions of tracked objects or strong camera motion. Moreover, since the model is trained end-to-end, it is able to learn how to manage faulty or missing sensor inputs. See fig. 1 for a high-level illustration of MOHART. In order to track objects, MOHART estimates their states, which can be naturally used to predict future trajectories over short temporal horizons, which is especially useful for planning in the context of autonomous agents. MOHART can be trained simultaneously for object tracking and trajectory prediction at the same time, thereby increasing statistical efficiency of learning. In contrast to prior art, where trajectory prediction and object tracking are usually addressed as separate problems with unrelated solutions, our work show trajectory prediction and object tracking are best addressed jointly. Section 2 describes prior art in tracking-by-detection, end-to-end tracking and predestrian trajectory prediction. In Section 3, we describe our approach, which uses a permutation-invariant self-attention module to enable tracking multiple objects end-to-end with relational reasoning. Section 4 contrasts our approach with multi-object trackers which do not explicitly enforce permutation invariance but have the capacity to learn it, simpler permutation-invariant architectures, as well as multiple single-object trackers running in parallel. We show that multi-headed self-attention significantly outperforms other approaches. Finally, in Section 5, we apply MOHART to real world datasets and show that permutation-invariant relational reasoning leads to consistent performance improvement compared to HART both in tracking and trajectory prediction. With MOHART, we introduce an end-to-end multi-object tracker that is capable of capturing complex interactions and leveraging these for precise predictions as experiments both on toy and real world data show. However, the experiments also show that the benefit of relational reasoning strongly depends on the nature of the data. The toy experiments showed that in an entirely deterministic world relational reasoning was much less important than in a stochastic environment. Amongst the real-world dataset, the highest performance gains from relational reasoning were achieved on the MOTChallenge dataset, which features crowded scenes, ego-motion and occlusions."
