    "content": "Federal personal property is generally defined as anything the government owns that is not real property. Common examples of personal property include furniture, cars, laptops, scientific equipment, and machinery. Sound management of the government's personal property inventory\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is valued at more than $1 trillion\u00e2\u0080\u0094is necessary to mitigate the risk of waste, fraud, and loss. Federal statutes and regulations require agencies to regularly survey their personal property inventories and dispose of items they no longer need (excess personal property). When an agency identifies excess property, it must first offer it at no charge to other federal agencies. If excess property is not transferred to another federal agency, it is then declared \"surplus\" and may be transferred to a State Agency for Surplus Property (SASP) for distribution to state and local governments and nonprofits. Surplus personal property that is not donated may be sold to the public. Unsold surplus property may be abandoned or destroyed (including through recycling). Personal property surveys may identify items that are still needed, are near the end of their useful lives, and need to be replaced. Agencies have the authority to exchange (trade in) or sell the items that need to be replaced and apply the credit (from an exchange) or sales proceeds to the acquisition of similar items. The method of replacement chosen\u00e2\u0080\u0094exchange or sale\u00e2\u0080\u0094should maximize the potential offset to the cost of acquiring new items. The government may realize cost savings when agencies regularly survey their inventories and dispose of excess and surplus property in a timely manner. Federal expenditures may be reduced when one agency's excess personal property is used to fill another agency's need and when replacement items are acquired in the most cost-effective manner. Federal expenditures may be further reduced if, as a result of disposing of unneeded items, agencies are able to decrease the amount of space needed to store personal property. Similarly, state and local governments and nonprofits may be able to reduce their expenditures if they obtain surplus federal personal property at no charge. According to federal auditors, agencies do not consistently fulfill the government's personal property disposal requirements. Some agencies do not regularly survey their inventories\u00e2\u0080\u0094often because they have not identified who is responsible for implementing the surveys. Agencies have been allowed to establish their own threshold for accountable personal property\u00e2\u0080\u0094items with longer useful lives and higher acquisition costs\u00e2\u0080\u0094below which items are not tracked. As a consequence, some agencies have set accountability thresholds higher than others, thereby excluding more items from regular monitoring and disposition. Agencies have also been able to set their own thresholds for capitalized personal property, which are the items with the longest lives and highest acquisition costs. Capitalized personal property is subject to additional reporting and evaluation requirements, so higher thresholds reduce the scope of oversight. Similarly, some agencies do not identify and dispose of unneeded personal property on an ongoing basis. Rather, they may wait until they face a \"triggering event,\" such as an office relocation or other real property transition. Without adequate planning for these events, the disposal of unneeded personal property could potentially delay the project and increase costs. Many agencies are unclear on how to use their exchange/sale authorities and often do not choose the option that would provide the greatest potential financial benefits to the government. The Federal Personal Property Management Act of 2018 ( P.L. 115-419 ) seeks to address these inconsistent policies and practices. The legislation requires the General Services Administration (GSA) to establish government-wide capitalization and accountability thresholds. It also requires GSA to issue guidance that directs agencies to conduct an annual inventory and assessment of capitalized personal property to identify which items, if any, are no longer needed and should be declared excess. The guidance must also require agencies to regularly inventory and assess their accountable personal property. Implementation of the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2017 (FASTA; P.L. 114-287 ) may result in the disposal of dozens or hundreds of government buildings within the same time frame. FASTA requires agencies to work with GSA to develop a list of recommended real property projects, including the sale, conveyance, consolidation, and reconfiguration of space. GSA submits the recommendations to a newly established Public Buildings Reform Board, which reviews them and submits a revised list to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) director. If the OMB director approves of the list in its entirety, then all of the recommendations must be implemented within six years. Incorporating personal property plans into the FASTA process may mitigate the risk of delays resulting from the disposition of excess items."
