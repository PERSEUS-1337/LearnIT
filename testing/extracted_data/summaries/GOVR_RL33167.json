    "content": "Since its founding in 1949, the People's Republic of China (PRC) has exerted great effort inmanipulating the flow of information and prohibiting the dissemination of viewpoints that criticizethe government or stray from the official Communist party view. The introduction of Internettechnology in the mid-1990's presented a challenge to government control over news sources, andby extension, over public opinion. While the Internet has developed rapidly, broadened access tonews, and facilitated mass communications in China, many forms of expression online, as in othermass media, are still significantly stifled. Empirical studies have found that China has one of the most sophisticated content-filteringInternet regimes in the world. The Chinese government employs increasingly sophisticated methodsto limit content online, including a combination of legal regulation, surveillance, and punishmentto promote self-censorship, as well as technical controls. U.S. government efforts to defeat Internet\"jamming\" include funding through the Broadcasting Board of Governors to providecounter-censorship software to Chinese Internet users to access Voice of America (VOA) and RadioFree Asia (RFA) in China. As U.S. investments in China and bilateral trade have surged in the past several years andChina has developed its communications infrastructure, Chinese society has undergone rapidchanges while the PRC government has continued to repress political dissent. Many U.S. observers,including government officials, have argued that economic openness and the growth of the Internetin China would help bring about political liberalization in China. However, contrary to facilitatingfreedom, some private U.S. companies have been charged with aiding or complying with ChineseInternet censorship. Private U.S. companies that provide Internet hardware, such as routers, as wellas those that provide Internet services such as Web-log (blog) hosting or search portals, have beenaccused of ignoring international standards for freedom of expression when pursuing businessopportunities in the PRC market. In the 108th Congress, the provisions of the \"Global Internet Freedom Act\" ( H.R. 48 ) were subsumed into the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2004-05 ( H.R. 1950 ) and passed by the House on July 16, 2003. Christopher Cox reintroduced the bill( H.R. 2216 ) to the 109th Congress in May 2005. If passed, the act would authorize $50million for FY2006 and FY2007 to develop and implement a global Internet freedom policy. Theact would also establish an office within the International Broadcasting Bureau with the sole missionof countering Internet jamming by repressive governments. On February 1, 2006, the CongressionalHuman Rights Caucus held a hearing entitled, \"Human Rights and the Internet -- The People'sRepublic of China.\" On February 15, 2006, the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Human Rights andInternational Operations of the House International Relations Committee will hold a joint hearingwith the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific regarding the Internet and censorship in China. This report will be updated periodically."
