    "content": "Cuba remains a hard-line Communist state, with a poor record on human rights. Fidel Castrohas ruled since he led the Cuban Revolution, ousting the corrupt government of Fulgencio Batistafrom power in 1959. With the cutoff of assistance from the former Soviet Union, Cuba experiencedsevere economic deterioration from 1989 to 1993. There has been some improvement since 1994as Cuba has implemented limited reforms. Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy toward Cuba has consisted largely of isolating the islandnation through comprehensive economic sanctions. The Bush Administration has essentiallycontinued this policy. The principal tool of policy remains comprehensive sanctions, which weremade stronger with the Cuban Democracy Act (CDA) in 1992 and the Cuban Liberty andDemocratic Solidarity Act in 1996, often referred to as the Helms/Burton legislation. Anothercomponent of U.S. policy consists of support measures for the Cuban people, including privatehumanitarian donations and U.S.-sponsored radio and television broadcasting to Cuba. In May 2002,President Bush announced a new initiative that includes several measures designed to reach out tothe Cuban people. There appears to be broad agreement on the overall objective of U.S. policy toward Cuba --to help bring democracy and respect for human rights to the island. But there are several schools ofthought on how to achieve that objective. Some advocate a policy of keeping maximum pressureon the Cuban government until reforms are enacted, while continuing current U.S. efforts to supportthe Cuban people. Others argue for an approach, sometimes referred to as constructive engagement,that would lift some U.S. sanctions that they believe are hurting the Cuban people, and move towardengaging Cuba in dialogue. Still others call for a swift normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations bylifting the U.S. embargo. Policy debate in the past several years has focused on whether to maintainU.S. restrictions on food and medical exports as well as on travel to Cuba. Legislative initiatives introduced in the 107th Congress reflected these divergent views on thedirection of U.S. policy toward Cuba and also covered a range of issues including human rights, foodand medical exports, travel restrictions, drug interdiction cooperation, and broadcasting to Cuba.Many of these will likely be introduced in the 108th Congress. In the second session of the 107thCongress, the House version of the FY2003 Treasury Department appropriations bill, H.R. 5120 , included three Cuba provisions that would have eased restrictions on travel,remittances, and U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba; the Senate version of the bill, S. 2740 ,as reported out of committee, would have eased restrictions on travel to Cuba. Final action on themeasure was not completed before the end of the 107th Congress; the 108th Congress will face earlyaction on these and other appropriations measures with Cuba provisions. This report will not be updated. It reflects legislative action through the end of the 107thCongress."
