(2) limit the cost to qualified candidates of broadcasting time for pre-election political advertising to the lowest rate charged for any time in the same period. And (3) prohibit any broadcast licensee from preempting the use of any such time purchased by a qualified candidate. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to mandate certain aural and visual political advertising requirements which unambiguously identify the candidate, the candidate's authorized political committee or its agents, and in the broadcast media the sponsor of such political advertising."
