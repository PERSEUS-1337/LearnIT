The report shall include, with respect to each major trading partner of the United States: (1) a description of the laws, policies, and practices of the country with respect to foreign investment. And (2) an assessment of the transparency of the process for making such laws, policies, and practices. The report shall also include the determination of the office whether each major trading partner: (1) has high barriers to investment by US persons. (2) has recently taken measures that constitute barriers to investment by US persons or has indicated an intention to take such measures. Or (3) has investment laws, policies, and practices that should be monitored. If the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States recommends that the President not suspend or prohibit a transaction made by a party that is subject to the jurisdiction of a high barrier country, it shall provide an explanation of the reasons for its recommendation."
