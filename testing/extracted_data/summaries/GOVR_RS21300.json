    "content": "The United States welcomed the successful October conclusion of 2002 elections inthe Indian state of Jammu andKashmir, where nearly half of the electorate cast ballots. The elections resulted in the ousting of the long-dominantNational Conference party, allies of thenational coalition-leading Bharatiya Janata Party, thus bolstering the credibility of the process and dampeningcriticism from some quarters that the electionswere flawed or \"farcical.\" The opposition Indian National Congress and the regional People's Democratic Party(PDP) won a combined 36 seats in the stateassembly, and Congress leader Sonia Gandhi agreed to a first-ever power-sharing coalition. PDP leader MuftiMohammed Sayeed has assumed the office ofChief Minister vowing to bring a \"healing touch\" to state politics. His \"common minimum program\" includescontroversial policies -- including the freeing ofjailed political prisoners -- that have been lauded by some and criticized by others. The new government's seemingmoderation has brought renewed hopes forpeace in the troubled region. The United States had urged the holding of free and fair elections to be followed by renewed dialogue betweenIndia and Pakistan to resolve their long-runningdispute. India has made clear that it will not engage such dialogue until Islamabad has put an end to cross-borderinfiltration of Islamic militants intoIndian-held Kashmir. Following the elections, New Delhi announced a major troop redeployment after a tenseten-month standoff at the India-Pakistan frontier. Militant separatist groups in both Pakistan and Kashmir have stated that the ground realities are unchanged and sotheir violent campaign will continue. Inapparent confirmation of these statements, numerous coordinated attacks in November 2002 killed dozens. Thisreport will not be updated. (1)"
