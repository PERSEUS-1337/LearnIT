    "content": "The United States primary tactical airlift aircraft is the C-130. Nicknamed the Hercules, this venerable aircraft has been the workhorse of U.S. tactical airlift for the past 57 years. The majority of C-130s in the U.S. government are assigned to the U.S. Air Force, but the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard also operate sizeable C-130 fleets. The potential concerns for Congress include oversight of and appropriations for an aging C-130 fleet. As the C-130 fleet ages, management issues arise with reduced reliability, obsolescence and reduced parts availability, and changing aviation rules that impact the C-130's ability to operate worldwide. The C-130 program recently passed a major milestone; the FY2013 NDAA authorized the Secretary of the Air Force to enter into one or more multi-year contracts for the procurement of C-130J aircraft for the Department of the Air Force and the Department of the Navy. This was a significant step toward recapitalizing a portion of the fleet. As Congress decides the future of the tactical airlift fleet, a significant decision is whether or not to continue recapitalizing the fleet with new aircraft. This issue is fueled by several factors, including aircraft life cycles, cost, basing strategy, strategic guidance, the industrial base, and the desired capabilities mix. With these factors in mind, the services have committed to recapitalize a large portion of the C-130 fleet. However, at current production rates, there will still be aircraft in the fleet much older than the crews that fly them well into the future. A common strategy to extend the life of an aircraft fleet is to modernize the current airframes with new components. This strategy attempts to combat issues that plague an aging fleet such as diminishing reliability, antiquated avionics, and capabilities that no longer meet current requirements. The cost of modernization is commonly the driving factor behind these efforts. Analyzing the return on investment of modernizing components on aging aircraft versus recapitalizing the fleet to gain new capabilities will inform these decisions. Congress is currently faced with deciding the future of several modernization efforts being considered for the C-130 fleet. Circumstances that arise due to the changing nature of the global environment may drive decisions by Congress to reduce the size of the fleet by divesting some aircraft. With the current drawdown of U.S. military forces, perhaps the desired future capability can be met with fewer aircraft. Divesting aircraft from a fleet involves a detailed analysis of the capabilities that remain in the desired end-state fleet. Ideally, the required capabilities to meet strategic guidance still reside within the system as a whole when aircraft are retired. The mix of Active and Reserve forces that remain after drawing down a fleet may also be a significant concern. This mix of Active, Guard, and Reserve forces may also lead to decisions regarding force structure. Adjustments to force structure within the Guard and Reserve have been a contentious issue in the past and will require congressional oversight and approval."
