    "title": "AB 596",
    "content": "Existing law governing common interest developments, the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act, requires the association of a common interest development, which includes a condominium project, to prepare and distribute to all of its members certain documents, including an annual budget report that includes, among other items of information, a pro forma operating budget. The act requires a notice to be provided if an insurance policy described in the annual budget report lapses, is canceled, or is not immediately renewed, restored, or replaced, or if there is a significant change as to the policy. This bill would, beginning July 1, 2016, require the annual budget report of a condominium project to also include a separate statement describing the status of the common interest development as a Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-approved condominium project and as a federal Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-approved condominium project."
