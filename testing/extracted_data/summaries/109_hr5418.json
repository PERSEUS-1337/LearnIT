    "title": "To establish a pilot program in certain United States district courts to encourage enhancement of expertise in patent cases among district judges.",
    "content": "Establishes a 10-year pilot program in certain US district courts under which: (1) those district judges who request to hear cases involving patent or plant variety protection issues are designated by the chief judge to hear them. (2) such cases are randomly assigned to the district court judges, regardless of whether they are designated. (3) a judge not designated to whom such a case is assigned may decline to accept the case. And (4) a case so declined is randomly reassigned to one of those judges so designated. Requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the US Courts to designate at least five US district courts, in at least three different judicial circuits, to carry out the pilot program. Requires such courts to be among the 15 district courts in which the largest number of such cases were filed in the most recent calendar year. States that the Director may only designate a court in which: (1) at least 10 district judges are authorized for presidential appointment. And (2) at least three judges request such cases. Requires periodic reports on the program to specified congressional committees. Authorizes appropriations for: (1) educational and professional development of those district judges designated under this Act. And (2) compensation of law clerks with expertise in technical matters arising in patent and plant variety protection cases who are appointed to assist courts in such cases."
