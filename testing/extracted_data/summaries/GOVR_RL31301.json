    "content": "On February 20, 2003, the President signed into law the FY2003 omnibus appropriations act( P.L. 108-7 , H.J.Res. 2 ), containing funding for agencies and programs within theeleven regular FY2003 appropriations bills that were unresolved in the 107th Congress. For the U.S.Department of Agriculture (USDA) and related agencies, P.L. 108-7 contains a total regular annualappropriation of $74.25 billion, of which $56.7 billion is for mandatory programs and $17.55 billionis for discretionary programs. The $17.55 billion in discretionary funds is $805 million below theSenate-passed version of H.J.Res. 2 and $56 million below the House-reported versionof H.R. 5263 , but $124 million above the Administration's FY2003 request and $1.27billion above the enacted FY2002 level including FY2002 supplementals. Not included in the totalsis the effect of a 0.65% across-the-board rescission to almost all discretionary programs funded by P.L. 108-7 , which could reduce USDA and related agencies appropriations by approximately $85million in FY2003. Also separate from the regular appropriations is a provision in P.L. 108-7 for$3.1 billion in FY2003 agricultural disaster assistance, primarily for farmers and ranchers affectedby a natural disaster in 2001 or 2002. The cost of the disaster assistance is offset by a comparablereduction in a mandatory conservation program over a 10-year period. Among its other major provisions affecting USDA agencies and programs, P.L. 108-7 : 1)provides $1.45 billion in foreign food aid under P.L. 480 Title II, including $250 million insupplemental funding that is available through FY2004, and requires USDA to supply a minimumof 400,000 tons of commodities under a separate mandatory food aid program; 2) prohibits the useof discretionary funds to administer any mandatory conservation programs; 3) limits spending oncertain mandatory trade, conservation and research programs and applies the savings from thesereductions to spending on discretionary programs; 4) rejects an Administration proposal to requireprivate crop insurance companies to absorb more of the cost of the federal crop insurance program;5) provides supplemental funding to help the Farm Service Agency administer disaster and farm billprograms; 6) funds special research grants proposed to be terminated by the Administration; 7)increases funding over FY2002 for food safety and animal and plant health inspection activities,reflecting increased government responsibility to protect the food supply from terrorist attacks; and8) increases USDA food and nutrition program spending by $4 billion over FY2002, in line with theAdministration request, including $3.2 billion more for the food stamp program. Included in the bill totals is $1.4 billion in appropriations for the largest related agency, theDepartment of Health and Human Services' Food and Drug Administration. This appropriationincludes $159 million as requested by the Administration for FDA's counter-terrorism activities.FDA also is authorized to collect $270.5 million in various user fees to supplement its appropriation,including a new medical device user fee.
