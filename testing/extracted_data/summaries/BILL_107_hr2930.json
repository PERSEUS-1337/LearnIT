Provides that amounts in the Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund shall be available, as provided in appropriation Acts, for purposes of making expenditures for counter-terrorism efforts by the United States. Authorizes the issuance of bonds to be known as Freedom Bonds, in response to the acts of terrorism perpetrated against the United States on September 11, 2001. Requires proceeds from the issuance of Freedom Bonds to be used to raise funds to assist in recovery operations following such terrorist acts and for efforts to combat terrorism. Permits a taxpayer to designate that a specified portion of any tax overpayment and any cash contribution which the taxpayer includes with such return be deposited into the Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund. Requires, in addition to other fees authorized to be charged for the consideration or processing of an application for an immigrant or nonimmigrant visa under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Attorney General to impose an additional 15 percent surcharge. Requires amounts collected pursuant to such surcharge to be held in a separate account and transferred to the Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund."
