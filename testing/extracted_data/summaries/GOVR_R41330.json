    "content": "The Antiquities Act of 1906 (54 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7320301-320303) authorizes the President to proclaim national monuments on federal lands that contain historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, or other objects of historic or scientific interest. The President is to reserve \"the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.\" The act was designed to protect federal lands and resources quickly. Presidents have proclaimed a total of 158 monuments, and also have enlarged, diminished, and changed the terms of monuments previously proclaimed by Presidents. Congress has modified many of these proclamations and has abolished some monuments. Congress also has created monuments under its own authority. Presidential establishment of monuments sometimes has been contentious\u2014for example, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's creation of the Jackson Hole National Monument in Wyoming (1943) and President Clinton's establishment of 19 monuments and expansion of 3 others (1996-2001). Debate over the President's authority to establish and modify national monuments has continued in light of more recent presidential action, namely President Obama's designation of 29 new monuments and enlargement of 5 others, and President Trump's designation of 1 monument and reduction and modification of the terms of 2 others. Various issues regarding presidentially designated monuments have generated controversy, lawsuits, statutory changes, and legislative proposals to limit the President's authority. Some concerns have centered on the extent of the President's authority to establish and modify monuments, the size of the areas, the types of protected resources and the level of threats to these resources, the inclusion of nonfederal lands within monument boundaries, the selection of the managing agency, restrictions on land uses that may result, and the manner in which the monuments were created. Most monument advocates favor the Antiquities Act in its present form. They believe that the act serves an important purpose in preserving resources for future generations and that the President needs continued authority to act promptly to protect valuable resources on federal lands from potential threats. They assert that the public has supported and courts have upheld designations by the President and that many past presidential designations that initially were controversial have come to be supported. Given the recurring controversies over presidential monument proclamations, Congress has evaluated whether to abolish, limit, or retain unchanged the President's authority under the Antiquities Act. During recent Congresses, measures were considered to impose restrictions on presidential authority, including to limit the designation of monuments in particular locations and promote presidential creation of monuments in accordance with certain federal land management, public participation, and environmental laws. Other measures sought to change land uses within monuments or alter monument boundaries. Among other bills, some proposals would have barred the President from reducing or abolishing national monuments or increased funds for presidentially proclaimed monuments."
