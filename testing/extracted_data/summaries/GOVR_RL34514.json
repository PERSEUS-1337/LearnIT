    "content": "The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is the lead federal law enforcement agency charged with administering and enforcing federal laws related to the manufacture, importation, and distribution of firearms and explosives. Congress transferred ATF's enforcement and regulatory functions for firearms and explosives from the Department of the Treasury to the Department of Justice as part of the Homeland Security Act (P.L. 107-296). ATF is also responsible for investigating arson cases with a federal nexus, as well as criminal violations of federal laws governing the manufacture, importation, and distribution of alcohol and tobacco. For the past two fiscal years, FY2009 and FY2010, Congress has provided ATF with program increases to address illegal gun trafficking from the United States to Mexico under an initiative known as \"Project Gunrunner.\" For FY2008, Congress also provided ATF with a program increase for domestic gun trafficking, but the focus of this program increase was also largely on the Southwest border. As a result, for those three fiscal years, Congress has provided over $49 million in program increases to address gun trafficking. Congress has also provided nearly $30 million for the construction of a National Center for Explosives Training and Research (NCETR). In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-117), Congress matched the Administration's request and appropriated $1.121 billion for ATF, or 3.9% more than the agency's FY2009 appropriations ($1.078 billion). Conference report language (H.Rept. 111-366) indicated that the act included an increase of $18 million for Project Gunrunner, the same amount requested by the Administration; $10 million to increase the Violent Crime Impact Team program; $6 million for construction (phase two) of NCETR; and $1.5 million to complete ATF headquarters construction projects. In the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-8), Congress appropriated $1.054 billion for ATF. This amount included at least a $5 million increase for Project Gunrunner. Congress also appropriated ATF an additional $14 million in the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-32). This amount included a $4 million increase to upgrade and share ballistic imaging technology with the government of Mexico, and an additional $6 million increase for Project Gunrunner. In addition, Congress appropriated an additional $10 million for Project Gunrunner in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5). Hence, Congress provided $25 million in FY2009 budget enhancements to address Southwest border gun trafficking. For FY2009, in sum total, Congress appropriated ATF $1.078 billion, or 6.6% more than the FY2008 appropriation ($1.012 billion). In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-161), Congress appropriated $1.008 billion for ATF. This act included an increase of $6.3 million to address domestic gun trafficking and $23.5 million for the construction of NCETR. In the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-252), Congress appropriated an additional $4 million for ATF to provide explosives and cigarette trafficking training and support to Iraqi authorities. The total FY2008 ATF appropriation was $1.012 billion, or 2.4% more than the FY2007 appropriations ($988.1 million). In the 110th Congress, the House passed a bill (H.R. 6028) that would have authorized increasing ATF appropriations over three years, for FY2008 through FY2010, by nearly $74 million to address Southwest border gun trafficking. Similar bills have been introduced in the 111th Congress (S. 205, H.R. 495, H.R. 1448, and H.R. 1867). This report will not be updated."
