    "content": "This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on October 6, 2015. Airport Access Control Security Improvement Act of 2015 This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to establish a risk-based, intelligence-driven model for the screening of airport employees based on level of employment-related access to Secure Identification Display Areas, Airport Operations Areas, or secure areas at US airports. TSA shall conduct an aviation security risk-based review of certain federal disqualifying criminal offenses to determine their appropriateness as a basis for denying an employee a credential that allows unescorted access to Secure Identification Display Areas of airports. TSA shall provide a redress process for employees subject to an adverse employment decision due to a disqualifying offense that is consistent with the appeals and waiver process for applicants for commercial motor vehicle hazardous materials endorsements and transportation workers at ports. TSA shall review the auditing procedures for all airport-issued identification media. TSA shall: establish a program to allow airport badging offices to use quot, E-Verifyquot. To determine eligibility to work in the United States of all applicants seeking access to secure areas of airports, establish a process to transmit applicants' biometric fingerprint data to the Office of Biometric Identity Management's Automated Biometrics Identification System for vetting, assess credential application data received by DHS to ensure it is complete and matches data submitted by airport operators. TSA shall establish a nationwide program for the anonymous reporting of violations of airport security. TSA shall: establish a national database of employees who have had either their airport or aircraft operator-issued badge revoked for failure to comply with aviation requirements, determine the appropriate mechanisms for airports and airlines to submit such data and access the database, and establish a process to allow individuals whose names were mistakenly entered into the database to have them removed and their credentialing restored. The Aviation Security Advisory Committee shall update and review airport access controls. TSA shall conduct a cost and feasibility study of a significant number of Category I, II, and X airports that ensures that all employee entry and exit points that lead to airport secured areas comprise the following: a secure door that uses card and pin entry or biometric technology, surveillance video recording capable of storing video data for at least 30 days, and certain advanced screening technologies . The Government Accountability Office shall assess the quality and reliability of the study."
