Net metering is widely regarded as having an important role in deployment of distributed generation (DG), especially solar energy. State and local governments have authority to establish net metering policies, and some have done so for many years. Congress took action to encourage net metering in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05), and the policy now exists, in some form, in 45 states. Recent state net metering policy modifications, and potential effects on solar energy deployment, may be relevant to congressional discussions regarding the role of renewable energy sources in the nation's electricity system. Solar photovoltaic panels (e.g., rooftop solar) accounted for 97% of the generation capacity participating in net metering programs in 2018. Net metering participation roughly quadrupled from 2013 to 2018, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Hawaii has the highest participation rate of any state, with 15% of electricity customers participating in net metering in 2018. In a majority of states, however, net metering customers account for less than 1% of total electricity customers. States differ in the way net metering customers are compensated. A common method is the retail rate, under which energy from net metering capacity offsets energy consumed from the grid in a one-to-one fashion. This method is often described as the \"meter running backward.\" Retail rate compensation was initially adopted, in large part, for its administrative simplicity. Some stakeholders continue to prefer it for the relatively high payments it gives to net metering customers. Other stakeholders criticize retail rate compensation as overcompensating net metering customers for the electricity they produce. Part of this criticism comes from the fact that electricity retail rates reflect not just costs associated with generating electricity, but also costs associated with building, maintaining, and operating the transmission and distribution systems (\"the grid\"). Electricity rates are typically designed so that utilities can recover their total costs associated with providing electricity. If a sufficiently large number of customers participate in net metering, costs might increase for non-net metering customers in order to pay for the grid benefits. This possibility is known as a cross-subsidy, or sometimes a cost shift. In addition to these concerns about fairness, some critics of retail rate compensation raise concerns about equity, because historically most net metering customers have had above-average incomes. Empirical evidence of the cost increases for non-net metering customers is mixed, partly because studies make different assumptions about costs and benefits associated with DG. Some projections in different states have quantified a potential cross-subsidy, but projections in other states have concluded that the value of cross-subsidies are approximately zero. States have considered, and in some cases adopted, alternative compensation approaches to address concerns over cross-subsidies. One type of approach adds a fixed charge to net metering customers' bills to reflect the costs of maintaining the grid. Another type of approach provides an alternative compensation rate (i.e., not the retail rate) that net metering customers receive for the energy they deliver to the grid. Options for alternative compensation rates are avoided cost rates, which reflect primarily the utility's cost of producing electricity, and value of solar (VOS) rates, which additionally consider societal benefits such as reduced air emissions. Generally, rates that consider more benefits (and avoided costs) associated with DG have a higher monetary value and might promote greater levels of DG penetration. States have included different costs and benefits in analyses conducted to estimate alternative compensation rates, resulting in different monetary values for alternative rates. Even if states opted to include the same types of costs and benefits, they might derive different values for rates, since the relative costs and benefits of DG can vary based on local circumstances. Relevant local circumstances include overall penetration of DG, average and marginal electricity costs, congestion in transmission and distribution systems, and potentially other factors. Other state net metering policy provisions can affect deployment of DG. They relate to whether to adopt program caps, thereby limiting the number of participants; which technology type and what size generator are eligible; how long customers can \"carry over\" credits associated with surplus electricity generation; and what types of system ownership arrangements may participate in net metering. A related consideration is whether third parties, such as solar leasing firms, may develop DG in the state. Some Members of Congress have expressed interest in various aspects of net metering policy since passage of EPACT05. Legislation has sought to limit revisions that states can make to net metering policies; expand access to net metering for different types of electricity generation; and estimate costs and benefits associated with net metering, among other topics."
