And (2) maintain a regional office at which all such claims are processed exclusively electronically. Provides that if a veteran who is a claimant dies before completing the submission of a claim for benefits, the person who would receive any accrued benefit(s) due to such veteran shall be treated as the claimant for purposes of completing submission of the claim.
