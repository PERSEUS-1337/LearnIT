Declares that nothing in the amendments made by this Act limits or otherwise preempts any state from establishing a more stringent law or regulation. Prohibits certain cargo vessels that carry a significant quantity of oil or petroleum-based fuel to power the vessel from operating in the navigable waters or the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the United States without fuel tanks that have a double hull, or a double containment system as effective as a double hull, for the prevention of a fuel discharge. Phases in the prohibition over a specified period of years, based on vessel age and tonnage."
