    "content": "Existing law establishes procedures by which a person may claim a refund for an overpayment of the taxes, fees, and surcharges imposed by the Sales and Use Tax Law, the Use Fuel Tax Law, the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Tax Law, the Alcoholic Beverage Tax Law, the Energy Resources Surcharge Law, the Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge Act, the Hazardous Substances Tax Law, the Integrated Waste Management Fee Law, the Oil Spill Response, Prevention, and Administration Fees Law, the Underground Storage Tank Maintenance Fee Law, and the Diesel Fuel Tax Law, and of taxes, fees, and surcharges imposed in accordance with the Fee Collection Procedures Law. Existing law generally requires that a claim be filed within 3 years after specified periods in which the overpayment was made. This bill would, with respect to each of the above-described laws, provide that a claim that is otherwise valid that is made in the case in which the amount of tax determined, as defined, has not been paid in full is deemed a timely filed claim for refund with respect to all subsequent payments applied to that determination. The bill would specify that its provisions apply only to claims for refund on or after its effective date."
