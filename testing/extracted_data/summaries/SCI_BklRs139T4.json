    "content": "Language and vision are processed as two different modal in current work for image captioning. However, recent work on Super Characters method shows the effectiveness of two-dimensional word embedding, which converts text classification problem into image classification problem. In this paper, we propose the SuperCaptioning method, which borrows the idea of two-dimensional word embedding from Super Characters method, and processes the information of language and vision together in one single CNN model. The experimental results on Flickr30k data shows the proposed method gives high quality image captions. An interactive demo is ready to show at the workshop. Image captioning outputs a sentence related to the input image. Current methods process the image and text separately BID3 BID8 BID10 BID9 BID4 BID5 BID0 BID1 . Generally, the image is processed by a CNN model to extract the image feature, and the raw text passes through embedding layer to convert into one-dimensional wordembedding vectors, e.g. a 300x1 dimensional vector. And then the extracted image feature and the word embedding vectors will be fed into another network, such as RNN, LSTM, or GRU model, to predict the next word in the image caption sequentially.Super Characters method ) is originally designed for text classification tasks. It has achieved stateof-the-art results on benchmark datasets for multiple languages, including English, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. It is a two-step method. In the first step, the text characters are printed on a blank image, and the generated image is called Super Characters image. In the second step, the Super Characters image is fed into a CNN model for classification. The CNN model is fine-tuned from pre-trained ImageNet model.In this paper, we address the image captioning problem by employing the two-dimensional word embedding from the Super Characters method, and the resulting method is named as SuperCaptioning method. In this method, the input image and the raw text are combined together through two-dimensional embedding, and then fed into a CNN model to sequentially predict the words in the image caption. The experimental results on Flickr30k shows that the proposed method gives high quality image captions. Some examples given by SuperCaptioning method are shown in FIG2 ."
