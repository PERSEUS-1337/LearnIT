    "title": "A bill to designate certain conduct by sports agents relating to signing of contracts with student athletes as unfair and deceptive acts or practices to be regulated by the Federal Trade Commission.",
    "content": "Sports Agent Responsibility and Trust Act - Prohibits an athlete agent from: (1) recruiting or soliciting a student athlete to enter into an agency contract by giving false or misleading information, making a false promise or representation, or providing anything of value to the athlete or anyone associated with the athlete before entering into such contract, including any consideration in the form of a loan, or acting as guarantor or co-guarantor for any debt. (2) entering into an agency contract with a student athlete without providing the required disclosure document. Or (3) predating or postdating an agency contract. Requires an athlete agent to provide to the athlete a separate disclosure document that includes notice that if the athlete agrees orally or in writing to be represented by an agent, he or she may lose eligibility to compete as a student athlete. Requires both the student athlete and the agent, within 72 hours or before the athlete's next athletic event, whichever occurs first, to notify the athletic director of the athlete's educational institution that the athlete has entered into an agency contract. Treats a violation of this Act as an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Authorizes civil actions by State attorneys general and educational institutions. Expresses the sense of Congress that States should enact the Uniform Athlete Agents Act of 2000 drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws."
