    "content": "Amends title XI of the Social Security Act with respect to the payment of cash benefits or administrative expenses from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund during any debt limit default period. Requires that during a debt limit default period public debt obligations held by the applicable federal fund be sold or redeemed in an amount not to exceed the sum of: (1) the face amount of obligations held by the fund which mature during the month in question. Plus (2) the amount necessary only to pay such benefits or administrative expenses, and only to the extent cash assets of the fund are not available during that period to make such payments. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in order to undertake the sale or redemption of public debt obligations held by the applicable federal fund, to issue corresponding public debt obligations to the public in order to obtain the amounts necessary to make such payments, notwithstanding the public debt limit. Declares that, in the event that the Secretary is not able to issue obligations to make all authorized payments because the public debt limit has been reached, the Secretary shall give equal priority to the following: (1) payments of principal and interest on public debt. (2) payments of amounts that the Secretary of Defense (DOD) determines to be necessary to continue pay and allowances to the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including their reserve components, who perform active service. (3) payments determined by the President to be necessary to continue US priorities of its vital national security interests. And (4) payments for items and services under SSA title XVIII (Medicare). Makes appropriations, for any period of lapsed appropriations, out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to the Secretary of Defense to continue to provide pay and allowances to members of the US armed forces."
