Or (2) shift to a type of business that is not related to the timber industry. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to provide grants under such program to any entity that operated in the timber industry in Alaska on January 1, 2009, that, prior to such date, operated in Alaska for not less than 10 years. Sets forth provisions concerning eligible uses of grant funding. Treats a grant recipient as a small business concern owned or controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals for three years after the grant was approved."
