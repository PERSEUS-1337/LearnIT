    "content": "Children First Child Support Reform Act of 1998 - Amends part D of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to require States to pass through directly to families on assistance under SSA title IV part A (TANF) all child support collected by the State on behalf of such families on TANF assistance. Amends SSA title IV part A to require a State to disregard child support collected for purposes of determining the amount of TANF assistance. But allows the State to include such support in family income for purposes of determining TANF eligibility. Repeals the TANF requirement that families assign certain support rights to the State."
