    "content": "This CRS Report discusses China's suspected acquisition of U.S. nuclear weapon secrets,including that on the W88, the newest U.S. nuclear warhead. This serious controversy becamepublic in early 1999 and raised policy issues about whether U.S. security was further threatened byChina's suspected use of U.S. nuclear weapon secrets in its development of nuclear forces, as wellas whether the Administration's response to the security problems was effective or mishandled andwhether it fairly used or abused its investigative and prosecuting authority. The ClintonAdministration acknowledged that improved security was needed at the weapons labs but said thatit took actions in response to indications in 1995 that China may have obtained U.S. nuclear weaponsecrets. Critics in Congress and elsewhere argued that the Administration was slow to respond tosecurity concerns, mishandled the too narrow investigation, downplayed information potentiallyunfavorable to China and the labs, and failed to notify Congress fully. On April 7, 1999, President Clinton gave his assurance that partly \"because of ourengagement, China has, at best, only marginally increased its deployed nuclear threat in the last 15years\" and that the strategic balance with China \"remains overwhelmingly in our favor.\" On April21, 1999, Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) George Tenet, reported the IntelligenceCommunity's damage assessment. It confirmed that \"China obtained by espionage classified U.S.nuclear weapons information that probably accelerated its program to develop future nuclearweapons.\" It also revealed that China obtained information on \"several\" U.S. nuclear reentryvehicles, including the Trident II submarine-launched missile that delivers the W88 nuclear warheadas well as \"a variety of\" design concepts and weaponization features, including those of the neutronbomb. On May 25, 1999, the House's Cox Committee reported that China stole classifiedinformation on the W88 and six other U.S. nuclear warheads. On June 15, 1999, the President'sForeign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) called the Department of Energy a \"dysfunctionalbureaucracy\" and urged the creation of a semi-autonomous or independent agency to oversee nuclearweapons. In September 1999, Congress passed the FY2000 National Defense Authorization Act tocreate a National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) within DOE on March 1, 2000. As one result of the W-88 case, the FBI investigated a Taiwan-born U.S. scientist at the LosAlamos lab, Wen Ho Lee. He was never charged with espionage. In December 1999, the JusticeDepartment indicted Lee on 59 felony counts for mishandling nuclear weapons information (notclassified at the time). Lee was jailed without bail until a plea agreement on September 13, 2000,when he pleaded guilty to one count of mishandling national defense information (for making copiesof his computer files). The judge apologized to Lee. Meanwhile, in April 1999, the FBI expandedits counterintelligence investigation beyond the focus on Los Alamos, and in 2000, the probe shiftedto missile secrets and to the Defense Department. In April 2003, an ex-FBI agent, James Smith, andhis informant, Katrina Leung, were arrested for allegedly mishandling national defense informationrelated to China."
