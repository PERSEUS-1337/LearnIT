    "content": "The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) regulates \"federal election activity,\" which is defined to include a \"public communication\" (i.e., a broadcast, cable, satellite, newspaper, magazine, outdoor advertising facility, mass mailing, or telephone bank communication made to the general public) or \"any other form of general public political advertising.\" In 2006, in response to a federal district court decision, the FEC promulgated regulations amending the definition of \"public communication\" to include paid Internet advertisements placed on another individual or entity's website. As a result, a key element of online political activity\u2014paid political advertising\u2014is subject to federal campaign finance law and regulations. During the 110th Congress, the regulation of political communications on the Internet was not the subject of major legislative action. H.R. 894 (Price, NC) would have extended \"stand by your ad\" disclaimer requirements to Internet communications, among others. H.R. 5699 (Hensarling) would have exempted from treatment as a contribution or expenditure any uncompensated Internet services by individuals and certain corporations. Similar legislation has not yet been introduced in the 111th Congress. This report will be updated in the event of major legislative, regulatory, or legal developments."
