    "content": "Bush Administration officials have said that they wish to see NATO countries contribute forces to bring stability to Iraq, possibly as part of a U.S.-led NATO or U.N. force. Key European alliessuch as France and Germany would first like to see a new U.N. mandate that would includeobjectives, such as a timetable for turnover of authority to Iraqis and a transparent process forimproving Iraq's petroleum industry, that the Administration now opposes. Some European alliesdo not wish to serve under a U.S. command in Iraq; other European allies already have troops in Iraq. Administration officials are concerned that greater international involvement in governing Iraq could deflect the United States from achieving some of its stated goals for that country's future. Such goals include establishing a democracy there that would influence other Middle Easterngovernments to follow a similar course, and easing of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Some Europeansargue that these goals are unattainable in the framework established by the U.S.-led occupation. Atthe same time, involvement of European forces, if a common outlook could be worked out, couldfree some U.S. forces for other missions, dampen international criticism of U.S. management of Iraq,and spread costs for reconstructing Iraq to other countries and the private sector.
