    "content": "P.L. 114-254, the further continuing resolution for FY2017, extended funding and program authority for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant through April 28, 2017. Though several bills that would have changed TANF policies were reported by the House Ways and Means Committee to the full House during the 114th Congress\u2014and one bill passed the House\u2014none were enacted. The TANF block grant funds grants to states, tribes, and territories for providing benefits, services, and activities to broadly address both the effects and root causes of childhood economic and social disadvantage. It was created in the 1996 welfare reform law, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193), which culminated decades of debate over how to change public assistance programs for needy families with children. Most TANF policy dates back to the 1996 welfare law, as a full reauthorization of the block grant has never been enacted. On June 21, 2016, the House passed H.R. 5170, a bill that would have established a demonstration project for \"social impact partnership projects.\" That bill also would have extended TANF and mandatory child care block grant funding for one year (FY2017) and revised TANF-related research funding. The bill did not pass the Senate. H.R. 5170, as it passed the House, would have established a mechanism through which state and local governments could apply to the Secretary of the Treasury for demonstration projects, which would have been called \"social impact partnership projects.\" These projects would have used funds provided through philanthropic and other private-sector partnerships to finance social programs to meet specified social goals. Under this type of financing, the government would \"pay off\" investors only when a program evaluation demonstrates that desired outcomes are met. H.R. 5170 would have funded social impact partnership demonstrations at $100 million, financed from a set-aside from FY2017 TANF contingency funds. The bill would have required that at least 50% of funds provided for agreements awarding funding for social impact partnership projects be used for initiatives that directly benefit children. As it passed the House, H.R. 5170 would have also extended TANF and mandatory child care block grant funding through FY2017 and revised TANF research requirements and funding. H.R. 2990, as reported by the House Ways and Means Committee, would have created a demonstration project for subsidized employment programs for TANF assistance families. Subsidized employment programs are those where public funds are used to pay all or part of the wages, benefits, and other costs of employing an individual. Subsidized employment can be a part of TANF programs under current law. However, except for a brief period when such programs were financed from special funds enacted in response to the 2007-2009 recession, subsidized employment has been little used in TANF. The subsidized employment demonstration would have been funded at $100 million, financed from an additional set-aside from FY2017 TANF contingency funds. The bill was not considered by the full House. The House Ways and Means Committee also reported additional TANF bills: H.R. 2959 would have altered the rules for the TANF state spending requirement, H.R. 2966 would have added reducing child poverty as a statutory TANF goal, and H.R. 2952 would have established new employment outcome performance measures for TANF. These bills were not considered by the full House."
