    "content": "Amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA) to require that a foreign state designated as a state sponsor of terrorism under specified laws, or an official, employee, or agent of such a foreign state, shall be liable to a US national for the national's personal injury or death caused by acts of that state or official, employee, or agent acting within the scope of his or her duties. Authorizes US courts to exercise jurisdiction over such actions for money damages under a FSIA provision concerning acts of torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, and material support for such acts. Mandates that property interests of foreign states, or agencies or instrumentalities of foreign states, against which judgment is entered pursuant to such provision are subject to attachment execution. Requires foreign states to be held vicariously liable for the actions of their officials, employees, or agents. Revives previously dismissed causes of action that would be cognizable under this Act by retroactively tolling the applicable statute of limitations from the date of initial filing to 60 days after enactment of this Act."
