Extinguishes any aboriginal title held by any Indian, Indian nation, or tribe or band of Indians on Settlement Lands. Conditions the transfer of the Settlement Lands to the Secretary in trust as part of this claims settlement upon the Secretary's receipt of a duly enacted resolution of the elected tribal council or business committee of the Wyandotte Nation agreeing to the extinguishment of all claims against the United States, the Unified Government, or any person or entity. Declares that if the State of Kansas and the Wyandotte Nation have not entered into a tribal-State compact under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act within 90 days, the Secretary shall prescribe gaming procedures on the Settlement Lands."
