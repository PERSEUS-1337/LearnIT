    "content": "Requires the Secretary of Energy to facilitate the updating of national model building energy codes and standards at least every three years to achieve overall energy savings, compared to the 2006 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) for residential buildings and ASHRAEIES Standard 90.1 for commercial buildings, of at least 30 by 2015 and 50 by 2022. Requires the Secretary, if the 2022 target cannot be achieved using existing technology or would not be lifecycle effective, to establish a revised target that ensures the maximum level of energy efficiency in buildings that is technologically feasible and lifecycle cost effective. Requires the Secretary: (1) to determine if a revision to the IECC or ASHRAEIES Standard 90.1 will improve energy efficiency in buildings and meet such energy savings targets. And (2) if a code or standard does not meet the targets or if a code or standard is not updated for more than three years, to amend the IECC or ASHRAEIES Standard 90.1 to establish a modified code or standard that meets the targets. Requires the Secretary to provide notice and an opportunity to comment on the targets, determinations, and modified codes and standards. Sets forth requirements for state certifications regarding the energy efficiency of, and compliance with, state residential and commercial building codes. Requires the Secretary to provide: (1) technical assistance to enable the national model building energy codes and standards to meet the targets, (2) assistance to states to comply with this Act. And (3) incentive funding to states to improve and implement building energy efficiency codes."
