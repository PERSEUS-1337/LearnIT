    "content": "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) was enacted on March 23, 2018. This omnibus bill included appropriations for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), of which USDA's domestic food assistance programs are a part. Prior to its enactment, the federal government had continued to operate for the first six months of the fiscal year under continuing resolutions (CRs). This report focuses on the enacted appropriations for USDA's domestic food assistance programs and, in some instances, policy changes provided by the omnibus law. CRS Report R45128, Agriculture and Related Agencies: FY2018 Appropriations provides an overview of the entire FY2018 Agriculture and Related Agencies portion of the law as well as a review of the reported bills and CRs preceding it. Domestic food assistance funding is primarily mandatory but also includes discretionary funding. Most of the programs' funding is for open-ended, appropriated mandatory spending\u2014that is, terms of the authorizing law require full funding and funding may vary with program participation (and in some cases inflation). The largest mandatory programs include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp Program) and the child nutrition programs (including the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program). Though their funding levels are dictated by the authorizing law, in most cases, appropriations are needed to make funds available for obligation and expenditure. The three largest discretionary budget items are the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP); and federal nutrition program administration. The domestic food assistance funding is, for the most part, administered by USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). The enacted FY2018 appropriation provides nearly $105 billion for domestic food assistance (Table 1). This is a decrease of approximately $3.2 billion from FY2017. Declining participation in SNAP is responsible for most of the difference. Over 95% of the FY2018 appropriations for domestic food assistance are for mandatory spending. Highlights of the associated appropriations accounts are summarized below. For SNAP and other programs authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act, such as The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) commodities, the FY2018 appropriations law provides approximately $74.0 billion. Certain provisions of the law affect SNAP policies. For example, it continues a policy in the FY2017 appropriations law that limited USDA's implementation of December 2016 regulations regarding SNAP retailers' inventory requirements. USDA must amend its final rule to define \"variety\" more expansively and must \"apply the requirements regarding acceptable varieties and breadth of stock.\" For the child nutrition programs (National School Lunch Program and others), the enacted law provides approximately $24.3 billion. This includes discretionary funding for school meals equipment grants ($30 million) and Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) demonstration projects ($28 million). General provisions provide an additional $5 million for farm-to-school grants and $2 million for training school nutrition personnel. The law includes policy provisions related to processed poultry from China, discrimination in the school meals programs, and requirements for schools' paid lunch pricing. For the WIC program, the law provides nearly $6.2 billion while also rescinding $800 million in prior-year carryover funding. For the Commodity Assistance Program account, which includes funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, TEFAP administrative and distribution costs, and other programs, the law provides over $322 million. It provides level funding for the WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program ($18.5 million), though the President's budget requested no funding for this program. For Nutrition Programs Administration, the law provides nearly $154 million."
