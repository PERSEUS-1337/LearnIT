    "content": "Advancing Grid Storage Act of 2015 This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish certain energy storage programs. The bill establishes a program for the research of energy storage systems within DOE's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy. DOE must establish a loan program to provide loans to states and other government entities, educational institutions, and electric utilities for: (1) the demonstration and deployment of energy storage systems in a specific project, and (2) programs to finance the demonstration and deployment of multiple energy storage systems through a financial assistance program. Loans may only be used to fund programs relating to the demonstration and deployment of energy storage systems in households, businesses, and communities. DOE must establish a technical assistance and grant program to: (1) disseminate information and provide technical assistance directly to nonprofit or for-profit entities so those entities can identify, evaluate, plan, and design energy storage systems. And (2) make grants to such entities so that they may contract to obtain technical assistance to identify, evaluate, plan, and design energy storage systems."
