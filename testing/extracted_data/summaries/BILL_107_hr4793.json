    "content": "Mosquito Abatement for Safety and Health Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to make grants to political subdivisions of States (localities) for the operation of mosquito control programs to prevent and control mosquito-borne diseases. Directs the Secretary to give preference in issuing the grants to certain types of localities, including those that have a high incidence of mosquito-borne disease or a substantial population of infected mosquitoes. Allows grants for control programs only to localities that have: (1) conducted an assessment of the needs for a program, with such assessment including an entomological survey of potential mosquito breeding areas. And (2) developed, based on the assessment, a plan for carrying out a control program. Requires each locality receiving a grant for a control program to make available matching funds in an amount not less than 13 of the cost of the program. Allows the Secretary to waive the matching requirement in the case of extraordinary economic conditions in a locality. Requires a locality receiving a grant to submit a report to the Secretary and to the State in which the locality is located describing the control program and its effectiveness. Limits the amount of a grant for a control program to a maximum of $100,000 for one year, and prohibits a locality from receiving more than one such grant. Permits the Secretary, acting through the Director, to make grants, not to exceed $10,000 for one year, to localities for conducting assessments and plans for control programs. Limits the number of such grants a locality may receive to one. Allows the Secretary, acting through the Director, to make grants to States for the purpose of coordinating control programs, with preference for States that have one or more localities with high incidences of mosquito-borne disease or with substantial populations of infected mosquitoes. Requires States receiving grants to: (1) have developed, or to have agreed to develop, a plan for coordinating control programs in the State which takes into account any assessments or plans for control programs that have been conducted or developed in the State. (2) agree to monitor control programs in the State to ensure they are carried out in accordance with such plan. And (3) submit a report to the Secretary describing the activities of the State under the grant and evaluating whether the control programs of localities were effectively coordinated with each other. Limits such a grant to a maximum of $10,000 for one year, and prohibits a State from receiving more than one grant. Permits the Secretary to provide training and technical assistance to localities with respect to the planning, development, and operation of control programs and assessments and plans, either directly or through award of grants or contracts to public and private entities. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to conduct or support research into methods to control the population of insects that transmit dangerous diseases to humans."
