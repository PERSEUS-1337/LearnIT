    "content": "Surface Owner Protection Act - Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to require an operator producing oil or gas under a federal lease to: (1) replace the water supply of a water user who obtains all or part of it from an underground or surface source affected by contamination, diminution, or interruption proximately resulting from such drilling operations. And (2) comply with federal and state law governing discharge of water produced under the lease. Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from authorizing exploration and drilling operations on land with respect to which title to oil and gas resources is held by the United States but not the title to the surface estate, unless the operator has filed a document with the Secretary, signed by the operator and surface owners, that a written surface use agreement has been consummated meeting certain criteria. Cites conditions under which the Secretary may authorize an operator to conduct exploration and drilling operations in the absence of such an agreement. Requires the Secretary to comply with specified surface owner notification requirements. Sets forth reclamation and bond requirements."
