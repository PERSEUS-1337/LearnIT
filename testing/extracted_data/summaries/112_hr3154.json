    "title": "To amend section 1112 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.",
    "content": "Education for Tomorrow's Jobs Act - Amends part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require local educational agencies receiving subgrants under part A to describe how they will establish and carry out a school improvement program, including how they will: create a network of schools or programs of study that integrate a rigorous curriculum emphasizing college and career readiness, and wraparound support services, use school-level strategies to personalize students' educational experience, demonstrate their capacity to implement and sustain their program. Involve institutions of higher education, employers, community-based organizations, parent organizations, and other stakeholders in the school improvement process. Provide school staff and other stakeholders with high-quality training and technical assistance. Facilitate student transitions from secondary schools that do not award diplomas to secondary schools that do, and from the latter to postsecondary education. Enable their program through policies that may include budgeting, governance, curriculum, and scheduling autonomies. Place students, when possible, in a school or program of study that the student or their parents choose. Assure that students are able to fully participate in their school or program of study and are not placed in a school or program of study on the basis of their prior academic achievement or status as a poor, minority, disabled, or limited English proficient student. And arrange for an ongoing and rigorous evaluation of their program, and disseminate best practices."
