    "content": "DTV Border Fix Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to allow the renewal of a full-power analog television broadcasting license through February 17, 2014, for stations located within 50 miles of the US border with Mexico, provided certain requirements are met, including that the renewal does not prevent the auction of recovered spectrum or encumber or interfere with any channel reserved for public safety use. Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), if mutually exclusive applications are submitted to use a channel under the amendments made by this Act, to award the authority to use the channel through competitive bidding under existing procedures."
