    "content": "Congress continues to debate the federal role in biofuel research, biofuel tax incentives, and renewable fuel mandates. The debate touches on topics such as fuel imports and security, job creation, and environmental benefits, and is particularly significant for advanced biofuels, such as those produced by algae. Congress established the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2), a mandate requiring that the national fuel supply contain a minimum amount of fuel produced from renewable biomass. The RFS2 is essentially composed of two biofuel mandates\u2014one for unspecified biofuel, which is being met largely with corn-starch ethanol, and one for advanced biofuels (or non-corn starch ethanol), which may not be met in coming years due to a lack of production. Within the advanced biofuels category, the RFS2 requirements for the cellulosic biofuels subcategory (e.g., ethanol from switchgrass) have not been met for the last few years, which could cause alarm among those required to purchase fuel or credits to satisfy the mandate, as this subcategory is slated to ramp up from roughly 3% of the requirement in the standard in 2012 to roughly 44% of the standard in 2022. Limited cellulosic biofuel production has occurred to date. As a result, as allowed under the RFS2, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has lowered the required cellulosic biofuels volume for 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 and has proposed to do the same for 2014. Currently, algae-based biofuel qualifies as an advanced biofuel under the RFS2, but not as a cellulosic biofuel. If algae were added as an eligible feedstock type under the RFS2 cellulosic biofuels mandate, and if an increase in production resulted, then a larger portion of the requirement might be achieved, although current production is minimal. Algae does qualify as a feedstock for the biomass-based diesel subcategory of the RFS2 advanced biofuel mandate. The RFS2 does not mandate rapid growth of biomass-based diesel, as it does for cellulosic biofuels. Algae can be converted into various types of energy for transportation, including biodiesel, jet fuel, electric power, and ethanol. The potential advantages of algae-based biofuel over other biofuel pathways include higher biomass yields per acre of cultivation, little to no competition for arable land, use of a wide variety of water sources, the opportunity to use carbon dioxide from stationary sources, and the potential to produce \"drop-in\" ready-to-use fuels. Potential drawbacks include the anticipated cost of production, the amount of resources (e.g., water and land) required to produce the biofuel, and the lack of commercial-scale production facilities. Algae-based biofuel research and development are in their infancy, although work has been conducted in this area for decades. At present, published research efforts offer policymakers little guidance on what algae types or conversion methods could be the front-runner for commercial production, or on when and for which biofuel. Congressional support for algae-based biofuel has consisted of congressionally directed projects and funding of programs and studies by the Departments of Energy (DOE) and Defense (DOD). Some algae industry advocates contend that Congress should encourage advances in algae-based biofuel production by extending the expiration date for eligible tax credits, appropriating additional federal funds for algae-related programs, and modifying the RFS2 to include algae in the cellulosic biofuels mandate, as was done recently for the cellulosic biofuels production tax credit. In contrast, some argue that Congress should reconsider its investment in biofuels because of the current federal budget crisis and the lack of any measurable progress in cellulosic biofuels production. Thus far in the 113th Congress, legislation pertaining to algae-based biofuels has not been introduced. Proposed legislation in the 112th Congress would have either expanded the cellulosic biofuels definition for the RFS2 to include algae by amending the Clean Air Act, and/or expanded the definition in the tax code for select tax credits to incorporate algae (e.g., H.R. 1149, S. 1185). The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; P.L. 112-240) amended both the cellulosic biofuel production tax credit and the cellulosic biofuel depreciation allowance to include algae-based biofuels. Both tax incentives expired at the end of 2013, and it is not known if they will be extended."
