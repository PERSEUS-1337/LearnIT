    "content": "The recent war against Iraq may have implications for various defense programs of interest to Congress. This report surveys some of those potential implications, and will be updated periodicallyas new information becomes available. Three cautionary notes associated with post-conflict\"lessons-learned\" reports apply to this report: Information about the Iraq war is incomplete andimperfect, so early lessons are subject to change. Each war is unique in some ways, so observersshould avoid \"overlearning\" the lessons of the Iraq war. And potential U.S. adversaries can derivelessons from the Iraq war and apply them in future conflicts against U.S. forces, possibly devaluingU.S.-perceived lessons. It can also be noted that some persons or organizations offering purported lessons of the Iraq war may have a financial, institutional, or ideological stake in the issue. Many observers have concluded that the Iraq war validated the Administration's vision for defense transformation, or major parts of it. Other observers disagree. The issue is potentiallysignificant because implementing the Administration's vision could affect the composition of U.S.defense spending, and because the Administration may invoke the theme of transformation to helpjustify or seek rapid congressional consideration of legislative proposals, including proposals thatcould affect Congress' role in conducting oversight of defense programs. The Iraq war mayinfluence debate on whether active-duty U.S. military forces are sufficiently large to carry out currentU.S. military strategy, and on whether greater emphasis should be placed on forces that are lessdependent on access to in-theater bases. One of the most significant defense-program debates going into the Iraq war - and potentially one of those most significantly influenced by the war - concerns the future size and composition ofthe active-duty Army. Both supporters and opponents of maintaining at least 10 active-duty Armydivisions may find support in the Iraq war for their positions, as may both supporters and opponentsof the current Army plan to shift toward a mix of fewer heavy armored units and a larger number oflighter and more mobile units. The Iraq war validated the effectiveness of combat-aircraft armed with precision-guided weapons, and may influence discussions about current plans for investing in specific aircraft andmunitions programs. The Iraq war may reinforce support generated by the war in Afghanistan forincreased investment in U.S. special operations forces. It may also highlight questions concerningreserve combat divisions and the potential consequences of extended callups of large numbers ofreserve forces. The war appears to have demonstrated the value of network-centric operations and timely battlefield intelligence, and the potential value of psychological operations. It appears to haveconfirmed the importance of preparing for urban combat. The war offered a limited real-world testof the Patriot missile defense system. The war may lead to renewed discussions about strategies forreducing friendly fire incidents. It may reinforce support for investing in aerial refueling capabilities,and increase interest in potential new airlift and sealift technologies."
