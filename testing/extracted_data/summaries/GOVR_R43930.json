    "content": "The federal Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program supports home visiting services for families with young children who reside in communities that have concentrations of poor child health and other indicators of risk. Home visits are conducted by nurses, mental health clinicians, social workers, or paraprofessionals with specialized training. Generally, they visit the homes of eligible families on a regular basis (e.g., weekly or monthly) over an extended period (e.g., six months or longer) to provide support to caregivers and children, such as guidance on creating a positive home environment and referrals to community resources. Families participate on a voluntary basis. Research on the efficacy of home visiting has shown that some models can help improve selected child and family outcomes, such as reducing child abuse. In FY2017, the MIECHV program supported 156,297 individual parents and children involved in 942,676 home visits. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, as amended; P.L. 111-148) established the MIECHV program under Section 511 of the Social Security Act in March 2010. The program is jointly administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS's) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The ACA, and amendments to the act, have directly appropriated mandatory funding for the program. Most recently, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018, P.L. 115-123) provided $400 million annually through FY2022. The law is silent about how funds are to be distributed under the program, except to require that HHS reserve 3% of the annual appropriation for Indian tribal entities and another 3% for training, technical assistance, and evaluations. BBA 2018 directs HHS to use the most accurate data available for eligible jurisdictions if funding is awarded on the basis of relative population or poverty considerations. In practice, HHS has distributed MIECHV funding based on a formula that accounts for poverty and based on a competitive award process. States, territories, and tribes must carry out their home visiting programs as specified in the law. Among other requirements, these jurisdictions had to carry out a needs assessment by September 20, 2010, to identify communities with concentrations of poor infant health and other negative outcomes for children and families; the availability and use of home visiting services; and the capacity for providing substance abuse treatment and counseling in the jurisdiction. BBA 2018 directs jurisdictions to update this assessment by October 1, 2020. Under the program, these jurisdictions are required to achieve gains in four of six \"benchmark\" (outcome) areas pertaining to family well-being and coordination of community resources. The law requires that the majority of annual funding (a minimum of 75%) for jurisdictions that administer home visiting programs must be used to support a program model that has shown sufficient evidence of effectiveness. The remaining 25% of funds may be used to implement models that have promise of effectiveness. HHS has established criteria for determining whether home visiting models are effective and reviews home visiting models on an ongoing basis via the Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness (HomVEE) project. The project has determined that 18 models are evidence-based. Generally, these models have shown impacts in one or more outcomes in maternal and child health; early childhood social, emotional, and cognitive development; family/parent functioning; and links to other resources. In FY2017, jurisdictions had implemented 10 of the 18 models using MIECHV funding: Child First, Early Head Start-Home Visiting (EHS-HV), Family Check-Up (FCU), Family Spirit, Health Access Nurturing Development Services (HANDS) Program, Healthy Families America (HFA), Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY), Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP), Parents as Teachers (PAT), and SafeCare Augmented."
