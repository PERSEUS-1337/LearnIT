    "content": "Innovative individuals and firms have increasingly engaged in collaborative research. Thegreater complexity of modern technology, heightened specialization in advanced fields, improvedmeans of communications, and the desire to share the risks and expenses of high technology researchhave each contributed to this trend. Congressional interest in creating an environment conducive tocollaborative research has resulted in numerous legislative initiatives. The Patent Law AmendmentsAct of 1984 and the Cooperative Research and Technology Enhancement (CREATE) Act of 2004are among those that have clarified patent law rules regarding joint inventors and cooperativeresearch endeavors. Observers have nonetheless expressed concerns that applicable patent law standards maydiscourage, rather than foster, collaboration among researchers. Some patent law experts believe thatcurrent rules identifying the members of a research team who qualify as joint inventors are toolenient, vague, and unpredictable. This standard may lead to uncertainties with respect to patentownership. It may also encourage strategic claims drafting during patent acquisition andenforcement. Another target of concern is the current legal rule governing the joint ownership of patents. In the event more than one individual is considered to be a co-inventor of an invention that ispatented, each such person is regarded as a joint owner of that patent. U.S. patent law further deemsa joint owner of a patent to enjoy a \"tenancy-in-common,\" which allows him to exploit a patentwithout regard to the other owners. This property rule appears to maximize the opportunity forexploitation of the patented invention in the marketplace. Yet, because every inventor receives fullrights in an invention no matter what the extent of his contribution, this ownership principle couldpossibly lead to inequitable distributions of the profits of patented inventions. If Congress should deem a legislative response to be appropriate, some commentators havecalled for more specific legislative guidance on the joint inventorship standard. A possible reformwould be to stipulate bright-line rules, or possibly a list of factors that courts should consider, withrespect to joint inventorship. On the other hand, fashioning a workable standard of jointinventorship might prove difficult or ultimately be unnecessary. In addition, alternative ownership rules--such as considering ownership on a claim-by-claim,rather than a patent-by-patent basis--are a possibility. In weighing the desirability of any alternativeto the current regime, concerns for ease of judicial administration and the diminution of theincentives of one joint owner to commercialize the patented invention may be appropriate. However,the patent statute's joint inventorship and joint ownership standards are effectively default rules. Ascollaborative researchers may reach alternative arrangements via contract, legal reform in this areamay not be a compelling need."
