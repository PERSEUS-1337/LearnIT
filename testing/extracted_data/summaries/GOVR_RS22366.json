    "content": "Ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have caused serious injuries to some military personnel. Many have been returned to medical facilities in the U.S., especially Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the National Naval Medical Center, and Brooke Army Medical Center. These severe and traumatic injuries\u2014including amputations, burns, blindness, brain injury, and paralysis\u2014often create significant hardships for the affected individuals that make independent living difficult or impossible. For example, an injured service member may need extensive physical therapy, transportation assistance, and job retraining in order to make the transition back to civilian life. In 2003 and 2004, some pointed out inadequacies in the military's ability to provide these services to its seriously injured personnel. Members of Congress have frequently expressed concern about the level of care for these wounded warriors and their family members. The Department of Defense (DOD) and each of the military services have established new programs to care for the severely disabled, ensuring rehabilitative assistance and easing the transition back to civilian life. Congress has followed these initiatives with interest and recently directed DOD to develop policies and procedures to standardize these programs. This report examines the background for the new initiatives and provides a status of each program, including contact information. This report will be updated as these programs continue to evolve and mature."
