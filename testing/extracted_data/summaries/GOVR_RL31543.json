    "content": "Russian President Putin appears to have made a strategic decision to shift Russian policy toward cooperation with the United States and the West. This is a major departure from the policy that Putininherited from his predecessors, which saw Russia as the leader of a coalition aimed at opposing U.S.\"global domination.\" Putin seized upon the events of September 11 to promote his new policy by: cooperating with the United States against Al Qaeda and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan; softening Russianopposition to NATO enlargement, including admission of former Soviet republics, and establishinga new cooperative relationship with NATO; acquiescing in U.S. decisions regarding withdrawal fromthe ABM Treaty, strategic nuclear force reductions, and missile defense; and closing Russia's largemilitary intelligence base in Cuba. The principal reason given by Putin for the new policy is that Russia must integrate with the West in order to reconstruct its own economy and achieve a decent living standard for its people. Putin also acknowledges Russia's weakness and inability to act globally in opposition to the UnitedStates. He may also have rejected as unwise, the previous policy of de facto alliance with Chinaagainst the United States, instead seeing China as a possible long-term threat to Russia. Putin's new policy does not seem to enjoy strong support among Russian political elites, the military and foreignpolicy establishment, and the general public. Putin's overall political power and prestige, however,may be sufficient to sustain the policy. The Bush Administration responded positively to the new Russian policy after September 11. The Administration, however, did not make many concessions on key issues related to arms control,missile defense, and NATO. It has been more forthcoming on some economic issues. The implications of Russia's pro-western policy are overwhelmingly positive for the United States in the war on terrorism and in relations with Russia and China. Russia's strategic choice ofintegration with the West reduces the danger seen by some of Russo-Chinese cooperation againstthe United States. By depriving China of its erstwhile Russian partner, it may encourage China toseek improved relations with the United States - or risk geostrategic isolation. Some sore points remain between Washington and Moscow in which Congress takes a strong interest, such as Russia's continued and possibly expanded plans to construct nuclear reactors in Iran,its support of Iraq, and its heavy-handed policy in Chechnya. There is also friction on some tradeissues. Critics of Bush Administration policy argue that it has not been sufficiently responsive to Putin and risks losing the new cooperativeness. Others reply that Russia has no choice but to continue itspro-western course, in view of Russia's weakness and its self-interest in integrating with the West. In this view, the endurance of Russia's pro-western policy ultimately may depend on Putin's successin reviving the economy and improving Russians' well-being."
