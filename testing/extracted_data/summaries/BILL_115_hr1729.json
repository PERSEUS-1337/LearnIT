    "content": "Statutes at Large Modernization Act This bill directs the Government Publishing Office (GPO) to make the Statutes at Large available to the public at no cost on a website in a searchable, non-proprietary format. The GPO must ensure that the searchable online edition is prepared in coordination with the National Archives and Records Administration and congressional support offices that develop formatting conventions used for enrolled bills and other legislative materials. The bill amends the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1996 to require relevant Statutes at Large electronic information made available by the GPO to be incorporated into the Library of Congress's legislative information retrieval system."
