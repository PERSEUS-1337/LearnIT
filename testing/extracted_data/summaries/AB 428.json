    "title": "An act to add and repeal Sections 17053.50 and 23650 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation, to take effect immediately, tax levy.",
    "content": "The Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law allow various credits against the taxes imposed by those laws. This bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2022, would allow a tax credit under both laws in an amount equal to 30 of the qualified costs paid or incurred by a qualified taxpayer for any seismic retrofit construction on a qualified building, as provided. The bill would require a taxpayer, in order to be eligible for the credit, to obtain 2 certifications from the appropriate jurisdiction with authority for building code enforcement of the area in which the building is located: one prior to seismic retrofit construction that certifies that the building is an at-risk property, and a second subsequent to construction that certifies that the completed construction is seismic retrofit construction, as defined, and specifies a dollar amount of qualified costs. The bill would further require the taxpayer to provide the second certification to and apply for allocation of the credit with the Franchise Tax Board, and would require the board to allocate credits on a first-come-first-served basis. The bill would provide that the credit would have an aggregate cap under both laws of $12,000,000 for each calendar year, as provided. Existing law requires a bill that would authorize a new credit against the tax imposed by the Personal Income Tax Law or the Corporation Tax Law to contain specific goals, purposes, and objectives that the new credit will achieve and detailed performance indicators and data collection requirements for determining whether the new credit achieves these goals, purposes, and objectives. This bill would make findings specifying the goals, purposes, and objectives of the above-described tax credits and detailing the performance indicators and data collection requirements for determining whether the credits meet these goals, purposes, and objectives. This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."
