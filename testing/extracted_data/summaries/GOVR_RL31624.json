    "content": "Pakistan is a key front-line ally in the U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition. After September2001, Pakistani President Musharraf ended his government's ties with the Taliban regime ofAfghanistan and has since cooperated with and contributed to U.S. efforts to track and captureremnants of Al Qaeda and Taliban forces that have sought refuge inside Pakistani territory. Pakistan's cooperation has been called \"crucial\" to past and ongoing U.S. successes in the region, butthere is growing concern that the bilateral relationship is fragile and may be undermined bypotentially disruptive developments in the areas of weapons proliferation, democracy-building, andPakistan-India relations. Remaining proliferation- and democracy-related aid restrictions on Pakistan were removedin the final months of 2001, and the United States continues to make large aid donations to Pakistanand to support that country's interests in negotiations with international financial institutions. Thereare concerns that October 2002 national elections in Pakistan were not sufficiently free and open byWestern standards and that the military-dominated government in Islamabad intends to remain inpower through manipulation of constitutional and democratic processes. This possibility led someMembers of the 107th Congress to seek the renewal of aid restrictions or a modification of thePresident's waiver authority until such time that a more robust democratic process is sustained anda civilian-led government effectively is in place. There also is concern that possibly growinganti-American sentiment in Pakistan and the potential \"re-Talibanization\" of that country's western provinces bordering Afghanistan could adversely affect U.S. interests in the region. During 2002, the United States took an increasingly direct, if low-profile, role in both lawenforcement and military operations being conducted on Pakistani territory. These operations haveled to favorable results in tracking and apprehending dangerous Islamic militants, but the activitiesof U.S. personnel in the country have led to increasing signs of anti-American backlash and Pakistanisovereignty concerns. Recent electoral gains by a coalition of Pakistani Islamist political parties areviewed as an expression of such sentiments that may lead to reduced Pakistan-U.S. cooperation incounterterrorism operations in the future. The civilian Parliament and Prime Minister that wereseated in Islamabad in November 2002 may powerfully influence the course and scope of future U.S.presence in the region. This report reviews the status of Pakistan-U.S. anti-terrorism cooperation in the areas of lawenforcement, intelligence, and military operations. U.S. arms transfers to and security cooperationwith Pakistan are also discussed. A following section addresses the major domestic repercussionsof Pakistan-U.S. counterterrorism efforts, the ways in which such efforts are perceived bynewly-empowered Pakistan Islamists and their followers, and the possible effects these dynamicsmay have on future Pakistan-U.S. cooperation in this realm. The final section assesses the overallstatus of Pakistan-U.S. anti-terrorism cooperation and key points of U.S. concern. Broaderdiscussion of bilateral relations and relevant legislation is found in CRS Issue Brief IB94041, Pakistan-U.S. Relations . This report will be updated periodically."
