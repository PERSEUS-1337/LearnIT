    "content": "The Hardest Hit Fund (HHF), administered by the Department of the Treasury, is one of several temporary programs that were created to help prevent home foreclosures in the aftermath of housing and mortgage market turmoil that began around 2007-2008. It provided a total of $9.6 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds to 19 states (including the District of Columbia) that were deemed to be \"hardest hit\" by the housing market turmoil, as defined by factors such as house price declines or unemployment rates. In 2010, a total of $7.6 billion was allocated to selected states through four rounds of funding. Different funding rounds used different criteria to identify eligible states. In December 2015, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) authorized Treasury to make up to an additional $2.0 billion in unused TARP funds available to the HHF, bringing total program funding to $9.6 billion. Treasury allocated this additional funding to the states that were already participating in the HHF through two phases in 2016. The Hardest Hit Fund is intended to provide funds to participating states to design foreclosure prevention programs that respond to local conditions. Participating states are using their funds for a variety of programs, including mortgage modifications, helping unemployed homeowners with mortgage payments, facilitating short sales and other foreclosure alternatives, and removing blighted homes, among other programs. Most participating states are using their funding for several different types of programs. As of December 2016, participating states had disbursed about $5.8 billion of the total $9.6 billion allocated to the HHF and assisted over 290,000 homeowners. States have until December 31, 2020, to use their HHF funds."
