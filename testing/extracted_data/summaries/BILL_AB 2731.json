    "content": "Existing law authorizes the Department of Transportation, upon adoption of an ordinance or resolution by the City of Carson, the City of Long Beach, and the City of Los Angeles, to issue a special permit to the operator of a vehicle, combination of vehicles, or mobile equipment, permitting the operation and movement of the vehicle, combination, or equipment, and its load, on specified routes in those cities if the vehicle, combination, or equipment meets specified criteria. Under existing law, those criteria include that the vehicle, combination of vehicles, or mobile equipment is used to transport intermodal cargo containers that are moving in international commerce, and that the maximum gross weight of the vehicles and loads not exceed 95,000 pounds gross vehicle weight. This bill would require the above-mentioned ordinance or resolution to conform with the weight limits determined by the Department of Transportation. the City of Carson, the City of Long Beach, and the City of Los Angeles to use and enforce the axle and gross vehicle weight limits used by the Department of Transportation for a permitted vehicle, combination of vehicles, or mobile equipment operating or moving on the above-described routes by individual, and not combined, axle group calculations."
