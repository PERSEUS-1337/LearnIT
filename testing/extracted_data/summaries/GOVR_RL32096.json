    "content": "Federal court denial of British extradition requests in the cases of four fugitives from Northern Ireland led to the Supplementary Extradition Treaty. The Treaty proved controversial, and before the Senate would give its consent, it insisted upon modifications, some quite unusual. Those modifications have been eliminated in a newly negotiated treaty to which the Senate has recently given its advice and consent and which incorporates features often more characteristic of contemporary extradition treaties with other countries. There was initial criticism of the new Treaty's exemptions to the political offense bar to extradition; elimination of judicial inquiry into politically motivated extradition request; treatment of probable cause; clause relating to extradition for crimes committed overseas; dropping the statute of limitations defense; discretionary authority for provisional arrest and detention; language relating to the seizure of assets; exceptions to the rule of speciality (permitting prosecution for crimes other than those for which extradition was granted); and retroactive application. The Treaty also contains articles relating to capital punishment, waiver of extradition, extradition involving third countries, double jeopardy, the elimination of nationality as a bar to extradition, translations, and deferred prosecution. The Senate conditioned its approval of the Treaty upon an understanding, two declarations and three provisos which relate to the Treaty's treatment of the exception for politically motivated requests and the role of the courts, its changes in the double jeopardy clause, assurances that the Treaty is not designed to accomplish the extradition of fugitives from Northern Ireland covered by the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, and reporting requirements concerning the disposition of requests under the Treaty.
