    "title": "An act to add Section 712.5 to the Public Utilities Code, relating to electricity, making an appropriation therefor, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately.",
    "content": "Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. The Diablo Canyon nuclear powerplant, composed of reactor Units 1 and 2, is operated by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company in the County of San Luis Obispo. Existing law requires the commission to convene, or continue, until August 26, 2025, an independent peer review panel to conduct an independent review of enhanced seismic studies and surveys of the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant, including the surrounding areas of the facility and areas of nuclear waste storage. The Nuclear Facility Decommissioning Act of 1985 requires each electrical corporation owning or operating nuclear facilities to establish an externally managed, segregated fund for payment of decommissioning costs of those facilities, establishes requirements for collection of moneys for decommisioning costs in the utility\u2019s rates and charges, and requires that the expenses associated with decommissioning of nuclear facilities be paid from those funds. Pursuant to the act, the commission ordered 2 nuclear decommissioning funds be established for the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant. This bill would require the commission to cause an assessment to be completed by no later than July 1, 2018, conducted by an independent 3rd party, selected as specified, of the adverse and beneficial economic impacts, and net economic effects, that could occur, and of potential ways for the state and local jurisdictions to mitigate the adverse economic impact, if the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant were to temporarily or permanently shut down before the powerplant\u2019s current operating licenses expire or when the Pacific Gas and Electric Company closes the powerplant upon the expiration of its current licenses. The bill would require the commission to approve the withdrawal of $400,000 from the nuclear decommissioning funds established for the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant for use by the commission for additional staffing to urgently effectuate the 3rd-party assessment. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Pacific Gas and Electric Company. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."
