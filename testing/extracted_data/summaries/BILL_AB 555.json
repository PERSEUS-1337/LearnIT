    "title": "AB 555",
    "content": "Existing law establishes procedures for conducting expedited jury trials in civil cases where the parties sign a consent order to stipulate that those procedures apply. Pursuant to these procedures, all parties agree that each side has up to 3 hours to present its case and agree to waive all rights to appeal and to move for a directed verdict or to make any posttrial motions, except as provided. Existing law repeals these provisions on January 1, 2016. This bill would modify procedures to provide that each party would have up to 5 hours to complete voir dire and present its case. The bill would require the Judicial Council to update rules and forms relating to these procedures by July 1, 2016. The bill would also delete the January 1, 2016, repeal date, thereby extending the operation of these provisions indefinitely. Existing law requires that a designated action or special proceeding meeting certain conditions be treated as a limited civil case. Existing law authorizes a limited civil case to be brought in the small claims division if the case is within the jurisdiction of the small claims division as otherwise provided by statute. The bill would establish procedures for conducting mandatory expedited jury trials in limited civil cases, including provisions for a jury of 8 or few members, with one alternate, and a limit of 5 hours for each side to complete voir dire and to present its case. The bill would authorize either party to opt out of the expedited jury trial procedures if certain requirements are met. The bill would provide that the verdict in an expedited jury trial case may be appealed and is subject to any written highlow agreement, as defined. The bill would require the Judicial Council to adopt additional rules and uniform procedures, as provided, by July 1, 2016. The bill would delay the operative date of specified provisions relating to mandatory expedited jury trials until July 1, 2016. The bill would also repeal the provisions relating to mandatory expedited jury trials on July 1, 2019."
