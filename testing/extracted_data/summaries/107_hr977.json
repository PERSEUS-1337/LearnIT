    "title": "To amend the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to provide increased authority for school personnel to discipline children with disabilities who engage in certain dangerous behavior.",
    "content": "Classroom Safety Act of 2001 - Amends the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to authorize school personnel to discipline , in the same manner in which such personnel may discipline a child without a disability, any child with a disability who commits specified school-related weapon or drug offenses. Authorizes such personnel to modify the disciplinary action on a case-by-case basis. Permits assertion of a defense that the offense was committed unintentionally or innocently. Allows the local educational agency (LEA) responsible for providing educational services to a child with a disability who is expelled or suspended under this Act to choose to continue to provide educational services to such child. But specifies that an LEA that so chooses to continue to provide services: (1) is not required by IDEA to provide such child with a free appropriate public education, or any particular level of service. And (2) has discretion as to the location where it provides the services."
