    "content": "Best Return on America's Investment Now Act or BRAIN Act - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make up to 10 of the worldwide employment-based immigration level available to qualified immigrants who: (1) hold a doctorate degree in a field of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics from a US doctoral institution of higher education. And (2) have taken all doctoral courses in a STEM field, including all courses taken by correspondence or by distance education, while physically present in the United States. Reduces the number of immigrant visas available to skilled workers, professionals, and other workers. Revises the computation of the total number of immigrant visas that may be made available to natives of any single foreign state or dependent area in a fiscal year. States that: (1) the permanent priority date for any employment-based petition shall be the date on which the petition is filed with Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) , unless such filing was preceded by the filing of a labor certification with the Secretary of Labor, in which case that date shall constitute the priority date. And (2) an alien who is the beneficiary of an employment-based petition that was approvable when filed shall retain that petition's priority date in the consideration of any subsequently filed employment-based petition."
