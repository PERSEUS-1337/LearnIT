    "title": "An act to amend Section 4000.5 of the Elections Code, relating to elections.",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes, until January 1, 2020, San Diego County to conduct, as a pilot program, an all-mailed ballot special election or special consolidated election to fill a congressional or legislative vacancy under specified conditions. If such an election is conducted, existing law requires San Diego County to report certain information to the Legislature and the Secretary of State regarding the success of the election. This bill, until January 1, 2021, would authorize San Diego County, or any city, school district, community college district, special district, or other district or political subdivision whose boundaries are located wholly within San Diego County, to conduct an all-mailed ballot special election or special consolidated election to fill a vacancy on the legislative or governing body of those entities. The bill would authorize those entities to also hold an all-mailed ballot special election for county initiatives, city initiatives, district initiatives, bond issues, and school measures conducted pursuant to specified provisions. The bill would extend the pilot program for San Diego County, as described above, until January 1, 2021. The bill would also require certain voter education workshops to be conducted in-person. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of San Diego."
