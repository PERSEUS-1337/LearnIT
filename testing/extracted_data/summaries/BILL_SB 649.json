    "title": "SB 649",
    "content": "Existing law generally prohibits the total gross weight in pounds imposed on the highway by a group of 2 or more consecutive axles of a vehicle from exceeding a specified weight, depending on the distance in feet between the extremes of a group of 2 or more consecutive axles, and the number of axles. This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to those provisions."
