    "content": "True American Heroes Act of 2002 - Title I: Medals for Responders and Resisters - Authorizes the award (posthumously) of congressional gold medals to the government workers and others who responded to the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Virginia and perished in the tragic events of September 11, 2001, and to the people aboard United Airlines Flight 93 who helped resist the hijackers on board and caused the plane to crash. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to strike duplicates in gold of the gold medals for permanent display in named departments and duty stations. Authorizes the Secretary to strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold medals at a price sufficient to cover the costs of the bronze medals and the cost of the gold medals. Title II: Spirit of America Commemorative Coins - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue $50 dollar gold coins, one-dollar silver coins, and half-dollar clad coins emblematic of the tragic events that occurred at the Pentagon, in New York City, and in Pennsylvania, on September 11, 2001. Requires the sale of such coins to include a surcharge to cover the cost of the gold coins minted under this Act for presentment to the next of kin of those who died in the September 11, 2001, attacks, and any proceeds from such surcharges in excess of the cost of producing all coins to be: (1) used to cover the costs incurred in the production of the gold medals that have not been recovered from the sale of duplicate bronze medals minted under this Act. And (2) with respect to any amount remaining after payment of such costs, transferred to any fund for the victims of such attacks."
