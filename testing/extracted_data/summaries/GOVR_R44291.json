    "content": "Congress most recently enacted major energy legislation in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-140). The 114th Congress is currently considering new legislation to address broad energy issues. On April 20, 2016, the Senate passed an amended version of S. 2012, the Energy Policy and Modernization Act. On December 3, 2015, the House passed an amended version of H.R. 8, the North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2015. On May 25, 2016, the House passed an amended version of S. 2012 which contains the text of H.R. 8, as well as the text of several other energy and natural resources-related bills. The following day, the House moved to insist upon its amendment, and to appoint conferees to resolve the differences in S. 2012. On July 12, the Senate agreed to the request for a conference, and appointed conferees. Both versions of S. 2012 would address a variety of energy topics, including Energy efficiency in federal buildings, data centers, manufacturing, and schools; Water conservation/efficiency; Electric grid cybersecurity; Nuclear energy and carbon sequestration research and development; Amendments to hydropower licensing provisions; Liquefied natural gas exports; and Energy workforce development. The House version also contains provisions on Electric grid physical security; A North American energy security plan; and A study of wholesale electricity markets. The Senate version also includes provisions on Review of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; Geothermal energy development on federal lands; Vehicle research and development; Electric grid energy storage; Renewable energy supply and incentives; and Loan programs. Both versions of S. 2012 also contain major non-energy provisions including fish and wildlife recreation and federal land conveyances. Differences include permanent authorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) (Senate); reauthorization of the EPA Brownfields Program (Senate); National Forest management (House); and federal water project operations and drought relief (House). This report provides a short discussion of key topics addressed in the House and Senate-passed versions of S. 2012."
