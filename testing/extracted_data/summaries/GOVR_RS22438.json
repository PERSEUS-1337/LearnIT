    "content": "The Public Health Service Act (PHSA) establishes authority for the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop and implement workforce programs authorized in Title VII (health and medicine) and Title VIII (nursing). These programs, administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), provide grants, scholarships, and loans to support institutions and individuals in developing and sustaining the health workforce. Before passage of health care reform legislation in March 2010, appropriations authority for all Title VII and Title VIII programs had expired. Congress had nonetheless continued to appropriate funds for the programs. During the period from FY2001 through FY2010, total annual appropriations for Title VII programs fluctuated from a high of $308.4 million in FY2003 to a low of $145.1 million in FY2006. For Title VIII programs, during the period from FY2001 through FY2009, the annual appropriation increased from $83.8 million to $171.0 million. In the FY2010 appropriation, Congress boosted Title VIII funding by an additional 43% over the previous year. For FY2009, Congress appropriated funds for Title VII and Title VIII programs through two separate enactments. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-8) provided $392.7 million in regular appropriations. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5) added a supplemental appropriation of $200 million to be obligated over two years. Of this total, $148.5 million has been applied to Title VII and Title VIII programs; remaining funds are expected to be obligated for related activities (see Appendix A). For FY2010, Congress appropriated $498.0 million for Title VII and Title VIII programs, an increase of 26.8% over the regular FY2009 appropriations. President Barack Obama's FY2011 budget contains a request of $503.9 million for Title VII and Title VIII programs, a 1.2% increase above the regular FY2010 appropriations. The FY2011 request would provide level funding for almost all Title VII and Title VIII programs. This report provides a history of appropriations for programs in Title VII and Title VIII of the PHSA. It includes a summary of new authorizations for these two titles, as enacted in major health reform legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, P.L. 111-148 (see Appendix B)."
