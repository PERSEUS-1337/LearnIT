Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act of 2013 - Amends the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act of 2004 to prohibit an employer from discharging, demoting, suspending, harassing, or in any other manner discriminating against an employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such employer who: (1) provided information to the employer or the federal government concerning a violation of antitrust law or of another criminal law committed in conjunction with a potential violation of antitrust law or in conjunction with an antitrust investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ). Or (2) filed, testified, participated, or otherwise assisted in an investigation relating to such a violation. Excludes from such protection any individual who planned and initiated such a violation or an obstruction to the investigation of such a violation. Authorizes an individual who alleges discharge or other discrimination by an employer in violation of such prohibition to seek relief: (1) by filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor. Or (2) if the Secretary has not issued a final decision within 180 days of such filing, by bringing an action at law or equity in the appropriate US district court. Entitles an individual who prevails in any such action to all relief necessary to make such individual whole, including reinstatement with the same status, back pay plus interest, and compensation for special damages sustained."
