    "title": "SB 1256",
    "content": "Existing law states the time and procedure for commencement of civil actions. This bill would require a person who claims to have been aggrieved by an alleged unlawful act or practice, to send a letter to the person or entity he or she alleges to have caused the harm that sets forth alleged facts in support of the grievance and any other information necessary to inform the person or entity of the alleged harm suffered, prior to filing any legal action or pursuing legally mandated alternative dispute resolution, as specified. The bill would require the person who claims to have been aggrieved to engage with that person or entity in good faith efforts to be made whole, if, during the 30-day period following the date on which the letter was received there is a response from the person or entity that is alleged to have engaged in the unlawful act or practice. The bill would toll the statute of limitations on a claim arising from the alleged unlawful act or practice for the 30-day period, including the following period of negotiations, if any. If, after that 30-day period there is no response, the bill would authorize the person who claims to have been aggrieved to pursue other efforts to be made whole, including filing a claim in a court of competent jurisdiction or alternative dispute resolution. The bill would require that if the person who claims to have been aggrieved files a complaint in a court of law, he or she shall describe in the complaint the good faith efforts he or she made to comply with these provisions or attach a copy of the letter sent pursuant to this section and proof of its mailing to the complaint. The bill would also authorize a court, factfinder, or arbiter, if it determines that these provisions were not complied with in good faith, to dismiss a claim that is otherwise authorized, in which case it would be required to state in writing and with specificity why the case was dismissed, and whether or not the case is dismissed with or without prejudice."
