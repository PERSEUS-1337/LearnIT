    "content": "Overseas Voting Practical Amendments Act of 2007 - Amends the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) to rename the official post card form containing both an absentee voter registration application and an absentee ballot application the Federal Voter Registration and Ballot Application. Prohibits states from refusing to accept balloting materials on any of specified grounds, including that the materials are not printed on a post card, do not include certain information, are not notarized or witnessed by an authorized official, are not delivered by the US Postal Service, or do not meet certain other nonessential requirements. Amends federal postal law with respect to postage markings on certain balloting materials mailed by the states. Amends UOCAVA to: (1) permit voters to request absentee ballots in all subsequent elections. (2) repeal the requirement to provide absentee ballots in subsequent elections to individuals with unknown addresses. (3) apply UOCAVA to individuals who have never resided in the United States. (4) require prompt notification of rejection of a voter registration or absentee ballot request. And (5) provide for use of a US State Department diplomatic pouch for returning completed absentee ballots."
