    "content": "Secure Visas Act - Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to grant the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) (Secretary), except for the Secretary of State's authority with respect to diplomatic- and international organization-related visas, exclusive authority to issue regulations, establish policy, and administer the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and all other immigration or nationality laws relating to US consular officer visa functions. Authorizes the Secretary to refuse or revoke any visa to an alien or class of aliens if necessary or advisable for US security interests. Provides that such visa revocation shall become effective immediately and cancel any other visa in an alien's possession. Prohibits judicial review of the Secretary's refusal or revocation of visa, or of any claim arising from such revocation. Authorizes the Secretary of State to direct a consular officer to refuse or revoke a visa if necessary or advisable for US interests. Prohibits a visa approval decision by the Secretary of State from overriding a revocation or refusal determination by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to review on-site all visa applications and supporting documentation before adjudication at visa-issuing posts in Algeria, Canada, Colombia, Egypt, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in Israel, Jordan, Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Venezuela, and Yemen and authorizes the Secretary to asign DHS personnel to each diplomatic and consular post at which visas are issued unless, in the Secretary's sole and unreviewable discretion, the Secretary determines that such an assignment at a particular post would not promote national or homeland security. Directs the Secretary of State to ensure that any such DHS personnel have been stationed and are operational within one year of enactment of this Act. States that if the Secretary or the Secretary of State revokes a visa: (1) the relevant consular, law enforcement, and terrorist screening databases shall be immediately updated. And (2) look-out notices shall be posted to all DHS port inspectors and Department of State consular officers. Amends INA to: (1) eliminate the exception permitting judicial review of a visa revocation where such revocation is the sole ground for a deportation process based upon an alien's unlawful US presence, and (2) prohibit any court from hearing a claim arising from a visa revocation."
