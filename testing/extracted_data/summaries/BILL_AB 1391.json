    "title": "AB 1391",
    "content": "Existing law requires the adopted course of study for grades 1 to 6, inclusive, to include instruction in specified areas of study, including physical education, with emphasis upon the physical activities for the pupils that may be conducive to health and vigor of body and mind, for a total period of time of not less than 200 minutes each 10 schooldays, exclusive of recesses and the lunch period. Notwithstanding that provision, existing law provides that instruction in physical education in an elementary school maintaining any of grades 1 to 8, inclusive, shall be for a total period of time of not less than 200 minutes each 10 schooldays, exclusive of recesses and the lunch period. This bill would authorize a complaint that a school district or county superintendent of schools has not complied with the instructional minute requirements of the physical education adopted course of study for pupils in those grades to be filed with the school district or county superintendent of schools pursuant to the Uniform Complaint Procedures, as specified. To the extent this bill would impose additional duties on school district or county office of education officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill also would state the Legislature\u2019s finding and declaration that the provisions prescribing the requirements for the adopted course of study for grades 1 to 6, inclusive, and for instructional time for physical education in an elementary school maintaining any of grades 1 to 8, inclusive, were not intended to create a private right of action, but would provide that nothing in those provisions is to restrict or expand the existing right of any party to seek relief from noncompliance with them pursuant to a writ of mandate. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."
