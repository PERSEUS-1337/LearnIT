    "content": "The Indian Health Service (IHS), an agency in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provides health care for eligible American Indians/Alaskan Natives through a system of programs and facilities located on or near Indian reservations and in certain urban areas. The IHS health delivery program is organized into 12 regional area offices and 161 local service units, and serves federal reservations, Indian communities, and urban Indians. In general, persons eligible for IHS services must be in IHS service areas and belong to federally recognized tribes. The IHS-served population generally has a higher incidence of illness and premature mortality than the U.S. population as a whole. Several IHS publications compare the health conditions and causes of death of the IHS service population with those for the entire U.S. population. According to the latest of these, the average life expectancy at birth for the IHS service area population in 1999-2001 was 74.5 years, or 2.4 years less than the 76.9 years for the total U.S. population. IHS appropriations are separated into two budget categories: health services and health facilities. For FY2008, the total appropriation for IHS was $3.35 billion, of which $2.97 billion (89%) was for health services and $374.6 million (11%) was for health facilities. Other sources of IHS funding include a special diabetes program and reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. Total IHS \"program-level\" funding, including all sources, was $4.28 billion in FY2008. Indian health advocates argue that IHS funding falls short of the need. Although a number of legislative issues concerning IHS face the 111th Congress, the primary focus has been on the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA). Two bills (S. 1200 and H.R. 1328) were introduced in the 110th Congress to reauthorize the IHCIA. Both reauthorization bills would have expanded health services, eased processes for reimbursements from Medicaid and other federal programs, coordinated behavioral health programs, and authorized other actions. S. 1200 was reported, amended, by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee on October 17, 2007 (S.Rept. 110-197). S. 1200 was passed, amended, by the Senate February 28, 2008, and sent to the House. H.R. 1328 was reported, amended, by the House Natural Resources Committee on April 4, 2008 (H.Rept. 110-564, part 1). Separately H.R. 1328 was forwarded, amended, by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee to the full Committee on November 7, 2007. H.R. 1328 was discharged by the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees on June 6, 2008, and the Natural Resources version reported in April was placed on the calendar. Concerns continue about many issues in the IHCIA bills, including provisions on Medicaid and other issues listed in a January 2008 Statement of Administration Policy on S. 1200, which threatened a veto of that bill. Neither S. 1200 nor H.R. 1328 were passed by Congress. No IHCIA bill has been introduced in the 111th Congress as of the date of this report, but certain Medicaid-related provisions have been included in draft economic-stimulus legislation. This report will be updated."
