    "content": "Green payments are generally defined as payments made to agricultural producers ascompensation for environmental benefits that accrue at levels beyond what producers mightotherwise achieve under existing market and regulatory conditions. They may support bothenvironmental and farm income objectives. Modern U.S. agri-environmental programs began in 1985 by paying farmers to retire landand limiting conversion of wetlands and highly erodible land to cultivation, thereby reducingnegative environmental effects associated with production agriculture. These initial programsfocused on a single agricultural benefit, limiting erosion. Since then, these programs haveproliferated in number and overall funding, and now pay farmers to provide additional conservationbenefits either while maintaining agricultural production on working lands, or by retiring land fromproduction. These environmental benefits include stemming wetland loss and wildlife habitatdeterioration, protecting farmland from conversion to other uses, and improving water and airquality. The Conservation Security Program (CSP), enacted in the 2002 farm bill ( P.L. 107-171 ) isthe most recent step in the evolution of U.S. agri-environmental policy. CSP pays producers tocapture environmental benefits across their entire agricultural operation, while producingcommodities. It has been characterized by some as the most comprehensive U.S. \"green payments\"program. General environmental policy in the European Union (EU) deals with negative externalitiesfrom water pollution, nitrates, and pesticides, among other issues, and also affects agriculturalproduction. EU farm policy since 1985, however, has included payments to farmers to compensatefor costs incurred or income forgone from undertaking agri-environmental measures that meet farmpolicy and rural development objectives. Such measures include, inter alia , reducing use of fertilizerand chemical inputs, adopting organic production methods, maintaining countryside and landscape,or managing land for leisure activities or public access. Successive reforms of the EU's CommonAgricultural Policy (CAP) have placed greater emphasis on such green payments -- and increasedfunding for them -- as agri-environmental measures have been integrated into a broad ruraldevelopment policy. Congressional interest in green payments today is driven by pressure from international tradenegotiations and the anticipated development of the next farm bill, which will likely contain the U.S.policy responses to the results of these negotiations. These negotiations create considerableuncertainty over future farm program options, and green payments, in some fashion, are widelyviewed as an option that could be designed so as to satisfy both international obligations anddomestic agriculture constituencies. Differences between the United States and the EU in how greenpayments have been defined and translated into policy and programs may make consideration of EUagri-environmental policy as a model or source of ideas problematic. This report, which comparescurrent U.S. and EU efforts in the area of green payments, will be updated."
