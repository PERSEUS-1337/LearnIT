    "content": "Hong Kong Reversion Act - Directs the President to consider the performance of the Hong Kong Government and the actions of the Chinese Government when determining whether Hong Kong is not sufficiently autonomous to justify treatment under a particular US law different from that accorded China as required under the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. Directs the Secretary of State to include in each annual report to the Congress on conditions in Hong Kong, among other things, assessments of: (1) whether the Hong Kong people have a legislature that is fairly and freely elected. (2) Hong Kong's or China's cooperation in securing certain agreements with the United States. And (3) the autonomy of Hong Kong and its customs territory. Prohibits the use of funds made available for the US Information Agency (USIA) for the participation of any member of the Hong Kong provisional legislature in any academic, professional, or cultural program of the USIA, including any international visitors program, any citizens exchange program, and any scholarship or fellowship associated with any such program."
