    "content": "The House of Representatives has several different parliamentary procedures through which it can bring legislation to the chamber floor. Which of these will be used in a given situation depends on many factors, including the type of measure being considered, its cost, the amount of political or policy controversy surrounding it, and the degree to which Members want to debate it and propose amendments. This report provides a snapshot of the forms and origins of measures that, according to the Legislative Information System of the U.S. Congress, received action on the House floor in the 113th Congress (2013-2014) and the parliamentary procedures used to bring them up for initial House consideration. In the 113th Congress, 943 pieces of legislation received floor action in the House of Representatives. Of these, 692 were bills or joint resolutions, and 251 were simple or concurrent resolutions, a breakdown between lawmaking and non-lawmaking legislative forms of approximately 73% to 27%. Of these 943 measures, 846 originated in the House, and 97 originated in the Senate. During the same period, 59% of all measures receiving initial House floor action came before the chamber under the Suspension of the Rules procedure, 18% came to the floor as business \"privileged\" under House rules and precedents, 16% were raised by a special rule reported by the Committee on Rules and adopted by the House, and 7% came up by the unanimous consent of Members. One measure, representing less than 1% of legislation receiving House floor action in the 113th Congress, was processed under the procedures associated with the call of the Private Calendar. When only lawmaking forms of legislation (bills and joint resolutions) are counted, 75% of such measures receiving initial House floor action in the 113th Congresses came before the chamber under the Suspension of the Rules procedure, 20% were raised by a special rule reported by the Committee on Rules and adopted by the House, and 5% came up by the unanimous consent of Members. Less than 1% of lawmaking forms of legislation received House floor action via the call of the Private Calendar or by virtue of being \"privileged\" under House rules. The party sponsorship of legislation receiving initial floor action in the 113th Congress varied based on the procedure used to raise the legislation on the chamber floor. Sixty-eight percent of the measures considered under the Suspension of the Rules procedure were sponsored by majority party Members. All but four of the 148 measures brought before the House under the terms of a special rule reported by the House Committee on Rules and adopted by the House were sponsored by majority party Members."
