    "content": "Human world knowledge is both structured and flexible. When people see an object, they represent it not as a pixel array but as a meaningful arrangement of semantic parts. Moreover, when people refer to an object, they provide descriptions that are not merely true but also relevant in the current context. Here, we combine these two observations in order to learn fine-grained correspondences between language and contextually relevant geometric properties of 3D objects. To do this, we employed an interactive communication task with human participants to construct a large dataset containing natural utterances referring to 3D objects from ShapeNet in a wide variety of contexts. Using this dataset, we developed neural listener and speaker models with strong capacity for generalization. By performing targeted lesions of visual and linguistic input, we discovered that the neural listener depends heavily on part-related words and associates these words correctly with the corresponding geometric properties of objects, suggesting that it has learned task-relevant structure linking the two input modalities. We further show that a neural speaker that is `listener-aware' --- that plans its utterances according to how an imagined listener would interpret its words in context --- produces more discriminative referring expressions than an `listener-unaware' speaker, as measured by human performance in identifying the correct object. Human world knowledge is both structured and flexible. For example, when people see a chair, they represent it not as a pixel array but as a semantically meaningful combination of parts, such as arms, legs, seat, and back. How to obtain and flexibly deploy such structured knowledge remains an outstanding problem in machine learning (Lake et al., 2017) . One promising approach is to harness the rich conceptual and relational structure latent in language (Andreas et al., 2017) . Natural languages have been optimized across human history to solve the problem of efficiently communicating those aspects of the world most relevant to current goals (Kirby et al., 2015; Gibson et al., 2017) . Consequently, language reflects the structured nature of our world knowledge: we not only conceive of a chair in terms of its semantic parts, but can combine multiple words to refer to its 'curved back' or 'cushioned seat', and provide more informative descriptions if the context requires it, e.g., refer to a different distinguishing part if all the chairs have a cushioned seat.Our goal is to leverage these insights to develop systems that can make fine-grained distinctions between complex object geometries across a wide variety of contexts. Our approach is to leverage natural language produced by people in an interactive communication task to develop neural network models of the speaker and listener roles in this task. We find that the resulting representations learned by these models exhibit structure that is crucial for robust communication: first, they capture taskrelevant correspondences between individual parts of objects and individual tokens of language, and second, they have strong capacity to generalize to novel contexts, objects, utterances, and other related object classes.We make the following contributions:close context far context Figure 1 : Constructing \"close\" and \"far\" contexts by exploiting the latent neighborhood structure of 3D chairs. Orange is a high indegree seed chair, dark gray its selected distractors in each context. Taken together, our results show that natural language, derived from communication in context, provides a strong objective for learning to make fine-grained distinctions between objects with an emphasis on their shared part-structure. An exciting future application of this work would be to leverage these techniques for improving unsupervised part segmentation and 3D shape retrieval, as well as context-aware shape synthesis, providing an advance over existing context-unaware synthesis techniques (Chen et al., 2018) .
