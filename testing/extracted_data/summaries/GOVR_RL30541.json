FY2000 allocated funding for Colombia,from appropriations made in 1999, already totalssome $164.0 million. At the same time, the Administration requested $318 million for FY2001 assistance toColombia and other regional efforts, in addition tothe $150 million that it previously indicated it had planned to allocate to Colombia in FY2001. The Clinton Administration's \"Plan Colombia\" program, as it became known, was intended to substantially increase the assistance provided to Colombia. Theproposal's centerpiece was funding for the \"Push into Southern Colombia\" program, which would include trainingand equipping two new army CN battalions,and providing funding to purchase new and sustain existing Blackhawk and Huey helicopters to transport them.Other assistance was included for interdiction,resettlement of displaced persons, economic development, and programs to improve Colombian National Police(CNP) eradication capabilities and to supporthuman rights monitors, improve the justice system and strengthen the rule of law. The 106th Congress commenced action on the request on March 9, 2000, when the House Appropriations Committee approved an emergency supplementalappropriations bill ( H.R. 3908 , H.Rept. 106-521 ) that included some $1.4 billion in funding for FY2000 andFY2001 counternarcotics efforts inColombia, its neighbors, and other parts of Latin America and the Caribbean. On March 30, the House approvedthat amount, placing conditions on the militaryassistance. On May 9, the Senate Appropriations Committee included $1.1 billion in FY2000 emergencysupplemental Plan Colombia funding in its FY2001Military Construction ( S. 2521 ) and Foreign Operations ( S. 2522 ) bills, placing extensive conditionson the assistance in both bills. These three measures were dealt with in the conference on the military construction appropriations bill ( H.R. 4425 , H.Rept. 106-710 ) with some $1.3billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for Plan Colombia. As approved and signed into law ( P.L.106-246 ) on July 13, the bill included five humanrights and two other conditions on aid to Colombia. Certification that these conditions had been met was required before the obligation of FY2000 and FY2001funds, but the President could waive them on national security grounds. President Clinton waived six of the sevencertification criteria on August 22, 2000, andhe determined a second certification was not required on January 19, 2001, but submitted a report on progressregarding certification criteria. On April 9, 2001, the Bush Administration requested $731 million in FY2002 funding for a broader regional strategy called the Andean Counterdrug Initiativethat would include funding from the International Narcotics Control account (INC) for not only Colombia, but alsoBolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, andVenezuela. In later references, the Bush Administration included other funding for those countries in a AndeanRegional Initiative. As a result, total funding forthe regional initiative, including the ACI, now stands at some $882.29 million."
