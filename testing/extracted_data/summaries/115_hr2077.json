    "content": "Restoring the Patient's Voice Act of 2017 This bill amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to require a group health plan to establish an exception to medication step-therapy protocol in specified cases. A medication step-therapy protocol establishes a specific sequence in which prescription drugs are covered by a group health plan or a health insurance issuer. nbsp.

Is expected to be ineffective, (3) the treatment will cause or is likely to cause an adverse reaction to the individual, (4) the treatment isnbsp, expected to decrease the individual'snbsp, ability either to performnbsp. Daily activities or occupational responsibilities or adhere to the treatment plan, or (5) the individual isnbsp. Stable based on the prescription drugs already selected. The bill requiresnbsp, a groupnbsp, health plan to implement a clear process for an individualnbsp, to request an exception to the protocol. nbsp. The process shall be readily available on the website of the group health plan and must list the requirements for a request and any necessary forms and contact information. Requests shall be granted no later than three days after receipt of the request. nbsp. In certain cases where the life, health, and ability of the individualnbsp.
