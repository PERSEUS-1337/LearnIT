    "title": "AB 1299",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions. Existing law provides that specialty mental health services and Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) for any individual under 21 years of age are covered under Medi-Cal, consistent with the requirements of federal law. Federal law defines EPSDT to include screening services, vision services, dental services, hearing services, and other necessary services to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services, whether or not the services are covered under the state plan. Existing law provides that specialty mental health services include EPSDT services provided to eligible Medi-Cal beneficiaries under 21 years of age. Existing law requires each local mental health plan to establish a procedure to ensure access to outpatient specialty mental health services, as required by the EPSDT program standards, for children in foster care who have been placed outside their county of adjudication. Existing law includes standardized contracts, procedures, documents, and forms, to facilitate the receipt of medically necessary specialty mental health services by a foster child who is placed outside his or her county of original jurisdiction. This bill would declare the intent of the Legislature to ensure that foster children who are placed outside of their county of original jurisdiction, are able to access mental health services in a timely manner consistent with their individualized strengths and needs and the requirements of EPSDT program standards and requirements. The bill would require the department to issue policy guidance that establishes the conditions for and exceptions to presumptive transfer of responsibility for providing or arranging for mental health services to a foster child from the county of original jurisdiction to the county in which the foster child resides, as prescribed. The bill would define presumptive transfer for these purposes. The bill would authorize any interested party who owes a legal duty to the child involving the child\u2019s health or welfare to seek a waiver of presumptive transfer and would provide that the county probation agency or child welfare services agency with responsibility for the care and placement of the child is responsible for determining whether presumptive transfer is appropriate under specified conditions, including when a determination is made that the transfer of mental health services would disrupt continuity of care or timely access to services, as specified. The bill would require the mental health plan in the host county to assume responsibility for the authorization and provision of mental health services, and payments for services, upon the presumptive transfer. By increasing the responsibilities of county probation agencies or child welfare services agencies with respect to determining whether presumptive transfer is appropriate, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. This bill would require the department to seek approval from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) prior to implementing these provisions if the department determines that approval is necessary. The bill would authorize the department and the State Department of Social Services to adopt regulations to implement these provisions by July 1, 2019, as specified. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
