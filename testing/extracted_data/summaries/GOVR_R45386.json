    "content": "The Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill includes funding for more than two dozen independent agencies. Among them are the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Election Assistance Commission (EAC), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Federal Election Commission (FEC), Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), General Services Administration (GSA), National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Selective Service System (SSS), Small Business Administration (SBA), and United States Postal Service (USPS). President Trump's FY2019 budget request included a total of $3 billion for the independent agencies funded through the FSGG appropriations bill, including $282 million for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) (which is considered through the Agriculture appropriations bill in the House and the FSGG bill in the Senate). In the 115th Congress, the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reported FSGG appropriations bills (H.R. 6258, H.Rept. 115-792 and S. 3107, S.Rept. 115-281) and both houses passed different versions of a broader bill (H.R. 6147) that would have provided FY2019 appropriations. The House-passed H.R. 6147 would have provided a combined total of $1.4 billion for the FSGG agencies, while the Senate-passed H.R. 6147 would have provided $2.3 billion. In both cases, the largest differences compared to the President's request were in the funding for the General Services Administration (GSA). No full-year FY2019 FSGG bill was enacted prior to the end of FY2018. The FSGG agencies were provided continuing appropriations through December 7, 2018, in P.L. 115-245 and through December 21, 2018, in P.L. 115-298. No final bill, however, was enacted and funding for FSGG agencies along with much of the rest of the government lapsed on December 22, 2018. No further FY2019 appropriations occurred prior to the 116th Congress. In the 116th Congress, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 21 and H.R. 648, both containing six full FY2019 appropriations bills, including FSGG provisions. H.R. 21 was identical to the Senate-passed H.R. 6147, while H.R. 648 was based on a prospective conference report from the 115th Congress and contained $2.5 billion for the FSGG independent agencies. The Senate did not act on either of these bills. On February 14, 2019, both the House and the Senate agreed to a conference report (H.Rept. 116-9) for H.J.Res. 31, containing seven appropriations bills providing full FY2019 funding for the government's operations that had not been previously funded. This included FSGG provisions nearly identical to H.R. 648. The President signed the resolution on February 15, 2019, enacting it into law as P.L. 116-6. P.L. 116-6 provides a total of $1.9 billion in appropriations for FSGG independent agencies."
