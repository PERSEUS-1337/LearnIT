    "content": "Promoting Self-Reliance for the World's Poorest Act of 2002 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to reauthorize sustainable poverty-focused microenterprise assistance programs through micro- and small enterprise development credits and microenterprise development grants for developing countries. Revises certain requirements with respect to such programs to require 50 percent of all microenterprise resources to be obligated and expended in support of programs or services under which 50 percent or more of the clients are initially very poor, that is, those persons living in the bottom 50 percent below the poverty line or those living on the equivalent of less than $1 per day. Requires the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (AID) to develop and implement certain interim methods to measure the level of poverty of clients of sustainable poverty-focused microenterprise programs under the Act."
