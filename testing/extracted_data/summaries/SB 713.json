    "title": "An act to amend Section 7282.5 of the Government Code, relating to state government.",
    "content": "Existing federal law authorizes any authorized immigration officer to issue an immigration detainer that serves to advise another law enforcement agency that the federal department seeks custody of an alien presently in the custody of that agency, for the purpose of arresting and removing the alien. Existing federal law provides that the detainer is a request that the agency advise the department, prior to release of the alien, in order for the department to arrange to assume custody in situations when gaining immediate physical custody is either impracticable or impossible. Existing state law prohibits a law enforcement official, as defined, from detaining an individual on the basis of a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement hold after that individual becomes eligible for release from custody, unless, at the time that the individual becomes eligible for release from custody, certain conditions are met, including, among other things, that the individual has been convicted at any time of a felony for specified offenses and the continued detention of the individual on the basis of the immigration hold would not violate any federal, state, or local law, or any local policy. This bill would expand the list of prior felony convictions to include the conviction of a felony which formed the basis upon which the individual was previously deported, thereby allowing a law enforcement official, if the continued detention of the individual on the basis of the immigration hold would not violate any federal, state, or local law, or any local policy, to detain an individual with that felony conviction on the basis of a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement hold after that individual becomes eligible for release from custody."
