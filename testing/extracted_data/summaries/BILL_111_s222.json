    "content": "Community Revitalization Energy Conservation Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase to $3.6 billion the national limitation on the issuance of qualified energy conservation bonds. Expands the purposes of green community programs to include the reduction of energy consumption in privately owned buildings and the recruiting and training of local workers in green community program jobs. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to submit to Congress and publish in the Federal Register an annual report on projects for which qualified energy conservation bonds are issued. Provides for offsets to the cost of this Act by prohibiting FY2009 expenditures and repealing multiyear procurement authority for the F-22A Raptor fighter aircraft."
