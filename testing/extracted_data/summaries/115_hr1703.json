The intended use of these medical products shall not be determined by actual or constructive knowledge of the manufacturer or sponsor that these products will be used in a manner that varies from the use approved for marketing. Additionally, the scientific exchange of information about these products shall not constitute labeling, advertising, or evidence of a new intended use. The bill sets forth the requirements for a scientific exchange."
