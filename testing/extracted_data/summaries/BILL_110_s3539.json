Requires the coin design to be emblematic of such centennial. Requires such coins to be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities, from only one US Mint facility. Declares the sense of Congress that such facility should be the US Mint at West Point, New York, to the greatest extent possible. Authorizes the Secretary to issue such coins only during calendar 2011. Applies a $10 per coin surcharge to all coin sales. Requires all surcharges received to be paid to the Girl Scouts of the United States of America for efforts involved in marking it centennial, which may include efforts to preserve the birthplace of founder Juliette Gordon Low."
