    "content": "States and localities can have significant interest in the manner and extent to which federal officials enforce provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) regarding the exclusion and removal of unauthorized aliens. Depending upon the jurisdiction's specific concerns, this interest can be expressed in various ways, from the adoption of \"sanctuary\" policies limiting the jurisdiction's cooperation in federal enforcement efforts to the enactment of measures to deter unauthorized aliens from entering or remaining within the jurisdiction. In some cases, states or localities have also sued to compel federal officials to enforce the INA and other relevant laws. In the mid-1990s, six states which were then home to over half the unauthorized aliens in the United States\u2014Arizona, California, Florida, New Jersey, New York, and Texas\u2014each filed suit alleging that federal officials' failure to check unauthorized migration violated the Guarantee and Invasion Clauses of the Constitution, the Tenth Amendment, and provisions of the INA. Concerns regarding standing\u2014or who is a proper party to seek relief from a federal court\u2014were sometimes noted. However, even when standing was assumed, the constitutional claims were seen to involve nonjusticiable \"political questions,\" or failed on their merits. The states' statutory claims were similarly seen to involve matters committed to agency discretion by law and, thus, not reviewable by the courts. In three cases, the courts also noted that federal officials' alleged failure to control unauthorized migration did not constitute a reviewable \"abdication\" of their statutory duties. Over a decade later, in 2011, Arizona asserted counterclaims challenging the federal government's alleged failure to stop unauthorized migration in the litigation over Arizona's S.B. 1070 measure. Although the court presumed that Arizona had standing, it rejected Arizona's claims regarding violations of the Invasion and Domestic Violence Clauses, Tenth Amendment, and immigration laws. Some claims were seen as precluded or otherwise settled by the earlier litigation. Others were found to involve nonjusticiable political questions, or otherwise failed. The court also rejected the argument that federal officials had abdicated their statutory duties. Subsequently, in 2012, Mississippi, along with some U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, challenged the Obama Administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative on the grounds that it runs afoul of the Take Care Clause, separation of powers, INA, and Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The ICE agents initially prevailed in their claim that DACA is contrary to the INA, although their case was ultimately dismissed on other grounds. However, Mississippi was found to lack standing because it could not show that aliens granted deferred action would have been removed had the Executive not implemented DACA. Most recently, in December 2014, over 25 states or state officials filed suit challenging the Administration's expansion of DACA and the creation of a DACA-like program for aliens who are parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents (known as DAPA). The states allege that these programs run afoul of the Take Care Clause and separation of powers principles of the Constitution, the INA, and substantive and procedural requirements of the APA. After finding that the states have standing, and that DAPA and the DACA expansion are judicially reviewable, a federal district court imposed a preliminary nationwide ban on the implementation of these programs in February 2015, on the grounds that the states are likely to prevail in their argument that the programs run afoul of the APA's procedural requirements. Subsequently, in November 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court's finding as to the procedural violation of the APA, and also found for the states on their claim that DAPA and the DACA expansion substantively violate the APA because these programs are \"not in accordance with law\" and \"in excess of statutory ... authority.\" The Supreme Court granted review, but the Justices ultimately split evenly, four votes to four votes. Consistent with recent practice in cases with such splits, the Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit's decision without issuing an opinion."
