Unlike other valuable items, license plates are not allocated an estimated price before auction. \n\n I propose that the task of predicting plate prices can be viewed as a natural language processing (NLP) task, as the value depends on the meaning of each individual character on the plate and its semantics. I construct a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict the prices of vehicle license plates in Hong Kong, based on the characters on a plate. I demonstrate the importance of having a deep network and of retraining. Evaluated on 13 years of historical auction prices, the deep RNN's predictions can explain over 80 percent of price variations, outperforming previous models by a significant margin.   I also demonstrate how the model can be extended to become a search engine for plates and to provide estimates of the expected price distribution. Chinese societies place great importance on numerological superstition. Numbers such as 8 (representing prosperity) and 9 (longevity) are often used solely because of the desirable qualities they represent. For example, the Beijing Olympic opening ceremony occurred on 2008/8/8 at 8 p.m., the Bank of China (Hong Kong) opened on 1988/8/8, and the Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar at a rate of around 7.8.License plates represent a very public display of numbers that people can own, and can therefore unsurprisingly fetch an enormous amount of money. Governments have not overlooked this, and plates of value are often auctioned off to generate public revenue. Unlike the auctioning of other valuable items, however, license plates generally do not come with a price estimate, which has been shown to be a significant factor affecting the sale price BID2 BID23 . The large number of character combinations and of plates per auction makes it difficult to provide reasonable estimates.This study proposes that the task of predicting a license plate's price based on its characters can be viewed as a natural language processing (NLP) task. Whereas in the West numbers can be desirable (such as 7) or undesirable (such as 13) in their own right for various reasons, in Chinese societies numbers derive their superstitious value from the characters they rhyme with. As the Chinese language is logosyllabic and analytic, combinations of numbers can stand for sound-alike phrases. Combinations of numbers that rhyme with phrases that have positive connotations are thus desirable. For example, \"168,\" which rhythms with \"all the way to prosperity\" in Chinese, is the URL of a major Chinese business portal (http://www.168.com). Looking at the historical data analyzed in this study, license plates with the number 168 fetched an average price of US$10,094 and as much as $113,462 in one instance. Combinations of numbers that rhyme with phrases possessing negative connotations are equally undesirable. Plates with the number 888 are generally highly sought after, selling for an average of $4,105 in the data, but adding a 5 (rhymes with \"no\") in front drastically lowers the average to $342.As these examples demonstrate, the value of a certain combination of characters depends on both the meaning of each individual character and the broader semantics. The task at hand is thus closely related to sentiment analysis and machine translation, both of which have advanced significantly in recent years.Using a deep recurrent neural network (RNN), I demonstrate that a good estimate of a license plate's price can be obtained. The predictions from this study's deep RNN were significantly more accurate than previous attempts to model license plate prices, and are able to explain over 80 percent of price variations. There are two immediate applications of the findings in this paper: first, an accurate prediction model facilitates arbitrage, allowing one to detect underpriced plates that can potentially fetch for a higher price in the active second-hand market. Second, the feature vectors extracted from the last recurrent layer of the model can be used to construct a search engine for historical plate prices. Among other uses, the search engine can provide highly-informative justification for the predicted price of any given plate.In a more general sense, this study demonstrates the value of deep networks and NLP in making accurate price predictions, which is of practical importance in many industries and has led to a huge volume of research. As detailed in the following review, studies to date have mostly relied on small, shallow networks. The use of text data is also rare, despite the large amount of business text data available. By demonstrating how a deep network can be trained to predict prices from sequential data, this study provides an approach that may improve prediction accuracy in many industrial applications."
