    "content": "In February 2016, the Obama Administration proposed a $96.9 billion budget for the Department of Transportation (DOT) for FY2017. That is approximately $22 billion more than was provided for FY2016. The budget request reflected the Administration's call for significant increases in funding for highway, transit, and rail programs. The DOT appropriations bill funds federal programs covering aviation, highways and highway safety, public transit, intercity rail, maritime safety, pipelines, and related activities. Federal highway, transit, and rail programs were reauthorized in the fall of 2015, and their future funding authorizations were somewhat increased. There is general agreement that more funding is needed for transportation infrastructure, but Congress has not been able to agree on a source that could provide the additional funding. The federal excise tax on motor fuel, which is the primary funding source for federal highway and transit programs, has not been increased in over 20 years, and does not raise enough revenue to support even the current level of spending. To address this shortfall, Congress periodically transfers money from the general fund to keep the programs going. The annual appropriations for DOT are combined with those for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) appropriations bill. In the 114th Congress, the Senate passed H.R. 2577, in which Division A was FY2017 appropriations for THUD. The bill would have provided $76.9 billion in new budget authority for DOT, $1.8 billion more than the comparable figure in FY2016 but roughly $20 billion less than the Administration request. The increase in spending over FY2016 was not obvious in budget tables due to a proposed rescission of $2.2 billion of contract authority, which made the net FY2017 amount $344 million less than the comparable FY2016 appropriation. The House Committee on Appropriations reported out H.R. 5394, which would have provided $76.9 billion in new budget authority for DOT. The major changes from FY2016 levels in these bills were more funding for highways, transit, and intercity passenger rail. FY2017 funding is being provided by a continuing resolution (CR) at roughly FY2016 levels. The current CR ends on April 28, 2017. According to press reports, the Trump Administration has requested a $1 billion reduction in DOT funding from FY2016 levels, with cuts to the Essential Air Service, TIGER (National Infrastructure Investment), and transit New Starts grant programs."
