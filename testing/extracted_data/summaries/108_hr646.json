Revises the boundary of the Fort Donelson Battlefield to include the site of Fort Donelson and associated land that has been acquired by the Secretary of the Interior for administration by the National Park Service, including Fort Donelson National Cemetery, in Stewart County, Tennessee, and the site of Fort Heiman and associated land in Calloway County, Kentucky.

Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire only by purchase from willing sellers, by donation, or by exchange with willing owners for inclusion in the Fort Donelson National Battlefield land, interests, and improvements: (1) within the boundaries of the Battlefield. And (2) outside such boundaries if the land has been identified by the American Battlefield Protection Program as part of the battlefield associated with Fort Donelson or the Secretary otherwise determines that acquisition will protect critical resources associated with the Battle of Fort Donelson in 1862 and the Union campaign that resulted in the capture of the Fort. Requires the Secretary, upon acquisition of such land or interests, to revise the boundaries of the Battlefield to include the acquired property. Limits the total area encompassed by the Battlefield to 2,000 acres.
