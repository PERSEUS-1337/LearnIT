    "title": "AB 176",
    "content": "Existing law requires any state agency, board, or commission that directly or by contract collects demographic data as to the ancestry or ethnic origin of Californians to use separate collection categories and tabulations for specified Asian groups and Pacific Islander groups, and requires a state agency, board, or commission to include data on specified collection categories and tabulations in every demographic report on ancestry or ethnic origins of California residents that it publishes or releases. Existing law requires specified agencies to use additional separate collection categories and other tabulations for major Asian groups and Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander groups, and also requires those agencies to take additional actions, including, among other things, posting, and annually updating, the demographic data collected on their Internet Web sites, and updating the reporting categories to reflect these Asian and Pacific Islander groups as they are reported for the 2020 decennial census. This bill would require the updating of the reporting categories for future decennial censuses. The bill would require, on or after July 1, 2016, the Department of Managed Health Care to use the additional separate collection categories and other tabulations for specified Asian groups and Pacific Islander groups, and to take additional actions as specified above, under certain circumstances. This bill would, on and after July 1, 2016, require the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, the Trustees of the California State University, and the Regents of the University of California, whenever those entities collect demographic data as to the ancestry or ethnic origin of students for a report that includes student admission, enrollment, completion, or graduation rates, to use specified collection and tabulation categories for Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander groups, as specified. The bill would require each entity specified above to make this demographic data publicly available by posting the data on the applicable entity\u2019s Internet Web site and would require the updating of the reporting categories for each decennial census. The bill would not apply these categorization requirements to demographic data of graduate and professional schools of the University of California. The bill would be applicable to the University of California only if the Regents of the University of California, by resolution, make it applicable. To the extent the bill would impose additional requirements on community colleges, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the State, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
