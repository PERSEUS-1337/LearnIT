Amends the Judicial Code to instruct the Director to: (1) periodically review crime prevention standards and procedures at financial institutions, (2) make technical recommendations to the Federal banking agencies. And (3) submit copies of such recommendations to congressional judiciary committees. Requires consultation with the Attorney General to ascertain the extent to which inadequate security measures, or improperly maintained security equipment, at financial institutions have hindered effective prosecutions for bank robbery and incidental crimes. Sets a timetable for: (1) promulgation of final Federal regulations pursuant to the Director's recommendations, and (2) depository institution compliance with such regulations."
