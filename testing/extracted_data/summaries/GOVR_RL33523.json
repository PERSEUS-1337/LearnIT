    "content": "One part of the energy debate is whether to approve energy development in the ArcticNational Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in northeastern Alaska, and if so, under what conditions, orwhether to continue to prohibit development to protect the area's biological, recreational, andsubsistence values. ANWR is rich in fauna, flora, and oil potential. Its development has beendebated for over 40 years, but sharp increases in energy prices from late 2000 to early 2001, terroristattacks, more price increases in 2004-2006, and energy infrastructure damage from hurricanes haveintensified debate. Few onshore U.S. areas stir as much industry interest as ANWR. At the sametime, few areas are considered more worthy of protection in the eyes of conservation and someNative groups. Current law prohibits oil and gas leasing in the Refuge. In the first session of the 109th Congress, development advocates added ANWR developmentto the conference report for the Defense appropriations bill ( H.R. 2863 ). The Housepassed the conference report with the ANWR provision, but the ANWR title was removed from thebill ( P.L. 109-148 ) after failure of a cloture motion in the Senate. In the second session, on March 16, 2006, the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 83 , theFY2007 budget resolution. Its sole reconciliation instruction was to the Senate Committee onEnergy and Natural Resources, and it assumed revenues from leasing in ANWR. On May 25, 2006,the House passed the American-Made Energy and Good Jobs Act ( H.R. 5429 ), whichwould open ANWR to development. Development advocates argue that ANWR oil would reduce U.S. energy markets' exposureto Middle East crises; lower oil prices; extend the economic life of the Trans Alaska Pipeline; andcreate jobs in Alaska and elsewhere in the United States. They maintain that ANWR oil could bedeveloped with minimal environmental harm, and that the footprint of development could be limitedto a total of 2,000 acres. Opponents argue that intrusion on such a remarkable ecosystem cannot bejustified on any terms; that economically recoverable oil found (if any) would provide little energysecurity and could be replaced by cost-effective alternatives, including conservation; and that jobclaims are exaggerated. They maintain that development's footprints would have a greater impactthan is implied by a limit on total acreage. They also argue that limits on footprints have not beenworded to apply to extensive Native lands in the Refuge, which could be developed if the Refugewere opened. This report will be updated as events warrant."
