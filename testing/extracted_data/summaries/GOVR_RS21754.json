    "content": "For several years, some Members of Congress and many military analysts have argued that the U.S. Armed Forces are too small to adequately meet all the requirements arising after the Cold War, particularly with the advent of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). In January 2004, the Department of Defense acknowledged a problem by temporarily adding 30,000 troops to the authorized active duty end strength of the Army. Congress addressed the issue by raising ground force statutory end strengths in the FY2005 defense authorization bill ( P.L. 108-375 ), the FY2006 bill ( P.L. 109-163 ), and again in FY2007 ( P.L. 109-364 ). In FY2007, the Administration requested a permanent end strength increase\u00e2\u0080\u009465,000 for the Army and 27,000 for the Marine Corps\u00e2\u0080\u0094and P.L. 110-181 ) the FY2008 defense authorization bill approved the increase. This report describes the background of these actions, current Administration planning, and assesses potential issues for the 110 th Congress. This report will be updated."
