The economic and societal promise of nanotechnology has led to investments by governments and companies around the world. In 2000, the United States launched the world's first national nanotechnology program. From FY2001 through FY2015, the federal government invested approximately $20.9 billion in nanoscale science, engineering, and technology through the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). President Obama has requested $1.5 billion in NNI funding for FY2016. U.S. companies and state governments have invested billions more. The United States has, in the view of many experts, emerged as a global leader in nanotechnology, though the competition for global leadership is intensifying as countries and companies around the world increase their investments. Nanotechnology's complexity and intricacies, early stage of development (with commercial pay-off possibly years away for many potential applications), and broad scope of potential applications engender a wide range of public policy issues. Maintaining U.S. technological and commercial leadership in nanotechnology poses a variety of technical and policy challenges, including development of technologies that will enable commercial scale manufacturing of nanotechnology materials and products, as well as environmental, health, and safety concerns. Congress established programs, assigned responsibilities, and initiated research and development related to these issues in the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-153). Although many provisions of this act have no sunset provision, FY2008 was the last year of agency authorizations included in the act. Bills to amend and reauthorize the act were introduced in the 110th, 111th, and 113th Congresses but were not enacted. No comprehensive reauthorization bill was introduced in the 112th Congress. In the 114th Congress, as of the date of this report, one bill has been introduced that seeks to amend the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act. The National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2015 is incorporated as Subtitle B of Title 1 of the America Competes Reauthorization Act of 2015 (H.R. 1898). The bill was introduced April 21, 2015, and referred to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. In August 2015, the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology referred the bill to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology. No further action had been taken as of the date of this report. Proponents of the NNI assert that nanotechnology is one of the most important emerging and enabling technologies and that U.S. competitiveness, technological leadership, national security, and societal interests require an aggressive approach to its development and commercialization. Critics of the NNI voice concerns that reflect disparate underlying beliefs. Some critics assert that the government is not doing enough to move technology from the laboratory into the marketplace. Others argue that the magnitude of the public investment may skew what should be market-based decisions in research, development, and commercialization. Still other critics say that the inherent risks of nanotechnology are not being addressed in a timely or effective manner."
