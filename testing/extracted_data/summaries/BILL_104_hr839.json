    "content": "Stop Regulating our Small Businesses Act of 1995 - Prohibits any Federal agency, between February 3, 1995, and January 31, 1996, from taking any regulatory rulemaking action (RRA) respecting small business, unless an emergency exception is provided because the President finds that a waiver is necessary: (1) because of an imminent threat to health or safety or other emergency. Or (2) for the enforcement of criminal laws. Directs the President to conduct an inventory and publish in the Federal Register a list of all RRAs covered by the moratorium. Extends until February 1, 1996, any deadline for, relating to, or involving an action under a RRA respecting small business authorized or required to be taken during the moratorium period. Outlines procedures for the declaration of emergency exceptions to the moratorium. Provides appropriate relief via civil action for any non-excepted RRA taken in violation of the moratorium."
