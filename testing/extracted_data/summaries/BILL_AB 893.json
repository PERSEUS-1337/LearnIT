    "title": "AB 893",
    "content": "The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act imposes various requirements relating to the labels and containers of alcoholic beverages sold within the state, including a requirement that every manufacturer or bottler of beer whose beer is sold within the state file with the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control the brand name or names under which the beer is sold or labeled, as provided. The act provides that a violation of its provisions is a misdemeanor if not otherwise specified. This bill would require a manufacturer, before the first sale of a brand of beer in this state, to register the brand with the department, as specified, and would make the manufacturer responsible for compliance with labeling and registration requirements. The bill, if beer is sold or offered for sale in this state without first complying with these provisions or other provisions of the act, would authorize the department to take action it deems reasonable and necessary including, but not limited to, ordering that the beer not be sold, or allowing it to be sold for a reasonable time, until these requirements are met. This bill, by expanding the scope of an existing crime, would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
