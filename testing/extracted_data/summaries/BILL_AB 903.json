    "title": "AB 903",
    "content": "The Gambling Control Act provides for the licensure of certain individuals and establishments involved in various gambling activities, and for the regulation of those activities, by the California Gambling Control Commission. Existing law prohibits a person under 21 years of age from being eligible for a work permit in a gambling establishment. Existing law also prohibits a person under 21 years of age from entering the premises of a licensed gambling establishment, except as provided. This bill would permit a person between 18 and 21 years of age to work in a gambling establishment in a classification that entails providing services on and off the gaming floor that are not involved in play of any controlled game, as specified. Existing law generally regulates false advertising and specifically prohibits certain unfair acts or practices undertaken by, or omissions of, a person in the operation of a contest, including misrepresenting the odds of winning a prize or failing to award and distribute all prizes. Existing law specifies that these provisions do not render unlawful or restrict otherwise lawful games and methods used by a gambling enterprise licensed under the Gambling Control Act or operations of the California State Lottery. This bill would expand that exemption to include lawful technologies and software used by a gambling enterprise licensed under the Gambling Control Act or operations of the California State Lottery."
