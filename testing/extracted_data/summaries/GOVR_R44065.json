    "content": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148, as amended) requires health insurance exchanges to be established in every state. Exchanges are marketplaces in which consumers and small businesses can shop for and purchase private health insurance coverage. In general, states must have two types of exchanges: an individual exchange and a small business health options program (SHOP) exchange. Exchanges may be established either by the state itself as a state-based exchange (SBE) or by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) as a federally facilitated exchange (FFE). Some states have SBE-FPs: they have SBEs but use the federal information technology platform, including the federal exchange website www.Healthcare.gov. In states with FFEs, the exchange may be operated by the federal government alone or in conjunction with the state. States may have different structures for their individual and SHOP exchanges. Consumers who obtain coverage through the individual exchange may be eligible for financial assistance from the federal government. Financial assistance in the individual exchanges is available in two forms: premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions. Small businesses that use the SHOP exchange may be eligible for small business health insurance tax credits. The tax credits assist small businesses with the cost of providing health insurance coverage to employees. The ACA generally requires that health insurance plans offered through an exchange are qualified health plans (QHPs). To be a certified as a QHP, a plan must be offered by a state-licensed issuer and must meet specified requirements, including covering the essential health benefits (EHB). QHPs sold in the individual and SHOP exchanges must comply with the same state and federal requirements that apply to QHPs and other health plans offered outside of the exchanges in the individual and small-group markets, respectively. Exchanges also may offer variations of QHPs, such as child-only or catastrophic plans, and non-QHP dental-only plans. This report provides an overview of the various components of the health insurance exchanges. It begins with summary information about how exchanges are structured and then discusses both individual and SHOP exchanges in terms of eligibility and enrollment, financial assistance for certain exchange consumers and small businesses, and enrollment assistance entities. The report also describes exchanges' role in certifying plans as qualified to be sold in their marketplaces and outlines the range of plans offered through exchanges. Finally, the report briefly addresses funding for the exchanges. Where applicable, the report references other CRS reports that have more information on various topics."
