    "content": "MedicareChoice Improvement and Stabilization Act of 2001 - Amends part C (MedicareChoice) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to make each annual MedicareChoice capitation rate for a MedicareChoice payment area for a contract year equal to the largest of the amounts specified under current law or, for 2003, 100 percent of the fee-for-service costs for the MedicareChoice payment area for services covered under Medicare parts A or B for individuals entitled to benefits under part A and enrolled under part B who are not enrolled in a MedicareChoice plan under this part for the year. Revises the calculation of the national standardized annual MedicareChoice capitation rate used in determining the input-price-adjusted annual national MedicareChoice capitation rate for a MedicareChoice payment area for calculation of annual MedicareChoice capitation rates for 2003. Eliminates budget neutrality in such calculation for a year other than 2003. Modifies requirements for establishment of standards for provider-sponsored organizations for MedicareChoice organizations and plans in relation to State laws to avoid duplicative State regulation. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a demonstration program under which payment rules for MedicareChoice organizations are modified in order to promote: (1) the offering of MedicareChoice plans by preferred provider organizations, of MedicareChoice plans that provide point-of-sale coverage for other than participating providers, and of MSA plans: and (2) the use of disease management programs by MedicareChoice plans. Amends SSA title XVII part C to: (1) suspend the limitation for program reentry for MedicareChoice organizations for 2003 and 2004. And (2) set forth rules governing specialized MedicareChoice plans for special needs beneficiaries. Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to provide for extension of municipal health service demonstration projects."
