Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation, subject to the availability of appropriations, to make recreational boating law enforcement grants to States that have: (1) implemented a recreational boating safety program incorporating the national guidelines and standards for personal watercraft. And (2) adopted the enforceable policies under this Act, if the State is a coastal State. Requires States, as a condition of receiving a grant, to provide matching funds on a one-to-one basis of Federal-to-State contributions. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation, subject to the availability of appropriations, to make grants to States to support the activities of collaborative task forces to minimize conflicts between personal watercraft and other recreational and commercial users. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to award task force development grants on a competitive basis, with no State receiving more than 25 percent of the total amount appropriated for a fiscal year. Sets forth similar matching fund requirements. Authorizes appropriations."
