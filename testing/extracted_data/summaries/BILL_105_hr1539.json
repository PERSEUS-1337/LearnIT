    "content": "Community Broadcasting Protection Act of 1997 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to prescribe regulations to establish a class A license for qualifying low-power television (LPT) stations. Requires notification of LPT licensees of the availability of such license. Defines as a qualifying LPT station one which in the 90 days preceding enactment of this Act: (1) broadcast for at least 18 hours per day. (2) broadcast for at least three hours weekly programming that was produced within the community of license of such station. And (3) complied with other requirements applicable to LPT stations. Allows the FCC to treat non-qualifying stations as LPT stations under this Act if public interest, convenience, and necessity would be so served. Provides that: (1) the FCC is not required to issue any additional licenses for advanced television services to the licensees of class A television stations. And (2) no licensee of a class A television station shall be required to cease operations, or have a license rescinded or terminated, due to the implementation of amendments to the table of allotments adopted before the enactment of this Act. Allows the FCC to order such a cessation, rescission, or termination only after compliance with specified requirements."
