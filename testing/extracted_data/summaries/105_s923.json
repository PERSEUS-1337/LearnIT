    "content": "Prohibits the appropriate Federal official from interring or memorializing in Arlington National Cemetery or in a cemetery of the National Cemetery System any person who: (1) has been convicted of a Federal or State capital crime for which the person was sentenced to death or life imprisonment. Or (2) is found to have committed such a crime but who has not been convicted due to unavailability for trial because of death or flight to avoid prosecution. Provides that such prohibition shall not apply unless the appropriate Federal official receives written notice of such a conviction or finding from the Attorney General or appropriate State official before approving the application for interment or memorialization.
