    "content": "More than most countries, Poland's relations today with the rest of the world are influencedby its past. The victim of historical forces and powerful neighbors, Poland was partitioned in the 18thcentury, and once again in the 20th. This loss of sovereignty may partly explain its assertive foreignpolicy. Poland has carved out a unique, sometimes maverick role for itself in Europe. A NATOmember since 1999, and an EU member since 2004, Poland has forcefully pursued its nationalinterests and has not been reluctant to assert itself with major powers -- for example, with Germany,its leading trading partner; with the European Union; and with the United States. Poland has been a staunch U.S. ally, not only in the global war on terrorism, but also in theU.S.-led campaign in Iraq. However, several factors -- including the revelations of prisoner abuseat Abu Ghraib prison and the March 2004 Madrid bombings -- have caused Poland to weigh thecosts and benefits of its participation in Iraq and reassess its partnership with the United States. Many Poles are also disappointed that their cooperation in the Iraq mission has yet to yield tangiblebenefits. In particular, the Poles had hoped for help in three areas: military assistance, Iraqreconstruction contracts, and U.S. visa policy. Poland has been an active member of the European Union (EU), and has not always sidedwith the majority; many of its positions within the EU -- and toward its eastern neighbors -- havebeen in accord with U.S. policy preferences that have at times been at odds with EU members. However, some analysts believe that, for economic and social reasons, Poland likely will draw closerto its fellow EU countries over the long term, and may eventually play a leadership role on thecontinent. This report analyzes Polish foreign policy motivations and trends, and implications forU.S.-Polish relations and U.S. interests in Europe. It will be updated after the 2005 Polish elections.
