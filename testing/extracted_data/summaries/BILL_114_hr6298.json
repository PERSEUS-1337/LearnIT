And restrictive trade practices or boycotts fostered or imposed by an international governmental organization, or requests to impose such practices or boycotts, against Israel. The bill prohibits US persons engaged in interstate or foreign commerce from: requesting the imposition of any boycott by a foreign country against a country which is friendly to the United States. Or supporting any boycott fostered or imposed by an international organization, or requesting imposition of any such boycott, against Israel.
