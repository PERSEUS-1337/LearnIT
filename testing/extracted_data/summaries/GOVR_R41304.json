    "content": "On March 19, 2010, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reissued a 1996 final rule aimed at reducing underage smoking and use of smokeless tobacco products (e.g., snuff, chewing tobacco). The agency's rulemaking was mandated by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which was enacted last year in response to a 2000 decision by the Supreme Court holding that FDA lacked the statutory authority to regulate tobacco products. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (P.L. 111-31) expressly gives FDA broad statutory authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to regulate the manufacture, distribution, advertising, sale, and use of cigarettes and other tobacco products. The new FDA tobacco rule builds on the youth access, marketing, and advertising restrictions that the tobacco companies agreed to as part of the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement, which settled lawsuits filed by the states to recover the public health costs of tobacco-related illness. Among its provisions, the rule prohibits the sale of tobacco products to any person under age 18; requires retailers to verify a purchaser's age by photo ID; restricts the sale of tobacco products through vending machines and self-service displays to adult-only facilities; limits tobacco advertising in publications to which children and adolescents are exposed to a black-on-white, text-only format; prohibits the sale of tobacco brand-identified promotional items such as caps and T-shirts; and prohibits brand-name sponsorship of sporting and other cultural events. The rule became effective on June 22, 2010. The original 1996 rule included a ban on outdoor cigarette and smokeless tobacco advertising (e.g., billboards, posters) within 1,000 feet of schools and playgrounds. The reissued rule does not incorporate such a ban. In Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly (2001), the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a similar outdoor advertising ban in Massachusetts, arguing that it violated the First Amendment protection of commercial speech. FDA has reserved a section in the reissued rule for future rulemaking on outdoor advertising restrictions. In a separate advanced notice of proposed rulemaking, the agency has requested public comment on this issue and offered several options for more narrowly tailored outdoor advertising restrictions that the agency believes would not violate the First Amendment. In August 2009, several tobacco companies filed a federal lawsuit against FDA claiming that the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act violates their constitutional right to commercial free speech. On March 19, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the district court's decision striking down the tobacco rule's provision that limits advertising in publications with significant youth readership to a black-on-white, text-only format."
