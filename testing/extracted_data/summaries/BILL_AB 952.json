    "title": "AB 952",
    "content": "Existing law requires a city council, within 60 days of a vacancy in an elective office, to fill that vacancy by appointment or call a special election to fill the vacancy, and provides that a person elected or appointed to fill a vacancy holds office for the unexpired term of the former incumbent. This bill would instead provide that if the council fills a vacancy in an elective office by appointment, and that vacancy occurred in the first half of the term of office and at least 130 days prior to the next general municipal election, the person appointed to fill the vacancy holds office until the next general municipal election at which a person is elected to fill that vacancy, and thereafter, until the person elected is qualified. The bill would additionally provide that if the vacancy occurs in the first half of a term of office, but less than 130 days prior to the next general municipal election, or if the vacancy occurs in the second half of the term of office, the person appointed to fill the vacancy holds office for the unexpired term of the former incumbent."
