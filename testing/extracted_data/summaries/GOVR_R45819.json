    "content": "The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA, Division D of P.L. 115-254 ) was enacted on October 5, 2018. DRRA is the most comprehensive reform of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) disaster assistance programs since the passage of the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 (SRIA, Division B of P.L. 113-2 ) and the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA, P.L. 109-295 ). DRRA focuses on improving pre-disaster planning and mitigation, response, and recovery, and increasing FEMA accountability. As such, it amends many sections of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act, P.L. 93-288 , as amended; 42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a75121 et seq.) and also includes new standalone authorities. In addition, DRRA requires reports to Congress, rulemaking, and other actions. This report provides an overview of selected sections of DRRA that significantly change the provision of services or authorities under the Stafford Act, and includes: an overview of programs as they existed prior to DRRA's enactment, and how they were modified following DRRA; the context or rationale for program modifications or changes to disaster assistance policies following DRRA's enactment; potential considerations and issues for Congress; a table of amendments to the Stafford Act following DRRA's enactment; and tables of deadlines associated with DRRA's reporting, rulemaking and regulations, and other implementation actions and requirements. This report does not specifically address every section included in DRRA, nor does it address every subsection or paragraph of those DRRA sections which are addressed herein."
