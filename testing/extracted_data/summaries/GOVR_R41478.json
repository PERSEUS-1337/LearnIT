    "content": "A decade ago, 158 refineries operated in the United States and its territories and sporadic refinery outages led many policy makers to advocate new refinery construction. Fears that crude oil production was in decline also led to policies promoting alternative fuels and increased vehicle fuel efficiency. Since the summer 2008 peak in crude oil prices, however, the U.S. demand for refined petroleum products has declined, largely due to the economic recession, and the outlook for the petroleum refining industry in the United States has changed. In response to weak demand for gasoline and other refined products, refinery operators have begun cutting back capacity, idling, and, in a few cases, permanently closing their refineries. By current count, 115 refineries now produce fuel in addition to 13 refineries that produce lubricating oils and asphalt. Even as the number of refineries has decreased, operable refining capacity has actually increased over the past decade, from 16.5 million barrels/day to over 18 million barrels/day. Cyclical economic factors aside, U.S. refiners now face the potential of long-term decreased demand for their products. Legislative and regulatory efforts that originally intended to address the growing demand for petroleum products may now displace some of that demand. These efforts include such policies as increasing the volume of ethanol in the gasoline supply, improving vehicle fuel efficiency, and encouraging the purchase of vehicles powered by natural gas or electricity. The United States met roughly 39% of its crude oil demand in 2011 through domestic production, exclusive of the natural gas needed in various refining processes. Canada has become the United States' leading supplier of crude oil through its increasing production from oil sands providing roughly 15% of U.S. demand. In total, the United States meets 62% of its demand from crude oil produced in North America. Over the last few decades, imported crude oils have become heavier and higher in average sulfur content. Until quite recently, the diminishing supply of light sweet crude oil led U.S. refineries to make multi-million dollar investments in processing-upgrades to convert lower-priced heavier sour crude oils to high-value products such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Some key environmental and energy policies enacted over the past few decades directly or indirectly affect the operations of U.S. refineries and the market for petroleum products. These include requirements for the use of reformulated gasoline (RFG) in many areas of the country, mandates under the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), increasingly stringent vehicle efficiency standards, and greenhouse gas limits under the Clean Air Act and state laws. Declining motor-fuel demand spurred by both market and regulatory forces has influenced some refinery operators to idle, consolidate, or permanently close refineries. However, newly available light sweet crudes from North Dakota, Texas, and Ohio are changing refining economics in some regions of the United States."
