Nepal must also meet certain eligibility criteria for designation as a beneficiary developing country under the Trade Act of 1974. Certain leather articles and textile or apparel articles imported directly from Nepal may enter the US customs territory duty-free if: the article is the growth, product, or manufacture of Nepal.
