    "content": "Concerns are growing that the visa category that allows executives and managers ofmultinational corporations to work temporarily in the United States is being misused. This visacategory, commonly referred to as the L visa, permits multinational firms to transfer top-levelpersonnel to their locations in the United States for five to seven years. The number of L visasissued has increased by 363.5% over the past 25 years. The U.S. Department of State (DOS) issuedonly 26,535 L visas in FY1980. L visa issuances began increasing in the mid-1990s and peaked at122,981 in FY2005. Some are now charging that firms are using the L visa to transfer \"rank and file\" professionalemployees rather than limiting these transfers to top-level personnel, thus circumventing immigrationlaws aimed at protecting U.S. employees from the potential adverse employment effects associatedwith an increase in the number of foreign workers. Proponents of current law maintain that anyrestrictions on L visas would prompt many multinational firms to leave the United States, as wellas undermine reciprocal agreements that currently permit U.S. corporations to transfer theiremployees abroad. Title IV of P.L. 108-447 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005, renders ineligiblefor L visa status those aliens who serve in a capacity involving specialized knowledge at the worksiteof an employer other than the petitioning employer or its affiliate if (1) the alien will be controlledprincipally by the unaffiliated employer; or (2) the placement with the unaffiliated employer is partof an arrangement merely to provide labor rather than to use the alien's specialized knowledge. Italso requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to impose a fraud prevention and detection fee of$500 on H-1B (foreign temporary professional workers) and L (intracompany business personnel)petitioners. In the 109th Congress, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act ( S. 2611 / S. 2612 ) would add certain requirements for L visa applicants seeking to cometo the United States to work in new or unopened facilities and would expand the staffing resourcesof DHS, DOS, and DOL to investigate abuses and enforce violations of the L visa. Other bills thatwould reform the L visa include H.R. 3322 and H.R. 3381 . Earlier, the House Committee on the Judiciary reported H.R. 3648 , which wouldimpose additional fees with respect to immigration services for L visa intracompany transferees. Thebill would require the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security to each charge fees of $1,500 toemployers filing certain visa applications and nonimmigrant petitions for L visas. These provisionswere included in Title V of H.R. 4241 , the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which theHouse passed on November 18, 2005. The Senate version ( S. 1932 ) would raise theminimum fee for L-1 visas by $750. The conference report on S. 1932 did not includethese L visa provisions. This report tracks legislative activity and will be updated as action warrants."
