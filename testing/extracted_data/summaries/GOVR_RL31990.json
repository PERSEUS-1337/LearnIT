    "content": "Nearly half a million miles of oil and gas transmission pipeline crisscross the United States. The nation's pipeline industry has made substantial investments to protect these systems and respond tothe possibility of terror attacks. However, U.S. pipelines are inherently vulnerable because of theirnumber and dispersion. Due to the essential role pipelines play in our economy, Congress isexamining the adequacy of federal pipeline security efforts. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is the lead federal agency for security in all modes of transportation -- includingpipelines. The agency oversees industry's identification and protection of critical pipeline assetsthrough security reviews, risk assessment and inspections. The Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS),within the Department of Transportation (DOT), is the lead federal regulator of pipeline safety . While TSA and the OPS have distinct missions, pipeline security and safety are intertwined. Thereare questions about the appropriate division of responsibility between the agencies and about theresources they will have for mandated security activities. As the lead agency for pipeline security, TSA expects pipeline operators to maintain security plans based on security guidance initially circulated in 2002. TSA also plans to issue pipelinesecurity regulations, although it is unclear if and when it will do so. This agency also intends to issuenew analytic models to help operators identify critical facilities and assess vulnerability to terroristattack. In 2003, TSA inspected 24 of the largest 25-30 pipeline operators to review their securitypractices and collect critical asset data. TSA found that nearly all of these operators had met orexceeded minimum security guidelines. All but two of the 24 operators also provided TSA with theirsecurity plans and critical infrastructure information. The OPS joined TSA on approximatelyone-third of these inspections and expects a continued security role. The agencies have no formalcooperative agreement defining responsibilities and at this point do not think they need one. Industry and government agencies generally assert that efforts to promote U.S. pipeline security are on the right track. Nonetheless, TSA's current funding for pipeline security will provide onlylimited capability for inspections and enforcement of any future regulations. The President' sFY2005 budget request does not include a line item for TSA's pipeline activities; they will be fundedfrom the agency's general operational budget. In addition to appropriations issues, Congress isconsidering several policy concerns: Operators believe they need more specific federal threatinformation to improve security decisions. Many operators also believe they need clear and stabledefinitions of what constitutes a \"critical\" asset. Finally, operators are concerned about potentiallyredundant, conflicting regulatory regimes under TSA and the OPS. This report will be updated asevents warrant."
