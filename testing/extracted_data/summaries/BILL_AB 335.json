    "title": "AB 335",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes the State Air Resources Board and air pollution control and air quality management districts to enforce air quality laws. This bill would require the State Air Resources Board and air pollution control and air quality management districts to adopt regulations classifying minor violations. The bill would define the term \u201cnotice to comply\u201d and would require a representative of those agencies, who in the course of conducting an inspection detects a minor violation, to issue a notice to comply, as specified. The bill would exempt an air pollution control or air quality management district from these provisions if it has in effect, as of January 1, 2015, a program with similar provisions, as specified. The bill would require the State Air Resources Board to report to the Legislature by January 1, 2020, regarding implementation of the bill. Because the bill would make a false statement of compliance submitted under those procedures a crime pursuant to specified provisions, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program by creating a new crime. In addition, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program by imposing new requirements on air pollution control and air quality management districts. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
