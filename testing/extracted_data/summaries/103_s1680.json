    "content": "Smoke-Free Environment Act of 1993 - Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to require the responsible entity for each public facility to adopt a uniform indoor air policy that meets the requirements of this Act. Defines a public facility as a building regularly entered by ten or more individuals at least one day per week, including a building owned by or leased to a Federal, State, or local governmental entity and excluding a building regularly used for residential purposes. Requires such policy to: (1) prohibit the emission of environmental tobacco smoke within the facility and on facility property within the immediate vicinity of the facility's entrance. And (2) provide for the posting of a notice of such prohibition in visible locations at the facility. Permits such policy to provide an exception to the prohibition for specially designated smoking areas within a facility if: (1) the areas are ventilated to ensure that air is directly exhausted to the outside and does not recirculate or drift to other areas within the facility. And (2) nonsmoking individuals do not have to enter such areas for any purpose. Authorizes waivers from compliance with this Act if a facility is subject to unusual and extenuating circumstances. Limits waivers to one-year periods. Prescribes civil penalties for violations of this Act."
