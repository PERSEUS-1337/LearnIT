Drawing much attention during congressional debate were the agreement's sugar provisionsto allow additional sugar from the region to enter the U.S. market. To assuage concerns expressedby some Members, the Administration pledged prior to Senate passage to take steps to ensure thatall sugar imports, including those under DR-CAFTA, do not exceed a \"trigger\" that could underminethe U.S. Department of Agriculture's ability to manage the domestic sugar program. Sugar producersand processors responded that USDA's pledge did not address their long-term concerns, andcontinued last-minute efforts to defeat the agreement. In DR-CAFTA, the United States and six countries will completely phase out tariffs andquotas -- the primary means of border protection -- on all but four agricultural commodities tradedbetween them in stages up to 20 years. The four exempted products are as follows: for the UnitedStates, sugar; for Costa Rica, fresh onions and fresh potatoes; and for the four other CentralAmerican countries, white corn. The Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, andNicaragua have approved the agreement; Costa Rica's legislature is currently considering it. As ittakes effect on a rolling basis, the U.S. agricultural sector will over time gain free access to the sixhighly protected markets on a reciprocal basis, matching these countries' current duty-free entry fornearly all their agricultural exports to the United States. Other provisions establish safeguards forspecified agricultural products to protect U.S. and the region's producers from sudden import surges;prohibit the use of export subsidies between partners; and establish a mechanism to address sanitaryand phytosanitary barriers to agricultural trade. DR-CAFTA's provisions, once fully implemented, are expected to result in trade gains,though small, for the U.S. agricultural sector. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC)estimates that $328 million in additional exports (primarily grains, meat products, and processedfood products) would be offset by a $52 million increase in imports (largely reflecting additionalaccess granted for sugar and beef from the six countries). Of the $2.7 billion increase in total U.S.exports that the ITC projects under DR-CAFTA, 12% would be attributable to the U.S. agriculturalsector. Most U.S. commodity groups, agribusiness and food manufacturing firms, and the AmericanFarm Bureau Federation (a general farm organization) supported DR-CAFTA, expecting to benefitfrom the guaranteed increased access to these six markets. Cotton producers announced theirsupport only after one major textile trade association came out in favor of it. The U.S. sugar industrystrongly opposed the additional access for sugar imports from these countries, fearing its economicimpact on domestic producers and processors. Two cattlemen trade organizations held differingpositions on the agreement's beef provisions. The National Farmers Union (a general farmorganization) opposed DR-CAFTA. Congress is expected to monitor developments on DR-CAFTAimplementation during the second session of the 109th Congress. This report will be updated."
