The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) may waive the applicability of such prohibition to any national security system in the interest of national security and shall submit a statement justifying such waiver. The ODNI shall: (1) coordinate with the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program Office (FRAMPO) to establish mandatory guidelines for the submission of an application for such an authorization that shall streamline and accelerate the accreditation process. (2) host a public-private industry cloud commercial working group representing cloud service providers, which shall provide recommendations directly to FRAMPO's Program Management Office and Joint Authorization Board regarding their operations, processes improvements, and best practices, (3) establish key performance metrics for FRAMPO, (4) report on the effectiveness and efficiency of FRAMPO. And (5) assess cloud computing opportunities and issue policies and guidelines for the adoption of government-wide programs providing for a standardized approach to security assessment and operational authorization for cloud computing products and services. There is established in each such agency an information technology system modernization and working capital fund for necessary expenses: for the replacement of a legacy information technology system. For the transition to cloud computing and innovative platforms and technologies. To assist and support efforts to provide information technology capabilities that address evolving threats to information security. And for developmental, modernization, and enhancement activities of information technology. Each agency shall prioritize amounts within such fund to be used initially for cost savings activities approved by the Federal Chief Information Officer. The Government Accountability Office shall report on the implementation and operation of each such fund, current practices compared with industry best practices for the effective oversight and governance of a cloud computing working capital fund, the basis for the fund's use and operation, the fund's efficacy to accelerate technology transitions, and recommendations for improvement."
