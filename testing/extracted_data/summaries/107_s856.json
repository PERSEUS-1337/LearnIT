(6) require STTR information to be included in agency databases currently maintaining Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program information. And (7) require STTR information to be included in such agencies' congressional reporting requirements. Requires the Administrator to include within an annual report on SBIR and STTR programs the number of proposals received from, and total amounts awarded to, HUBZone small businesses under each program.

Requires each Federal agency that adopts an STTR program to adopt such model agreement. Revises provisions concerning the Federal and State Technology Partnership Program to require the Administrator and the SBIR Program managers to consider whether an SBIR Program proposal addresses the needs of small businesses owned and controlled by women and minorities located in areas not participating in SBIR and STTR programs. Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations establishing standards for the consideration of such proposals."
