    "content": "Medicaid and Chip Quality Improvement Act of 2016 This bill amends titles XI and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to expand reporting requirementsnbsp, with respect to the quality of care providednbsp. Under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Current law requires a state that contracts with a Medicaid managed organizationnbsp. To develop and implement a quality assessment and improvement strategy. The bill extends this requirement to state contracts with providers ofnbsp, comparable primary care case management servicesnbsp, and othernbsp. Health care services under Medicaid. With respect to adults eligible for Medicaid and children enrolled in Medicaid ornbsp. CHIP, a state must report annually on quality measures identified by the Centers for Medicare amp. Medicaid Services (CMS). Such reporting shall be stratified by service delivery system. CMS shall establish a Medicaid Quality Performance Bonus fund to award states for high attainment and improvement onnbsp. A core set of quality measures. A state must designate at least 75 of any bonus funds for the development and operation of quality-related initiatives that will directly benefit providers or managed care entities participating in, or under a waiver of, the state plan for medical assistance. A state may usenbsp, the remainder of suchnbsp. Funds for activities related to the goals and purposes of the state plan."
