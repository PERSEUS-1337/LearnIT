    "content": "Bangladesh (the former East Pakistan) gained its independence in 1971, following India's intervention in a rebellion against West Pakistan (currently called Pakistan). The Bangladesh National Party (BNP), which led the ruling coalition of the previous government, and the leading opposition party, the Awami League (AL), traditionally have dominated Bangladeshi politics. The BNP has been led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia; the AL has been led by Sheikh Hasina. In the years since independence, Bangladesh has established a reputation as a largely moderate and democratic majority Muslim country. This status has been under threat from a combination of political violence, weak governance, poverty, corruption, and Islamist militancy. When in opposition, both parties have sought to regain control of the government through demonstrations, labor strikes, and transport blockades. Bangladesh is now ruled by a military-backed caretaker government led by Fakhruddin Ahmed that appears unlikely to relinquish power until at least the end of 2008. It is pursuing an anti-corruption drive that has challenged the usual political elites. It is also seeking to put in place voter reforms, including issuing identity cards, and has moved against militant Islamists. Although there is some concern that the new military-backed caretaker government may be reluctant to relinquish power, it has presented a roadmap for new elections and a return to democracy in Bangladesh. Bangladesh's status as a secular and moderate state, as well as its democratic process, has been jeopardized as a result of the approach taken by the two main political parties and by the takeover of government by a military-backed caretaker government. Further, there is concern that should Bangladesh become a failed state, or a state with increased influence by Islamist extremists, it could increasingly serve as a base of operations for terrorist activity. Political violence has become part of the political landscape in Bangladesh under previous governments. A.M.S. Kibria, a finance minister in a previous Awami League government, and four others were killed in a bomb attack that also injured 70 at a political rally of the Awami League in early 2005. In mid 2004, an apparent political assassination attempt on opposition leader Sheikh Hasina at a political rally in Dhaka killed 22. These two attacks, and widespread bombings in mid 2005 that claimed 26 lives and injured dozens others, are the most notable incidents among many in recent years. U.S. policy toward Bangladesh emphasizes support for political stability and democracy, development, and human rights. The United States has long-standing supportive relations with Bangladesh and views Bangladesh as a moderate voice in the Islamic world. Some analysts are concerned that Islamist parties and groups have gained influence through the political process and that this has created space for militant activities inside the country. Some allege that the presence in the former ruling Bangladesh National Party coalition government of two Islamist parties, the Islamiya Okiyya Jote (IOJ) and the Jamaat-e-Islami, contributed to the expansion of Islamist influence in Bangladesh."
