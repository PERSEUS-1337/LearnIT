    "content": "Civic Participation and Rehabilitation Act of 2005 - States that the right of an individual who is a citizen of the United States to vote in any election for Federal office shall not be denied or abridged because that individual has been convicted of a criminal offense unless such individual is serving a felony sentence in a correctional institute or facility at the time of the election. Authorizes the Attorney General, in a civil action, to obtain declaratory or injunctive relief to remedy a violation of this Act. Provides for a private right of action. Prohibits any State, unit of local government, or other person from receiving or using any Federal grant amount, to construct or otherwise improve a prison, jail, or other place of incarceration, unless that person has in effect a program under which each US citizen incarcerated in that person's jurisdiction is notified, upon release, of that citizen's rights."
