    "content": "Preserving American Homeownership Act of 2014 - Requires the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Federal Housing Commissioner each to establish a pilot program to encourage the use of shared equity mortgage modifications designed to return greater net present value to investors than other loss-mitigation activities, including foreclosure. Requires a shared equity mortgage modification to: reduce by specified action the loan-to-value ratio of a covered mortgage to 100 or less within 3 years. Reduce the interest rate if such a reduction of principal would not result in an affordable reduced monthly payment. Reduce to a specified amount any periodic payment the homeowner is required to make. Require the homeowner to pay the investor, upon refinancing or selling the real property securing a covered mortgage, up to 50 of the amount of the equity value of the real property, subject to certain conditions. Be designed to deliver maximal net present value to the investor, and be based on specified factors."
