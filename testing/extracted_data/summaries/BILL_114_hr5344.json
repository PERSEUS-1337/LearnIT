    "content": "Organ Donation Clarification Act of 2016 This bill allows the exchange of human organs for valuable consideration under pilot programs approved by the Department of Health and Human Services to measure the effect of removing disincentives or providing a noncash benefit that may increase organ availability. In addition to reimbursements permitted in the National Organ Transplant Act, this bill declares that valuable consideration does not include: dependent care needs related to organ donation, medical expenses related to donation and all related follow-up care including preventive follow-up care and medication, paperwork or legal costs related to donation, or an insurance policy against the risk of death or disability as a result of donating an organ or the longer-term health effects of having donated an organ."
