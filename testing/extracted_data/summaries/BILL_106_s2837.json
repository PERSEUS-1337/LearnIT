    "content": "Permits collection activities and communications during the 30-day notice period following initial debt notification to the consumer. Revises civil liability guidelines for a debt collector's noncompliance with the Act with respect to: (1) consumer's attorney's fees. (2) disallowance of certain attorney's fees accruing after a consumer's refusal of a debt collector's settlement offer if a final judgment amounts to the same as or less than such offer. (3) additional factors for consideration by the court in determining the amount of any award. And (4) a debt collector's good faith compliance with State or Federal rules of civil procedure as a shield against liability. Cites conditions under which a servicer of federally related mortgage loans secured by first liens is exempt from certain requirements relating to: (1) debt notification and validation. And (2) failure to disclose that the debt collector is attempting to collect a debt and that any information obtained will be used for that purpose. Requires such a servicer, if a debt collector is exempt from ordinary debt validation requirements, to provide a consumer, without charge, with a validation statement or a notice of the consumer's right to receive one at least 30 days before any debt acceleration."
