    "title": "SB 1088",
    "content": "Existing law makes it a misdemeanor for a person who has knowledge of an accidental death to actively conceal or attempt to conceal that death. Existing law provides that the punishment for that offense is imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or by a fine of not less than $1,000 nor more than $10,000, or by both that fine and imprisonment. Existing law also sets forth various time limits to prosecute crimes. Except as otherwise specified, prosecution for an offense that is not punishable by death or imprisonment in the state prison is required to be commenced within one year after commission of the offense. Existing law provides that for certain offenses, the prescribed limitation of time does not commence to run until the discovery of the offense. Existing law also provides that for other offenses, the criminal complaint may be filed within one year after the person is initially identified by law enforcement as a suspect in the commission of the crime, as specified. This bill would provide that for the offense of actively concealing or attempting to conceal an accidental death, as described above, a criminal complaint may be filed within one year after the person is initially identified by law enforcement as a suspect in the commission of the offense. This bill would incorporate changes to Section 803 of the Penal Code proposed by both this bill and SB 813, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last."
