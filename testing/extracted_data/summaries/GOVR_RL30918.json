President Alejandro Toledo assumed office on July 28, 2001. Hewon extraordinary elections that had to be organized following the sudden resignation in November 2000 ofPresidentAlberto Fujimori in the wake of electoral, human rights, and corruption scandals. President Fujimori headed Peru from 1990 to 2000. During that time he did much to bring under control destabilizingfactors such as terrorism, drug trafficking, hyperinflation, and border disputes. But Fujimori also led the countryintoconstitutional crises, and his efforts to remain in power eroded democratic institutions. Allegations of electoralfraud andan eruption of scandals involving his top aide led to his sudden resignation, after which constitutional successionpassed thepresidency to the President of the Congress, Valentin Paniagua, in November 2000. The immediate challenge facing the interim government was to organize new presidential and parliamentary elections. First and second round elections on April 8 and June 3 were widely praised as being free and fair, and AlejandroToledowas elected President. The Toledo administration faces the more long-term challenge of maintaining stability whiletryingto strengthen democratic institutions weakened by 10 years of a democratically elected, but autocratically run,government. Peru is located along the Andean mountains of South America. Although economic conditions have improved over the lastfive years, there is still extensive poverty in Peru. Peru has a free market economy. The United States and Peru have enjoyed generally friendly relations over the past decade, although the recurring politicalcrises of the Fujimori government strained those relations. The primary U.S. interest in Peru has been the reductionofillicit narcotics production and trafficking. Other stated goals of U.S. assistance are: broader citizen participationand moreresponsive government; increased incomes for Peru's poor; improved health of high risk populations; and improvedenvironmental conditions. The United States pressed the Fujimori government to improve respect for human rights;formuch of his term Fujimori's regime had one of the worst human rights record in the hemisphere. Both the interimand theToledo governments have taken steps to improve respect for human rights. The United States has been concernedaboutsecurity in Peru and in the Andean region as a whole. The U.S. Congress has expressed concern about the development of democratic institutions in Peru, and has conditionedaid on the respect for those institutions, and for human rights, and the holding of free and fair elections. Congresshas alsoexpressed concern about the case of Lori Berenson, an American prisoner in Peru; the relationship between U.S.agenciesand Peru's spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos; and whether to resume a joint aerial drug-interdiction program that wassuspended after the accidental shooting of an American missionary plane."
