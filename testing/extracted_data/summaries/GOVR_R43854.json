    "content": "Private health insurance is the predominant form of health insurance coverage in the United States, covering about two-thirds of Americans in 2014. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148, as amended) builds on and modifies existing sources of private health insurance coverage\u2014the non-group (individual), small-group, and large-group markets. The ACA provisions follow a federalist model in which they establish federal minimum requirements and give states the authority to enforce and expand those federal standards. The ACA includes provisions that restructure the private health insurance market by implementing market reforms that impose requirements on insurers and sponsors of health insurance (e.g., employers); creating health insurance exchanges (marketplaces) in which individuals and small businesses can shop for and purchase private health plans that meet or exceed federal standards; providing financial assistance to qualified individuals and small employers who purchase health plans through an exchange; establishing an individual mandate, which requires most individuals to either maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty; creating three risk mitigation programs to help health insurance issuers adjust to the reformed private health insurance landscape; assessing penalties on certain employers that either do not provide health insurance or provide health insurance that does not meet certain criteria; and including some state-option provisions, which states may choose to implement. This report provides a broad overview of some of the private health insurance provisions in the ACA and directs readers to more in-depth CRS reports."
