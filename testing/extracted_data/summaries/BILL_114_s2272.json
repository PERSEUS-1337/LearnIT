    "content": "Protecting Our Students and Taxpayers Act of 2015 or the POST Act of 2015 This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to modify requirements for a proprietary institution of higher education (IHE) to participate in title IV federal student aid programs. Current law requires a proprietary IHE to derive at least 10 of its revenue from sources other than title IV federal student aid. This legislation requires a proprietary IHE to derive at least 15 of its revenue from sources other than federal funds . It defines federal funds to mean title IV federal student aid, as well as education benefits for military personnel and veterans. Additionally, the bill limits what a proprietary institution may treat as revenue to the school in calculating whether it derives at least 15 of its revenue from sources other than federal funds. Finally, the bill moves the 8515 rule from title IV to title I of the HEA, making compliance a condition of institutional eligibility to participate in title IV federal student aid programs . Currently, a proprietary IHE must violate the rule for two consecutive years before losing eligibility for title IV programs."
