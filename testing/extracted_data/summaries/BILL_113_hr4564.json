Requires as well that if the aggregate amount sold within the previous 12-month period in reliance upon this exemption is: (1) $500,000 or less, the issuer provide potential investors with financial statements issuer-certified to be true and complete in all material respects. Or (2) between $500,000 and $3 million, the issuer provide potential investors with financial statements reviewed by a public accountant independent of the issuer.

Requires an intermediary to undertake background checks on the issuer's executive officers, directors, and shareholders with 15 or more voting control. Requires an issuer to use intermediaries when selling to unaccredited investors. Permits an intermediary to select the transactions in which it serves as an intermediary. Amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to exempt from treatment as an investment company any person substantially all of whose business is confined to investing in securities purchased in crowdfunding investment companies under this Act. Amends the Securities Act of 1933 to exempt such crowdfunded securities from state regulation of securities offerings. But retains state jurisdiction over the unlawful conduct of intermediaries, issuers, and custodians."
