    "content": "Overseas Voting Education and Reform, Safeguarding Every American's Vote Act, or OVERSEAS Vote Act - Amends the Uniformed and Overseas Citizen Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) to prohibit a state from refusing to accept or process any otherwise valid absentee ballot submitted by an absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter on the grounds that the envelope in which the ballot is submitted is not notarized or witnessed by a notary public or other official authorized to administer oaths. Repeals the requirement to apply for state absentee ballot as a condition for use of a federal write-in absentee ballot. Permits voters to request absentee ballots in all subsequent elections. Directs the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to establish and operate a program of grants to eligible nonpartisan organizations for activities to: (1) assist overseas civilian voters in voting in federal elections. And (2) increase turnout by providing them with information in advance of an election on how to cast absentee ballots. Requires the head of each office of the federal government with employees whose designated post of duty is outside the United States to notify them of the rights provided by UOCAVA to absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters. Directs the Secretary of State to ensure that each passport issued after enactment of this Act describes such rights. Extends application of UOCAVA to certain individuals who have never resided in the United States."
