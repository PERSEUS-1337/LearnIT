    "title": "A bill to reform the health care liability system.",
    "content": "Common Sense Medical Malpractice Reform Act of 2001 - Declares that, in a health care liability action that is subject to this Act: (1) the action may not be initiated unless a complaint is filed within two years, with exceptions, (2) the amount of non-economic damages shall not exceed $250,000. And (3) an award for punitive damages may only be made if proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant intended to injure the claimant for a reason unrelated to the provision of health care services. Understood the claimant was substantially certain to suffer unnecessary injury and deliberately failed to avoid such injury. Or acted with a conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk of unnecessary injury which the defendant failed to avoid in a manner which constitutes a gross deviation from the normal standard of conduct. Establishes additional limitations on punitive damages, including specified requirements for the pleading of punitive damages, and a requirement that the trier of fact consider the issue of punitive damages in a separate proceeding. Sets forth provisions regarding periodic payments, the scope of liability , mandatory offsets for damages paid by a collateral source, and a cap on attorney's fees . Encourages each State to establish or maintain ADR mechanisms. Directs the Attorney General to develop guidelines regarding such mechanisms."
