    "content": "Integrity of the United States Courts Act of 2001 - Amends the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act to permit a party or person to file with the US Court of International Trade an appeal of a determination of a binational panel, alleging that a panel determination was based on a misinterpretation of US law, a member of a binational panel is guilty of gross misconduct, bias, or serious conflict of interest, or that the panel seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure or exceeded its own authority, and such actions have materially affected panel determinations with respect to antidumping and countervailing duty cases and threaten the integrity of the panel review process. Authorizes a party to file an appeal of the antidumping or countervailing duty determination with the US Court of International Trade if such party has requested a panel review of the determination, but such panel is not convened within 315 days. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to grant the US Court of International Trade jurisdiction over the review of a final determination of a binational panel or an investigating authority. Declares that the amendments made by this Act with respect to antidumping and countervailing duty law shall apply to goods from Canada and Mexico."
