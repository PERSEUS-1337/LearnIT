Directs the court to enter an ex parte order authorizing the installation and use of a clone pager for which the service provider is subject to the jurisdiction of the court if the court finds that the attorney for the Government or the State law enforcement or investigative officer has certified to the court that the information likely to be obtained by such installation and use is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.

Authorizes a Federal court, upon the request of an attorney for the Government or an officer of a law enforcement agency authorized to acquire and use a clone pager, to order a provider of a paging service or other person to furnish to such investigative or law enforcement officer all information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the programming and use of such pager unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference with the paging services provided."
