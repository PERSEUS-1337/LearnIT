    "title": "AB 303",
    "content": "Existing law establishes a statewide policy strictly limiting strip and body cavity searches of prearraignment detainees arrested for infraction or misdemeanor offenses and of minors detained prior to a detention hearing on the grounds that he or she is alleged to have committed a misdemeanor or infraction offense. Existing law provides that if a person is arrested and taken into custody, that person may be subjected to patdown searches, metal detector searches, and thorough clothing searches in order to discover and retrieve concealed weapons and contraband substances prior to being placed in a booking cell. Existing law requires, among other things, that all persons conducting or otherwise present during a strip search or visual or physical body cavity search to be of the same sex as the person being searched, except for physicians or licensed medical personnel. Under existing law, a person who knowingly and willfully authorizes or conducts a strip, visual, or physical body cavity search in violation of the prescribed provisions is guilty of a misdemeanor. This bill would additionally require that all persons within sight of the inmate during a strip search or visual or physical body cavity search be of the same sex as the person being searched, except for physicians or licensed medical personnel. The bill would extend the protections regarding the manner in which a strip search is conducted to all minors held in a juvenile detention facility. By expanding the definition of a crime, creating a new crime, and imposing additional requirements on local law enforcement, this bill would create a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."
