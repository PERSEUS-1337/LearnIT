    "content": "The Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill includes funding for the Department of the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President (EOP), the judiciary, the District of Columbia, and 26 independent agencies. Among the independent agencies funded by the bill are the General Services Administration (GSA), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Small Business Administration (SBA), and the United States Postal Service (USPS). On September 30, 2008, President George W. Bush signed the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 110-329). Division A of P.L. 110-329 provided continuing appropriations for most accounts in the Financial Services and General Government accounts through March 9, 2009. Funding was generally at the same rate appropriated in P.L. 110-161, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. Division B of P.L. 110-329 provided GSA with an additional $182 million for courthouse construction, and provided SBA with an additional $799 million, almost of all which was for the disaster loan program account. On March 11, 2009, President Obama signed the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-8), which provides $44.6 billion for FSGG programs and agencies, an increase of $385 million above the FY2009 requested amount and $58 million less than FY2008 enacted appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee had recommended $44.27 billion for FSGG agencies and programs for FY2009, and the Senate Appropriations Committee had recommended $44.75 billion. In addition, Title V of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5) provided funding for three FSGG agencies: GSA received $5.85 billion, the Department of Treasury received $187 million, and SBA received $730 million. The newly established Recovery Act Accountability and Transparency Board was also funded through Title V of the ARRA, receiving $84 million. This report will be updated as events warrant."
