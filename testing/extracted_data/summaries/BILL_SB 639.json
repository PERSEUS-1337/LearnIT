    "title": "SB 639",
    "content": "Existing law vests in the State Department of Developmental Services jurisdiction over state hospitals referred to as developmental centers for the provision of residential care to individuals with developmental disabilities. Existing law requires the department to comply with procedural requirements when closing a developmental center, including submitting a detailed plan to the Legislature and holding at least one public hearing. Under existing law, the department allocates funds to private nonprofit entities known as regional centers, which are required to provide, or arrange for the provision of, services and supports for persons with developmental disabilities. This bill would require the department to submit a plan to the Legislature by April 1, 2016, to close the Sonoma Developmental Center and the Fairview Developmental Center. The bill would require the plan to meet existing requirements for closing a developmental center and to additionally include, specified components, including a closure plan that will result in each of the 2 developmental centers closing no later than December 31, 2018, except as specified. The bill would also require the plan to include a plan for using the properties occupied by the 2 developmental centers, as specified, and would require the department to work with the Department of General Services to estimate potential revenues that may be generated from different options for use of the properties. The bill would state the intent of the Legislature that the department minimize the expenditure of state funds related to any developmental center residential units that are decertified for failure to meet federal or state health and safety laws or regulations or that receive notification from a state or federal regulator that they are at risk of decertification for failure to meet those laws or regulations, and that funds previously used to operate developmental centers instead be shifted to support community-based services for individuals with developmental disabilities."
