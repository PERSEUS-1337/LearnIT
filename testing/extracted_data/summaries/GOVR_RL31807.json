On September 16 the Senate passed its version of H.R.2754, funding energy and water development programs at $27.38 billion. The conferencecommittee on the bill approved $27.33 billion on November 5, 2003. Both the House and the Senateagreed to the conference report on November 18, and the President signed the bill December 1 ( P.L.108-137 ).
