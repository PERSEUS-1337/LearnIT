    "content": "Capitol Visitor Center Authorization Act of 1997 - Authorizes the Architect of the Capitol (AOC), under the direction of the US Capitol Preservation Commission (Commission), to: (1) plan, construct, equip, administer, and maintain a Capitol Visitor Center under the East Plaza of the Capitol. And (2) reconstruct the East Plaza and its environs to enhance its attractiveness, safety, and security. Requires that the design of the Capitol Visitor Center shall be substantially in accordance with the Final Design Report dated November 10, 1995, submitted by the AOC to specified congressional committees. Authorizes and directs the AOC to finance and develop the project in accordance with this Act. Directs the AOC to develop and submit to the Commission for approval a plan that will enable the construction of the project to be completed without the appropriation of funds to the legislative branch for such purpose. Establishes in the Treasury an Architect of the Capitol, Capitol Buildings and Grounds, Capitol Visitor Center, Gifts and Donations account. Authorizes the AOC to establish competitive procedures for work to carry out the project by the use of prequalification standards, and to award contracts on the basis of contractor qualifications as well as price. States that such procedures and contract awards shall be final and conclusive upon all officers of the Government. Amends the Arizona-Idaho Conservation Act to authorize the Commission to establish a special committee to provide the AOC with all necessary oversight and direction. Repeals the provisions of title III of the National Visitor Center Facilities Act of 1968 to the extent that such provisions are inconsistent with the provisions of the plan approved under this Act."
