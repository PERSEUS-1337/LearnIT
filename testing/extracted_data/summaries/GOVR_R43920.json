    "content": "The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) is a pipeline for clinician recruitment and training. Its program objective is to increase the availability of primary care services to populations in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs). It aims to increase clinician availability by making loan repayments and awarding scholarships to individuals in exchange for their agreement to serve as NHSC clinicians (or providers) at approved sites. NHSC providers are mainly physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and behavioral/mental health professionals who must serve for a minimum of two years at an approved facility. An approved facility, for example, may be a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) and FQHC Look-Alike, American Indian and Native Alaska Health Clinic, Rural Health Clinic, Critical Access Hospital, School-Based Clinic, Mobile Unit, Free Clinic, or Community Mental Health Center, and must be located in a federally designated HPSA. All NHSC providers must fulfill a minimum of two-year service commitment at an NHSC-approved site. The NHSC is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Congress created the NHSC in the Emergency Health Personnel Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-623), and since then has reauthorized and amended its programs several times. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA; P.L. 111-148) permanently reauthorized the NHSC. Legislation to potentially repeal or replace all or parts of the ACA, depending on its scope, may impact NHSC authorization and funding. In 2010, Congress implemented major revisions in the NHSC through the ACA. Most notably, the ACA permanently authorized the NHSC and created the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF), a source of mandatory funding for the NHSC from FY2011 through FY2015. This funding was subsequently extended in the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA, P.L. 114-10). MACRA provided $310 million to support the NHSC in FY2016 and FY2017 through the CHCF. MACRA is the sole source of NHSC funds in FY2017. (Because this fund is subject to the mandatory spending sequester, the FY2017 funding level is $289 million.) In addition, the ACA amended statutory authorities pertaining to the NHSC's requirements for part-time service, teaching credits toward service obligations, and exclusions from an individual's gross income for those payments from state loan repayment or loan forgiveness programs that seek to increase health care access in federally designated HPSAs. In FY2015, the most recent annual data available, the NHSC awarded 2,934 new loan repayment agreements; 1,841 continuing loan repayment agreements; 96 student-to-service loan repayments; 620 state loan repayments; 196 new scholarships; and 11 continuing scholarships. In FY2014, the NHSC issued the largest number of awards, 5,620, in a single year. Mental health providers, physicians, and nurse practitioners represented the largest number of NHSC clinicians in recent years. Also, in recent years, congressional appropriators have expressed concerns about updating the methodology for designating areas where NHSC providers are placed, and interest in the possibility of authorizing pharmacists as NHSC clinicians. The 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) expanded the list of NHSC providers to include child and adolescent psychiatrists. This report summarizes the NHSC's recruitment and retention programs, and the NHSC's funding trends from FY2010 through FY2017."
