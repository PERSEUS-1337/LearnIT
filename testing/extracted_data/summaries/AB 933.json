    "title": "An act to\namend Section 1808 of\nadd Section 23582.5 to\nthe Vehicle Code, relating to vehicles.",
    "content": "Existing law prohibits a person who has 0.08 or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood from driving a vehicle. Existing law also prohibits a person while having 0.08 or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood from driving a vehicle and concurrently doing any act forbidden by law, or neglecting any duty imposed by law in driving the vehicle, when the act or neglect proximately causes bodily injury to a person other than the driver. A violation of either of these prohibitions is a crime. Existing law authorizes a court, in addition to imposing penalties and sanctions for those violations, to require the person to enroll and participate in, and successfully complete, a driving-under-the-influence program, which may include, among other things, education, group counseling, and individual interview sessions. Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to immediately suspend a person\u2019s privilege to operate a motor vehicle for a specified period of time if the person has driven a motor vehicle when the person had a certain blood-alcohol concentration. Existing law also requires the department to suspend or revoke the driving privilege of a person who refuses an officer\u2019s request or fails to complete a chemical test or tests, as specified. Existing law authorizes certain individuals whose privilege is suspended or revoked pursuant to that provision to receive a restricted driver\u2019s license if specified requirements are met, including the completion of specified periods of license suspension or revocation and, in some instances, the installation of an ignition interlock device on the person\u2019s vehicle. This bill would authorize the court to order a person convicted of a crime described above to enroll and participate in, and successfully complete, a qualified \u201c247 Sobriety program,\u201d as defined, as a condition of probation, if the program is available and deemed appropriate, and the person committed the crime within 10 years of one or more separate crimes described above that resulted in a conviction. The bill also would authorize a court to order participation in a 247 Sobriety program as a condition of release on bond for a person who has been charged with a crime described above. The bill would permit a person whose driving privilege has been suspended or revoked for certain violations, and who subsequently applies to the department for a restricted driving privilege, to be permitted to participate in a 247 Sobriety program as a condition of obtaining the restricted driving privilege as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, participation in an ignition interlock device program. The bill would define a \u201c247 Sobriety program,\u201d in part, as requiring a person in the program to abstain from alcohol and unauthorized controlled substances and be subject to frequent testing for alcohol and controlled substances, as specified. The bill would require a person participating in the program to pay the program costs, commensurate with the person\u2019s ability to pay, as specified. Existing law provides that all records of the Department of Motor Vehicles relating to the registration of vehicles, other information contained on an application for a driver\u2019s license, abstracts of convictions, and certain abstracts of accident reports are required to be open to public inspection during office hours, except when a specific provision of law prohibits the disclosure of records or information or provides for confidentiality. This bill would provide that consent to the use of a person\u2019s driver\u2019s license number by the insurance agent or broker of an insurer, insurance licensee, employer, or prospective employer to obtain, transmit, or otherwise utilize the motor vehicle records of that person pursuant to the provision described above is presumed if the person provides his or her driver\u2019s license number to an insurer, insurance licensee, employer, or prospective employer for the purpose of eligibility, underwriting, and rating of personal or commercial insurance coverage or eligibility for employment or continued employment involving the use of a motor vehicle. The bill would provide that the insurance agent or broker of the insurer, insurance licensee, employer, or prospective employer is authorized to transmit motor vehicle records for these purposes, as specified, and would specify that an insurance agent or broker who has lawfully transmitted a record as authorized under these provisions is not responsible for the subsequent handling of that record by any recipient who is authorized to receive the record under these provisions. The bill would also delete an obsolete cross-reference."
