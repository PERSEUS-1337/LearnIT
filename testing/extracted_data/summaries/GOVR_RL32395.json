    "content": "Photographs depicting the apparent abuse of Iraqi detainees at the hands of U.S. militarypersonnel at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq resulted in numerous investigations, congressional hearings,and prosecutions, raising questions regarding the applicable law. The international law of armedconflict, in particular, those parts relating to belligerent occupation, applies in Iraq. The four GenevaConventions of 1949 related to the treatment of prisoners of war (POW) and civilian detainees, aswell as the Hague Regulations define the status of detainees and state responsibility for theirtreatment. Other international law relevant to human rights and to the treatment of prisoners mayalso apply. For example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits \"cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment.\" The U.N. Declaration on Human Rights and the U.N. ConventionAgainst Torture (CAT) is also relevant. Federal statutes that implement the relevant internationallaw, such as the War Crimes Act of 1996 and the Torture Victim Protection Act, as well as othercriminal statutes with extraterritorial application may also come into play. Finally, the law of Iraqas amended by regulations that were issued by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) may applyin some circumstances. This report summarizes pertinent provisions of the Geneva Conventions Relative to theTreatment of Victims of War (Geneva Conventions) and other relevant international agreements. The report begins with a discussion of international and U.S. standards pertaining to the treatmentof prisoners. A discussion of accountability in case of breach of these standards follows, includingpotential means of asserting jurisdiction over alleged violators, either in military courts under theUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) or U.S. federal courts, by applying U.S. criminal statutesthat explicitly apply extraterritorially or within the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of theUnited States (as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 7), or by means of the Military Extraterritorial JurisdictionAct (MEJA). The section that follows discusses international requirements to provide redress forthose whose treatment at the hands of U.S. officials may have fallen below the standards outlinedin the first section of the report. Finally, the report summarizes relevant congressional activityduring the 108th and 109th Congresses, including a brief discussion of the anti-torture provision of P.L.109-13 ( H.R. 1268 ) as well as relevant pending legislation ( H.R. 3003 , S. 12 , H.R. 112 , H.R. 2863 , S. 1042 ). This reportwill be updated."
