    "content": "Explosives Fingerprinting Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the manufacture, importation, transport, shipment, distribution, or receipt in interstate or foreign commerce, or resale or other disposition as surplus by a Government department, agency, or instrumentality of any explosive material that does not contain an identification taggant and a detection taggant. Makes such provisions inapplicable to any such material designated by the President for use by the Department of Defense or another Government agency for national defense or international security purposes. Sets penalties for violations. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) defer specified effective dates of prohibitions under this Act until the Secretary is satisfied that identification and detection taggants are available in sufficient quantity for commercial purposes, will not impair the quality of explosive materials for their intended use, and will not adversely affect the environment, and (2) inform the Congress before making any such deferrals."
