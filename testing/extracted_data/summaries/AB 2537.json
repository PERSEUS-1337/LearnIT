    "title": "An act to amend and repeal Section 48204 of the Education Code, relating to pupils.",
    "content": "Existing law provides that a pupil is deemed to have complied with the residency requirements for school attendance in a school district if the pupil satisfies one of the specified requirements. Until July 1, 2017, existing law authorizes a school district within the boundaries of which at least one parent or the legal guardian of a pupil is physically employed for a minimum of 10 hours during the school week to allow that pupil to attend a school in that school district through grade 12 if the parent or legal guardian of the pupil so chooses and if the parent or legal guardian of the pupil continues to be physically employed by an employer situated within the attendance boundaries of the school district. This bill would indefinitely extend the operation of the provision authorizing the school district within the boundaries of which a parent or legal guardian of a pupil is physically employed for a minimum of 10 hours during the school week to allow that pupil to attend a school in that school district."
