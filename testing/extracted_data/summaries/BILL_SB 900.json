    "title": "SB 900",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the State Lands Commission in the Natural Resources Agency and prescribes the functions and duties of the commission. Under existing law, the commission has jurisdiction over various state lands, including coastal lands. This bill would, upon appropriation of moneys by the Legislature, require the commission to, within 2 years, administer a coastal hazard removal and remediation program, as specified. The bill would authorize the commission to seek and accept on behalf of the state any gift, bequest, devise, or donation whenever the gift and the terms and conditions thereof will aid in actions undertaken to administer that program. The bill would authorize the commission to seek to abandon, in cooperation with the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources, legacy oil and gas wells, as defined, that present a hazard to the public health and safety and the environment. The bill would require the commission to annually report to the Legislature the activities and accomplishments of the program. Existing law, with specified exceptions, generally requires the State Lands Commission, on and after July 1, 2006, to deposit all revenue, money, and remittances, derived from mineral extraction leases on state tide and submerged lands, including tideland oil revenue, into the General Fund, to be available upon appropriation by the Legislature for specified purposes. Existing law establishes the Land Bank Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, from which the commission may expend moneys for management and improvement of real property held by the commission, as trustee, to provide open space, habitat for plants and animals, and public access. This bill would require that, for the 2017\u201318 fiscal year, out of those funds deposited into the General Fund by the commission, the sum of $500,000 be transferred to the Land Bank Fund and be available, upon appropriation in the annual Budget Act, for the purpose of implementing the coastal hazard removal and remediation program. The bill would require that, commencing with the 2018\u201319 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, an amount sufficient to bring the unencumbered balance of the Land Bank Fund available for the purpose of implementing the program to $500,000 be transferred to that fund and be available, upon an appropriation in the annual Budget Act, for the purpose of implementing the program."
