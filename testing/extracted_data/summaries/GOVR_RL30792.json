    "content": "The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides for the listing and protection of species that arefound to be \"endangered\" or \"threatened\" -- species that might become extinct. The listing of aspecies as endangered triggers the prohibitions in the act against \"taking\" (killing or harming)individuals of the protected species, unless a permit is obtained to take individuals incidental to anotherwise lawful proposed action, or an exemption for the proposed action is obtained. Unauthorized taking of a listed species can result in civil or criminal penalties. These prohibitionsand potential penalties can affect various activities, including development and use of land, withattendant economic impacts. Therefore, the extent to which likely economic impacts can be takeninto account under the ESA has generated interest and discussion. The determination of whether a species should be listed as endangered or threatened mustbe based \"solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available.\" (\"Commercialdata\" here refers to trade data.) The data that may be considered at the listing stage may include factsrelated to a species' population, habitat, distribution, etc., as well as threats to its continued survival,but must not include economic factors. However, economic factors may be, and in some instances must be, considered in devisingresponses to the listing of a species -- e.g., in the designation of critical habitat, in the process forobtaining an exemption for a particular proposed action from the prohibitions of the ESA, and in thedevelopment of the recovery plan for a listed species. Economic factors also play less direct rolesin the permitting processes. Parts of the ESA relate to commercial importation and trade in listed species. This reportdoes not address those issues, but rather discusses the ESA generally, aside from the commercialcontext, and how some of its provisions relate to the consideration of economic factors. It will beupdated as circumstances warrant."
