The U.S. Department of Education estimates that in FY2020, $100.2 billion in new loans will be made through the program. As of the end of the second quarter of FY2019, $1.2 trillion in principal and interest on Direct Loan program loans, borrowed by or on behalf of 34.5 million individuals, remained outstanding. For many individuals, borrowing a federal student loan through the Direct Loan program may be among their first experiences in incurring a major financial obligation. Upon obtaining a loan, a borrower assumes a contractual obligation to repay the debt over a period that may span a decade or more. Loans were first made through the Direct Loan program in 1994. Since then, Congress has periodically made changes to the program and the terms and conditions of loans. Changes have impacted program aspects such as the availability of loan types, interest rates, loan repayment, loan discharge and forgiveness, and the consequences of default. Over time, the accumulation of changes\u00e2\u0080\u0094many of which are differentially applicable to borrowers or loan types\u00e2\u0080\u0094has resulted in a set of loan terms and conditions that are voluminous and complex. Congress may contemplate making future changes to loan terms and conditions. This report has been prepared to provide Congress with a comprehensive description of the terms and conditions and borrower benefits that are applicable to loans made through the Direct Loan program. Emphasis is placed on discussing loan types, provisions related to borrower eligibility, amounts that may be borrowed, interest and fees, loan repayment, repayment relief, loan forgiveness benefits, the consequences of default, and the methods used to ensure borrowers are informed about the terms and conditions of their loans and their obligation to repay them. Direct Loan Types Four types of loans are available through the Direct Loan program. Direct Subsidized Loans are available only to undergraduate students with financial need. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available both to undergraduate students and graduate students. Direct PLUS Loans may be borrowed by graduate students and by the parents of undergraduate students dependent upon them for financial support. Direct Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine debt from multiple existing federal student loans into a single new loan. Eligibility and Amounts That May Be Borrowed Whether an individual may borrow a loan and the amount he or she may borrow are determined by the interaction of many factors. Eligibility to borrow varies by loan type, borrower characteristics, program level, and class level. The amount an individual may borrow is subject to annual and aggregate borrowing limits, and federal need analysis and packaging procedures. Loans are made available in amounts constrained by program rules, but\u00e2\u0080\u0094with the exception of Direct PLUS Loans\u00e2\u0080\u0094without consideration of a borrower's ability to repay. Eligibility to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan depends on an individual's creditworthiness. Interest on Direct Loan Program Loans Procedures for calculating interest vary by loan type, repayment status, and the period during which a loan was made. In limited circumstances, the federal government subsidizes, or does not charge, interest that would otherwise accrue. Interest subsidies are mostly limited to Direct Subsidized Loans; however, certain interest subsidies may be provided on all loan types. Loan Repayment Plans Numerous repayment plans, each with different payment structures and maximum durations, are available. Among the various plans, income-driven repayment (IDR) plans cap monthly payments at a specific percentage of a borrower's discretionary income. For most repayment plans, monthly payments must cover the interest that accrues; however, the IDR plans allow for negative amortization, in which case monthly payments may be for less than the interest that accrues. Deferment and Forbearance Periods of deferment and forbearance offer a borrower temporary relief from the obligation to make monthly payments. In certain instances, interest subsidies may be provided during periods of deferment; however, interest subsidies are not available during periods of forbearance. Loan Discharge and Loan Forgiveness A borrower may be relieved of the obligation to repay his or her loans in certain circumstances. Student loan debt may be discharged on the basis of borrower hardship (e.g., death, total and permanent disability, school closure) or may be forgiven following an extended period of repayment according to an IDR plan or completion of a period of public service. Loan Default, Its Consequences, and Resolution If a borrower defaults, the loan becomes due in full and the borrower loses eligibility for many benefits, as well as access to other forms of federal student aid. The government also uses numerous means to collect on defaulted student loan debt. A limited set of options is available for a borrower to bring a defaulted loan back into good standing. Loan Counseling and Disclosures Student borrowers are required to undergo financial counseling, which is designed to provide them with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of their loans as well as their rights and the responsibilities they assume as borrowers. Loan terms and conditions are specified in a promissory note, which is a contract that establishes the borrower's obligation to repay the loan, and in a plain language disclosure document that uses simplified terms to explain a loan's terms and conditions and the borrower's rights and responsibilities."
