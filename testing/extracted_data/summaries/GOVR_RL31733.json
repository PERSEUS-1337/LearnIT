    "content": "The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 heightened awareness about the vulnerability toterrorist attack of all modes of transportation. Port security has emerged as a significant part of theoverall debate on U.S. homeland security. The overarching issues for Congress are providingoversight on current port security programs and making or responding to proposals to improve portsecurity. The U.S. maritime system consists of more than 300 sea and river ports with more than 3,700cargo and passenger terminals. However, a large fraction of maritime cargo is concentrated at a fewmajor ports. Most ships calling at U.S. ports are foreign owned with foreign crews. Container shipshave been the focus of much of the attention on seaport security because they are seen as vulnerableto terrorist infiltration. More than 9 million marine containers enter U.S. ports each year. While theBureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) analyzes cargo and other information to targetspecific shipments for closer inspection, it physically inspects only a small fraction of the containers. The Coast Guard and CBP are the federal agencies with the strongest presence in seaports. In response to September 11, 2001, the Coast Guard created the largest port-security operation sinceWorld War II. The Coast Guard has advanced its 24-hour Notice of Arrival (NOA) for ships to a96-hour NOA. The NOA allows Coast Guard officials to select high risk ships for boarding upontheir arrival at the entrance to a harbor. CBP has also advanced the timing of cargo information itreceives from ocean carriers. Through the Container Security Initiative (CSI) program, CBPinspectors pre-screen U.S.-bound marine containers at foreign ports of loading. The Customs TradePartnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) offers importers expedited processing of their cargo if theycomply with CBP measures for securing their entire supply chain. To raise port security standards, Congress passed the Maritime Transportation Security Actof 2002 ( P.L. 107-295 ) in November 2002. The focus of debate in Congress has been about whethercurrent efforts to improve port security are adequate in addressing the threat. While many agree thatCoast Guard and CBP programs to address the threat are sound, they contend that these programsrepresent only a framework for building a maritime security regime, and that significant gaps insecurity still remain. The GAO has investigated how the CSI and C-TPAT programs are beingimplemented and found several shortcomings that need correction. The GAO found that C-TPATparticipants were benefitting from reduced scrutiny of their imported cargo after they had beencertified into the program but before CBP had validated that the participants were indeed carryingout the promised security measures. The GAO also found that not all containers that CBP hadtargeted for inspection at the overseas loading port were being inspected by the host customsadministration.
