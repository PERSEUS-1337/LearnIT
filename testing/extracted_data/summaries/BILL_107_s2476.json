    "content": "International Cooperation Against Terrorism Act of 2002 - Amends Federal aviation law to establish certain civil penalties for domestic and foreign air carriers which do not transmit passenger and crew manifest data electronically for each flight through the advanced passenger information system (APIS) to the Commissioner of Customs. Amends the Tariff Act of 1931 to require the pilot, operator, or owner of every aircraft required to make entry or obtain clearance under the US customs laws to transmit certain cargo manifest information electronically in advance in the manner, time, and form the Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe. Specifies civil penalties for noncompliance with such requirements. Authorizes the President to conclude agreements with foreign countries in which such countries agree to require charitable organizations identified as supporting terrorist organizations to report certain information, including the overall sources of organization funds. Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to revise the requirement of a validated license for the export of goods or technology to a foreign country supporting international terrorism. Extends such requirement to a country if the Secretary of State determines that: (1) the government of the country is not cooperating with US antiterrorism efforts, including failing to freeze the bank accounts of entities supporting terrorist activities, or failing to share intelligence information regarding terrorist organizations with the United States. And (2) the export to the country of such goods or technology could make a significant contribution to the development of the country's ability to explore for, extract, refine, or transport petroleum or natural gas. Requires a validated license for the financial investment by a US person in a foreign country if the President makes determinations about the country similar to those relating to the export of goods or technology."
