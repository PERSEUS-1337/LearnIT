    "content": "The Origination Clause of the Constitution, Article I, Section 7, clause 1, states that, \"Allbills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may proposeor concur with amendments as on other bills.\" This report discusses opinions of the Supreme Courtand some lower federal courts that have interpreted the text of the Clause and delineated the scopeof the Senate's power to amend revenue legislation. It does not address parliamentary precedents ofthe House and Senate, which generally have interpreted the Clause more restrictively than the courts. These cases have limited the phrase \"bills for raising revenue\" to those that levy taxes forthe support of the government generally and not to those that raise revenue for specific programs. They have held that the Senate may attach amendments to raise revenue only to House bills that raiseit under this limited interpretation and not to House bills that do not raise revenue. Lower courtshave concluded that the Senate may amend a House bill to reduce revenue with Senate text thatincreases revenue. This report will be updated."
