    "title": "A bill to provide further protections for the watershed of the Little Sandy River as part of the Bull Run Watershed Management Unit, Oregon, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "Requires the cutting of trees to be prohibited on Federal land in the entire unit. Repeals a provision of the Oregon Resource Conservation Act of 1996 which requires certain Unit lands that are not contained in the Bull Run River Drainage to be managed in accordance with the law establishing the Unit. Requires the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to identify any Oregon and California Railroad lands , subject to the distribution provision regarding such lands, within the boundary of the Unit. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to identify public domain lands within the Medford, Roseburg, Eugene, Salem and Coos Bay Districts and the Klamath Resource Area of the Lakeview District of the Bureau of Land Management equal in size and condition as such OC lands, but not subject to the Act relating to the Oregon and California Railroad and Coos Bay Wagon Road grant lands. Requires such Secretary to: (1) submit to Congress and publish in the Federal Register a map or maps identifying those public domain lands mentioned in the two preceding clauses. And (2) after an opportunity for public comment, complete an administrative land reclassification such that the OC lands within the Unit become public domain lands not subject to the distribution provision and the public domain lands within such Districts become OC lands subject to such Act. Authorizes appropriations under the provisions of the FY 1999 Interior Appropriations Act for Clackamas County, Oregon, for watershed restoration that protects or enhances water quality or relates to the recovery of endangered and threatened species near the Unit in order to further this Act's purposes."
