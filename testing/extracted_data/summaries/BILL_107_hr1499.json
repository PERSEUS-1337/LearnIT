    "content": "District of Columbia College Access Improvement Act of 2001 - Revises eligibility requirements for tuition assistance under the District of Columbia College Access Act of 1999 to allow the following to be eligible for such assistance: (1) applicants who graduated from a secondary school or received the recognized equivalent of a secondary school diploma before January 1, 1998, and are currently enrolled at an eligible institution as of the enactment of this Act, and were domiciled in the District of Columbia for not less than 12 consecutive months preceding the commencement of the freshman year at an institution of higher education. (2) applicants re-enrolling after more than a three-year break in their post-secondary education who have been domiciled in the District for at least five consecutive years at the application date. (3) applicants who did not graduate from a secondary school or receive a recognized equivalent of a secondary school diploma, but are accepted for enrollment as a freshman at an eligible institution on or after January 1, 2002. And (4) applicants who graduated from a secondary school or received the recognized equivalent of such school diploma before January 1, 1998 and are currently enrolled at an eligible institution as of the enactment of this Act. Requires all eligible students to meet the citizenship and immigration status requirements described in the Higher Education Act of 1965. Amends the Act: (1) to allow individuals who attend private historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) nationwide to participate in such Tuition Assistance Program. And (2) to prohibit the Mayor from using more than seven percent of the total amount of Federal funds appropriated for such Program, retroactive to the Act's enactment, for the Program's administrative expenses. Expresses the sense of Congress that the District of Columbia may appropriate such local funds as necessary for the Program. Requires the District government to establish a dedicated account for the Resident Tuition Support Program that shall consist of the Federal funds appropriated to the Program in this Act and any subsequent appropriations, any unobligated balances from prior fiscal years, and any interest earned in this or any fiscal years. Authorizes the use of such funds to help pay the cost of tuition and fees for eligible students to attend eligible institutions if the fiscal year appropriation for that year is insufficient to cover the cost of tuition and fees for that year."
