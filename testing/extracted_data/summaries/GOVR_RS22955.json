    "content": "Since the final rule to implement country-of-origin labeling (COOL) took effect in March 2009, most retail food stores have been required to inform consumers about the country of origin of fresh fruits and vegetables, fish, shellfish, peanuts, pecans, macadamia nuts, ginseng, and ground and muscle cuts of beef, pork, lamb, chicken, and goat. The rules were required by the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171) as amended by the 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246). COOL for beef and pork resulted in a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement case with Canada and Mexico that started in 2009 and finally concluded in 2015. Canada and Mexico challenged U.S. COOL in the WTO, arguing that COOL had a trade-distorting impact by reducing the value and number of cattle and hogs shipped to the U.S. market, thus violating WTO trade commitments. In November 2011, the WTO dispute settlement panel found that COOL treated imported livestock less favorably than U.S. livestock, and did not meet its objective to provide complete information to consumers on the origin of meat products. In March 2012, the United States appealed the WTO ruling. In June 2012 the WTO's Appellate Body (AB) upheld the panel's finding that COOL treated imported livestock less favorably than domestic livestock. But the AB reversed the finding that COOL did not fulfill its legitimate objective to provide consumers with information on origin. The United States welcomed the WTO's affirmation of the right to adopt labeling requirements to inform consumers on the origin of their meat. Participants in the U.S. livestock sector had mixed reactions, reflecting the ongoing heated debate on COOL. In order to meet a compliance deadline of May 23, 2013, USDA issued a revised COOL rule requiring that labels show where each production step (born, raised, slaughtered) occurred and prohibited the commingling of muscle-cut meat from different origins. COOL's supporters applauded the revised rule for providing consumers with specific, useful information on origin. In September 2013, a compliance panel was formed to determine if the revised COOL rule complied with WTO agreements. On October 20, 2014, the panel found that the revised COOL rule treated imported livestock less favorably than domestic livestock. The panel confirmed that COOL was a legitimate objective, but could not determine if the rule was more trade restrictive than necessary. The United States appealed the compliance panel findings in November 2014, and the AB heard the appeal in February 2015. The AB report, released in May 2015, again found that COOL violated U.S. WTO obligations. On June 4, 2015, Canada and Mexico requested authorization to retaliate against U.S. imported products in the amount of US$3 billion. The United States objected to the requests, and on September 15-16, 2015, an arbitration panel met to determine the appropriate level of retaliation. On December 7, 2015, the arbitration panel set the retaliation levels at C$1.055 billion (US$781 million) for Canada and at US$228 million for Mexico. On December 18, 2015, Congress repealed the COOL requirements for beef and pork and ground beef and pork in the enacted Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113). After the repeal by Congress, USDA halted enforcement of COOL for beef and pork. On December 21, 2015, the WTO authorized Canada and Mexico to retaliate against products imported from the United States. Canada and Mexico stated that they were pleased with the repeal of COOL but will retain the authority to retaliate until they are assured that cattle and hog trade is unimpeded as the repeal of COOL is implemented. On March 2, 2016, USDA issued a final rule that amended the COOL regulations to bring them into conformity with P.L. 114-113. Congressional repeal of COOL for beef and pork and the amended regulations have brought the United States into compliance with its WTO obligations."
