And (2) require the payment to the member or member's estate of the remainder of any bonus or special pay not yet paid, but to which the member was entitled to immediately before their death, retirement, or separation. Requires the latter payment to made in a lump sum within 90 days after such death, retirement, or separation. Provides the same discretionary authority and requirements as above for the Secretary concerned with respect to repayment by a member of the unearned portion of any military bonus, special pay, or similar benefit when the member fails to satisfy any service or eligibility requirement."
