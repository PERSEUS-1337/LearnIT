    "content": "In September 2003, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) published a proposedbulletin on \"Peer Review and Information Quality\" in the Federal Register that sought to establisha process by which all \"significant regulatory information\" would be peer reviewed. The scope ofthe proposed bulletin was very broad, covering virtually all agencies and defining regulatoryinformation as \"any scientific or technical study that ... might be used by local, state, regional, federaland/or international regulatory bodies.\" Such information would be subject to peer review if theagency could determine that it could have a \"clear and substantial impact on important publicpolicies or important private sector decisions\" when disseminated. The proposed bulletin placedadditional peer review requirements on \"especially significant regulatory information,\" and saidagencies were required to notify OMB in advance of any studies that might require peer review andhow any such reviews would be conducted. The proposed bulletin aroused controversy, with some observers expressing concern that itcould create a centralized peer review system within OMB that would be vulnerable to politicalmanipulation or control by regulated entities. OMB received nearly 200 comments on the proposal,and published a \"substantially revised\" peer review bulletin in April 2004 that was broader in scopethan the proposed bulletin in that it applied to \"influential scientific information\" (which includes,but is not limited to, regulatory information) and \"highly influential scientific assessments.\" However, agencies were given substantial discretion to decide whether information is \"influential\"and therefore requires a peer review. The revised bulletin also allowed agencies to use the NationalAcademy of Sciences for peer reviews or to use other procedures that had been approved by OMB. It also provided exemptions for certain classes of information, such as information related to nationalsecurity, products by government-funded scientists that are not represented as views of a federalagency, and routine statistical information. However, OMB retained significant authority to decidewhen information is \"highly influential\" (and, therefore, requires more specific peer reviewprocedures) and to approve alternative peer review procedures. OMB received more than 50 comments on the revised peer review bulletin, many of whichwere supportive of the changes made to the proposal. However, some commenters believed thechanges did not go far enough, while others believed that OMB had significantly weakened thebulletin. In January 2005, OMB published a final version of the bulletin with what it described as\"minor revisions\" to the version published in April 2004 (e.g., requiring agencies to disclose theidentities of peer reviewers and to prepare an annual report on their peer review activities). Anumber of issues regarding the implementation of the bulletin remain unclear (e.g., how muchdiscretion agencies will be given to decide when and what kind of peer review is required). Thisreport will be updated when any further revisions to the bulletin are published or other significantevents occur."
