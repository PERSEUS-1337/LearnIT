    "content": "Nutrients are elements essential to plant and animal growth. In agricultural production, the focus generally rests on the three primary macronutrients\u2013\u2013nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)\u2014because of their relative abundance in plants. As crops grow and are harvested, they gradually remove the existing nutrients from the soil and over time will require additional nutrients to maintain or increase crop yield. When nutrients are added in excess of the plants' ability to utilize them, there is an increased risk that the nutrients will enter the surrounding environment (water or air) and create environmental problems. The nutrients of primary environmental concern in agriculture are nitrogen and phosphorus. One of the better-known environmental responses to high levels of nutrients is eutrophication\u2013\u2013the enrichment of water bodies, which can promote the growth of algae. Under certain conditions, algal blooms can occur that can deplete the oxygen content of water, block sunlight to other organisms, and potentially produce toxins. These harmful algal blooms can contaminate surface and drinking water supplies, potentially harming animal and human health. Over time, through research and technological advancements, an understanding of how crops utilize nutrients and how nutrients move in the environment have led to the development of a number of best management practices (BMPs) for nutrient management. Primarily, nutrient BMPs focus on preventing or reducing the ways in which excess nutrients can enter the environment. Crop production BMPs for nutrient management generally focus on applying the right amount of nutrients, from the right source, in the right place, at the right time. BMPs for livestock operations are typically prescribed for concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), where animals are raised or bred in close quarters, thus creating a concentrated source of nutrients. Currently, few federal regulations govern the environmental impacts from agriculture. Some environmental laws specifically exempt agriculture from regulatory requirements, and others are structured so that agriculture is not addressed by most, if not all, of the regulatory impact. The primary regulatory authority protecting water resources is the Clean Water Act (CWA). Regulatory requirements for agricultural nutrients under the CWA are limited to permitting requirements for large CAFOs and the establishment of total maximum daily loads, which are pollution limits for state-identified impaired waters. The major federal response to nutrient pollution from agriculture continues to be through research, education, outreach, and voluntary technical and financial incentives. A number of U.S. Department of Agriculture agencies provide support through education, outreach, and research, while federal funds are provided through conservation programs to help agricultural producers adopt BMPs for nutrient reduction. As the 114th Congress reviews nutrient pollution in U.S. waterways, among the issues being discussed is how to address nutrients from agricultural sources. Whether the current balance between regulatory action and voluntary response is enough to meet environmental goals, who should bear the cost of preventing and correcting nutrient loading, and whether the tools for correction are adequate are among the issues being discussed. How these issues are resolved will have important implications for agriculture, which has taken a keen interest in water quality policy and legislation."
