During the first 11 fiscal years(FY1989-FY1999), when assistance totaled just over $1 billion,the annual levels were considerably lower than during the past three fiscal years and the current fiscal year. FromFY2000-FY2003, assistance totals about $2,556billion. The Clinton Administration increased assistance in FY2000 to fund its \"Plan Colombia\" programs tocounter the spread of coca cultivation in southernColombia. The Bush Administration has continued \"Plan Colombia\" programs through its Andean Regional Initiative(ARI), which also provides increased funding forColombia's neighbors. In FY2002, President Bush also sought authority to expand the circumstances under whichfunding for the Colombian security forces can beused. As approved by Congress in 2002 and 2003, funding for FY2003 and previous years can be used forcounternarcotics and anti-terrorist purposes.
