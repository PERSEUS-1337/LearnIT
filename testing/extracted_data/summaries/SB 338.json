    "title": "An act to amend Section 368 of the Penal Code, relating to elder abuse.",
    "content": "Existing law provides that a person who knows or reasonably should know that the victim is an elder or dependent adult, and under circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death, willfully causes or permits the victim to suffer unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering, is punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by a fine not to exceed $6,000, or by both that fine and imprisonment, or by imprisonment in the state prison for 2, 3, or 4 years. This bill would provide that a person who knows or reasonably should know that the victim is an elder or dependent adult, and under circumstances or conditions likely to produce significant or substantial mental suffering, willfully causes or permits the victim to suffer unjustifiable mental suffering, is punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by a fine not to exceed $6,000, or by both that fine and imprisonment, or by imprisonment in the state prison for 2, 3, or 4 years. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
