    "content": "Media Violence Labeling Act of 1999 - Amends the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act to state that it is the policy of Congress to provide for the establishment, use, and enforcement of a consistent and comprehensive system for labeling violent content in audio and visual media products, including with regard to the appropriateness of such products for minors. Authorizes manufacturers and producers of interactive video game products and services, video program products, motion picture products, and sound recording products (products) to submit to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) a joint proposal for a system for labeling the violent content of such products. Outlines labeling system requirements, including that: (1) such product shall specify a minimum age for purchase and viewing. And (2) the label should appear conspicuously on the product. Requires the FTC to review any proposal that is submitted by such manufacturers and producers within 180 days after the enactment of this Act to determine if it meets such requirements. Requires the FTC to issue a labeling system within 180 days after commencing a review of such proposal. Directs the FTC to establish its own labeling system if a proposal is not submitted. Prohibits a person from manufacturing or producing such a product unless it bears a label meeting requirements of this Act. Prohibits a person, from the same date, from selling such product to an individual whose age is less than the minimum age specified under the labeling system. Empowers the FTC to investigate allegations of violations of this Act. Provides civil penalties for violations. Renames the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act as the Federal Cigarette and Media Violence Labeling and Advertising Act."
