    "title": "An act to\namend Section 34 of\nadd Section 39 to\nthe Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation.",
    "content": "Existing law imposes various taxes that are administered by the Franchise Tax Board, the State Board of Equalization, and the Employment Development Department. This bill would require, on or before January 1, 2017, the State Board of Equalization, the Franchise Tax Board, and the Employment Development Department to collaborate and focus the agencies\u2019 current and future information technology efforts to conduct a feasibility study on the development of a single Internet Web site portal that virtually consolidates the agencies to enable online, self-service access to the agencies, as provided, and to submit the study to the Legislature. The bill would also require these agencies, upon a joint determination by the agencies that a need exists to improve cost-effective services to taxpayers and an appropriation by the Legislature, to consolidate forms, applications, and other documents to reduce or eliminate the number of multiple submissions of the same information by taxpayers. Under existing law, whenever an amount of money paid by a person to the state includes a sum that can be identified as intended as payment of a locally administered tax that should have been paid directly to a local government within the state, the state is authorized to pay the amount to the local government and notify the payor of its action. However, existing law prohibits this procedure from being followed unless the governing body of the local government has, by resolution, agreed with respect to those payments that a timely payment received by the state will be regarded as a timely payment to the local government concerned, as provided. This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to those provisions."
