    "title": "AB 318",
    "content": "Existing law requires a person who finds and takes possession of property that is lost to try and return it to the rightful owner. If the owner of the lost property cannot be determined and the item is worth $100 or more, the finder is required to turn the item over to the police or sheriff, as specified. Existing law provides 90 days for the owner to return and claim the property and to pay any reasonable fee for its bailment. Existing law requires, if the reported value of the property is $250 or more and the owner does not return and claim the property, the police or the sheriff to cause notice of the property to be published, as provided. This bill, until December 31, 2020, would provide that if that lost property is found on a vehicle of public conveyance or on public transit property, that it instead be turned in to the public transit agency, and would provide 90 days for the owner to return and claim the property, as specified. The bill, until December 31, 2020, also would require the public transit agency to cause notice of the property to be published under the circumstances described above. The bill, until January 1, 2021, would require specified authorize a transit agency to utilize alternate unclaimed property procedures to be followed with respect to lost or unclaimed bicycles turned in to or held by a that public transit agency. Because this bill would impose new requirements on local transportation agencies, it would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
