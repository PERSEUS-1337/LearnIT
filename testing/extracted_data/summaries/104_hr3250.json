    "content": "National Discovery Trails Act of 1996 - Amends the National Trails System Act to provide that national discovery trails established under the Act shall be components of the National Trails System. Provides that such trails shall be extended, continuous interstate trails located so as to provide for outdoor recreation and travel and to connect representative examples of America's trails and communities. Designates the 6,000-mile American Discovery Trail as a national discovery trail. Provides that the Trail shall extend from Cape Henlopen State Park in Delaware to Point Reyes National Seashore in California, traveling northern and southern routes from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Denver, Colorado. Exempts the Trail from comprehensive national scenic trail plan requirements under the Act, but requires the Secretary of the Interior to enter into arrangements with a nonprofit organization to submit to specified congressional committees, within three fiscal years after this Act's enactment, a comprehensive plan for the protection, management, development, and use of the Trail."
