    "content": "Congress agreed to a 1.2% increase in its budget authority for FY2005, appropriating $3.57 million, subject to a 0.80% rescission. Although legislative branch agencies requested an overall12.5% increase, the chairmen and some members of the House and Senate Subcommittees onLegislative Branch indicated early in budget discussions the probability of a fairly flat FY2005budget. Subsequently, during markup the House and Senate Committees on Appropriationsapproved a freeze on FY2005 legislative branch budget authority. The House bill ( H.R. 4755 ) contained a -0.1% change from FY2004, excluding Senate items; the Senate's version of H.R. 4755 , amended to contain the language of S. 2666 , contained a+0.33% change, excluding House items. Both bills fell below the 1.3% increase agreed to earlierthis year by the House and Senate for discretionary agencies and programs under jurisdictions of theHouse and Senate Subcommittees on Legislative Branch. Among elements under considerationduring discussions on the FY2005 budget were impact of a flat budget funded at the FY2004 level with additional appropriations to pay for mandatory expenses (annual salary increases and related increasedpersonnel costs), and for costs of goods and services increased due toinflation; impact of a budget funded at the FY2004 level with no additional funds formandatory expenses and inflationary increases; impact of a tight budget on funding to equip and startup the Capitol Visitors'Center (CVC) (the House bill did not contain funds, while the Senate bill contained $7.6 million;conferees authorized a transfer up to $10.6 million to the CVC; impact of funding restrictions on implementation of additional securityenhancements within and around the Capitol complex, including funding for the CapitolPolice; elimination of the Joint Economic Committee (proposed but postponed inHouse Subcommittee markup; not considered in full committee markup); authorization for the Government Accountability Office (GAO), formerlynamed the General Accounting Office, to study statutory jurisdictions of the joint economic andtaxation committees to determine possible overlap (included in the House bill, but specifically notsupported in the Senate bill); elimination of the Capitol Hill mounted police force (adopted during HouseSubcommittee markup, but supported in Senate report language); and extension of dental and vision benefits to Members and House employees(proposed for employees but postponed during House Subcommittee markup); considered and agreedto in full committee markup (applicable to both employees and Members).
