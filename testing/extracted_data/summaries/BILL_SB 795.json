    "title": "SB 795",
    "content": "Existing law, when a person is arrested without a warrant, requires the person, if not otherwise released and without unnecessary delay, to be taken before the nearest or most accessible magistrate in the county in which the offense is triable, unless certain exemptions apply, including that the person was arrested for intoxication only and no further proceedings are desirable. This bill would exempt a person from the requirement of, without unnecessary delay, being taken before the nearest or most accessible magistrate in the county in which the offense is triable if the person is arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and the person is delivered to a hospital for medical treatment that prohibits immediate delivery before a magistrate. Existing law requires the Department of Parks and Recreation to protect the state park system and the state vehicular recreation area and trail system from damage and to preserve the peace therein. Existing law provides that a person who violates the rules and regulations established by the department is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished by imprisonment, as specified, except that at the time a particular action is commenced, the judge may, considering the recommendation of the prosecuting attorney, reduce the charged offense from a misdemeanor to an infraction. Existing law also requires that a person who is convicted of the offense after that reduction be punished by a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $1,000. This bill would instead make a person who violates those rules and regulations guilty of either a misdemeanor, punishable as provided under existing law, or an infraction, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000. The bill would delete the mandatory minimum fine. Existing law, the Interstate Compact for Juveniles, adopted by this state and effective until January 1, 2016, establishes an interstate commission of the compacting states to, among other things, oversee, supervise, and coordinate the interstate movement of juveniles. This bill would delete the repeal date of these provisions, and would thereby extend the operation of the provisions indefinitely. This bill would make other technical, nonsubstantive changes."
