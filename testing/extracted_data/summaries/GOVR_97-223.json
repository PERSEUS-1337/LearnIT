    "content": "Permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) authorize various types of development projects in wetlands and other waters of the United States. The Corps' regulatory process involves two types of permits: general permits for actions by private landowners that are similar in nature and will likely have a minor effect on jurisdictional waters and wetlands, and individual permits for more significant actions. The Corps uses general permits to minimize the burden of its regulatory program: general permits authorize landowners to proceed with a project without the more time-consuming need to obtain standard individual permits in advance. More than 97% of the Corps' regulatory workload is processed in the form of general permits. Nationwide permits are one type of general permit. Nationwide permits, which number 52, are issued for five-year periods and thereafter must be renewed. They were previously reissued in total in March 2012. In advance of their scheduled expiration in March 2017, the Corps reissued the 2012 permits, with some revisions and modifications, in January 2017. The current nationwide permit program has received criticism from multiple stakeholders and has few strong supporters, for differing reasons. Developers and other industry groups say that it is too complex and burdened with arbitrary restrictions that limit opportunities for an efficient permitting process and have little environmental benefit. Environmentalists say that it does not adequately protect aquatic resources, because the review procedures and permit requirements are less rigorous than those for individual permits and because the Corps fails to adequately track impacts on aquatic resources. At issue is whether the program has become so complex and expansive that it cannot either protect aquatic resources or provide for a fair regulatory system, which are its dual objectives. Controversies also exist about the use of specific nationwide permits for authorizing particular types of activities, such as pipeline and utility line projects and surface coal mining operations. In addition to general objections, interest groups have a number of specific criticisms of the permit program, such as requirements that there must be compensatory mitigation for impacts of some authorized activities and impacts of regional conditioning through which local aquatic considerations are addressed. Coordinating implementation of the nationwide permits between federal, state, and tribal governments also raises a number of issues. Of particular concern to states is tension over whether their authority to certify the nationwide permits is sufficient to assure that state water quality standards or coastal zone management plans will not be violated. Whether the Corps adequately ensures protection of endangered or threatened species and critical habitat is an issue of concern to some stakeholders. It has been more than 15 years since Congress examined the nationwide permit program in oversight hearings or in connection with bills to fund the Corps' regulatory program. While the Obama Administration's initiatives concerning some activities that are authorized by nationwide permits drew congressional attention and criticism\u2014such as initiatives concerning surface coal mining activities in Appalachia\u2014that attention has not extended to oversight of the Corps' regulatory program generally. The nationwide permit program has continued to evolve and to generate wide-ranging concerns among stakeholder and interest groups. Recent controversies about the Corps' use of nationwide permits to authorize large pipeline and utility line projects could lead to greater congressional interest in the program."
