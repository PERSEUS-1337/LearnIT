    "content": "Ovarian Cancer Biomarker Research Act of 2009 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Director of the National Cancer Institute to enter into cooperative agreements with, or make grants to, public or nonprofit entities to establish and operate Ovarian Cancer Biomarker Centers of Excellence to conduct research on biomarkers for use in risk stratification for, and the early detection and screening of, ovarian cancer. Permits federal funds to be used for research on: (1) the development and characterization of new biomarkers and the refinement of existing biomarkers, for ovarian cancer, (2) the clinical and laboratory validation of such biomarkers. (3) the development and implementation of clinical and epidemiological research on the utilization of such biomarkers. And (4) the development and implementation of repositories for new tissue, urine, serum, and other biological specimens. Requires the Director to: (1) make available for research banked serum and tissue specimens from clinical research regarding ovarian cancer that was funded by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). And (2) establish an Ovarian Cancer Biomarker Clinical Trial Committee to assist in designing and implementing national clinical trials to determine the utility of using such biomarkers. Requires a national data center to be established in and supported by the Institute to conduct statistical analyses of trial data, and to store such analyses and data. Requires such data and statistical analyses to be used to establish clinical guidelines to provide the medical community with information regarding the use of validated biomarkers."
