    "title": "A bill to prevent and punish counterfeiting and copyright piracy, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "Anticounterfeiting Act of 2004 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit trafficking in an illicit authentication feature. Defines that term to mean an authentication feature that: (1) has been tampered with or altered without authorization so as to facilitate the reproduction or distribution of a phono-record, a copy of a computer program, motion picture or other audiovisual work, or documentation or packaging, in violation of the rights of the copyright owner. (2) is genuine, but has been distributed or is intended for distribution without authorization. Or (3) appears to be genuine but is not. Authorizes a copyright owner who is injured by a violation of this Act or is threatened with injury to bring a civil action in an appropriate US district court. Allows the court to: (1) grant temporary or permanent injunctions to prevent or restrain violations. (2) order the impounding of an article in the custody or control of the alleged violator that the court has reasonable cause to believe was involved in a violation. And (3) award to the injured party reasonable attorney fees and costs, actual damages and any additional profits of the violator, or statutory damages. Authorizes: (1) the injured party to elect to recover, instead of actual damages and profits, an award of statutory damages of between $2,500 and $25,000 for each violation. And (2) the court to increase a damage award by three times the amount that would otherwise be awarded upon finding that a person has violated this Act within three years after a final judgment was entered for a previous violation. Sets a three-year statute of limitations from discovery of the violation."
