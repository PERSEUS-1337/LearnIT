    "content": "Professional Sports Antitrust Clarification Act of 1996 - Permits a professional sports league or its member franchises to establish and enforce rules and procedures for deciding whether a member franchise may change its home territory, notwithstanding the antitrust laws. Specifies requirements for antitrust protection, including that the league promote comparable economic opportunities by sharing revenue among member franchises to account for disparities in revenue or savings due to public benefits and subsidies. Requires such franchise relocation rules and procedures to provide for consideration of various factors to protect the public interest, including: (1) fan support, (2) the extent of public financial support received, (3) the effect on existing contracts, (4) the extent of any net operating losses. And (5) any bona fide offer to purchase the franchise and keep it in its home territory. Provides for judicial review in actions challenging establishment or enforcement of such rules and procedures."
