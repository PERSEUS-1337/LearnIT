    "content": "Drug compounding is a process by which a pharmacist or physician combines, mixes, or alters various drug ingredients to create a drug to meet the unique needs of an individual patient for whom an approved drug may not be appropriate (e.g., due to an allergy to a dye in the product). The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) authorizes the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate the manufacturing and sale of drugs in the United States, including compounded drugs. Generally, a drug may not be sold unless the FDA, through its drug approval process, has determined that the drug is safe and effective for its intended use. Although compounded drugs are considered new drugs, it would not be practicable for pharmacies to obtain FDA approval for each drug compounded for an individual patient. Thus, compounded drugs are not evaluated by FDA prior to marketing for safety, effectiveness, or quality. In 1997, Congress passed the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA, P.L. 105-115), which attempted to clarify FDA's authority to regulate compounded drugs. The act set forth, in a new FFDCA Section 503A, the conditions that must be met for a compounded drug to be exempt from certain statutory requirements related to new drug approval. Following the 2012 fungal meningitis outbreak and a series of adverse event reports and quality problems linked to compounding facilities, Congress passed the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA, P.L. 113-54). Title I of the DQSA, the Compounding Quality Act (CQA), created a new category of drug compounders called outsourcing facilities, a term that describes entities that compound drugs in circumstances that go beyond what 503A compounding pharmacies are allowed to do (i.e., compounding drugs in bulk for use in hospitals and other facilities, referred to as \"office-use\"). Since the enactment of the CQA, FDA has issued various guidance documents to facilitate implementation of the law and a draft memorandum of understanding (MOU) addressing the interstate distribution of certain compounded drug products. FDA has also increased its enforcement efforts with respect to compounding, conducting over 400 inspections of drug compounders, issuing over 150 warning letters, and overseeing 120 recalls involving compounded drugs. Additionally, FDA has communicated with stakeholders and state regulators via listening sessions, meetings, and information posted on the FDA website. Some stakeholders have found FDA guidance and communication to be helpful; others have reported communication challenges and disagreement with the agency's interpretation of the statutory provisions. These reported challenges have resulted in certain actions by some in Congress, including letters to FDA, report directives, and the introduction of legislation that would amend certain compounding provisions in the FFDCA. In working to address the issues raised by stakeholders and maintain public health protections, policymakers may consider issues such as patient access, drug quality, and the necessity of compounded drugs. For patients with a legitimate medical need, preserving timely access to compounded medications has been identified as a concern by supporters of office-use compounding. However, in the context of patient safety, drug quality is also a consideration. Compounded drugs are not evaluated by FDA prior to marketing, and pharmacies that compound pursuant to FFDCA Section 503A are not required to register with FDA or report adverse events to the agency. For these reasons, among others, FDA maintains that compounded drugs pose a higher risk than FDA-approved drugs. A third consideration is necessity, specifically whether pharmacies need to compound for office-use. If a hospital, clinic, or health care practitioner wants to keep compounded drugs in stock for office-use, these entities can generally obtain non-patient-specific compounded products from outsourcing facilities that are registered with FDA and subject to more stringent regulatory requirements."
