    "content": "The Department of Transportation (DOT) is funded through annual appropriations acts. ForFY2006, the Administration requested $58.3 billion for the Department of Transportation. This is$1.4 billion (2%) less than the $59.7 billion provided for FY2005. The major proposed reductionswere the Administration's zeroing out of Amtrak (down from $1.2 billion in FY2005) and areduction in funding for the Airport Improvement Program (to $3.0 billion, $500 million (14%)below FY2005's $3.5 billion). The FY2006 budget also reflected a statutory change to one of the DOT's operatingadministrations. The Norman Y. Mineta Research and Special Programs Improvement Act ( P.L.108-426 ; 118 Stat. 2423) created two new operating administrations in place of the former Researchand Special Programs Administration (RSPA): the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials SafetyAdministration (PHMSA) and the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA). On June 30, 2005, the House passed H.R. 3058 , the FY2006 appropriations billfunding the Department of Transportation (and several other agencies). The House provided $63.5billion for the Department, $3.7 billion over FY2005's enacted level and $5.2 billion over theAdministration request. The bill increased funding (beyond the requested levels) for the FederalAviation Administration, the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Transit Administration,and Amtrak. The House approved two amendments relating to Amtrak; one added $626 million tothe $550 million recommended by the House Committee on Appropriations, bringing Amtrak'sFY2006 funding to $1.2 billion; the other eliminated the prohibition on federal funding for routeswith a per-passenger subsidy of $30 or more proposed by the Appropriations Committee. On October 20, 2005, the Senate passed its version of H.R. 3058 . The Senateprovided $64.2 billion for the Department of Transportation, $4.3 billion over FY2005 and $770million over the House-passed figure. The Senate bill provided more funding than the Houseapproved for highway programs and Amtrak, and less for aviation and transit programs. The Senatealso passed several provisions affecting Amtrak operations. The conference version of H.R. 3058 was passed by Congress on November 18,2005; the President signed the bill into law on November 30, 2005 ( P.L. 109-115 ). The conferencebill provided $60.7 billion for the Department of Transportation, less than either the House or Senateversion, but $1.0 billion over FY2005 funding and $2.4 billion more than requested. On December30, 2005, the President signed the FY2006 Department of Defense appropriations bill ( P.L.109-148 ), which included a one percent across-the-board rescission of non-emergency federaldiscretionary funding for FY2006 and $2.8 billion in supplemental funding to DOT for response tothe consequences of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma.
