    "content": "The Older Americans Act (OAA) is the major vehicle for the delivery of social and nutrition services for older persons. Originally enacted in 1965, the act supports a wide range of social services and programs for older persons. Authorization of appropriations expired at the end of FY2005. The Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006 (P.L. 109-365) reauthorized all programs under the act through FY2011. The major program under the act, Title III\u2014Grants for State and Community Programs on Aging\u2014authorizes grants to 56 state and 655 area agencies on aging to act as advocates on behalf of, and to coordinate programs for, older persons. Title III accounted for 70% of the act's total FY2006 appropriations ($1.24 billion out of $1.78 billion). States receive separate allotments of funds for supportive services and centers, family caregiver support, congregate and home-delivered nutrition services, the nutrition services incentive grant program, and disease prevention and health promotion services. Title V\u2014Community Service Senior Opportunities Act\u2014is the only federally subsidized employment program for low-income older persons. It represented almost one-quarter of the act's total funding in FY2006 ($432.3 million). P.L. 109-365 added requirements that state and area agencies on aging focus programs and services on specific groups of older people, including those at risk for institutional care and those with limited English proficiency. The law also added requirements that the Administration on Aging (AoA) and state and area agencies focus efforts on the promotion of home and community-based long-term care services for older people to prevent or delay the need for institutional care. The law also revised the formula for distribution of Title III grants to require that states receive at least as much as they received in FY2006 (a 2006 \"hold harmless\" level), and to gradually eliminate a \"guaranteed growth\" provision. The new law added responsibility for AoA to develop and implement systems for elder justice and to conduct an elder abuse national incidence study. It also added authority for competitive grants to states for elder justice activities under Title VII. In addition, the law authorized the Assistant Secretary on Aging to conduct several new research and demonstration programs, including model projects to assist older people \"age in place\"(including in Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities, or NORCs); and to develop systems for mental health screening and treatment for older people. P.L. 109-365 maintained the Title V program focus on employing older people in community service jobs, but it also revised the program to place more emphasis on training eligible older individuals. The new law required the Secretary of Labor to conduct a national competition for Title V funds every four years. For FY2006, the act's programs received $1.78 billion, a 2% decrease from the FY2005 level. Figure 1 shows the distribution of FY2006 funding by program.
