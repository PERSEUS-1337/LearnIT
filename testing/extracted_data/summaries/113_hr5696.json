    "content": "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act - Amends the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 to direct the Secretary of State to report to Congress on conditions in Hong Kong that are of US interest by March 31, 2015, and annually thereafter for 10 years or until the Secretary certifies that Hong Kong has held free and fair elections for 2 consecutive Chief Executive and 2 consecutive Legislative Council periods. States that it is US policy to: reaffirm the principles set forth in the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, support the democratic aspirations of the people of Hong Kong, urge China's government to uphold its commitments to Hong Kong. Support the establishment by 2017 of a democratic option to nominate and elect the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, and the establishment by 2020 of democratic elections for all members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council. And support freedom of the press. States that Hong Kong is ineligible for treatment different from that accorded to China under US laws or agreements unless the President certifies to Congress that Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous to justify different treatment. Authorizes the President to waive such ineligibility if waiver is in the US national interest and Congress is given a justification of the waiver on or before the date it takes effect."
