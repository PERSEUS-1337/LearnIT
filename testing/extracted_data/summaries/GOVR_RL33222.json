For general information on Israel, see CRS Report RL33476, Israel: Background and U.S. Relations, by [author name scrubbed]. Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign assistance since World War II. To date, the United States has provided Israel $134.7 billion (current, or noninflation-adjusted, dollars) in bilateral assistance and missile defense funding. Almost all U.S. bilateral aid to Israel is in the form of military assistance, although in the past Israel also received significant economic assistance. At a signing ceremony at the State Department on September 14, 2016, representatives of the U.S. and Israeli governments signed a new 10-year Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on military aid covering FY2019 to FY2028. Under the terms of the MOU, the United States pledges to provide $38 billion in military aid ($33 billion in Foreign Military Financing grants plus $5 billion in missile defense appropriations) to Israel. This MOU replaces a previous $30 billion 10-year agreement, which runs through FY2018. Israel is the first international operator of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Department of Defense's fifth-generation stealth aircraft, considered to be the most technologically advanced fighter jet ever made. To date, Israel has purchased 50 F-35s in three separate contracts. P.L. 115-141, the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act, provides the following for Israel: $3.1 billion in Foreign Military Financing, of which $815.3 million is for off-shore procurement; $705.8 million for joint U.S.-Israeli missile defense projects, including $92 million for Iron Dome, $221.5 million for David's Sling, $310 million for Arrow 3, and $82.3 million for Arrow 2; $47.5 million for the U.S.-Israeli anti-tunnel cooperation program; $7.5 million in Migration and Refugee Assistance; $4 million for the establishment of a U.S.-Israel Center of Excellence in energy and water technologies; $2 million for the Israel-U.S. Binational Research & Development Foundation (BIRD) Energy program; and The reauthorization of War Reserves Stock Allies-Israel (WRSA-I) program through fiscal year 2019. For FY2019, the Trump Administration is requesting $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing for Israel and $500 million in missile defense aid to mark the first year of the new MOU. The Administration also is seeking $5.5 million in Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) funding for humanitarian migrants to Israel."
