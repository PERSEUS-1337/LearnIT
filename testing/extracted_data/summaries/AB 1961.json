    "title": "An act to amend Section 69432 of the Education Code, relating to student financial aid.",
    "content": "Existing law, known as the Ortiz-Pacheco-Poochigian-Vasconcellos Cal Grant Program, establishes the Cal Grant A and B entitlement awards, the California Community College Transfer Entitlement awards, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B awards, the Cal Grant C awards, and the Cal Grant T awards under the administration of the Student Aid Commission, and establishes eligibility requirements for awards under these programs for participating students attending qualifying institutions. Existing law establishes the maximum tuition award amount for each Cal Grant A and B award for new recipient students attending private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions at $9,084 for the 2015\u201316 and 2016\u201317 award years and $8,056 for the 2017\u201318 award year and each award year thereafter. Existing law also establishes these amounts as the maximum tuition award amounts for new recipients attending private for-profit postsecondary educational institutions that are accredited, as specified. This bill would instead increase the maximum tuition award amount for Cal Grant A and B awards for new recipients at private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions to no less than $10,000 for the 2017\u201318 award year and each award year thereafter. For these award years, the maximum tuition award amounts would remain at $8,056 for new recipients attending accredited private for-profit postsecondary educational institutions as referred to above. The bill would impose requirements on private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions to provide specified data to a specified association as a condition for the funding of Cal Grant awards to their students and would require the association to report on that information to the Legislature, the Governor, the Department of Finance, and the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office."
