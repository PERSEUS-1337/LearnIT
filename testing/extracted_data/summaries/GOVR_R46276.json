    "content": "In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, on March 13, 2020, the Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a national emergency declaration to exempt from the Hours of Service (HOS) rule through April 12, 2020, commercial drivers providing direct assistance in support of relief efforts related to the virus. This includes transport of certain supplies and equipment, as well as personnel. Drivers are still required to have at least 10 consecutive hours off duty (eight hours if transporting passengers) before returning to duty. It has been estimated that up to 20% of bus and large truck crashes in the United States involve fatigued drivers. In order to promote safety by reducing the incidence of fatigue among commercial drivers, federal law limits the number of hours a driver can drive through the HOS rule. Currently the HOS rule allows truck drivers to work up to 14 hours a day, during which time they can drive up to 11 hours, followed by at least 10 hours off duty before coming on duty again; also, within the first 8 hours on duty drivers must take a 30-minute break in order to continue driving beyond 8 hours. Bus drivers transporting passengers have slightly different limits. Approximately 3 million drivers are subject to the federal HOS rule. For decades, drivers recorded their service hours in paper log books. This method made violations of the HOS rule easy to hide. Since many drivers are paid by the mile, some drivers violated the HOS rule in order to drive longer and make more money. Some drivers said they had to violate the rule to meet the schedules imposed on them by dispatchers. There were concerns about the safety impacts of having drivers become even more fatigued by driving longer than the maximum times allowed by the HOS rule. In an effort to improve compliance with the HOS rule, in 2012 Congress mandated that trucks be equipped with electronic logging devices (ELDs), hardware devices that are connected to the truck engine to record driving time and transmit it during roadside inspections. In 2015, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) finalized regulations to implement that mandate. The mandate took effect in December 2017. FMCSA determined that the mandatory use of ELDs would improve highway safety, and could improve driver health if drivers take advantage of the rest periods mandated under the regulations to get adequate sleep. Since the ELD mandate went into effect, certain sectors of the commercial trucking industry have raised concerns about its impact. Since the ELD mandate did not change the HOS rule, but made it harder to evade the HOS limits without being detected, those concerns suggest that some operators may have routinely been out of compliance with the HOS rule. One sector that has been particularly critical of the improved enforcement of the HOS limits is the livestock hauling industry. The industry's business model has evolved to depend on hauling livestock long distances from around the nation to feedlots and slaughterhouses located mostly in the central states, and each stop along the way poses hazards to the livestock. Congress has repeatedly provided temporary waivers from the ELD mandate for livestock haulers, pending proposed revisions of the HOS rule by FMCSA. Currently the agency is prohibited from using federal funding to enforce the HOS rule against livestock haulers until September 30, 2020. The use of ELDs may help to quantify a challenge faced by drivers: inroads into their driving time caused by delays in loading and unloading their cargo by shippers and receivers. Drivers are typically paid by the mile, and by one estimate this unpaid \"driver detention time\" costs drivers $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion a year (an average of $1,300 to $1,500 per driver). This detention time is also estimated to increase the risk of crashes due in part to encouraging drivers to speed to make up for mileage that otherwise could not be driven during the allowable work time because of detention time. As the ELD mandate has been in effect for two years now, some impacts are starting to come into focus. An array of ELDs are now offered, some at prices below FMCSA's initial estimates. The impact of improved enforcement on industry activity and truck safety is not yet clear. Legislation is being proposed to help address the shortage of parking spots for truck drivers that can make it difficult to find a safe place to stop when they reach their HOS time limit. FMCSA has proposed a set of relatively minor changes to the HOS rule to, in the agency's words, increase safety while providing flexibility to drivers."
