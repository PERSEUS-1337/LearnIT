    "content": "Consumers Payment System Protection Act - Delays until one year after enactment of this Act any proposed or final rule issued under the authority of specified requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act governing interchange transaction (swipe) fees for electronic debit transactions (EDTs). Requires the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and specified federal banking agencies jointly to study and report to Congress on the effect of such requirements upon consumers, card issuers, merchants, and financial institutions. Sets a deadline for the Board to make revisions to any proposed or final rule regarding such EDTs if at least two of the agencies contributing to such report determine that any one of the following is true: (1) either such requirements or the Board's proposed rule entitled Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing does not encompass all costs and investments associated with debit card transactions. (2) consumers will be adversely affected by either the requirements or the proposed rule. Or (3) the current exemption of small financial institutions from such requirements, or as carried out by the proposed rule, is not effective in practice."
