    "content": "The development of offshore oil, gas, and other mineral resources in the United States is impacted by a number of interrelated legal regimes, including international, federal, and state laws. International law provides a framework for establishing national ownership or control of offshore areas, and domestic federal law mirrors and supplements these standards. Governance of offshore minerals and regulation of development activities are bifurcated between state and federal law. Generally, states have primary authority in the area extending three geographical miles from their coasts. The federal government and its comprehensive regulatory regime govern minerals located under federal waters, which extend from the states' offshore boundaries to at least 200 nautical miles from the shore. The basis for most federal regulation is the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), which provides a system for offshore oil and gas exploration, leasing, and ultimate development. Regulations run the gamut from health, safety, resource conservation, and environmental standards to requirements for production-based royalties and, in some cases, royalty relief and other development incentives. The five-year program for offshore leasing for 2017-2022 adopted by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management focuses only on new exploration and production in the Gulf of Mexico and the Cook Inlet off the coast of Alaska. However, the Trump Administration has published a 2019-2024 Draft Proposed Plan that would supersede the 2017-2022 Program. Congress is also free to alter the scope of offshore oil and gas exploration and production contemplated by the 2017-2022 Program via new legislation. In addition to legislative and regulatory efforts, there has also been significant litigation related to offshore oil and gas development. Over a number of years, courts have clarified the extent of the Secretary of the Interior's discretion over how leasing and development are conducted."
