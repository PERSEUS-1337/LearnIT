    "content": "Ninety-seven major military bases were recommended for closure and realignment by the 1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995 base realignment and closure (BRAC) commissions. Action on all 451installations (major and minor) from the first four rounds was completed by the end of FY2001, asscheduled. The U.S. General Accounting Office has estimated that these closures and realignmentsproduced net savings of about $16.7 billion as of the end of FY2001 and will continue to producean estimated annual recurring savings thereafter of about $6.6 billion. In mid-1997, Secretary of Defense William Cohen called for two new rounds of base closures and realignments. He explained that, while four previous rounds had achieved significant savings,it was important to continue the process of closing underutilized facilities. Despite DOD pressure,most Members of Congress were reluctant to support authorization of new base closure legislation,at least for the foreseeable future. The reasons given included, among others, grass-roots oppositionfrom communities likely to be affected and President Clinton's \"intervention\" in the 1995 baseclosure commission's recommendations regarding McClellan and Kelly air force bases. Of the twochambers, the House of Representatives expressed the stronger and more united opposition. In theSenate, proponents of new base closure rounds have attempted to attach amendments to each year'sdefense authorization bill since 1997, achieving success only toward the end of 2001. The principal advocates in Congress for new base closures have been Senator John McCain and Senator Carl Levin. On February 27, 2001, they introduced legislation ( S. 397 ) toauthorize two new closure rounds in 2003 and 2005. On August 3, 2001, the Secretary of Defensesubmitted his own proposal to Congress, calling for one additional round in 2003. On September6, 2001, the Senate's defense panel incorporated elements of both proposals and passed the measureby a vote of 17 to 8. Later, in Senate floor debate (September 24, 2001), the Levin/McCain initiativepassed by a margin of 53 to 47. However, many Members of the House were reluctant to support S. 397 , thus creating an impasse in the conference phase that delayed final passage of the FY2002 defenselegislation. Finally, on December 12, 2001, the conferees reached a compromise. They agreed toauthorize one new round of base closures in 2005. They also added language that revised variousaspects of previous base closure law -- the most notable of which, perhaps, will be the enhancedrole and influence of the Secretary of Defense in the base closure selection process. President Bushsigned the defense authorization bill into law ( P.L. 107-107 ) on December 28, 2001. This report will be updated as warranted."
