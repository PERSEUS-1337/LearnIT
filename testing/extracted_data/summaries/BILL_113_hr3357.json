    "content": "Early Childhood Education Professional Improvement Act of 2013 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to states to: provide scholarships that enable preschool teachers employed in an early childhood education program to pursue a bachelor's degree in early childhood education or a closely related field. Support preschool teachers employed in an early childhood education program to attain a credential, licensure, or endorsement that demonstrates competence in early childhood education if their bachelor's degree is not in that or a closely related field. Increase the compensation of teachers who are making progress toward a degree in early childhood education or who have attained that degree. And provide ongoing professional development opportunities to preschool teachers and teacher assistants employed in an early childhood education program. Requires each state that desires a grant to include a description of its comprehensive early childhood professional development system in its application. Requires grant recipients to maintain their fiscal effort for the activities supported by the grant funds for a fiscal year at levels equal to or greater than their fiscal effort for such activities during the preceding fiscal year."
