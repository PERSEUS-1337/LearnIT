    "content": "Construction Reform, Authorization, and Choice Improvement Act of 2015 This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to: (1) enter into an agreement with an appropriate non-VA entity to provide full project management services for a super construction project. And (2) use industry standards, standard designs, and best practices in carrying out medical facility construction. A super construction project is one for the construction, alteration, or acquisition of a medical facility involving a total expenditure of more than $100 million . The VA is prohibited from: obligating or expending funds for advance planning or design for any super construction project until 60 days after congressional notification, obligating funds for a major medical facility project or a super construction project by more than 10 of the amount approved by law unless certain congressional committees each approve the obligation, and using bid savings amounts or funds for other than their original purpose before 30 days after notifying such committees unless each committee approves the obligation. The VA must complete a master plan for each VA medical facility meeting specified requirements to inform investment decisions and funding requests over a 10-year period for construction projects at the facility. The 40-mile distance requirement for a veteran to use a non-VA medical facility under the veterans choice program of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 means 40 miles calculated on the basis of distance traveled. The VA may carry out the following major medical facility projects in FY2015 : construction of a community living center, outpatient clinic, renovated domiciliary, and renovation of existing buildings in Canandaigua, New York. Seismic corrections to the mental health and community living center in Long Beach, California, seismic correction of 12 buildings in West Los Angeles, California. And construction of a spinal cord injury building and seismic corrections in San Diego, California. VA authority to make medical services and hospital care available for eligible veterans through agreements with non-VA entities shall now be permanent. The sense of Congress regarding the Veterans Choice Fund is revised."
