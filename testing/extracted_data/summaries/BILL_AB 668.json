    "title": "AB 668",
    "content": "Existing law requires the county assessor to consider, when valuing real property for property taxation purposes, the effect of any enforceable restrictions to which the use of the land may be subjected. Under existing law these restrictions include, but are not limited to, zoning, recorded contracts with governmental agencies, and various other restrictions imposed by governments. Existing property tax law establishes a welfare exemption under which property is exempt from taxation if, among other things, that property is used exclusively for religious, hospital, scientific, or charitable purposes and is owned and operated by an entity, as provided, that is itself organized and operated for those purposes. Under existing property tax law, the welfare exemption applies to property that is owned and operated by a nonprofit corporation, otherwise qualifying for the welfare exemption, that is organized and operated for the purpose of building and rehabilitating single-family or multifamily residences for sale, as provided, at cost to low-income families. This bill would require the county assessor to consider, when valuing real property for property taxation purposes, a recorded contract with a nonprofit corporation that meets prescribed requirements, including requirements that the nonprofit corporation has received a welfare exemption for properties intended to be sold to low-income families who participate in a special no-interest loan program, and that the contract includes a restriction on the use of the land for at least 30 years to owner-occupied housing available at affordable housing cost. By changing the manner in which county assessors assess property for property taxation purposes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. This bill would incorporate amendments to Section 402.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code proposed by AB 1251, to be operative only if AB 1251 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, and this bill is chaptered last. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
