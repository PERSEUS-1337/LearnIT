    "title": "SB 938",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes a conservator to place a conservatee in a secured perimeter residential care facility for the elderly, as specified, or to authorize the administration of certain prescribed medications upon a court\u2019s finding that among other things, the conservatee has dementia and a functional impairment. Existing law requires certain findings to be made by the court for each type of authority sought by the conservator and requires a petition for authority to be supported by a declaration of a licensed physician or psychologist, as specified, regarding these findings. This bill would replace references to the term dementia in these provisions with major neurocognitive disorders (MNCDs), as defined. The bill would require a petition requesting the authority to administer psychotropic medications, as defined, to be supported by a declaration of a physician that includes specified information, including, among other things, the recommended course of medication, the expected effects of the recommended medication on the conservatee\u2019s overall mental health and treatment plan, including how the medication is expected to improve the conservatee\u2019s symptoms, and a description of the potential side effects of the recommended medication. The bill would revise the court findings required for placement in a secured perimeter facility. The bill would require the Judicial Council, on or before July 1, 2017, to adopt rules of court and develop appropriate forms for the implementation of these provisions, as specified. The bill would make related changes and additional findings and declarations of the Legislature."
