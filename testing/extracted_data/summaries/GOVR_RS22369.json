    "content": "The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L. 109-171 ) includes a scaled-back version of welfare reauthorization. More extensive versions were considered during the preceding four-year debate. (See CRS Report RL33418, Welfare Reauthorization in the 109 th Congress: An Overview , by [author name scrubbed], [author name scrubbed], and [author name scrubbed] for details.) The DRA extends funding at current levels for basic state grants under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant through Fiscal Year (FY) 2010. It requires most states to either raise participation in work activities among families receiving cash welfare from TANF or further reduce the cash assistance rolls. DRA also required the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue regulations to define activities countable toward work participation standards and set rules for state enforcement and verification of participation in activities. These regulation were published on June 29, 2006. The DRA also extends Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) mandatory funding through FY2010, increasing mandatory child care funding by $200 million per year from previous levels (a total increase of $1 billion over five years). The DRA further establishes $100 million per year in TANF research and technical assistance funds for \"healthy marriage promotion\" initiatives and $50 million per year for \"responsible fatherhood initiatives.\" This report will not be updated."
