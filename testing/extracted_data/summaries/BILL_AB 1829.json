    "title": "AB 1829",
    "content": "Existing law makes it unlawful for any person to operate a vessel or water-related device while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug, or both. Existing law directs the administration of a chemical test that is used to analyze an individual\u2019s breath, blood, or urine for evidence of drug or alcohol use when the individual is arrested for these actions. Existing law requires the arrested individual to be informed that a refusal to submit to, or failure to complete, the required chemical testing may be used against the person in court and that the court, upon convicting the arrested individual, may impose increased penalties for his or her refusal or failure. This bill would instead require the arrested individual to be advised that a criminal complaint may be filed against him or her for operating a vessel or water-related device while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug, or both. That he or she has a right to refuse chemical testing. And that the officer has the authority to seek a search warrant compelling him or her to submit a blood sample. By imposing new duties on local peace officers, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
