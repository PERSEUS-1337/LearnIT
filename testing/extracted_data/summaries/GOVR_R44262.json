    "content": "The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) is the principal government agency responsible for renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency efforts. EERE works with industry, academia, national laboratories, and others to conduct research and development (R&D) and to issue grants to state governments. EERE oversees nearly a dozen technologies and programs\u2014from vehicle technologies to solar energy to advanced manufacturing to weatherization and intergovernmental programs\u2014each with its own respective mission and program goals. EERE receives funding from the annual energy and water development (E&W) appropriations bill. At issue for the 115th Congress is not only the level of EERE appropriations but also which activities EERE should support, including whether to continue support for specific initiatives and programs. On March 16, 2017, the Trump Administration released a budget blueprint for FY2018. The blueprint states that funding for EERE would focus on \"limited, early-stage applied energy research and development activities where the Federal role is stronger.\" The blueprint requests $28.0 billion for DOE, a decrease of $1.7 billion, or 5.6%, from the FY2017 annualized continuing resolution level. The blueprint does not specify how much of the proposed $1.7 billion cut would apply to EERE programs. The blueprint specified that the Trump Administration's request includes two specific program eliminations: the Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program, which received FY2016 appropriations of $211.6 million and $50.0 million, respectively. The Trump Administration also requested an $18 billion decrease in nondefense appropriations for FY2017; it is not clear how such a cut would apply to EERE. For FY2017, the Obama Administration requested $2.9 billion of discretionary funding for EERE and $1.3 billion of mandatory funding for a new program, bringing the total FY2017 budget request to $4.2 billion. This total request, if enacted, would be an increase of $2.2 billion (104%) over the enacted FY2016 level of $2.1 billion (the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016; P.L. 114-113, Division D). The $2.9 billion of discretionary funding requested would be an increase of $829 million (40%) over the FY2016 enacted level of $2.1 billion. The bulk of the discretionary portion of the request would be split among three areas: nearly 32% for energy efficiency programs, about 21% for renewable energy programs, and about 29% for sustainable transportation programs. The discretionary funding portion of the request is nearly 10% of the $30.2 billion discretionary portion of the FY2017 request for DOE. The Obama EERE request included new and ongoing efforts that range in scale and cost. EERE would continue to support the EV Everywhere Grand Challenge, concerning the adoption and use of plug-in electric vehicles; the SunShot Initiative to make solar energy cost-competitive by 2020; and the establishment of energy efficiency requirements for equipment and appliances. With the discretionary funding, EERE requested $40 million to establish a new R&D program focused on reducing the climate impacts of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. Further, the Obama Administration requested $215 million for a new EERE Crosscutting Innovation Initiatives program, which has several goals, including the establishment of regionally focused clean energy innovation partnerships across the country and the acceleration of next-generation clean energy technology pathways. A relatively significant new measure contained in the Obama budget request was $1.3 billion in mandatory funding for EERE's portion of the Obama Administration's 21st Century Clean Transportation System\u2014a new multiagency initiative to build a clean transportation system. EERE reports that this initiative would \"expand investment in transportation technologies of the future; establish regional fueling infrastructure to support the deployment of low-carbon fuels; and accelerate the transition to a cleaner vehicle fleet.\" On May 12, 2016, the Senate passed the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 (H.R. 2028). The bill would have provided $2.1 billion for EERE, $825 million below the Obama Administration's FY2017 discretionary request and $3.8 million above the FY2016 enacted level. On May 26, 2016, the House rejected an Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for 2017 (H.R. 5055). The bill would have provided $1.8 billion for EERE, $1.1 billion below the Obama Administration's FY2017 discretionary request and $244 million below the FY2016 enacted level. Funding is currently being provided by a continuing resolution."
