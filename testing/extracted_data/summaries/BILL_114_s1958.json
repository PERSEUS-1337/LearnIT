    "content": "Christopher Bryski Student Loan Protection Act or Christopher's Law This bill amends the Truth in Lending Act to require a private student loan lender to disclose clearly and conspicuously in writing a cosigner's obligations regarding a private student loan. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) must publish a model form for such disclosure. The bill prohibits a private student loan lender from taking an adverse action against a borrower upon a cosigner's death, disability, or bankruptcy. It also prohibits adverse actions against a cosigner for a borrower's death, disability, or bankruptcy. The CFPB must establish and a private student loan lender must disclose criteria for releasing a cosigner from a private student loan obligation. A private student loan lender must also: provide prompt notice of a cosigner's release. Allow a borrower to designate a legal representative to make decisions upon the death or disability of such borrower. And ensure a borrower and cosigner receive comprehensive counseling on the terms, conditions, and responsibilities of a private student loan. Additionally, this bill amends title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to expand the required elements of entrance counseling for a federal student loan borrower to include: conditions for loan discharge upon the death or disability of a borrower, options for loan repayment and forgiveness upon the death or disability of a borrower or cosigner, and obligations of a borrower or cosigner upon the death or disability of a borrower. It requires clear and conspicuous disclosure of a student's option to designate a legal representative to make decisions about a federal student loan upon such student's death or disability."
