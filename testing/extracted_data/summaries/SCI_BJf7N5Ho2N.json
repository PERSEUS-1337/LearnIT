    "content": "Modern federated networks, such as those comprised of wearable devices, mobile phones, or autonomous vehicles, generate massive amounts of data each day. This wealth of data can help to learn models that can improve the user experience on each device. However, the scale and heterogeneity of federated data presents new challenges in research areas such as federated learning, meta-learning, and multi-task learning. As the machine learning community begins to tackle these challenges, we are at a critical time to ensure that developments made in these areas are grounded with realistic benchmarks. To this end, we propose Leaf, a modular benchmarking framework for learning in federated settings. Leaf includes a suite of open-source federated datasets, a rigorous evaluation framework, and a set of reference implementations, all geared towards capturing the obstacles and intricacies of practical federated environments. With data increasingly being generated on federated networks of remote devices, there is growing interest in empowering on-device applications with models that make use of such data BID25 . Learning on data generated in federated networks, however, introduces several new obstacles:Statistical: Data is generated on each device in a heterogeneous manner, with each device associated with a different (though perhaps related) underlying data generating distribution. Moreover, the number of data points typically varies significantly across devices. We present LEAF, a modular benchmarking framework for learning in federated settings, or ecosystems marked by massively distributed networks of devices. Learning paradigms applicable in such settings include federated learning, metalearning, multi-task learning, and on-device learning. LEAF allows researchers and practitioners in these domains to reason about new proposed solutions under more realistic assumptions than previous benchmarks. We intend to keep LEAF up to date with new datasets, metrics and opensource solutions in order to foster informed and grounded progress in this field TAB1"
