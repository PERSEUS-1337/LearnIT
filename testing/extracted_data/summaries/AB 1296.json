    "title": "An act to amend Sections 9114, 9115,\n9211,\nand 9308 of, and to repeal Section 9309 of, the Elections Code, relating to elections.",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes any person who meets specified requirements to circulate an initiative petition to be presented to the voters at a municipal, county, or special district election. Existing law requires the elections official to examine the petitions, and from the records of registration ascertain whether or not the petition is signed by the requisite number of voters. If the petition is found sufficient, the elections official is required to certify the results of the examination to the appropriate legislative body. This bill would additionally require the elections official to immediately place the initiative measure on the election ballot for which it qualifies if the official finds the petition to be sufficient. If more than one election date is legally possible, the official would be required to place the measure on the ballot for the earliest legally possible date, unless as specified. The bill would apply this procedure to municipal, county, and district initiative measures, including city and city and county charter proposals, and to municipal referendum measures. The bill also would make a technical change. By imposing new requirements on local elections officials, the bill would create a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
