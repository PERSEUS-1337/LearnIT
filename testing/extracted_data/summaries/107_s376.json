Requires the President, for each fiscal year during such period, to identify to the appropriate congressional committees any country the President proposes to subject to the withholding of half of any allocated bilateral assistance, and to opposition to any multilateral assistance to such country, because it is not: (1) cooperating with the United States in achieving full compliance with the goals and objectives of the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. (2) taking adequate steps on its own to achieve full compliance with the Convention. Or (3) taking adequate steps to achieve full compliance with a bilateral agreement with the United States on illicit drug control. Requires the inclusion of the identity of major drug trafficking organizations in the President's annual international narcotics control strategy report."
