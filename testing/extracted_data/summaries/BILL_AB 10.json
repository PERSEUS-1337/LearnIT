    "content": "The Political Reform Act of 1974 prohibits a public official at any level of state or local government from making, participating in making, or in any way attempting to use his or her official position to influence a governmental decision in which the public official knows or has reason to know that he or she has a financial interest. A public official has a financial interest in a governmental decision if it is reasonably foreseeable that the decision will have a material financial effect, distinguishable from its effect on the public generally, on a business entity in which the public official has a direct or indirect investment worth $2,000 or more, real property in which the public official has a direct or indirect interest worth $2,000 or more, and sources of income aggregating $500 or more in value within 12 months before the time when the decision is made. The Political Reform Act of 1974 requires persons holding specified public offices to file disclosures of investments, real property interests, and income within specified periods of assuming or leaving office, and annually while holding the office. The act requires the disclosures to include a statement indicating, within a specified value range, the fair market value of investments or interests in real property and the aggregate value of income received from a source. This bill would increase the thresholds at which a public official has a disqualifying financial interest in sources of income from $500 to $1,000, in investments in business entities from $2,000 to $5,000, and in interests in real property from $2,000 to $10,000. This bill would make conforming adjustments to the thresholds at which income, investments, and interests in real property must be disclosed on a public official\u2019s statement of economic interests. The bill would also revise the dollar amounts associated with the value ranges for reporting the value of economic interests. This bill would require certain public officials to disclose information on the official\u2019s statement of economic interests relating to governmental decisions for which the public official had a disqualifying financial interest, as specified. Existing law makes a knowing or willful violation of the act a misdemeanor and subjects offenders to criminal penalties. By creating additional crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 87207 of the Government Code, proposed by SB 21, that would become operative only if SB 21 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, and this bill is chaptered last. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act\u2019s purposes upon a 23 vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements. This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act."
