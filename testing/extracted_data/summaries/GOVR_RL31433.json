    "content": "Global health has become a major focus of the U.S. foreign assistance program. Congressional proponents of more health assistance have successfully increased appropriations aboveAdministration requests in recent years. Some have challenged the Administration's FY2003 budgetproposal during the foreign operations debate, particularly the manner in which the Administrationproposed the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) allocate its funds. Itrequested a $36 million increase in FY2003 for global health programs. It proposed that more than40% of the global health budget be spent on HIV/AIDS activities, up substantially from the previousfiscal year. USAID emphasized that HIV/AIDS affects all sectors of societies, and thus it is apriority in global health. Some in Congress have expressed concern about the consequences ofspending a significant portion of global health funds on HIV/AIDS, and suggested that more moneybe spent on other programs, namely infectious diseases and child survival. As Congress debatedfunding levels for FY2003 global health activities it discussed several issues including: global healthfunding versus other development assistance programs, and increasing funding to HIV/AIDS at theexpense of other global health programs. This report will be updated as needed."
