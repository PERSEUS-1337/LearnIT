    "title": "An act to amend Sections 40240 and 40241 of, and to add Section 40240.5 to, the Vehicle Code, relating to vehicles.",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes the City and County of San Francisco to enforce parking violations in specified transit-only traffic lanes through the use of video imaging, and authorizes San Francisco to install automated forward facing parking control devices on city-owned public transit vehicles for the purpose of video imaging parking violations occurring in transit-only traffic lanes. Existing law requires a designated employee, who is qualified by San Francisco, to review video image recordings for the purpose of determining whether a parking violation occurred in a transit-only traffic lane, and to issue a notice of parking violation to a registered owner of a vehicle within 15 calendar days of the date of the violation. Existing laws makes these video image records confidential, and provides that these records are available only to public agencies to enforce parking violations. Existing law establishes the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District. This bill would extend the provisions to the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District, thereby authorizing the district to enforce parking violations in specified transit-only traffic lanes through the use of video imaging evidence and to install automated forward facing parking control devices on district-owned public transit vehicles. The bill would repeal the authority for the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District to implement an automated enforcement system to enforce parking violations occurring in transit-only traffic lanes on January 1, 2022. This bill would require, under designated circumstances, the district and the City and County of San Francisco to submit to the transportation, privacy, and judiciary committees of the Legislature evaluations of the automated enforcement system\u2019s effectiveness, impact on privacy, cost to implement, and generation of revenue, no later than January 1, 2021. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City and County of San Francisco and the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District. Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest. This bill would make legislative findings to that effect."
