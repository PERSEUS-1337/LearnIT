Directs the Secretary of Commerce to exercise the authorities of the Export Administration Act of 1979 to carry out this Act. Except that the Secretary may not require a license for the export of humanitarian assistance, but shall require persons to notify the Secretary when exporting such assistance. Amends the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 to repeal a specified section prohibiting the export to Iraq of agricultural commodities , medicine, or medical devices, and travel . Expresses the sense of Congress that the US Government should take all necessary steps to end the suffering of innocent populations, primarily children and the elderly, by allowing the free flow of humanitarian aid to Iraq without threat of prosecution. Urges the US Government to use its position as a permanent member of the United Nations (UN) Security Council to lift the economic sanctions on Iraq so as to allow such exports and travel there, and to recommend a ban on transfers of weapons to such country by countries that are members of the UN."
