    "content": "Transforming a graphical user interface screenshot created by a designer into computer code is a typical task conducted by a developer in order to build customized software, websites, and mobile applications. In this paper, we show that deep learning methods can be leveraged to train a model end-to-end to automatically generate code from a single input image with over 77% of accuracy for three different platforms (i.e. iOS, Android and web-based technologies). The process of implementing client-side software based on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) mockup created by a designer is the responsibility of developers. Implementing GUI code is, however, time-consuming and prevent developers from dedicating the majority of their time implementing the actual functionality and logic of the software they are building. Moreover, the computer languages used to implement such GUIs are specific to each target runtime system; thus resulting in tedious and repetitive work when the software being built is expected to run on multiple platforms using native technologies. In this paper, we describe a model trained end-to-end with stochastic gradient descent to simultaneously learns to model sequences and spatio-temporal visual features to generate variable-length strings of tokens from a single GUI image as input.Our first contribution is pix2code, a novel application of Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks to generate computer tokens from a single GUI screenshot as input. That is, no engineered feature extraction pipeline nor expert heuristics was designed to process the input data; our model learns from the pixel values of the input image alone. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for generating computer code for various platforms (i.e. iOS and Android native mobile interfaces, and multi-platform web-based HTML/CSS interfaces) without the need for any change or specific tuning to the model. In fact, pix2code can be used as such to support different target languages simply by being trained on a different dataset. A video demonstrating our system is available online 1 .Our second contribution is the release of our synthesized datasets consisting of both GUI screenshots and associated source code for three different platforms. Our datasets and our pix2code implemention are publicly available 2 to foster future research."
