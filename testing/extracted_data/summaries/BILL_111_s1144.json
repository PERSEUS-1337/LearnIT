    "content": "Rural Transit Improvement and Flexibility Act of 2009 - Revises the apportionment of nonurbanized formula grants for amounts remaining after apportionment for grants to Indian tribes for public transportation on Indian reservations for FY2006-FY2009. Increases from 20 to 25 the amount of remaining funds to be apportioned to a state based on its land area. Decreases correspondingly from 80 to 75 the amount of remaining funds to be apportioned to a state based on population in nonurbanized areas. Limits to 25 of its apportionment for a formula grant for a capital project for the special needs of elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities the amount a state may use for operating costs of equipment and facilities. Limits a grant for operating assistance from exceeding 50 of the net operating project costs. Increases such limit to 62.5 of the government share of project costs in the case of a state containing nontaxable Indian lands, individual and tribal, and public domain lands , national forests, and national parks and monuments. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish a pilot program for the award of grants to states to establish transit centers to improve transit service in urbanized areas with a population of less than 200,000 and in nonurbanized areas."
