A trafficking victim may file a motion: (1) to vacate a conviction for a nonviolent offense that does not include a child victim. (2) to expunge records of an arrest for a nonviolent offense that does not include a child victim. Or (3) to expunge records of an arrest for an offense that is violent or that includes a child victim, if the charges are reduced, dismissed, or disposed of."
