    "content": "Under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, states are entitled to open-ended reimbursement for the cost of providing foster care, adoption assistance, and (in states that choose to provide it) kinship guardianship assistance. Additional mandatory funding is available, on a capped basis, for services to youth who \"age out\" of foster care, or are expected to, and for Tribal Title IV-E plan development and technical assistance. Each year the President's budget estimates the amount of funding necessary to meet federal commitments under Title IV-E based on current law and, if included in the budget, provides estimates related to proposed changes to the law. While the current law estimate reflects funding needed to support policies that have already been placed in statute, Congress would need to make changes to the law to enable the proposed policies (and any related spending) to be implemented. For FY2016, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF) estimates that, under current law, $7.601 billion will be needed to meet the costs of all Title IV-E program components (including those with open-ended funding and those with capped funding). The overall funding level is $258 million above what HHS/ACF expects to need under the program for FY2015 ($7.343 billion). The primary reasons HHS/ACF assumes a need for this additional FY2016 funding are expected growth in the number of children receiving Title IV-E foster care maintenance, adoption assistance, and guardianship assistance payments; and increased program administrative costs tied to implementation of new program requirements. The Administration also seeks legislative authority to implement several new policies under the Title IV-E program. Combined, it estimates these policies would require an additional $430 million in Title IV-E budget authority in FY2016 and a total of $1.358 billion in additional funding across 10 years (FY2016-FY2025). Specifically, it seeks budget authority of $30 million in FY2016 ($587 million across 10 years) to enable federal support for a part of the cost of providing services needed to prevent the entry or re-entry to foster care of children who are at imminent risk of this outcome; $78 million in FY2016 (but an estimated savings of $69 million across 10 years) to require states to meet new Title IV-E requirements before placing a child in a congregate care setting, while also providing enhanced Title IV-E support to expand the capacity of states to provide family-based care for children in foster care, including those with identified behavioral problems or clinical mental health concerns; $27 million in FY2016 ($114 million over 10 years) to offer enhanced Title IV-E support to enable tribes with approved Title IV-E plans to implement them; $250 million in FY2016 (total 10-year cost of $250 million) to address concerns about prescription of psychotropic medication for children in foster care (additional funding is sought under the Medicaid program as part of this same proposal); and $45 million in FY2016 ($476 million over 10 years) to ensure child support payments for children in foster care are used only in the child's best interest (and not as reimbursement to federal or state government). Finally, the Administration also proposes two policy changes that do not have an associated cost (or savings): (1) requiring states to have a permanency plan for each child in foster care that involves reunification, adoption, legal guardianship, or placement with a fit and willing relative (by eliminating entirely the permanency plan option known as \"another planned permanent living arrangement,\" or APPLA); and (2) permitting states that offer foster care assistance to youth up to age 21 to spend Chafee Foster Care Independence (CFCIP) funds for otherwise eligible youth up to age 23 (current law limits the use of these funds to otherwise eligible youth up to age 21)."
