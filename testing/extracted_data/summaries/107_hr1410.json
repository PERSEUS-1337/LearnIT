And (2) multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) States and localities should work together to develop a uniform streamlined sales and use tax system that addresses remote sales. And (2) a joint comprehensive study should be undertaken to determine the cost of collecting and remitting State and local sales and use taxes under such system. Authorizes States to enter into an Interstate Sales and Use Tax Compact which shall describe a uniform, streamlined sales and use tax system consistent with such system."
