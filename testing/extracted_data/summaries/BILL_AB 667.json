    "title": "AB 667",
    "content": "Under existing law, the Corporate Securities Law of 1968, the Commissioner of Business Oversight regulates the activities of a broker-dealer which is defined as, among other things, any person engaged in the business of effecting securities transactions in California for the account of others or his or her own account, and it specifies those persons or entities excluded from the definition. Existing law requires, among other things, that a broker-dealer apply for and secure a certificate authorizing that person to act in that capacity, unless the person is exempted from this requirement, as prescribed. Existing law prohibits a person acting on behalf of a licensed broker-dealer or an issuer, from effecting any transaction in, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of, any security in this state unless the broker-dealer and agent have complied with certain rules. This bill would exempt from those provisions an individual who is a finder, as defined, who satisfies specified requirements, including, among other things, filing an initial statement of information with the Commissioner of Business Oversight and paying a filing fee."
