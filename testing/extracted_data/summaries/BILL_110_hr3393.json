    "content": "Reservist Access to Justice Act of 2007 - Allows a court, if it determines that a federal, state, or private employer's failure to comply with a veteran's reemployment rights was willful, to require the employer to pay the individual the greater of any loss of wages or benefits, or $20,000. Requires a court to exercise injunctive relief to fully vindicate such rights. Authorizes a court to require a state or private employer to pay punitive damages for violations found to be with malice or reckless indifference to the individual's federally-protected reemployment rights. Makes federal arbitration procedures inapplicable to claims for veterans' employment and reemployment rights and benefits."
