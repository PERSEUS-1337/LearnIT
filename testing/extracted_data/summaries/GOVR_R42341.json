    "content": "Dating back to the 1950s, federal sourcing policy generally has focused on the premise that the government should rely on the private sector for the provision of certain goods and services. Additionally, it has centered around guidance for conducting public-private competitions to determine whether federal employees, or contractor employees, should be selected to perform certain agency functions. The Administration of President George W. Bush, in particular, emphasized subjecting eligible agency functions to public-private competitions. Branding this policy, and related guidance, as competitive sourcing, the Bush Administration included it as one component of the President's Management Agenda. During the Administration of President Barack Obama, another strain, or facet, of sourcing policy surfaced. Labeled multi-sector workforce management by the Administration, it posits that federal agencies might be susceptible to overreliance on contractors, which could affect the ability of agencies to maintain control over their missions and operations. OMB's July 2009 memorandum provides guidance to agencies on how to manage their multi-sector workforces. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy's Policy Letter 11-01\u2014by providing a single, consistent definition of inherently governmental and guidance for identifying and managing inherently governmental functions, functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions, and critical functions\u2014complements the Administration's multi-sector workforce management policy. This letter was issued in September 2011. Congressional interest in sourcing policy, generally, has been evident for some time. For example, in 1998, the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act (P.L. 105-270) was signed into law. It requires certain federal agencies to compile, and submit annually to OMB, inventories of their commercial activities, which are activities that may be performed by federal employees or a government contractor. Recent signs of interest in sourcing policy include two substantively similar but identically titled bills that were introduced during the 112th Congress. H.R. 1474 and S. 785, the Freedom From Government Competition Act, contain provisions that would expand upon existing policies designed to encourage federal government reliance on the private sector for the provision of both goods and services. This report provides an overview of the evolution of federal sourcing policy to date and identifies the major policy issues before Congress. It is not a legislation tracking report. This report will be updated as events warrant."
