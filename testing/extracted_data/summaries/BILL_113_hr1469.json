    "content": "Leave Ethanol Volumes at Existing Levels Act or the LEVEL Act - Amends the Clean Air Act to revise the renewable fuel program, including by: (1) redefining quot, renewable fuelquot, . (2) revoking the requirement that the Administrator ensure that renewable fuel achieves a 20 reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to baseline lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. (3) reducing the volume of renewable fuel that is required to be in gasoline sold or introduced into commerce in the United States to 7.5 billion gallons for each year. (4) requiring the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration to provide to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) an estimate of the volumes of gasoline projected to be sold or introduced into commerce in the following year. (5) making one gallon of cellulosic biomass ethanol or waste derived ethanol equivalent to 2.5 gallons of renewable fuel, (6) repealing provisions concerning cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel. And (7) repealing a requirement that the Administrator of EPA promulgate fuel regulations to implement measures to mitigate adverse impacts on air quality as the result of renewable fuel requirements. Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to repeal provisions requiring EPA to report to Congress on current and future impacts of the renewable fuel requirements on environmental issues, resource conservation issues, and the growth and use of cultivated invasive or noxious plants and their impacts on the environment and agriculture. Prohibits the Administrator from permitting or authorizing the introduction into commerce of gasoline that: (1) contains greater than 10 ethanol by volume, (2) is intended for general use in conventional gasoline-powered vehicles or engines, and (3) is not a registered fuel or fuel additive that is lawfully sold in the United States before enactment of this Act. Repeals waivers that permit the introduction into commerce of gasoline that contains greater than 10-volume-percent ethanol for general use in conventional gasoline-powered vehicles or engines, including: (1) the quot. Partial Grant and Partial Denial of Clean Air Act Waiver Application Submitted by Growth Energy To Increase the Allowable Ethanol Content of Gasoline to 15 Percent, Decision of the Administratorquot, , and (2) the quot. Partial Grant of Clean Air Act Waiver Application Submitted by Growth Energy To Increase the Allowable Ethanol Content of Gasoline to 15 Percent, Decision of the Administrator. quot. Excepts waivers for such gasoline that is a registered fuel or fuel additive that is lawfully sold in the United States before enactment of this Act. Requires the Administrator to study: (1) the effects of the introduction into commerce of an ethanol-gasoline blend on consumer products. (2) the impact of such blend on engine performance of conventional gasoline-powered vehicles and nonroad engines, emissions from the use of the blend, and materials compatibility and consumer safety issues associated with the use of such blend. And (3) the ability of wholesale and retail gasoline distribution infrastructure to introduce such blend into commerce without widespread misfueling by consumers."
