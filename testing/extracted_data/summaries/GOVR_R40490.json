    "content": "All poor American children and pregnant woman are eligible for Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), although millions are not enrolled. However, some other populations' upper income eligibility threshold for Medicaid is often well below the federal poverty level. For working parents of dependent children, for example, the median Medicaid upper income eligibility threshold among the states is 68% of poverty\u2014less than $10,000 a year for a single parent with a child. (For parents who are not working, the median Medicaid upper income eligibility threshold among the states is even lower, at 41% of poverty\u2014less than $6,000 a year for a single parent with a child.) Adults under age 65 who are not disabled, not pregnant and not custodial parents of dependent children\u2014often referred to as \"childless adults\"\u2014are generally ineligible for Medicaid, regardless of their income. Some health reform proposals include provisions to expand traditional Medicaid\u2014to 100% of poverty, for example\u2014regardless of whether one is in a covered \"category,\" such as children, pregnant women, the aged or disabled, as generally required for Medicaid coverage today. This report briefly describes current Medicaid eligibility and presents some policy and legislative considerations if Congress decided to expand mandatory Medicaid eligibility to 100% of poverty through federal legislation."
