    "title": "AB 2426",
    "content": "The California Alternative and Renewable Fuel, Vehicle Technology, Clean Air, and Carbon Reduction Act of 2007 requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to administer the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program to provide financial assistance for the development and deployment of innovative technologies that transform California\u2019s fuel and vehicle types to help attain the state\u2019s climate change policies. The act requires the State Air Resources Board to administer the Air Quality Improvement Program to fund projects to reduce criteria air pollutants, to improve air quality, and to fund research to determine and improve air quality impacts of alternative transportation fuels and vehicles, vessels, and equipment technologies. Existing law defines various terms for purposes of those programs. Existing law requires the commission to allocate $20,000,000 annually to fund the number of publicly available hydrogen-fueling stations identified by the State Air Resources Board as being needed, as specified, until at least 100 stations are in operation. This bill would make nonsubstantive changes in the provision defining those terms. This bill would require the state board, until January 1, 2021, to establish and implement the Workplace Charging Stations Grant Program to award grants to eligible applicants, as defined, for the installation of electric vehicle charging stations in commercial parking facilities for employees and visitors. The bill would require eligible applicants awarded grants pursuant to the program to report annually to the state board on certain usage statistics of the charging stations. The bill would require the state board, on or before July 1, 2018, and annually thereafter, to submit to the Legislature a report on the program, as provided. The bill would repeal the above provision on January 1, 2022."
