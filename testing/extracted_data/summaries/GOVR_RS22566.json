    "content": "On January 4, 2007, the House adopted new internal rules to prohibit the receipt of most gifts by Members and staff from lobbyists, foreign agents, and most of their private clients. Additionally, the new House Rules placed more restrictions and requirements on the acceptance from outside private sources of travel expenses for \"officially connected\" travel by Members and staff. Such restrictions are designed specifically to further limit the participation and involvement of lobbyists, foreign agents, or their clients in such travel events, and to provide for more transparency and disclosures of any such travel. With the passage of the \"Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007\" ( P.L. 110-81 , September 14, 2007), further ethics provisions applicable to House Members and staff were adopted."
