    "content": "The 111th Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148, PPACA), and amended it a week later by passing the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-152). (PPACA refers to P.L. 111-148 as amended by P.L. 111-152.) On January 19, 2011, the House passed H.R. 2, which would repeal PPACA. It is possible that the 112th Congress will examine other legislation to amend parts of PPACA. One issue that may arise during any debate to amend provisions in PPACA is the eligibility of aliens (noncitizens) for some of the key provisions of the act. Aliens who are \"lawfully present in the United States\" are subject to the heath insurance mandate and are eligible, if otherwise qualified, to participate in the high-risk pools and the exchanges, and they are eligible for premium credits and cost-sharing subsidies. PPACA expressly exempts unauthorized (illegal) aliens from the mandate to have health coverage and bars them from a health insurance exchange. Unauthorized aliens are not eligible for the federal premium credits or cost-sharing subsidies. Unauthorized aliens are also barred from participating in the temporary high-risk pools. To enforce the alien eligibility requirements under PPACA, the act requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a program to determine whether an individual who is to be covered in the individual market by a qualified health plan offered through an exchange, or who is claiming a premium tax credit or reduced cost-sharing, is a citizen or national of the United States or an alien lawfully present in the United States. Some have raised concerns that PPACA created an inequality between U.S. citizens and some noncitizens with incomes at or below 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL) with respect to eligibility to participate in an exchange and receive premium credits or cost-sharing subsidies. In general, all U.S. citizens and Medicaid-eligible noncitizens with incomes at or below 133% of FPL will be eligible for Medicaid, while similarly situated Medicaid-ineligible lawfully present noncitizens will be eligible to participate in an exchange and possibly to receive the credits or subsidies. This report will be updated if warranted by legislative events."
