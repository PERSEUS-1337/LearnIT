    "title": "A bill to shorten the campaign period for congressional elections.",
    "content": "Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to define an eligible congressional candidate as a candidate to the Senate or the House of Representatives who makes specified declarations to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) that: (1) such candidate and the candidate's authorized committees will not participate in campaign advertising except during the primary or general election period. And (2) at least one other candidate has qualified for the same primary election ballot under the law of the candidate's State. Entitles eligible congressional candidates with opponents who have qualified for the ballot to reduced broadcast media rates. Requires candidates so entitled to use the time for communications at least 60 seconds in length. Sets forth FEC certification requirements with respect to declarations. Makes candidates whose certifications have been revoked ineligible for further benefits for the duration of the election cycle. Requires candidates with revoked certifications to reimburse benefit providers for any difference in rates. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require a broadcast station to make broadcast time available to all House and Senate candidates in the last 30 days before a primary at the lowest charge of the station for the same amount of time for the same period on the same date. Limits charges for broadcast time during such period for eligible congressional candidates to 50 percent of the lowest charge. Prohibits broadcasters from preempting advertisements by eligible congressional candidates during such periods, unless the preemption is beyond the broadcaster's control. Authorizes the Federal Communications Commission to revoke a station license or construction permit for willful failure to allow reasonable access to, or permit purchase of time for, the use of a broadcasting station or cable system by a legally qualified candidate under the same terms as apply to the most favored advertiser of the licensee."
