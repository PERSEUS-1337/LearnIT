    "content": "The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-171), as amended by the DTV Delay Act, directed that on June 12, 2009, all over-the-air full-power television broadcasts\u2014which were previously provided by television stations in both analog and digital formats\u2014would become digital only. Digital television (DTV) technology allows a broadcaster to offer a single program stream of high definition television (HDTV), or alternatively, multiple video program streams (multicasts). Households with over-the-air analog-only televisions will no longer be able to receive full-power television service unless they either (1) buy a digital-to-analog converter box to hook up to their analog television set; (2) acquire a digital television or an analog television equipped with a digital tuner; or (3) subscribe to cable, satellite, or telephone company television services, which will provide for the conversion of digital signals to their analog customers. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 established a digital-to-analog converter box program\u2014administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the Department of Commerce\u2014that partially subsidizes consumer purchases of converter boxes. NTIA provides up to two forty-dollar coupons to requesting U.S. households. The coupons are being issued between January 1, 2008, and July 31, 2009, and must be used within 90 days after issuance towards the purchase of a stand-alone device used solely for digital-to-analog conversion. The DTV Delay Act allows expired coupons to be replaced. The preeminent goal for Congress is ensuring that American households are prepared for the DTV transition deadline, thereby minimizing a scenario where television sets across the nation \"go dark.\" At issue is whether the federal government's current programs and reliance on private sector stakeholders will lead to a successful digital transition with a minimum amount of disruption to American TV households. Specific issues have included whether consumer DTV education and outreach efforts are sufficient, the extent to which digital signal reception and antenna issues could still be a problem for some viewers, and whether the supply of converter boxes will be adequate. On June 12, 2009, 971 full power television stations terminated their regular analog programming. All other full power stations (about 790 stations) had already voluntarily terminated their analog signal before June 12. Although the FCC and many reports in the press indicate that, in general, the digital transition appears to be proceeding relatively smoothly, digital signal reception problems persist for some viewers, particularly in areas where individual stations switched on June 12 from UHF to VHF channels."
