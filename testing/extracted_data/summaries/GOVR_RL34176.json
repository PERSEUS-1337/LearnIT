    "content": "Congress has long taken a leadership role in establishing and sustaining offices of inspector general (OIGs), which now exist in more than 60 federal departments and agencies. This effort began with Congress's initiation of the first contemporary statutory inspectors general (IGs) in 1976; it has continued with passage of the broadly encompassing 1978 Inspector General (IG) Act and 1988 Amendments as well as with additions and modifications in the meantime. In the 110 th Congress, two bills designed to increase the IGs' independence and accountability or otherwise modify specific provisions have been introduced\u00e2\u0080\u0094 H.R. 928 and S. 1723 . These bills are similar, and their major provisions include a fixed term of office for IGs; removal for cause only; apprisal of the intention to remove or transfer an IG given to Congress 15 or 30 days in advance; notification of the annual IG budget request to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) when the IG submits it to agency administration; establishment of a Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, replacing the two current councils operating under executive order; and creation of an Integrity Committee composed of Council members to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by an inspector general or officials in the office. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee reported H.R. 928 with some changes on September 27, 2007. The Bush Administration has taken exception to several provisions in H.R. 928 \u00e2\u0080\u0094removal for cause, transmittal of budget requests to Congress, and an independent IG Council\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, on October 1, 2007, threatened a veto of the legislation. The House passed H.R. 928 , with amendments, by a vote of 404-11 on October 3, 2007. This report, which will be updated as developments dictate, covers the main provisions of the proposals."
