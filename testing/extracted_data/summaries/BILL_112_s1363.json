    "content": "American Jobs Matter Act of 2011 - Requires an executive agency to state in a solicitation for competitive proposals that the agency may consider information that the offeror may include on the effects awarding the contract to the offeror would have on employment within the United States . Allows such statement to include a guarantee that jobs created or retained in the United States will not be moved outside the United States after award of the contract. Requires each agency to: (1) assess, annually, the accuracy of such a statement submitted by an offeror awarded a contract. (2) submit an annual report on the frequency of use of such statements in evaluating competitive proposals. And (3) track the number of jobs created or retained during the performance of a contract awarded to an offeror that submitted such a statement. Authorizes an agency to evaluate whether a contractor should be proposed for debarment if the number of jobs that the agency estimates will be created based on such statement significantly exceeds the number created or retained. Sets forth analogous provisions for defense contracts. Requires revision of the Federal Acquisition Regulation to implement the amendments made by this Act."
