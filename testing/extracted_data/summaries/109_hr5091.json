Reserves a specified minimum amount of certain authorized development assistance appropriations under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for literacy and basic education programs in Haiti.

And (2) promote mutual understanding between the peoples of the United States and of Haiti. Urges the President to: (1) design a program to match scholarship contributions from private and public sectors in either country.
