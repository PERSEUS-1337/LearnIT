    "content": "The federal crop insurance program offers subsidized crop insurance policies to farmers. Farmers can purchase policies that pay indemnities when their yields or revenues fall below guaranteed levels. While the majority of federal crop insurance policies cover yield or revenue losses, the program also offers policies with other types of guarantees, such as index policies that trigger an indemnity payment based on weather conditions. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), a government corporation within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), pays part of the premium\u2014about 63%, on average\u2014across the federal crop insurance portfolio during crop year 2017, while policy holders\u2014farmers and ranchers\u2014pay the balance. Private insurance companies, known as Approved Insurance Providers (AIPs), deliver the policies in return for administrative and operating subsidies from FCIC. AIPs also share underwriting risk with FCIC through a mutually negotiated Standard Reinsurance Agreement. The USDA Risk Management Agency (RMA) administers the federal crop insurance program. The federal crop insurance program primarily covers traditional field crops (such as wheat, corn, and soybeans) that are supported by USDA's revenue-support programs. Unlike these traditional crops, specialty crops\u2014defined in statute as \"fruits and vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, and horticulture and nursery crops (including floriculture)\" (7 U.S.C. \u00a71621 note)\u2014have not been a major part of federal crop insurance support. Specialty crops are also generally not eligible for USDA's revenue-support programs. USDA estimates that the statutory definition of specialty crops covers more than 300 agricultural commodities, including fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, tree nuts, nursery plants (trees, shrubs, and flowering plants), herbs, spices, coffee, tea, honey, and maple syrup. Legislative changes, coupled with ongoing administrative efforts by USDA, have expanded federal crop insurance coverage for specialty crops, and they now account for a small but growing number of federal crop insurance policies bought by farmers. Among the issues Congress may consider if it seeks to further expand coverage for specialty crops are data collection and price discovery for commodities not sold on exchanges (such as most fruits and vegetables), coverage of quality losses, and the effect of ad hoc payments on the demand for crop insurance. Federal crop insurance policies currently cover around 38 specialty crop categories, which include roughly 80 types of fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, and nursery crops. Over the past few decades, total specialty crop insured liabilities rose from nearly $1 billion in 1989 to nearly $18.5 billion in 2017. In 2017, federal crop insurance policies covered about 9 million acres of specialty crops, around 800,000 bee colonies, about 100,000 tons of raisins, and roughly 60,000 fruit and coffee trees. Across all specialty crops, coverage and the premium subsidy paid by the federal government may vary depending on the crop. Moreover, for many specialty crops, crop-specific insurance policies are not available. Currently, about one-half of all U.S. specialty crop acres are covered by federal crop insurance policies. Some specialty crops may be covered under a Whole Farm Revenue Protection (WFRP) insurance policy. WFRP is designed to fill in coverage gaps for producers of uninsured crops that lack individual policy coverage and for producers marketing to local, farm-identity preserved, or direct markets. The average premium subsidy rate for WRFP was about 70% in 2017. Federal crop insurance for specialty crops and WFRP together accounted for about 17% of the entire federal crop insurance portfolio, as measured by liability, during crop year 2017."
