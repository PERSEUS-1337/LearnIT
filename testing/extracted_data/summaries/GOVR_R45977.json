    "content": "The primary source of federal aid for elementary and secondary education is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA)\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly its Title I-A program, which authorizes federal aid for the education of disadvantaged students. The ESEA was initially enacted in 1965 (P.L. 89-10), and was most recently comprehensively amended and reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; P.L. 114-95 ). Under Title I-A, the ESEA as amended by the ESSA continues to require states and public schools systems to focus on educational accountability as a condition for the receipt of grant funds. Public school systems and individual public schools are held accountable for monitoring and improving achievement outcomes for students and closing achievement gaps, sustaining a focus that was initiated by amendments to the ESEA made by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB; P.L. 107-110 ) but modified under the ESSA. While states were given more latitude to develop their accountability systems under the ESSA provisions, as a condition of receiving Title I-A funds each state must continue to have content and academic achievement standards and aligned assessments in reading/language arts (RLA), mathematics, and science for specific grade levels. States must now have an accountability system that incorporates (1) long-term and interim performance goals for specified measures; (2) weighted indicators based, in part, on these goals; and (3) an annual system for meaningful differentiation that is used to identify schools that need additional support to improve student achievement. Beyond Title I-A, other ESEA programs provide grants and contracts for a variety of educational purposes. ESEA programs and general provisions are included in eight titles, which collectively received appropriations of $25.2 billion in FY2019. The ESEA's titles are as follows: Title I: Programs for disadvantaged students, student assessment, migratory students, and neglected and delinquent students. Title II: Programs for teachers, principals, and school leaders; literacy; and American history and civics education. Title III: Programs to support English language acquisition for English learners. Title IV: Programs to support a well-rounded education, safe and healthy students, and technology; after-school instruction and care; charter schools; magnet schools; family engagement in education; and various national activities. Title V: Programs to support rural education. Title VI: Programs for Indian education, Native Hawaiian education, and Alaska Native education. Title VII: Impact Aid programs. Title VIII: General provisions. This report provides an overview of major provisions of the ESEA. It also includes a table showing annual appropriations for ESEA programs for FY2017 through FY2019, as well as a table showing the transition in authorized programs and related appropriations from FY2016, when NCLB provisions were still in effect, to FY2017, when ESSA provisions took effect. Finally, a table detailing authorizations of appropriations under current law is also included. The ESSA authorized appropriations for ESEA programs through FY2020."
