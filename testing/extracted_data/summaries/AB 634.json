    "title": "An act to amend\nSection 11273 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to time-shares.\nSection 881 of the Probate Code, as added by Assembly Bill 691 of the 2015\u2013\n16 Regular Session, relating to estates.",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the disposition of a testator\u2019s property by will. Existing law also provides for the disposition of that portion of a decedent\u2019s estate not disposed of by will. Existing law provides that the decedent\u2019s property, including property devised by a will, is generally subject to probate administration, except as specified. AB 691 of the 2015\u201316 Regular Session would enact the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act, which would authorize a decedent\u2019s personal representative or trustee to access and manage digital assets and electronic communications, as specified. Among other provisions, AB 691 would provide that a custodian of digital assets, and its officers, employees, and agents, are immune from liability for an act or omission done in good faith and in compliance with the act. This bill would specify that this immunity does not apply in a case of gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct. The bill would become operative only if AB 691 is enacted prior to the enactment of this bill. The Vacation Ownership and Time-share Act of 2004 requires all records of a time-share plan maintained by a time-share association to be made available for inspection and copying by any member for a purpose reasonably related to membership in the association. Existing law requires the time-share association to maintain among its records a complete list of the names and addresses of all owners of time-share interests in the time-share plan, as specified. Existing law prohibits an association from publishing the owners list or providing a copy of it to any time-share interest owner or to any 3rd party or using or selling the list for commercial purposes, except as provided in the time-share instruments. This bill would require the owner addresses in the list to be mailing addresses, and would prohibit the association from publishing the list or providing a copy of it to any 3rd party or using or selling the list for commercial purposes. The bill would require the association to provide a copy of the list to an owner for a purpose reasonably related to membership in the association, except as specified. The bill would require, if a time-share interest owner makes a request to communicate by mail with the membership of the association for a purpose reasonably related to membership in the association, the communication to be made within 30 days of receipt of the request and payment of actual costs in performing the mailing. The bill would require, if the purpose is not reasonably related, the board of administration of the association or the managing entity to notify the requesting owner of the rejection. The bill would authorize a court to summarily order the distribution of the requested communication if it is not distributed within 30 days after receipt of a request from an owner and payment of actual costs. The bill would also specify that certain provisions of the Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation Law pertaining to the list of names, addresses, and voting rights of members of a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation do not apply to time-share associations under the Vacation Ownership and Time-share Act of 2004."
