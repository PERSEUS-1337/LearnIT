Forpurposes of this report, these reorganization exercises are referred to as \"landmark commissions.\" Context for discussion of landmark commissions is provided by a review and analysis of sixcrucial historical periods, such as the Progressive Era, in the evolution of the executive branch. Theselected landmark commissions, beginning with the Keep Commission in 1905 and concluding withthe National Performance Review (1993-2000) are described and analyzed in chronological order. Each commission and its work is founded on philosophical principles of management, someof which are made explicit while others have to be interpreted from texts and actions. The prevailingconsensus on organizational management principles changed considerably during the course of the20th century and these changing principles and assumptions are analyzed. Highlighted is the current debate over which set of principles should form the basis for futureorganizational design and management in the executive branch. The debate, in its essence, isbetween those believing that the governmental and private sectors are distinctive in theircharacteristics, based on legal theory, and ought to kept separate (\"constitutionalists\"), and those whobelieve that the governmental and private sectors are essentially alike and ought to be organized andmanaged according to generic principles with an economic foundation (\"entrepreneurs\"). The report concludes with a discussion of the future, if any, for the landmark commissionapproach to organizational management in the executive branch."
