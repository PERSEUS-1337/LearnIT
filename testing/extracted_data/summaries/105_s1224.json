    "content": "Federal Facility Superfund Compliance Act of 1997 - Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to subject each department, agency, and instrumentality of the Federal Government to all Federal, State, interstate, and local requirements and other laws relating to response or restoration actions or management of hazardous waste, pollutants, or contaminants in the same manner and to the same extent as a nongovernmental entity. Waives any US immunity otherwise applicable with respect to any such requirement. Absolves Federal employees of personal liability for civil penalties under Federal or State law relating to response actions or management of hazardous substances for acts or omissions within the scope of official duties. Makes Federal employees subject to criminal sanctions under such laws, but exempts Federal agencies from such sanctions. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to issue an abatement order to a Federal entity and requires initiation of an administrative enforcement action in the same manner and under the same circumstances as action would be initiated against any other person. Removes provisions for application of State laws concerning removal and remedial action at Federal facilities not on the National Priorities List. Precludes interagency remedial action agreements from impairing or diminishing State, local, individual, or court authority to enforce requirements of State or Federal law, unless such requirements have been addressed or waived without objection after notice to the State."
