    "title": "Federalization of Crimes Uniform Standards Act of 2000",
    "content": "Specifies that it shall not be in order in either the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any measure containing a provision that would increase the law enforcement responsibilities of the Federal Government, unless that measure is accompanied by a Federal law enforcement impact statement. Directs the Commission, for each such measure that is provided to the Commission by a Member of Congress or a congressional committee, to promptly: (1) prepare a Federal law enforcement impact statement with respect to that measure. And (2) provide the statement to that Member or committee. Requires a Federal law enforcement impact statement, for each provision of that measure that would increase the law enforcement responsibility of the Government, to contain the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the Commission as to the extent to which: (1) that increase in responsibilities would occur only as to core Federal responsibilities. (2) the efforts of States are inadequate to address the purposes to be served by that provision. And (3) the burdens imposed on the Federal court system with respect to that provision could be accommodated within the existing capacity, resources, and structure of that system."
