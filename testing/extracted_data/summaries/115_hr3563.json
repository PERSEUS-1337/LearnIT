    "content": "Veterans' Pathway to Citizenship Act of 2017 This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide that a current or former member of the Armed Forces who would be eligible for naturalization but is not because of failure to complete a specified period of residence or physical presence within the United States or failure to maintain lawful permanent resident status shall be deemed to be a lawful permanent resident and to have fulfilled any residency and physical presence requirements solely for naturalization purposes. With respect to any such individual seeking naturalization: (1) a prior removal may be not taken into account for purposes of any immigration benefit or in determining deportability or inadmissibility, and (2) an offense for which a pardon was received may not be taken into account for naturalization purposes unless the offense was the same offense that caused the individual's separation from the Armed Forces in any manner other than honorable. A military recruiter or officer overseeing an enlistment shall inform every recruit of, and the Department of Homeland Security shall provide every separating member of the Armed Forces with notice of, naturalization options and available naturalization assistance services. In the case of a current or former member of the Armed Forces who would be eligible for naturalization but is not because of failure to timely file an application for naturalization, a subsequently filed naturalization application shall be reviewed as if it were timely filed. This provision is repealed one year after the date of enactment of the bill."
