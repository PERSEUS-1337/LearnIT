    "content": "Checkpoint Optimization and Efficiency Act This bill expresses the sense of Congress that airport checkpoint wait times should not take priority over the security of the nation's aviation system. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the Department of Homeland Security shall begin and complete, within 30 days after enactment of this bill, an assessment of its staffing allocation model to determine the necessary staffing positions, including use of canine explosives detection teams and technology, at all US airports at which the TSA operates passenger checkpoints. The staffing allocation model shall be based on staffing levels necessary to maintain minimal passenger wait times and maximum security effectiveness. The TSA shall require each Federal Security Director to engage regularly with appropriate aviation security stakeholders to exchange information regarding airport and security operations. The Government Accountability Office shall review the assessment. The TSA shall also: require Transportation Security Officers with appropriate certifications and training to be assigned to passenger and baggage security screening functions. Use other TSA personnel who may not have certification and training to screen passengers or baggage for tasks not directly related to security screening, including restocking bins and giving instructions and support to passengers in security lines, assess headquarters personnel. And reassign appropriate personnel to assist with airport security screening activities on a permanent or temporary basis. Within 30 days after enactment of this bill the TSA shall: utilize TSA Behavior Detection Officers for passenger and baggage security screening, including the verification of traveler documents, particularly at designated PreCheck lanes to ensure that they are operational for use and maximum efficiency. Make every practicable effort to grant additional flexibility and authority to Federal Security Directors in matters related to checkpoint and checked baggage staffing allocation and employee overtime in furtherance of maintaining minimal passenger wait times and maximum security effectiveness. Disseminate to aviation security stakeholders and appropriate TSA personnel a list of checkpoint optimization best practices. Expand efforts to increase the public's participation in the TSA PreCheck program. And request the Aviation Security Advisory Committee to make recommendations on best practices for checkpoint operations optimization. By the same 30-day deadline the TSA shall direct each Federal Security Director to coordinate local representatives of aviation security stakeholders to establish a staffing advisory working group at each airport at which the TSA oversees or performs passenger security screening to give recommendations to TSA on Transportation Security Officer staffing numbers. The bill defines the term quot, aviation security stakeholdersquot. To mean air carriers, airport operators, and labor organizations representing Transportation Security Officers or contract screeners."
