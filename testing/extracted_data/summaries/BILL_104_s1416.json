    "content": "Genetic Privacy and Nondiscrimination Act of 1995 - Establishes limitations with respect to the disclosure and use of genetic information. Prohibits disclosure of genetic information about an individual unless specifically authorized by the individual involved, or the individual's legal representative, through a written authorization which includes a description of the information being disclosed, the name of the individual or entity to whom the disclosure is being made, and the purpose of the disclosure. Allows such a disclosure if it is: (1) authorized under Federal or State criminal laws relating to the identification of individuals, or as is necessary for the purpose of a criminal or death investigation, a criminal or juvenile proceeding, an inquest, or a child fatality review by a multidisciplinary child abuse team. (2) required under the specific order of a Federal or State court. (3) authorized under Federal or State law for the purpose of establishing paternity. (4) intended to furnish genetic information relating to a decedent to the decedent's blood relatives for the purpose of medical diagnosis. Or (5) intended for the identification of bodies. Prohibits any employer from seeking to obtain, obtaining, or using the genetic information of an employee or a prospective employee, or requiring a genetic test of an employee or prospective employee, to distinguish between or discriminate against or restrict any right or benefit otherwise due or available to the employee or prospective employee. Provides for enforcement of such prohibition through the same powers, procedures, and remedies that are provided to a person alleging a violation under specified provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Prohibits an insurer offering health insurance from using genetic information to reject, deny, limit, cancel, refuse to renew, increase the rates of, or otherwise affect health insurance. Requires, if an insurer requests that an insurance applicant take a genetic test, that: (1) the use of the results of such test be disclosed to the applicant. And (2) the insurer obtain the applicant's specific written authorization for such disclosure. Prohibits an insurer from using such a genetic test as an inducement for the purchase of insurance. Directs the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to report to the appropriate congressional committees its recommendations on the development and implementation of appropriate standards: (1) to provide increased protection for the collection, storage, and use of identifiable DNA samples and genetic information obtained from those samples. And (2) for the acquisition and retention of genetic information in all settings, including appropriate exceptions."
