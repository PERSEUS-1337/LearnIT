    "content": "In November 2003, the Administration notified Congress that it intended to beginnegotiations on a free-trade agreement (FTA) with four Andean countries - Colombia, Peru,Ecuador, and Bolivia. The notification said that an FTA would reduce and eliminate foreign barriersto trade and investment and would support democracy and fight drug activity in the Andean region. The Andean governments wanted to ensure access to the U.S. market, especially since their currenttrade preferences will terminate at the end of 2006. In the United States, the business communityindicated strong support for the trade agreement, with labor opposing it as the case for many FTAs,and the agriculture community was split. The Andean-U.S. FTA negotiations began in May 2004, when the United States, Colombia,Peru, and Ecuador participated in the first round of talks. Bolivia participated as an observer. Afterthirteen rounds of talks, however, negotiators failed to reach an agreement. After the last set of talks,Peru decided to continue negotiating, without Colombia or Ecuador, and concluded a bilateralagreement with the United States in December 2005. Colombia later continued negotiations withthe United States and this agreement was successfully concluded on February 27, 2006. Negotiationswith Ecuador are stalemated. A senior US trade official recently stated that the Peru and ColombianFTAs are likely to be submitted to Congress as separate agreements, thereby constraining thepossibility of an Andean-U.S. FTA. The United States currently extends duty-free treatment to imports from the four Andeancountries under a regional preference program. The Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA)authorized the President to grant duty-free treatment to certain products, and the Andean TradePromotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) reauthorized the ATPA program and addedproducts that had been previously excluded. Over half of all U.S. imports in 2005 from the Andeancountries entered under these preferences. In 2005, the United States imported $20.1 billion from the four Andean countries andexported $9.9 billion. Colombia accounted for about half of U.S. trade with the region. Peru andEcuador almost evenly split the other half, and Bolivia represented a very small share. The leadingU.S. import from the region in 2005 was crude petroleum oil, which accounted for 35% of imports. Leading U.S. exports to the region were petroleum products, mining equipment, and broadcastingequipment. There were several important issues in the FTA negotiations. The trade negotiators statedthat the main obstacles to concluding an overall agreement were in agriculture and intellectualproperty rights. Another major concern was the issue of labor standards. Under the notificationprocedures founded in the Trade Promotion Authority Act, the trade agreements with Peru andColombia could be voted on by the Congress sometime this summer. The narrow passage ofCAFTA-DR had been viewed as an indicator that any U.S.-Andean FTA might also faceconsiderable opposition. How the Bush Administration's decision to negotiate and submit separateFTAs with Peru and Colombia might affect this calculation remains uncertain. This report will notbe updated."
