    "content": "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes funding for civil projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of the Interior'sBureau of Reclamation (BuRec), most of the Department of Energy (DOE), and a number of independent agencies. The Administration requested $22 billion forthese programs for FY2000. The House and Senate approved $21.3 billion. Low allocations under Section 302 (b) of the Budget Act created difficulties for Appropriations Committees in both Houses. The Senate Committee responded bycutting water projects for the Corps and BuRec, and keeping DOE funding about at the requested level. The HouseAppropriations Committee increased moneyfor the Corps and cut about $1.5 billion from DOE, much of it in the weapons program. The Senate passed the bill( S. 1186 ) June 16, 1999. TheHouse passed its version of the bill ( H.R. 2605 ) July 27, 1999. The House-Senate Conference Committeereported out its agreement on September24, 1999, with some of the Senate cuts to the Corps, and some of the House cuts to DOE, restored. The bill wassigned by the President on September 29, 1999( P.L. 106-60 ). Other key issues involving Energy and Water Development appropriations programs included: Policy issues related to wetlands regulatory programs involving the Corps; the Bureau of Reclamation's controversial Animas-La Plata project in Colorado, a large irrigation and tribal projects with likely controversialenvironmental impacts, for which the Administration requested no new appropriations in FY2000; a pending decision by DOE on the electrometallurgical treatment of nuclear spent fuel for storage and disposal, a process that opponentscontend raises nuclear nonproliferation concerns; proposed funding increases for DOE's accelerated computer simulation efforts to simulate nuclear weapons explosions and other importantaspects of the nuclear weapons stockpile; increased funding for DOE's Nuclear Cities Initiative in Russia, to find alternative work for unemployed Russian nuclear weaponsdesigners; NRC's plans to overhaul its regulatory system for nuclear power plant safety, as urged by the House and Senate AppropriationsCommittees; The ongoing controversy over interim civilian nuclear waste storage; and DOE's \"privatization\" program for nuclear waste cleanup.
