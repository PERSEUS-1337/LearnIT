    "content": "Mexican Agricultural Trade Compliance Act - Determines that US rights under the Uruguay Round Agreements are being denied by Mexico in connection with Mexico's imposition of a 20 percent tax on soft drinks containing high fructose corn syrup, an extension of Mexico's unjustified antidumping order on high fructose corn syrup from the United States. Directs the US Trade Representative, unless certifying to Congress within 30 days after the enactment of this Act that Mexico has eliminated such tax and is otherwise preserving all US trade agreement rights with respect to high fructose corn syrup, to either: (1) suspend, withdraw, or prevent the application of benefits of trade agreement concessions to carry out a trade agreement with Mexico. Or (2) impose duties or other import restrictions on the goods of Mexico, and fees or restrictions on the services of Mexico."
