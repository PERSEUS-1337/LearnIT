    "title": "AB 1920",
    "content": "Under existing law, the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee administers the federal and state low-income housing tax credit programs. Existing law requires the committee to allocate the housing credit on a specified regular basis and requires the committee to only allocate credits to a project if the housing sponsor enters into a specified regulatory agreement. Existing law authorizes the committee to make any allocation or reservation of the state\u2019s housing credit ceiling to a housing credit applicant subject to specified terms and conditions. Existing law establishes the Housing Rehabilitation Loan Fund, which is continuously appropriated to the Department of Housing and Community Development, to fund various housing-related purposes. This bill would authorize the committee to establish a specified schedule of fines for violations of the terms and conditions, the regulatory agreement, other agreements, or program regulations. The bill would require the committee to define serious violations and, except for serious violations, would require a first-time property owner violator to be given the opportunity to correct the violation before the fine is imposed. The bill would authorize a property owner to appeal a fine to the committee. The bill would require these fines to be deposited in the Housing Rehabilitation Loan Fund and would authorize the committee to record a property lien if the fine has not been paid within a specified period of time. By depositing these fines into the Housing Rehabilitation Loan Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, the bill would make an appropriation."
