    "title": "SB 478",
    "content": "The Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act requires a mandated reporter, as defined, to make a report to a specified agency whenever the mandated reporter, in his or her professional capacity or within the scope of his or her employment, has knowledge of or observes a child whom the mandated reporter knows or reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse or neglect. Existing law further requires the mandated reporter to make an initial report by telephone to the agency immediately or as soon as is practicably possible, and to prepare and send, fax, or electronically transmit a written followup report within 36 hours of receiving the information concerning the incident. This bill, until January 1, 2021, would authorize certain county welfare agencies to develop a pilot program for Internet-based reporting of child abuse and neglect, as specified. The bill would impose specified standards on a county that participates in the pilot program. The bill would also require the State Department of Social Services to consult with the County Welfare Directors Association of California and the county welfare agencies of the individual counties to determine which counties may be involved in the pilot program. The bill would require the department to oversee and administer the pilot program, and require a county that chooses to participate in the pilot program to hire an evaluator to monitor implementation of the program. The bill would require a county that participates in the pilot program to develop outcome measures that determine the effectiveness of the pilot program of the county, as specified, and report to specified committees of the Legislature on or before January 1, 2020, on the effectiveness of the pilot program. The bill would authorize the department to conclude the pilot program prior to January 1, 2021, if the evaluation and monitoring indicate that implementation of the program compromises the safety of children."
