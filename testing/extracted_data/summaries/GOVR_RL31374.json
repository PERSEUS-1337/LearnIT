    "content": "In 2005, the most recent year for which data are available, just under $2 trillion was spent on health care and health-related activities. This amount represents a 6.9% increase over 2004 spending. The majority of health spending (84%) went towards paying for health care goods and services provided directly to individuals. These goods and services are referred to as personal health care. The remaining 16% of health spending covered research, public health activities, administrative costs, structures, and equipment. Personal health care expenditures grew 7.1% in 2005, continuing a downward trend in the growth of expenditures that peaked in recent times in 2001 at 8.7%. From the beginning of 1992 to the end of 2000, personal health expenditures grew at an average annual rate of 5.8%, historically low levels not seen since 1960. Compared with spending increases over the past 40 years, the 7.1% increase that occurred in 2005 is relatively moderate. In particular, the years 1979 through 1981 experienced growth rates between 13.8% and 15.9%. Relative to the overall economy, personal health expenditures increased in 2005. In 2005, personal health expenditures accounted for 13.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), up from 13.2% of GDP in 2004 and 2003, 12.8% of GDP in 2002, and 12.2% in 2001. For the nine years prior to 2001, health spending as a percentage of GDP was relatively constant. From 1992 to 2000, personal health expenditures, as a percentage of GDP, stayed between 11.5% and 11.7%. During the three decades prior to the 1990s, personal health expenditures, as a percentage of GDP, increased almost every year. Home health care spending was the fastest growing category of personal health care in 2005. Home health care spending in 2005 was 11.1% higher than the amount spent in 2004. Yet, because home health care represents about 3% of personal health expenditures, it was one of the smallest contributors to overall growth in personal health spending. Hospital care, which grew 7.9% in 2005 and accounts for more than one-third of personal health expenditures, contributed the most to overall growth in personal health spending. Spending on physician and clinical services, which grew at 7.0% in 2005 and accounts for one-fourth of personal health expenditures, was the second largest contributor to overall growth in personal health spending. Over 85% of personal health expenditures in 2005 were financed by third-party payers. The largest payer, private health insurance, financed 36% of all personal health expenditures. The second-largest payer, the federal government, accounted for 34% of all personal health spending. Certain categories of health care are funded primarily by third-party payers, whereas other categories are financed almost entirely out-of-pocket. The federal government is the largest payer of hospital care and nursing home and home health care. Private health insurance is the largest payer of dental services and prescription drugs. Out-of-pocket expenditures are the largest source of funding for non-durable medical goods (which include over-the-counter drugs) and durable medical goods (which include eyeglasses)."
