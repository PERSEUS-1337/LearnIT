    "content": "In the late 1990s, the United States began to focus on the possible deployment of defenses against long-range ballistic missiles. The planned National MissileDefense (NMD) system would have exceeded the terms of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Recognizing this,the Clinton Administration sought toconvince Russia to modify the terms of the Treaty. But Russia was unwilling to accept any changes to the Treaty. It also decried the U.S plan to deploy NMD,insisting that it would upset strategic stability and start a new arms race. Russia claimed that the ABM Treaty is the \"cornerstone of strategic stability\" and that, without its limits on missile defense, the entire framework of offensivearms control agreements could collapse. Furthermore, Russia argued that a U.S. NMD system would undermineRussia's nuclear deterrent and upset stability byallowing the United States to initiate an attack and protect itself from retaliatory strike. The Clinton Administrationclaimed that the U.S. NMD system would bedirected against rogue nations and would be too limited to intercept a Russian attack. But Russian officialsquestioned this argument. They doubted that roguenations would have the capability to attack U.S. territory for some time, and they believed that the United Statescould expand its NMD system easily. Furthermore, they argued that, when combined with the entirety of U.S. conventional and nuclear weapons, an NMDsystem would place the United States in aposition of strategic superiority. During the Clinton Administration and first year of the Bush Administration, Russian officials stated that, if the United States withdrew from the ABM Treaty anddeployed an NMD, Russia would withdraw from a range of offensive arms control agreements. Furthermore, Russiacould deploy multiple warheads on itsICBMs to overcome a U.S. NMD, or deploy new intermediate-range missiles or shorter-range nuclear systems toenhance its military capabilities. Russia has also outlined diplomatic and cooperative military initiatives as alternatives to the deployment of a U.S. NMD. Russia has proposed that theinternational community negotiate a Global Missile and Missile Technology Non-Proliferation regime as a meansto discourage nations from acquiring ballisticmissiles. It has also suggested that it would cooperate with nations in Europe to develop and deploy defensesagainst theater-range ballistic missiles. Manyanalysts believe this proposal was designed to win support among U.S. allies for Russia's opposition to the U.S.NMD program. U.S. officials expressed aninterest in the idea but said it could not substitute for defenses against longer-range missiles. The Clinton Administration sought to address Russia's concerns by offering continued support to the fundamental principles of the ABM Treaty and by seeking toconvince Russia that the U.S. NMD system would remain too limited to threaten Russia's nuclear deterrent. TheBush Administration, in contrast, has supportedmore robust missile defenses, but it also has stated that they will not be directed against Russia's offensive forces. The President has indicated that the UnitedStates will need to move beyond the limits in the ABM Treaty, but he suggested that Russia join the United Statesin developing a new strategic framework."
