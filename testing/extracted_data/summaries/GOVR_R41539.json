    "content": "This report provides background data on U.S. arms sales agreements with and deliveries to its major purchasers during calendar years 2002-2009, made through the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. In a series of data tables, it lists the total dollar values of U.S. government-to-government arms sales agreements with its top five purchasers, and the total dollar values of U.S. arms deliveries to those purchasers, in five specific regions of the world for three specific periods: 2002-2005, 2006-2009, and 2009 alone. In addition, the report provides data tables listing the total dollar values of U.S. government-to-government arms agreements with and deliveries to its top 10 purchasers worldwide for the periods 2002-2005, 2006-2009, and for 2009 alone. This report is prepared in conjunction with CRS Report R41403, Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 2002-2009, by [author name scrubbed]. That annual report details both U.S. and foreign arms transfer activities globally and provides analysis of arms trade trends. The intent here is to complement that elaborate worldwide treatment of the international arms trade by providing only the dollar values of U.S. arms sales agreements with and delivery values to its leading customers, by geographic region, for the calendar years 2002-2005, 2006-2009, and 2009. Unlike CRS Report R41403, this annual report focuses exclusively on U.S. arms sales and provides the specific names of the major U.S. arms customers, by region, together with the total dollar values of their arms purchases or deliveries. This report will not be updated."
