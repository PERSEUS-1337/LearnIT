    "title": "AB 2274",
    "content": "The California Credit Union Law provides for the regulation of credit unions within the state by the Commissioner of Business Oversight. The law requires a credit union to be directed by a board of directors consisting of an odd number of directors, at least 5 in number, each of whom are a member of the credit union, to be elected by the members at their annual meeting. The law requires a credit union to have a supervisory committee of at least 3 persons, each of whom is a member of the credit union. The law authorizes the directors to delegate the approval of applications for new memberships to any officer, director, committee member, or employee pursuant to a written membership plan adopted by the board, provided the board reviews, at least quarterly, a report of membership applications approved by an officer, director, committee member, or employee. This bill would require the board to meet on a regular basis, not less than quarterly, as reasonably determined by the board. The bill would require the membership of the supervisory committee to be an odd number and would authorize, in lieu of the requirement for a supervisory committee, the establishment of an audit committee and the selection of the members of the audit committee. The bill would remove the requirement for the directors to, at least quarterly, review a report of membership applications approved by an officer, director, committee member, or employee to whom the directors delegated the authority to approve applications for new membership. The California Credit Union Law prohibits an obligation with a member that is not a natural person and results in liability to the credit union in excess of that member\u2019s investment in the credit union unless an exception is authorized in the credit union\u2019s bylaws and approved by the commissioner. The law authorizes any lending activity permitted pursuant to this provision to be terminated by the commissioner pursuant to a specific procedure. This bill would repeal this prohibition. The California Credit Union Law limits the circumstances when a nonmember may participate in an obligation or extension of credit to a member as a joint applicant or co-obligor. This bill would include the terms coborrower, surety, and guarantor within these provisions. The California Credit Union Law limits a credit union from entering, directly or indirectly, into any obligation with an official, and defines that term to mean a director, officer, member of the supervisory committee, or member of the credit committee of a credit union. This bill would modify that definition to remove the position of an officer, and to include the positions of a member of the audit committee, credit manager, president, and chief executive officer of a credit union. The California Credit Union Law requires any application for any loan or extension or guarantee of credit, except as specified, to state in writing the purpose for which the loan or extension or guarantee of credit is desired, and, if applicable, describe the property that is proposed to secure the loan or extension or guarantee of credit. This bill would repeal this requirement."
