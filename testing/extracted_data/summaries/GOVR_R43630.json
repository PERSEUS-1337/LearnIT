    "content": "The federal law commonly known as the \"Hatch Act\" applies to all federal officers and employees\u2014other than the President and Vice President\u2014in the agencies, departments, bureaus, and offices of the executive branch of the federal government. Under the significant amendments made to the law in 1993, the Hatch Act now generally permits most federal employees to engage in a wide range of voluntary, partisan political activities on their own off-duty time and away from the federal workplace. Some employees in specified agencies and positions, including those dealing with law enforcement and national security matters, it should be noted, may be subject to further restrictions on their off-duty partisan political activities, and may not take any active part in political management or political campaigns. Although most officers and employees in the executive branch of the federal government are now free to engage in most voluntary, partisan political activities on their own free time, employees in the executive branch may still not be candidates \"for election to a partisan political office\" (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7323(a)(3)), that is, federal employees may generally not be candidates for elective office in a partisan election. Most civilian employees in the executive branch may, however, (1) run for office in a \"nonpartisan\" election (that is, an election in which none of the candidates represents a political party); (2) run as an \"independent\" in partisan elections in certain specified, exempt communities in which a number of federal employees reside; and (3) be candidates for and hold positions in political parties and their affiliated organizations."
