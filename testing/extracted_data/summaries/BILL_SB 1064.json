    "title": "SB 1064",
    "content": "Existing law, until January 1, 2017, authorizes the Counties of Alameda and Los Angeles, respectively, to create a pilot project, contingent upon local funding, for the purposes of developing a comprehensive, replicative, multidisciplinary model to address the needs and effective treatment of commercially sexually exploited minors, as specified. This bill would extend the operation of this program indefinitely in the County of Alameda. The bill would also expand the definition of a \u201ccommercially sexually exploited minor\u201d to include, among others, a minor who has been adjudged a dependent of the juvenile court because he or she is a commercially sexually exploited child, and would create a presumption that, if a minor has been arrested for engaging in prostitution, or is the subject of a petition to adjudge him or her a dependent of the juvenile court because he or she is a commercially sexually exploited child, he or she is a commercially sexually exploited minor for the purposes of that definition. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Alameda."
