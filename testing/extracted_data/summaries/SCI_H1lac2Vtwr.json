In this study, we focused on one such self-attention network model, namely BERT, which has performed well in terms of stacking layers across diverse language-understanding benchmarks. However, in many downstream tasks, information between layers is ignored by BERT for fine-tuning. In addition, although self-attention networks are well-known for their ability to capture global dependencies, room for improvement remains in terms of emphasizing the importance of local contexts. In light of these advantages and disadvantages, this paper proposes SesameBERT, a generalized fine-tuning method that (1) enables the extraction of global information among all layers through Squeeze and Excitation and (2) enriches local information by capturing neighboring contexts via Gaussian blurring. Furthermore, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in the HANS dataset, which is used to determine whether models have adopted shallow heuristics instead of learning underlying generalizations. The experiments revealed that SesameBERT outperformed BERT with respect to GLUE benchmark and the HANS evaluation set. In recent years, unsupervised pretrained models have dominated the field of natural language processing (NLP). The construction of a framework for such a model involves two steps: pretraining and fine-tuning. During pretraining, an encoder neural network model is trained using large-scale unlabeled data to learn word embeddings; parameters are then fine-tuned with labeled data related to downstream tasks. Traditionally, word embeddings are vector representations learned from large quantities of unstructured textual data such as those from Wikipedia corpora (Mikolov et al., 2013) . Each word is represented by an independent vector, even though many words are morphologically similar. To solve this problem, techniques for contextualized word representation (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019) have been developed; some have proven to be more effective than conventional word-embedding techniques, which extract only local semantic information of individual words. By contrast, pretrained contextual representations learn sentence-level information from sentence encoders and can generate multiple word embeddings for a word. Pretraining methods related to contextualized word representation, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) , OpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) , and ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) , have attracted considerable attention in the field of NLP and have achieved high accuracy in GLUE tasks such as single-sentence, similarity and paraphrasing, and inference tasks . Among the aforementioned pretraining methods, BERT, a state-of-the-art network, is the leading method that applies the architecture of the Transformer encoder, which outperforms other models with respect to the GLUE benchmark. BERT's performance suggests that self-attention is highly effective in extracting the latent meanings of sentence embeddings. This study aimed to improve contextualized word embeddings, which constitute the output of encoder layers to be fed into a classifier. We used the original method of the pretraining stage in the BERT model. During the fine-tuning process, we introduced a new architecture known as Squeeze and Excitation alongside Gaussian blurring with symmetrically SAME padding (\"SESAME\" hereafter). First, although the developer of the BERT model initially presented several options for its use, whether the selective layer approaches involved information contained in all layers was unclear. In a previous study, by investigating relationships between layers, we observed that the Squeeze and Excitation method (Hu et al., 2018) is key for focusing on information between layer weights. This method enables the network to perform feature recalibration and improves the quality of representations by selectively emphasizing informative features and suppressing redundant ones. Second, the self-attention mechanism enables a word to analyze other words in an input sequence; this process can lead to more accurate encoding. The main benefit of the self-attention mechanism method is its high ability to capture global dependencies. Therefore, this paper proposes the strategy, namely Gaussian blurring, to focus on local contexts. We created a Gaussian matrix and performed convolution alongside a fixed window size for sentence embedding. Convolution helps a word to focus on not only its own importance but also its relationships with neighboring words. Through such focus, each word in a sentence can simultaneously maintain global and local dependencies. We conducted experiments with our proposed method to determine whether the trained model could outperform the BERT model. We observed that SesameBERT yielded marked improvement across most GLUE tasks. In addition, we adopted a new evaluation set called HANS , which was designed to diagnose the use of fallible structural heuristics, namely the lexical overlap heuristic, subsequent heuristic, and constituent heuristic. Models that apply these heuristics are guaranteed to fail in the HANS dataset. For example, although BERT scores highly in the given test set, it performs poorly in the HANS dataset; BERT may label an example correctly not based on reasoning regarding the meanings of sentences but rather by assuming that the premise entails any hypothesis whose words all appear in the premise (Dasgupta et al., 2018) . By contrast, SesameBERT performs well in the HANS dataset; this implies that this model does not merely rely on heuristics. In summary, our final model proved to be competitive on multiple downstream tasks. This paper proposes a fine-tuning approach named SesameBERT based on the pretraining model BERT to improve the performance of self-attention networks. Specifically, we aimed to find highquality attention output layers and then extract information from aspects in all layers through Squeeze and Excitation. Additionally, we adopted Gaussian blurring to help capture local contexts. Experiments using GLUE datasets revealed that SesameBERT outperformed the BERT baseline model. The results also revealed the weight distributions of different layers and the effects of applying different Gaussian-blurring approaches when training the model. Finally, we used the HANS dataset to determine whether our models were learning what we wanted them to learn rather than using shallow heuristics. We highlighted the use of lexical overlap heuristics as an advantage over the BERT model. SesameBERT could be further applied to prevent models from easily adopting shallow heuristics.
