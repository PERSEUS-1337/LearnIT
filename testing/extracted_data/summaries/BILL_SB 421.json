    "title": "SB 421",
    "content": "Existing law requires a petroleum refinery employer to, every September 15, submit to the Division of Occupational Safety and Health information regarding planned turnarounds, as defined, for the following calendar year and provide onsite access to the division for inspection. Existing law establishes procedures for the public disclosure of turnaround information designated a trade secret, including authorization for a petroleum refinery employer to seek a declaratory judgment to prevent disclosure. Existing law requires a court to award attorney\u2019s fees to a party that prevails in an action to compel or prohibit the division from disclosing turnaround information. This bill would delete the requirement that a person requesting the release of the above-described information, or a petroleum refinery employer seeking to prevent disclosure, name the other as a real party in interest in an applicable action. The bill would delete the requirement that a person requesting release of this information provide notice of an action to compel disclosure to the petroleum refinery employer and would instead require the division to provide that notification. The bill would instead authorize the person to intervene in a petroleum refinery employer\u2019s declaratory relief action and require the court to permit that person to intervene. The bill would also require the court to allow the petroleum refinery employer to intervene in that action. The bill would also delete the requirement that the court award attorney\u2019s fees."
