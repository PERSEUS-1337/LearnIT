    "content": "Nepal is a poor country of an estimated 31 million people that has undergone a radical political transformation since 2006, when a 10-year armed struggle by Maoist insurgents, which claimed at least 13,000 lives, officially came to an end. The country's king stepped down in 2006, and two years later Nepal declared itself a republic, electing a Constituent Assembly (CA) in 2008 to write a new constitution. A second CA elected in 2013 reached agreement on a new constitution in September 2015. Though the process of democratization begun in 2006 has had setbacks and has been marked by violence, Nepal has conducted reasonably peaceful elections, brought former insurgents into the political system, and, in a broad sense, taken several large steps toward establishing a functioning democracy. New provincial demarcations contained in the new constitution, along with other provisions, have met with opposition by the minority Madhese people of the lowland Terai border region with India. This has led to violent protests and disruptions to cross-border trade that have led to economic hardship and fuel shortages in Nepal. Kathmandu has asserted that the Indian government is playing a role in this unrest. Some media coverage described this as an unofficial blockade of Nepal. In part as a result of these developments, Nepal is seeking closer energy and trade linkages with China. Among the drivers of congressional interest in Nepal are the country's still-unfolding democratization process, geopolitical and humanitarian concerns, and its location as a landlocked state situated between India and China. The United States and Nepal established diplomatic ties in 1948 and relations between the two countries are friendly. U.S. policy objectives toward Nepal include supporting democratic institutions and economic liberalization, promoting peace and stability in South Asia, supporting Nepalese territorial integrity, alleviating poverty, and promoting development. Nepal's status as a relatively small, landlocked buffer state situated between India and China largely defines the context of its foreign policy. This geopolitical dynamic is changing somewhat as Nepal appears to be the site of more intense diplomatic and economic activity by both India and China. Historically, Nepal's ties with India have been closer than its ties with China. Recent developments in the Terai, however, have encouraged Nepal to seek closer relations with China. China is developing trade, transport and development linkages with Nepal and has reportedly pressured Nepal to constrain the activities of Tibetan refugees in Nepal. Nepal was devastated by a massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake on April 25, 2015. The disaster killed over 8,000 and destroyed much of Nepal's housing and infrastructure. By one estimate, over half a million homes were destroyed. Reconstruction costs are estimated by some at $7 billion. The devastation wrought by the earthquake is compounded by economic hardship stemming from the ongoing discontent in the Terai. An international donors conference held in June 2015 led to significant pledges of assistance to help Nepal rebuild. Nepal faces other challenges, as well as potential opportunities. Trafficking remains a key human rights concern. Nepal also faces challenges related to demographic and climate change driven pressures on the environment. Nepal has extensive and underutilized hydropower potential that, if developed, could hold the promise of improved economic development for the nation."
