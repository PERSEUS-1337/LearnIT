    "content": "Existing Existing law authorizes the establishment of the San Diego Unified Port District for the acquisition, construction, maintenance, operation, development, and regulation of harbor works and improvements for the harbor of San Diego and for the promotion of commerce, navigation, fisheries, and recreation. Existing law specifies the territory to be included in the district and grants and conveys in trust to the San Diego Unified Port District in the County of San Diego all the right, title, and interest of the State of California acquired by the state pursuant to specified deeds. Existing law requires the State Lands Commission to manage specified public lands in the state, including tidelands and submerged lands. Existing law further establishes the Land Bank Fund in the State Treasury, and continuously appropriates moneys in the fund to the commission for expenditure for specified purposes related to land management, the preservation of open space, habitat for plants and animals, and public access. This bill would make nonsubstantive changes in those provisions pertaining to the territory held in trust by the San Diego Unified Port District. grant in trust to the district certain additional tidelands and submerged lands held by the state within the San Diego Bay, subject to certain terms and conditions, as prescribed. The bill would require the district, by June 30, 2017, and at the end of every fiscal year thereafter, to transfer to the State Lands Commission specified amounts of the revenues generated on those granted tidelands and submerged lands, and would require the commission to allocate those revenues to the Treasurer for deposit in the General Fund and the Land Bank Fund for management of the commission\u2019s granted lands program. By authorizing the deposit of additional moneys into a continuously appropriated fund, the bill would make an appropriation. The bill would require the commission, on or before July 1, 2019, to survey, monument, plat, and record or file with the Office of the County Recorder of the County of San Diego the area of tidelands and submerged lands granted pursuant to the bill. By imposing new duties on the district with regard to the management of, and accounting and transfer of funds from, those granted lands, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
