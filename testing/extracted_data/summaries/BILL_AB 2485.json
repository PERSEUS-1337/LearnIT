    "title": "AB 2485",
    "content": "Under the Dental Practice Act, the Dental Board of California is responsible for the licensure and regulation of dentists. Existing law establishes the Dental Corps Loan Repayment Program of 2002 to assist dentists who practice in an underserved area with loan repayment pursuant to an agreement between the board and the dentist, as specified. Existing law governs eligibility, application, selection, placement, and repayment for the program, and authorizes the board to adopt standards to implement the program relating to eligibility, placement, and termination. Existing law creates the Dentally Underserved Account within the State Dentistry Fund and moneys in the account are continuously appropriated for purposes of the program. This bill would require that the program be known as the California Dental Corps Loan Repayment Program and would revise program provisions regarding eligibility, application, selection, and placement. The bill would require the board to develop a process for repayment of loans or grants disbursed if the participant is terminated from the program or is not able to complete the required service obligation, as provided. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."
