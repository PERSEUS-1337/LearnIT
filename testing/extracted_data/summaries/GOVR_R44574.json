    "content": "The Congressional Research Service (CRS) regularly receives requests about the number, size, and programmatic details of federal benefits and services targeted toward low-income populations. This report is the most recent in a series that attempts to identify and discuss such programs, focusing on aggregate spending trends. The report looks at federal low-income spending from FY2008 (at the onset of the 2007-2009 recession) through FY2015 (after implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA). Programs discussed here provide health care, cash aid, food assistance, education, housing and development, social services, employment and training, and energy assistance to low-income people and communities. Despite the common feature of an explicit low-income focus, these programs are extremely diverse in their purpose, design, and target population. They do not include social insurance (e.g., Social Security, Medicare, Unemployment Compensation), which is meant to be universal, or tax provisions, with the exception of two targeted tax credits. Key findings include the following: In nominal dollars (not adjusted for inflation), federal spending for low-income assistance programs grew from $561 billion in FY2008 to $848 billion in FY2015, a 51% increase over the eight-year period. This increased spending occurred in two distinct episodes. First, after a sharp spike in FY2009 affecting all categories of benefits and services, low-income spending peaked at $763 billion in FY2011, largely in response to the recession. The second episode was driven almost entirely by health care. Spending growth from FY2013 ($744 billion) to FY2015 ($848 billion) was primarily due to the ACA Medicaid expansion. Most low-income spending is for noncash benefits and services; health care is the largest category and Medicaid the largest individual program. In FY2015, noncash benefits and services accounted for 82% of all low-income assistance and cash aid comprised 18%. Health care dominates federal spending for low-income programs, accounting for more than half (52%) of such spending in FY2015. Medicaid alone comprised 45% of all low-income spending that year. This report identifies a large number of programs intended to assist low-income people, but spending is concentrated among a few. The four largest programs\u2014Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Supplemental Security Income, and the Earned Income Tax Credit\u2014together accounted for 68% of all low-income spending in FY2015, and the top 10 programs comprised 83%. After the top four, these programs include (in descending size) Federal Pell Grants, the Medicare Part D Low-Income Drug Subsidy, the Additional Child Tax Credit, Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and Title I-A Education for the Disadvantaged grants. Spending patterns described here do not reflect congressional decisions about the aggregate size of low-income spending that should occur each year. The size of each program is a function of its design and budgetary classification (mandatory versus discretionary), congressional budget and appropriations processes, external influences affecting the cost of goods and services, and other factors. This report tells a story\u2014that low-income spending has grown sharply in recent years and is dominated by health care\u2014but given the diversity among programs that serve low-income people, further generalizations should be made with care."
