Makes such privilege inapplicable to information: (1) required to be developed, maintained, or reported pursuant to such laws. Or (2) with respect to a regulated entity's intentional or willful violation of such a law. Provides immunity from prosecution for voluntary disclosures of information relating to violations of an environmental law as a result of a voluntary environmental self-evaluation if certain conditions are met, including that the disclosure is made promptly and efforts to achieve compliance are initiated. Precludes immunity if the violation concerned is part of a pattern of significant violations."
