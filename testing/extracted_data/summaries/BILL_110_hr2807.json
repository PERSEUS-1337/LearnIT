(2) the destruction or discarding of, or risk of injury to, a living human embryo. Or (3) the use of any stem cell the derivation or provision of which would be inconsistent with this Act. Requires the Secretary to issue guidelines implementing this Act to ensure that any research supported under this Act: (1) is clearly consistent with the standards established in this Act, if conducted using human cells. (2) is prioritized in terms of potential for near-term clinical benefit in human patients. And (3) may take into account techniques outlined by the President's Council on Bioethics and any other appropriate techniques and research. Requires the Secretary to: (1) report on peer reviewed stem cell research proposals that were not funded. And (2) study and submit recommendations to Congress on any structural changes to the C. W.
