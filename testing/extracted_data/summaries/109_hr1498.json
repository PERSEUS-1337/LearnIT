Specifies factors for determining whether exchange-rate manipulation is occurring and a benefit thereby conferred. Applies the definition of exchange-rate manipulation to the Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) or any other public entity within its territory. Specifies: (1) factors for determining whether exchange-rate manipulation is occurring in the PRC. (2) actions to be taken, if a petition for an investigation alleges and reasonably documents that it is occurring. And (3) the standard for presidential action to prevent or remedy the market disruption at issue .
