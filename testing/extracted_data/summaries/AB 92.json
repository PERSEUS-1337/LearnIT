    "content": "Existing law requires any new diversion of water from any stream having populations of salmon and steelhead that is determined by the Department of Fish and Wildlife to be deleterious to salmon and steelhead to be screened by the owner of the diversion. Existing law requires the department to submit to the owner its proposals as to measures necessary to protect the salmon and steelhead within 30 days of receipt of a notice of a diversion of water from a stream having populations of salmon and steelhead. This bill would instead require the department, within 30 days of providing written notice to the owner that the department has determined that the diversion is deleterious to salmon and steelhead, to submit to the owner its proposals as to measures necessary to protect the salmon and steelhead. Existing law prohibits the construction or maintenance, in certain fish and game districts, of any device or contrivance that prevents, impedes, or tends to prevent or impede, the passing of fish up and down stream. A violation of this provision is a misdemeanor. This bill would impose an additional civil penalty of not more than $8,000 for a violation of this provision. Existing law declares that the diversion or use of water other than as authorized by specified provisions of law is a trespass. Existing law authorizes the executive director of the State Water Resources Control Board to issue a complaint to a person who violates certain laws regarding the use and diversion of water, and subjects the violator to administrative civil liability. Existing law requires that the complaint be served by personal notice or certified mail and inform the party served that the party may request a hearing not later than 20 days from the date the party was served. This bill would authorize the Director of the Department of Fish and Wildlife, or his or her designee, to issue a complaint in accordance with the above-specified provisions alleging that an unauthorized diversion or use of water harms fish and wildlife resources. Existing law prohibits a charter city from receiving or using state funding or financial assistance for a construction project if the city has a charter provision or ordinance that authorizes a contractor to not comply with prevailing wage provisions on any public works contract or if the city has awarded, within the prior 2 years, a public works contract without requiring the contractor to comply with prevailing wage provisions, as specified. Existing law authorizes charter cities to receive or use state funding or financial assistance if the city has a local prevailing wage ordinance, applicable to all of its public works contracts, that includes requirements that are equal to or greater than the state\u2019s prevailing wage requirements, as specified. This bill would exempt from that prohibition funding and financial assistance provided to a charter city in response to an emergency. Existing law provides various technical assistance opportunities to disadvantaged communities for projects relating to groundwater sustainability, clean drinking water, and water recycling and advanced treatment water technology projects. This bill would establish the Office of Sustainable Water Solutions within the State Water Resources Control Board to promote permanent and sustainable drinking water and wastewater treatment solutions to ensure effective and efficient provision of safe, clean, affordable, and reliable drinking water and wastewater treatment services. The bill would authorize the office to take certain actions in furtherance of this purpose. Existing law, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, authorizes the imposition and collection of civil and criminal penalties for specified violations of that act. The act requires certain moneys, including General Fund revenues of penalties, collected pursuant to these provisions to be deposited in the State Water Pollution Cleanup and Abatement Account in the State Water Quality Control Fund. The act continuously appropriates the moneys in the account to the State Water Resources Control Board for specified cleanup programs. The act authorizes the state board, upon application by a public agency, specified tribal governments, or not-for-profit organizations serving disadvantaged communities that have authority to clean up a waste or abate the effects of a waste to order moneys in the account to be paid to the entity to assist in cleaning up the waste or abating its effects on waters. This bill would, until July 1, 2018, additionally authorize the state board to pay these moneys to a community water system that serves a disadvantaged community and would authorize moneys in the account to be used to assist in addressing an urgent drinking water need. By authorizing new expenditures from a continuously appropriated account, this bill would make an appropriation. The bill would exempt projects using moneys paid pursuant to these provisions from state contracting and procurement requirements, as specified, and would authorize the state board to adopt guidelines for the allocation and administration of moneys in the account that would be exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act. Existing law establishes the CalConserve Water Use Efficiency Revolving Fund and provides that the moneys in the fund are available to the Department of Water Resources, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for the purpose of water use efficiency projects. Existing law requires moneys in the fund to be used for purposes that include, but are not limited to, at or below market interest rate loans to local agencies, as defined, and permits the department to enter into agreements with local agencies that provide water or recycled water service to provide loans. Existing law, the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, approved by the voters as Proposition 1 at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election, authorizes the issuance of general obligation bonds in the amount of $7,545,000,000 to finance a water quality, supply, and infrastructure improvement program. The bond act provides that the sum of $810,000,000 is to be available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for expenditures on, and competitive grants and loans to, projects that are included in and implemented in an adopted integrated regional water management plan and respond to climate change and contribute to regional water security. The bond act authorizes the use of $100,000,000 of those funds for direct expenditures, and for grants and loans, for certain water conservation and water use efficiency plans, projects, and programs. This bill would transfer to the CalConserve Water Use Efficiency Revolving Fund the sum of $10,000,000 of the proceeds of these bonds for water conservation and water use efficiency projects and programs to achieve urban water use targets. This bill would require the department to use $5,000,000 for a pilot project for local agencies to provide water efficiency upgrades to eligible residents. This bill would require the department to use the other $5,000,000 for local agencies to provide low-interest loans to customers to finance the installation of onsite improvements to repair or replace, as necessary, cracked or leaking water pipes to conserve water. The bill would authorize the department to provide local agencies with zero-interest loans of up to $3,000,000 and would require a local agency that receives a loan pursuant to these provisions to exercise reasonable efforts to recover the costs of the loan. The bill would also authorize the department to waive up to 10 of the repayment amount for costs that could not be recovered by a local agency. The State Contract Act generally provides for a contracting process by state agencies for public works of improvement pursuant to a competitive bidding process, under which bids are awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, with specified alternative bidding procedures authorized in certain cases. Existing law, the California Emergency Services Act, sets forth the emergency powers of the Governor under its provisions and empowers the Governor to proclaim a state of emergency for certain conditions, including drought. During a state of emergency, existing law authorizes the Governor to suspend any regulatory statute, or statute prescribing the procedure for conduct of state business, or the orders, rules, or regulations of any state agency where the Governor determines and declares that strict compliance with any statute, order, rule, or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay the mitigation of the effects of the emergency. Pursuant to this authority, the Governor proclaimed a state of emergency, and a continued state of emergency, due to drought conditions and suspended certain statutes. This bill would suspend the provisions of the Government Code and the Public Contract Code applicable to state contracts for purposes of state agencies implementing the Governor\u2019s orders proclaiming a state of emergency as long as the state of emergency due to drought conditions remains in effect. The bill would specify that these suspensions only apply to contracts that respond to conditions arising from the drought and that support the state agencies in specified actions. The bill would require approval by the Department of Finance prior to the execution of any contract entered into pursuant to this provision and would require that certain information relating to these contracts be posted on the California Drought Internet Web site. This bill would require an agency receiving moneys from one or more sources as appropriated pursuant to Assembly Bill 91 or Senate Bill 75 of the 2015\u201316 Regular Session to use the services of the California Conservation Corps or a certified community conservation corps, as defined, for restoration, ecosystem protection projects, or other similar work. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill."
