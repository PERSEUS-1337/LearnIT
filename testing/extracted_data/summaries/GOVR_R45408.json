    "content": "The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) is a federal food distribution program that supports food banks, food pantries, soup kitchens, and other emergency feeding organizations serving low-income Americans. Federal assistance takes the form of federally purchased commodities\u2014including fruits, vegetables, meats, and grains\u2014and funding for administrative costs. Food aid and funds are distributed to states using a statutory formula that takes into account poverty and unemployment rates. TEFAP is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS). TEFAP was established as the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program by the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983. The Emergency Food Assistance Act continues to govern program operations, while the Food and Nutrition Act provides mandatory funding authority for TEFAP commodities. Based on levels set in statute, appropriations provided $289.5 million in mandatory funding for TEFAP's \"entitlement\" commodities in FY2018. TEFAP also incorporates \"bonus\" commodities, which are distributed at USDA's discretion throughout the year to support different crops using separate budget authority. USDA purchased $268.6 million worth of bonus commodities for TEFAP in FY2017. A smaller amount of cash assistance ($64.4 million in FY2018) is appropriated to cover administrative and distribution costs under Emergency Food Assistance Act authority. These administrative funds are discretionary. USDA-FNS coordinates the purchasing of commodities and the allocation of commodities and administrative funds to states, and provides general program oversight. State agencies\u2014often state departments of health and human services, agriculture, or education\u2014determine program eligibility rules and allocations of aid to feeding organizations (called \"recipient agencies\"). States often task food banks, which operate regional warehouses, with distributing foods to other recipient agencies. TEFAP aid makes up a modest proportion of the food and funds available to emergency feeding organizations, which are reliant on private donations as well. TEFAP is the largest source of federal support for emergency feeding organizations. Other related food distribution programs focus on specific subpopulations; for example, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Emergency Food and Shelter Program distributes food to homeless individuals and USDA's Commodity Supplemental Food Program distributes food to low-income elderly individuals. TEFAP is typically amended and reauthorized through farm bills. Most recently, the 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) extended and provided additional funding for TEFAP's entitlement commodities. Current 2018 farm bill proposals (two versions of H.R. 2) would reauthorize and continue additional funding for entitlement commodities (as of the date of this report). They also include different approaches to incorporating non-federally donated foods and reducing food waste. Recent program developments include TEFAP's use in disaster response and receipt of commodities from the 2018 trade aid package."
