    "title": "SB 1414",
    "content": "Existing law requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to prescribe, by regulation, building design and construction standards and energy and water conservation design standards for new residential and nonresidential buildings. Existing law requires the Energy Commission to prescribe, by regulation, standards for minimum levels of operating efficiency to promote the use of energy-efficient and water-efficient appliances whose use requires a significant amount of energy or water on a statewide basis. Existing law requires that the minimum levels of operating efficiency be based on feasible and attainable efficiencies or feasible improved efficiencies that will reduce the energy or water consumption growth rates. Existing law prohibits a new appliance manufactured on or after the effective date of the operating efficiency standards to be sold or offered for sale in the state unless it is certified by the manufacturer to be in compliance with those standards. This bill would require the Energy Commission, by January 1, 2019, to approve a plan that will promote compliance with specified regulations in the installation of central air conditioning and heat pumps. The bill would authorize the Energy Commission to adopt regulations to increase compliance with permitting and inspection requirements for central air conditioning and heat pumps, and associated sales and installations, consistent with that plan. Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. The Reliable Electric Service Investments Act states the intent of the Legislature that the Public Utilities Commission continue to administer cost-effective energy efficiency programs that produce cost-effective energy savings, reduce customer demand, and contribute to the safe and reliable operation of the electrical distribution grid. Under the act, in order to receive a rebate or incentive offered by a public utility for an energy efficiency improvement or for the installation of energy efficient components, equipment, or appliances in buildings, the recipient is required to certify that the improvement or installation complied with any applicable permitting requirements and, if a contractor performed the installation or improvement, that the contractor holds the appropriate license for the work performed. This bill would limit the application of the above energy efficiency rebate and incentive provisions to customer or contractor recipients. The bill would require a customer or contractor to certify that an energy efficiency improvement or installation complies with any applicable specifications or requirements set forth in the California Building Standards Code in order to receive a rebate or incentive. The bill would require a customer or contractor receiving a rebate or incentive offered by a public utility for purchasing or installing central air conditioning or a heat pump, and their related fans, to additionally provide a proof of permit closure. The bill would also more specifically identify the Public Utility Commission\u2019s statutory authority for supervising cost-effective energy efficiency programs."
