    "content": "Benefit Authors without Limiting Advancement or Net Consumer Expectations (BALANCE) Act of 2003 - Amends Federal copyright law to: (1) include analog or digital transmissions of a copyrighted work within fair use protections. (2) provide that it is not a copyright infringement for a person who lawfully obtains or receives a transmission of a digital work to reproduce, store, adapt, or access it for archival purposes or to transfer it to a preferred digital media device in order to effect a non-public performance or display. (3) allow the owner of a particular copy of a digital work to sell or otherwise dispose of the work by means of a transmission to a single recipient, provided the owner does not retain his or her copy in a retrievable form and the work is sold or otherwise disposed of in its original format. And (4) permit circumvention of copyright encryption technology if it is necessary to enable a noninfringing use and the copyright owner fails to make publicly available the necessary means for circumvention without additional cost or burden to a person who has lawfully obtained a copy or phonorecord of a work, or lawfully received a transmission of it."
