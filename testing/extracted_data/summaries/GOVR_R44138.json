    "content": "The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), enacted in 1938, is the main federal legislation that establishes general wage and hour standards for most, but not all, private and public sector employees. Among other protections, the FLSA establishes that covered nonexempt employees must be compensated at one-and-a-half times their regular rate of pay for each hour worked over 40 hours in a workweek. The FLSA also establishes certain exemptions from its general labor market standards. One of the major exemptions to the overtime provisions in the FLSA is for bona fide \"executive, administrative, and professional\" employees (the \"EAP\" or \"white collar\" exemptions). The FLSA grants authority to the Secretary of Labor to define and delimit the EAP exemption \"from time to time.\" To qualify for this exemption from the FLSA's overtime pay requirement, an employee must be salaried (the \"salary basis\" test), must perform specified executive, administrative, or professional duties (the \"duties\" test), and must earn above a salary level threshold (the \"salary level\" test). In July 2015, the Secretary of Labor published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to make changes to the EAP exemption. After receiving approximately 294,000 comments on the NPRM, the Secretary of Labor published the Final Rule on the EAP exemption on May 23, 2016 (2016 final rule). The 2016 final rule is effective December 1, 2016. The major changes in the 2016 final rule include increasing the salary level threshold from the previous level of $455 per week to $913 per week and providing an automatic update to the salary level every three years. The 2016 final rule does not change the duties and responsibilities that employees must perform to be exempt. Thus, the 2016 final rule will affect EAP employees at salary levels between $455 and $913 per week in 2016. The Department of Labor (DOL) estimates that about 13.1 million workers will be affected in the first year, including about 4.2 million EAP employees who will become newly entitled to overtime pay. This report answers frequently asked questions about the overtime provisions of the FLSA, the EAP exemptions, and the 2016 final rule that defines and delimits the EAP exemption."
