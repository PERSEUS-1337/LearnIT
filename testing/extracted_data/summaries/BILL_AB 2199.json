    "title": "AB 2199",
    "content": "Existing law provides various circumstances that constitute rape, which are punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for 3, 6, or 8 years, except as specified. Existing law also prescribes circumstances that constitute unlawful sexual intercourse, some of which involve an adult perpetrator who engages in that unlawful intercourse with a minor, as specified. Unlawful sexual intercourse under those circumstances is punishable by imprisonment for 2, 3, or 4 years, and also may be subject to designated civil penalties or fines. Under existing law, any person 21 years of age or older who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is under 16 years of age is guilty of either a misdemeanor or a felony, punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by imprisonment pursuant to a specified provision of law for 2, 3, or 4 years. This bill would subject any person 21 years of age or older who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is under 16 years of age and is convicted of a felony to a sentence enhancement of 2 years, if the perpetrator holds a position of authority over the minor with whom he or she engaged in the act of unlawful sexual intercourse. By changing the penalty for the commission of unlawful sexual intercourse under the above circumstances, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing law makes it a crime for a person to engage in specified acts of a sexual nature with a minor, including lewd and lascivious conduct when the victim is a child of 14 or 15 years of age and the person is at least 10 years older, and sodomy, oral copulation, or sexual penetration of a minor under 16 years of age when the person is 21 years of age or older. This bill would impose an additional term of 2 years when a person who is convicted of a felony violation of the above crimes is a person who holds a position of authority, as defined, over the minor victim. By increasing the penalty for a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
