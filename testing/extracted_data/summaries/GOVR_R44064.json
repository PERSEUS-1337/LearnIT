    "content": "The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, P.L. 114-22 (S. 178), establishes and enhances a host of federal programs designed to prevent human trafficking and assist its victims. It also adjusts federal criminal law in the areas of substantive criminal law, victims' rights, and related criminal procedure. It is these adjustments that are the subject of this report. P.L. 114-22 amends the federal commercial sex trafficking statute, 18 U.S.C. 1591, to clarify the criminal liability of the advertisers and customers of a commercial sex trafficking enterprise. It modifies the Mann Act, which outlaws interstate and foreign travel for unlawful sex purposes, to encompass travel for the purpose of producing child pornography and to narrow the ignorance-of-age defense available in some cases involving travel in order to engage in sexual activity with children. It also seeks to make clear that the victims of federal crimes, victims of both sex trafficking offenses and other crimes, have a right to be notified of plea agreements and deferred prosecution agreements, even when the bargains are struck before formal charges are filed. It establishes a Domestic Trafficking Victims Fund to receive the special assessments levied on convicted trafficking and sex abuse offenders. Victims become entitled to access to confiscated proceeds for restitution purposes. P.L. 114-22 modifies federal bail laws so that defendants charged with human trafficking offenses may be held on preventive detention. Moreover, it authorizes court-supervised wiretaps in federal and state cases involving human trafficking. Finally, it directs the Secretary of Defense to provide the Attorney General with information concerning individuals convicted of offenses under military law which require them to register as sex offenders."
