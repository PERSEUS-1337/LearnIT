    "content": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a new highly infectious disease, was first identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2003. While the overall numberof confirmed cases is not high by comparison with statistics for other infectious diseases, the distanceand speed with which SARS spread raised an alarm over the potential risks to international publichealth. Containment appears to be working; however, there are fears that another SARS outbreakcould take place during the regular influenza season later in 2003. The United States was instrumental in the global effort to contain the spread of SARS. Affected countries responded in different ways. Singapore and Taiwan acted quickly andencouraged international support in curbing the spread of the virus. China, on the other hand, hasbeen criticized for down-playing the magnitude of the problem, particularly in the early phase of thedisease. This, some analysts contend, ultimately enabled the virus to cross borders and in the caseof Canada, hemispheres. This report takes a retrospective look at the global response by WHO and by those countries most affected. It reveals some of the challenges that may lie ahead for the global health community,such as global interdependence and transparency, surge capacity, management of public fear andinformation disclosure, coordination of different national responses, and lack of funding. Examiningthe impacts of SARS and lessons learned may be useful in the response to future outbreaks orincidences of new diseases. This report will not be updated."
