    "content": "Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act established the ability-to-repay (ATR) requirement. Under the ATR requirement, a lender must determine based on documented and verified information that, at the time a mortgage is made, the borrower has the ability to repay the loan. Lenders that fail to comply with the ATR rule could be subject to legal liability, such as the payment of certain statutory damages. A lender can comply with the ATR requirement in different ways, one of which is by originating a Qualified Mortgage (QM). When a lender originates a QM, it is presumed to have complied with the ATR requirement, which consequently reduces the lender's potential legal liability for its residential mortgage lending activities. The QM rule has several compliance options that a lender can use to have a mortgage that it originates receive QM status, one of which is the Small Creditor Portfolio QM. Critics of the QM rule argue that the Small Creditor Portfolio QM, which is intended to benefit small creditors that keep loans in portfolio, should be broadened. They propose modifying the rule to make it easier for a lender to comply if it keeps the loan instead of selling it. Proponents of an expanded portfolio QM disagree on several policy issues, but, in general, they argue that because the lender is holding the loan in its portfolio, it is exposed to the risks associated with the loan (such as the risk that the lender will not be repaid) and therefore has the incentive to ensure that the loan is safely underwritten. The lender, the argument goes, should be allowed to follow less prescriptive underwriting criteria when the mortgage is held in portfolio, and more lenders should be allowed to avail themselves of this option than is currently allowed. Critics of the expanded portfolio lending proposals counter that the incentives of holding the loan in portfolio are insufficient to protect consumers and that the existing protections in the rule are needed to ensure that the failures of the past are not repeated. This report analyzes the policy debate related to portfolio lending and qualified mortgages, focusing on the legislation that is the subject of congressional debate: H.R. 1210, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act; S. 1484, the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act; and S. 1491/H.R. 2642, the Community Lender Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act. The analysis in this report raises several issues: Economic theory supports different arguments that are made about whether a mortgage that is kept in portfolio is more or less likely to be prudently underwritten. The retained risk associated with keeping a mortgage in portfolio may provide the lender an incentive to ensure that the borrower is creditworthy, but increasing home prices and issues related to the arbitrage of capital requirements may provide incentives to keep mortgages in portfolio that may be profitable but not prudently underwritten. Empirical research has also led to conflicting results. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau argues that small creditors may have \"strong incentives and particular ability\" to make mortgages that accurately assess a borrower's ability to repay that larger lenders may not have. It is unclear, however, what the appropriate size thresholds should be and whether other factors, such as keeping the mortgage in portfolio, can compensate for a larger lender's possibly reduced incentives and ability. It is unclear how significant an effect an expanded portfolio QM option would have on credit availability, as the mortgages that would qualify for the expanded option may already receive QM status under existing options. The legislative proposals may, however, have a greater effect on reducing a creditor's regulatory burden, as the lender may be able to use less cost-intensive underwriting processes of the expanded QM option. Although the burden may be reduced for the lender, it could be borne by consumers if they have fewer consumer protections under an expanded portfolio QM."
