    "content": "Private Wireless Spectrum Availability Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), within six months after enactment of this Act, to: (1) implement a system of spectrum lease fees applicable to newly allocated frequency bands assigned to systems in private wireless service. (2) provide incentives for licensees to confine their radio communications to the area of operation actually required for that communication. And (3) permit FCC-certified private land mobile frequency advisory committees (committees) to assist in the computation, assessment, collection, and processing of amounts received under the system of spectrum lease fees. Provides for: (1) a formula to be used by private wireless licensees and committees to compute spectrum lease fees. And (2) lease fees based on the approximate value of the assigned frequencies to licensees . Directs the FCC to allocate for use under its spectrum lease fee program not less than 12 megahertz of electromagnetic spectrum, previously unallocated to private wireless, located between 150 megahertz and 1000 megahertz on a nationwide basis. Provides for the delegation to committees of administrative functions under the spectrum lease system. States that nothing shall preclude the FCC from considering the public interest benefits of private wireless communications systems and making spectrum allocations under specified circumstances which preclude the need for, or requirement of, competitive bidding for such allocations. Establishes in the Treasury an account for the spectrum license fees generated under this Act. States that the implementation of spectrum lease fees as a license administration mechanism is not a substitute for effective spectrum allocation procedures."
