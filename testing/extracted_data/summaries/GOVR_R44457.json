    "content": "After the attacks of September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush authorized the National Security Agency to conduct a Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) to \"intercept international communications into and out of the United States\" by \"persons linked to al Qaeda or related terrorist organizations.\" After the TSP activities were concluded in 2007, Congress enacted the Protect America Act (PAA, P.L. 110-55 ), which established a mechanism for the acquisition, via a joint certification by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and the Attorney General (AG), but without an individualized court order, of foreign intelligence information concerning a person reasonably believed to be outside the United States. This temporary authority ultimately expired after approximately six months, on February 16, 2008. Several months later, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Amendments Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-261 ), which created separate procedures for targeting non-U.S. persons and U.S. persons reasonably believed to be outside the United States under a new Title VII of FISA. Title VII of FISA was reauthorized in late 2012 ( P.L. 112-238 ); this authority now sunsets on December 31, 2017. Significant details about the use and implementation of Section 702 of Title VII, which provides procedures for targeting non-U.S. persons who are abroad, became known to the public following reports in the media beginning in summer 2013. According to a partially declassified 2011 opinion from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), the National Security Agency (NSA) collected 250 million Internet communications per year under Section 702. Of these communications, 91% were acquired \"directly from Internet Service Providers,\" using a mechanism referred to as \"PRISM collection.\" The other 9% were acquired through what NSA calls \"upstream collection,\" meaning acquisition while Internet traffic is in transit from one unspecified location to another. In 2015, Congress enacted the USA FREEDOM Act ( P.L. 114-23 ) to reauthorize and amend various portions of FISA. While most of the amendments dealt with portions of FISA that were unrelated to Section 702, the act did include authority to continue surveillance of a non-U.S. person for 72 hours after the target is reasonably believed to be within the United States, but only if a lapse in surveillance of the target would pose a threat of death or serious bodily harm. A traditional FISA order for electronic surveillance must be obtained to continue surveillance after that period."
