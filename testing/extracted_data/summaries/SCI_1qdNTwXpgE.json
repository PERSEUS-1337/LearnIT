To be able to use an AR guidance system, we need a tool to quickly create a 3D representation of the assembly line and of its AR annotations. This tool should be very easy to use by an operator who is not an AR or VR specialist: typically the manager of the assembly line. This is why we proposed WAAT, a 3D authoring tool allowing user to quickly create 3D models of the workstations, and also test the AR guidance placement. WAAT makes on-site authoring possible, which should really help to have an accurate 3D representation of the assembly line. The verification of AR guidance should also be very useful to make sure everything is visible and doesn't interfere with technical tasks. In addition to these features, our future work will be directed in the deployment of WAAT into a real boiler assembly line to assess the usability of this solution. In a context of constant industrial evolution and a need of more industrial agility to answer the increasingly unpredictable customer requests, having well trained assembly line operators is extremely important. This operator training problematic is well known by the XXX company, a boiler manufacturer for which this training problem is very important during each winter, when boiler orders rise a lot, as many new operators must be hired for a few months. After meetings and interviews with the XXX company, it appears that the training of these operators requires time and human resources. Currently, the training is done in 3 days with one experienced operator showing three trainees how to perform the technical gestures at their workstation. During these training days, none of the workers actually works on the assembly line and no boiler is built. After that, it takes 2 weeks for the operator in training to perform the technical tasks in the required time. Furthermore, only 1/3 of the new operators accept the job at the end of the training. To improve the training of these new operators, we want to propose an AR-based operator training system, allowing the operators to train directly on the assembly line without the need of an experimented operator. This tool could also be used by experimented operator to train on a new position of the assembly line or on a different assembly line. AR can be used in many different ways in the industrial context. It can be use to make expert remote guidance, create new products in collaborative engineering, or realize digital inspection of new prototypes [3] . AR is also used to test the ergonomics of the workstations and the reachability of some equipment. Testing new layout for the plant is also one of the AR use [1] . These different use are interesting, but the most interesting feature of AR and the most used is the assembly assistance, for training use or not [12, 15] . To use our AR-based operator training system we need to be able to create quickly and easily a 3D representation of the assembly line, and to be able to place anchors and markers (the details will be given in section 3.2.1) for the AR guidance elements. Furthermore, this tool must be very easy to use because the operators are not used to this technology. Indeed, the final users of the authoring tool will be the line managers, who are not used to use AR devices, or don't even know what AR is. That is why we need to adapt the interactions to the line manager, to ease the use of the tool. The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we explain the industrial constraints for the use of this authoring tool. Section 3 contains the related work, justifying the choices made in section 4 which describes WAAT, our authoring tool. Finally, section 5 concludes this paper and discusses about future developments. So we created WAAT, a 3D authoring tool allowing untrained users to create 3D models of the assembly line in a boiler factory. WAAT allow fast creation and AR comparison of the 3D and the real model. In case of a mismatch, the user can move the 3D components to match the real workstation. He can test the AR guidance used to train assembly line operators to make sure everything is fully visible and doesn't interfere in the realization of the technical tasks. Every modification made in desktop and AR is saved in a file on a server so there is no need to change on multiple platform. WAAT needs to be tested with 3D elements corresponding to the factory's workstations to find the most suitable level of details the 3D objects need to have, and the level of fidelity in the positioning of the 3D objects. We also have to test this tool with real operators from the factory to test the usability and the intuitiveness of WAAT. To adapt the interactions used to move/rotate/resize the 3D objects to our users, adding accessories such as a controller will be explored. We will also test new AR systems to test their usability and native interactions to see if we can use them, or if we can adapt them to our users. The immersive mode of WAAT will allow us to visualize the augmented environment and test the placement of the operator guidance, even if it's not the focus right now. We will be able to simulate the AR test of the scenes without the need to be in the plant all the time."
