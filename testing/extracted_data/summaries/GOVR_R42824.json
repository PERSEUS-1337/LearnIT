    "content": "The federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was established in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct) and significantly expanded in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). The RFS requires the use of renewable biofuels in transportation fuel\u2014for 2013, the mandate was 16.55 billion gallons of renewable fuel. Within the larger mandate, there are sub-mandates (\"carve-outs\") for advanced biofuels (e.g., biomass-based diesel and cellulosic fuels). By 2022, the RFS requires the use of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels, including 21 billion gallons of advanced biofuels. For 2014, EPA has proposed lower mandates than those scheduled in EISA. The RFS is a market-based compliance system in which obligated parties (generally refiners and/or terminal operators) must submit credits to cover their obligations. These credits\u2014Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs\u2014are effectively commodities that can be bought or sold like other commodities. For each gallon of renewable fuel in the RFS program, one RIN is generated. Each RIN is a 38-digit number, with blocks of digits corresponding to various data, including the year the RIN was generated, the producer of the fuel, and the type of fuel. RINs are valid for use in the year they are generated and the following year. From the beginning of the RFS program, there have been concerns with RIN generation and the RIN market. Because of concerns over transposed digits, allegations of double-counting (intentional or unintentional) and other errors and inaccuracies, when EPA finalized rules for the RFS as expanded by EISA (the \"RFS2\"), EPA also established a new transaction system in an effort to address these concerns. All RIN transactions must be cleared through this system, called the EPA Moderated Transaction System (EMTS). From the beginning of the RFS2 EPA has maintained obligated parties must exercise due diligence. Under this \"buyer beware\" system those purchasing or receiving RINs must certify their validity on their own, and they are responsible for any invalid RINs they pass on to other buyers or submit to EPA for compliance. In late 2011 and early 2012, EPA issued Notices of Violations (NOVs) to three companies that the agency alleges fraudulently generated a combined 140 million biodiesel RINs in 2010 and 2011. In late 2013 EPA issued an NOV to a fourth company; in early 2014 two men were indicted for fraud in a separate case. Because of these RIN fraud cases, EPA is looking at establishing a system whereby RINs can be certified by third parties registered with EPA. EPA is considering whether such certification would provide obligated parties with an \"affirmative defense\" if RINs are later found to fraudulent\u2014that is, obligated parties would not be liable for penalties under the Clean Air Act for the use of such RINs. Key questions include whether such an affirmative defense would also eliminate the requirement to purchase make-up RINs. EPA proposed a plan in January 2013, but the rule has yet to be finalized. Most RINs are bought and sold through private contracts. However, there are also spot markets for RINs, and in 2013, spot prices for conventional ethanol RINs rose dramatically. Prices rose from roughly $0.07 per gallon in early January to over $1.40 per gallon in mid-July. Through the second half of 2013, prices dropped even more rapidly, although they rebounded somewhat in early 2014. Various factors have been identified by stakeholders as potentially causing the price increase, including whether sufficient amounts of ethanol can be blended into gasoline to meet the RFS mandates and the extent to which non-obligated parties are speculating in RIN markets. In the 112th and 113th Congresses several congressional hearings have been held and various bills have been proposed to address both RIN issues and the overall RFS."
