    "title": "An act to add Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 15400) to Division 6 of the Vehicle Code, relating to vehicles.",
    "content": "Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles, upon proper application, to issue driver\u2019s licenses and identification cards. The federal Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative facilitates travel within the western hemisphere by authorizing the use of enhanced driver\u2019s licenses and identification cards meeting specified requirements as travel documents. This bill would authorize the Department of Motor Vehicles to enter into a memorandum of understanding with a federal agency for the purpose of facilitating travel within the western hemisphere pursuant to the federal Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative through the issuance of an enhanced driver\u2019s license, provisional license, or identification card. The bill would authorize the department to issue or renew, upon request, an enhanced driver\u2019s license, provisional license, or identification card for specified persons. The bill would require a person applying for the initial issuance or renewal of an enhanced driver\u2019s license, provisional license, or identification card to submit, under the penalty of perjury, additional proof of identity, residency, and citizenship that satisfies the requirements of the federal Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. By expanding the scope of the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the department to provide a protective shield and to take other specified security measures for the enhanced driver\u2019s license, provisional license, or identification card. The bill would also require the department to submit an annual report to specified committees of the Legislature on the implementation of the enhanced driver\u2019s license, provisional license, and identification card. The bill would require a person applying for an enhanced driver\u2019s license, provisional license, or identification card to submit an additional application fee. The bill would require the department to set, by regulation, the application fee in an amount not to exceed the reasonable regulatory cost of issuing or renewing the license or identification card, or $55, whichever is less, and to provide specified information to the applicant. The bill would require the fees to be deposited into the Motor Vehicle Account. The bill would, upon appropriation by the Legislature, require those fees to be expended by the department in implementing the above provisions. The bill would prohibit specified information submitted by an applicant for an enhanced driver\u2019s license, provisional license, or identification card from being disclosed by the department, as specified. The bill would make all laws related to the privacy or security of a driver\u2019s license, provisional license, or identification document, or a similar document, or regulating the use, access or sharing of information, applicable to enhanced driver\u2019s licenses, provisional licenses, and identification cards. Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest. This bill would make legislative findings to that effect. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
