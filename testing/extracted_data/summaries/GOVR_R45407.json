    "content": "Approximately 26,000 state-approved teacher preparation programs are in operation across the United States. Among these, about 70% are traditional teacher preparation programs\u2014that is, they are contained within schools of education at institutions of higher education (IHEs). Of the remaining, alternative routes to teacher preparation, about two-thirds are based at an IHE and about one-third are operated independent of an IHE. The Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA, P.L. 89-329, as amended), includes financial support and accountability provisions intended to improve the quality of teacher preparation programs. Specifically, Title II, Part A of the HEA consists of two major components: (1) a competitive grant program intended to support a select group of programs that prepare teachers, and (2) reporting and accountability provisions intended to track and improve the quality of all teacher preparation programs. Title II-A authorizes the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program, which provides grants to about two dozen partnerships of teacher preparation programs and local educational agencies. The TQP receives annual appropriations of about $42 million. Title II-A also requires states (as a condition for receiving HEA funds) to report information on the performance of their teacher preparation programs and identify programs determined to be low-performing or at risk of low performance. This information is compiled by the Department of Education (ED), which annually issues a report on the quality of teacher preparation in the United States. The authorization of appropriations for Title II-A expired at the end of FY2011 and was extended for an additional fiscal year under the General Education Provisions Act. Along with many HEA programs whose authorizations have lapsed, Title II-A authorities were provided additional appropriations under a variety of appropriations legislation and continuing resolutions; most recently under P.L. 115-245, which provides full-year FY2019 appropriations for ED, among other agencies. The 115th Congress has considered legislation to reauthorize the HEA, including provisions in Title II, but has yet to do so. These efforts may resume in the 116th Congress. Some of the issues that may arise during this process that relate to Title II include consideration of the following: the appropriate role for the federal government to play in supporting innovations and reforms for teacher preparation programs; the optimal mix of TQP-authorized activities such as support for clinical practice, induction, mentoring, and pre-service assessment; and the extent to which current reporting and accountability provisions encourage program quality."
