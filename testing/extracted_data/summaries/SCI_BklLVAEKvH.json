    "content": "We introduce a novel end-to-end approach for learning to cluster in the absence of labeled examples. Our clustering objective is based on optimizing normalized cuts, a criterion which measures both intra-cluster similarity as well as inter-cluster dissimilarity. We define a differentiable loss function equivalent to the expected normalized cuts. Unlike much of the work in unsupervised deep learning, our trained model directly outputs final cluster assignments, rather than embeddings that need further processing to be usable. Our approach generalizes to unseen datasets across a wide variety of domains, including text, and image. Specifically, we achieve state-of-the-art results on popular unsupervised clustering benchmarks (e.g., MNIST, Reuters, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100), outperforming the strongest baselines by up to 10.9%. Our generalization results are superior (by up to 21.9%) to the recent top-performing clustering approach with the ability to generalize. Clustering unlabeled data is an important problem from both a scientific and practical perspective. As technology plays a larger role in daily life, the volume of available data has exploded. However, labeling this data remains very costly and often requires domain expertise. Therefore, unsupervised clustering methods are one of the few viable approaches to gain insight into the structure of these massive unlabeled datasets. One of the most popular clustering methods is spectral clustering (Shi & Malik, 2000; Ng et al., 2002; Von Luxburg, 2007) , which first embeds the similarity of each pair of data points in the Laplacian's eigenspace and then uses k-means to generate clusters from it. Spectral clustering not only outperforms commonly used clustering methods, such as k-means (Von Luxburg, 2007) , but also allows us to directly minimize the pairwise distance between data points and solve for the optimal node embeddings analytically. Moreover, it is shown that the eigenvector of the normalized Laplacian matrix can be used to find the approximate solution to the well known normalized cuts problem (Ng et al., 2002; Von Luxburg, 2007) . In this work, we introduce CNC, a framework for Clustering by learning to optimize expected Normalized Cuts. We show that by directly minimizing a continuous relaxation of the normalized cuts problem, CNC enables end-to-end learning approach that outperforms top-performing clustering approaches. We demonstrate that our approach indeed can produce lower normalized cut values than the baseline methods such as SpectralNet, which consequently results in better clustering accuracy. Let us motivate CNC through a simple example. In Figure 1 , we want to cluster 6 images from CIFAR-10 dataset into two clusters. The affinity graph for these data points is shown in Figure 1 (a) (details of constructing such graph is discussed in Section 4.2). In this example, it is obvious that the optimal clustering is the result of cutting the edge connecting the two triangles. Cutting this edge will result in the optimal value for the normalized cuts objective. In CNC, we define a new differentiable loss function equivalent to the expected normalized cuts objective. We train a deep learning model to minimize the proposed loss in an unsupervised manner without the need for any labeled datasets. Our trained model directly returns the probabilities of belonging to each cluster (Figure 1(b ) ). In this example, the optimal normalized cuts is 0.286 (Equation 1), and as we can see, the CNC loss also converges to this value (Figure 1(c) Optimal Normalized cuts #edge cuts = 1 per cluster volume = 2+2+3 = 7 1/7 + 1/7 = 0.286 Cluster 2 Cluster 2 Cluster 1 Figure 1: Motivational example: (a) affinity graph of 6 images from CIFAR-10, the objective is to cluster these images into two clusters. (b) CNC model is trained to minimize expected normalized cuts in an unsupervised manner without the need for any labeled data. For each data point, our model directly outputs the probabilities of it belonging to each of the clusters. (c) The CNC loss converges to the optimal normalized cuts value. In Algorithm 1 we show how we can scale this approach through a batch processing technique to large datasets. We compare the performance of CNC to several learning-based clustering approaches (SpectralNet , DEC (Xie et al., 2016) , DCN (Yang et al., 2017) , VaDE (Jiang et al., 2017) , DEPICT (Ghasedi Dizaji et al., 2017) , IMSAT (Hu et al., 2017) , and IIC (Ji et al., 2019) ) on four datasets: MNIST, Reuters, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Our results show up to 10.9% improvement over the baselines. Moreover, generalizing spectral embeddings to unseen data points, a task commonly referred to as out-of-sample-extension (OOSE), is a non-trivial task (Bengio et al., 2003; Belkin et al., 2006; Mendoza Quispe et al., 2016) . Our results confirm that CNC generalizes to unseen data. Our generalization results are superior (by up to 21.9%) to SpectralNet , the recent top-performing clustering approach with the ability to generalize. We propose CNC (Clustering by learning to optimize Normalized Cuts), a framework for learning to cluster unlabeled examples. We define a differentiable loss function equivalent to the expected normalized cuts and use it to train CNC model that directly outputs final cluster assignments. CNC achieves state-of-the-art results on popular unsupervised clustering benchmarks (MNIST, Reuters, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 and outperforms the strongest baselines by up to 10.9%. CNC also enables generation, yielding up to 21.9% improvement over SpectralNet , the previous best-performing generalizable clustering approach. Table 4 : Generalization results: CNC is trained on VGG and validated on MNIST-conv. During inference, the model is applied to unseen TensorFlow graphs: ResNet. Inception-v3, and AlexNet. The ground truth for AlexNet is Bal = 99%, Cut = 4.6%, for Inception-v3, is Bal = 99%, Cut = 3.7%, and for ResNet is Bal = 99% and Cut = 3.3%. GraphSAGE-on generalizes better than the other models."
