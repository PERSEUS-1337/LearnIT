    "content": "In April 1980, the federal government enacted the crude oil windfall profit tax on the U.S.oil industry. The main purpose of the tax was to recoup for the federal government much of therevenue that would have otherwise gone to the oil industry as a result of the decontrol of oil prices. Supporters of the tax viewed this revenue as an unearned and unanticipated windfall caused by highoil prices, which were determined by the OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries)cartel. Despite its name, the windfall profit tax (WPT) was actually an excise tax, not a profits tax,imposed on the difference between the market price of oil and an adjusted base price. While mostdomestically produced oil was subject to the tax (about 2/3 in 1985), the remaining 1/3 that wastax-exempt was significant (1.3 billion barrels in 1985, or 360,000 barrels per day). The $80 billionin gross revenues generated by the WPT between 1980 and 1988 was significantly less than the $393billion projected. Due to the deductibility of the WPT against the income tax, cumulative net WPTrevenues were about $38 billion, significantly less than the $175 billion projected. This reportpresents estimates of the amount of foregone oil production from 1980-1986 due to the WPT underthree alternative supply price responses, reflecting three different assumptions about the priceelasticity of the domestic oil supply function, a critical factor (statistic) in estimating lost oil outputand increased import dependence. From 1980 to 1988, the WPT may have reduced domestic oilproduction anywhere from 1.2% to 8.0% (320 to 1,269 million barrels). Dependence on importedoil grew from between 3% and 13%. The tax was repealed in 1988 because (1) it was anadministrative burden to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), (2) it was a compliance burden to theoil industry, (3) due to low oil prices, the tax was generating little or no revenues in 1987 and 1988,and (4) it made the United States more dependent on foreign oil. The depressed state of the U.S. oilindustry after 1986 also contributed to the repeal decision. Reinstating the windfall profit tax would reduce recent oil industry windfalls due to highcrude and petroleum prices but could have several adverse economic effects. If imposed as an excisetax, the WPT would increase marginal production costs and be expected to reduce domestic oilproduction and increase the level of oil imports, which today is at nearly 60% of demand. Crudeprices would not tend to increase. Some have proposed an excise tax on both domestically producedand imported oil as a way of mitigating the negative effects on petroleum import dependence. Sucha broad-based WPT would tend to reduce import dependence, but it would lead to higher crude oilprices and likely to oil industry profits, potentially undermining its original goals. Because the purecorporate profits tax is relatively neutral in the short run -- few, if any, price and output effects occurbecause marginal production costs are unchanged in the short run -- a possible option would be acorporate income surtax on the upstream operations of crude oil producers. Such a tax that wouldrecoup any recent windfalls with less adverse economic effects; imports would not increase becausedomestic production would remain unchanged. In the long run, such a tax is a tax on capital; itreduces the rate of return, thus reducing the supply of capital to the oil industry."
