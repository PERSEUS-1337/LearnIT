The bill prohibits boards established to carry out a checkoff program or a USDA order issued under a checkoff program from entering into a contract or agreement to carry out program activities with a party that engages in activities to influence any government policy or action that relates to agriculture. The bill also prohibits a board or its employees or agents acting in their official capacity from engaging in: (1) any act that involves a conflict of interest. And (2) any anticompetitive activity, unfair or deceptive act or practice, or any act that may be disparaging to another agricultural commodity or product. The board must meet specified requirements regarding the publication of budgets and disbursements of funds. The USDA Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office must conduct specified audits regarding checkoff programs."
