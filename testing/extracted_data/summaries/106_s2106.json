    "title": "Advancing the Global Opportunities for Biotechnology in Agriculture Act of 2000",
    "content": "Directs the President to establish an interagency process for all relevant executive branch agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, the Office of the US Trade Representative, the Department of State, AID, the Department of Commerce, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency, to coordinate efforts and to generate support for the acceptance of agricultural biotechnology. Urges US policies to stress the prominence of science as the foundation for regulatory decision-making and work aggressively in international fora such as the World Trade Organization, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, including its CODEX Alimentarius, and the United Nations, to advocate for science-based decision- making. Urges AID and the Department of Agriculture to ensure that all food and grain products that meet US health and safety requirements are acceptable to foreign countries under relevant food aid programs. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State should work with US embassies abroad to develop bilateral support from foreign governments for the approval of science-based trading regimes in multilateral forums and organizations."
