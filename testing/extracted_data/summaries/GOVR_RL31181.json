    "content": "Technological innovation is a primary engine of long-term economic growth, and research and development (R&D) serves as the lifeblood of innovation. The federal government encourages private investment in R&D in several ways, including a tax credit for increases in spending on qualified research above a base amount. This report describes the current status of the credit, summarizes its legislative history, and discusses policy issues it raises. The research tax credit (also known as the research and experimentation (or R&E) tax credit) was permanently extended in 2015. Since its enactment in mid-1981, the credit was temporarily extended 16 times and significantly modified 5 times. While the credit is often thought of as a single credit, it actually consists of four discrete credits: (1) a regular credit, (2) an alternative simplified credit (ASC), (3) a university basic research credit, and (4) an energy research credit. A taxpayer may claim one of the first two and each of the other two, provided it meets the requirements for each. In essence, the research credit endeavors to boost business investment in basic and applied research by reducing the after-tax cost of undertaking qualified research above a base amount, which approximates the amount a company would invest in R&D in the absence of the credit. As a result, the credit's effectiveness hinges, in part, on the sensitivity of the demand for this research to decreases in its cost. It is unclear from existing studies exactly how sensitive that demand is. While most analysts endorse the use of tax incentives to generate ever-higher levels of business R&D investment, some have some reservations about the design of the current credit. Critics contend that it is not as effective as it could or should be, given the economic benefits of technological innovation. The limits on the credit's effectiveness, in their view, include uneven and inadequate incentive effects, a lack of refundability, and an ambiguous definition of qualified research that fosters disputes between the Internal Revenue Service and companies over the legitimacy of claims for the credit. The 114th Congress permanently extended the research tax credit by passing the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act, P.L. 114-113). The act also allowed certain small firms to apply up to $250,000 of any credit they may claim against their payroll taxes in a tax year."
