    "content": "Congress, in the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act, and the Department of Defense (DOD) has identified electronic warfare (EW) as a critical capability supporting military operations to fulfil the current National Defense Strategy. Collectively, DOD considers procurement appropriations and research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations as part of its investment accounts. Using programs identified by the EW Executive Commission (EW EXCOM), this report traces funding for three of the military services (Air Force, Army, and Navy) along with several defense agencies (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Defense Information Systems Agency, the Joint Staff, Office of the Secretary of Defense Operational Test and Evaluation, and U.S. Special Operations Command). This report compares DOD's funding requests for FY2019, FY2020, and FY2021 to assess if DOD seeks to increase the funding of the EW portfolio (by increasing funding), decrease its funding, or keep the portfolio relatively unchanged. Insights into EW Program Funding This report tracks DOD funding requests for approximately 65 research and develop program elements and 30 procurement line items across FY2019 and FY2021. Reviewing these three fiscal years request allows for comparisons across the EW portfolio and provides insights into how EW was prioritized relative to the overall DOD budget. In addition to tracking funding requests in each of the respective fiscal years and identifying what Congress appropriated in FY2019 and FY2020, this report looks at the future years defense program (FYDP) to identify potential trends in the EW portfolio. This report looks at the combination of the procurement and RDT&E budget requests to provide a comprehensive, unclassified overview of the total EW program requests within DOD. DOD requested at least $10.1 billion in FY2019, $10.2 billion in FY2020, and $9.7 billion in FY2021 for EW, an amount analogous to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program ($10.7 billion in FY2019) or a Ford-class aircraft carrier ($12.5 billion in total ship-building procurement). Based on statements by several senior defense officials and the conclusions of the National Defense Strategy Commission, it could be expected that DOD is likely to substantially increase funding for EW programs. CRS assesses that DOD requested 11.5% more funding for EW RDT&E in FY2021 than what was projected in the FY2019 budget, but 1.7% less than what was projected in the FY2020 budget. Comparing the procurement budget, the FY2021 request seeks to increase funding by 2.2% compared to FY2019 projections, but decrease funding by 10.3% compared to what was projected in the FY2020 request. From a portfolio perspective, CRS assesses that the Administration projects $51.7 billion over the FY2021 Future Years Defense Program (FYDP), $259 million less than the FY2020 FYDP, but $4.5 billion more than the FY2019 FYDP. Overall, it appears the Administration is prioritizing research and development for EW programs, while decreasing procurement, which aligns with the overall FY2021 DOD budget request. Potential Issues for Congress Based on this analysis, this report identifies three potential issues for Congress Is DOD appropriately funding the EW portfolio? How does DOD use appropriated funds for EW programs? Is DOD potentially buying new capabilities with research and development funds, when it should use procurement funding? Does DOD understand what it is developing and procuring within the EW portfolio?"
