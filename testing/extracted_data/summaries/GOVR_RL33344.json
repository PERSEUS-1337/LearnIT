    "content": "On February 6, 2006, the President submitted his FY2007 budget to the Congress. It proposed funding the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) at $34.1 billion, just over the FY2006 level (not including FY2006 supplementals related to Hurricane Katrina). HUD's FY2007 budget summary stated that the budget intended to use \"taxpayer money more wisely\" and \"reform programs in need of repair.\" The President's budget would have increased funding for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program from $15.4 billion in FY2006 to $15.9 billion in FY2007. It proposed to reduce funding to the Public Housing Capital Fund to $2.2 billion from the $2.4 billion that was appropriated for FY2006. The proposed budget also would have eliminated funding for public housing's HOPE VI program, which replaces distressed public housing units with new or rehabilitated mixed-income developments. Within the community development programs, the President's FY2007 budget proposed cutting funding to the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program by nearly 20% from the FY2006 level. CDBG provides grants to states and localities to use for housing and community development projects. The FY2007 budget proposal would have increased funding for the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program from $286 million to $300 million and the HOME program from $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Additionally, it would have increased funding for the four Homeless Assistance Grants by $209 million, and provided funding for two new initiatives: the Samaritan Initiative for the chronically homeless and the Prisoner Re-entry Initiative. The President's budget proposed to cut in half funding for the Section 811 Housing for the Disabled program, as proposed in FY2006. The FY2007 budget would have provided $119 million for Section 811, down from $237 million in FY2006. Funding for the Section 202 Housing for the Elderly program would have been reduced from just under $735 million to $546 million, a drop of 25.7%. The House passed its version of the HUD funding bill on June 14, 2006 (H.R. 5576). It funded most programs at or near the President's requested level, although it increased funding for the Section 8 voucher program, CDBG, and the Section 202 Housing for the Elderly and Section 811 Housing for the Disabled programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee passed its version of H.R. 5576 on July 20, 2006. It would have provided over $2 billion more for HUD than the President's request and the House bill, increased funding for Public Housing and restored funding for programs slated for elimination, including HOPE VI. Since the majority of the FY2007 appropriations bills were not approved before the end of FY2006, Congress enacted a series of stop-gap funding measures, or continuing resolutions, to maintain government operations. On February 15, 2007, Congress approved a revised yearlong continuing resolution, funding most accounts at their FY2006 level (P.L. 110-5). Congress is also considering FY2007 supplemental appropriations that may make changes to HUD funding (H.R. 1591). This report will be updated to reflect legislative activity."
