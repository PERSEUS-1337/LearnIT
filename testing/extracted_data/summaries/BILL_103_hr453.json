Authorizes other Federal agency heads, with the Secretary's agreement, to make similar waivers of such requirements applicable to an elementary, secondary, or youth vocational training program administered by such agencies. Limits duration of projects and associated waivers. Requires each project that involves elementary or secondary schools to include participation of an LEA and at least two schools. Requires, to the extent possible, project participation by each grade and academic program in a participating school. Sets forth application and planning requirements.
