    "content": "Royalty Relief for American Consumers Act of 2010 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to agree to a request by a lessee to amend any lease issued for any Central and Western Gulf of Mexico tract between January 1, 1998, and January 1, 2000, to incorporate price thresholds applicable to royalty suspension provisions that are equal to or less than specified price thresholds described in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA). Requires: (1) an amended lease to impose the new or revised price thresholds effective October 1, 2010. And (2) existing lease provisions to prevail through September 30, 2010. Prohibits the Secretary from issuing a new lease to certain persons or entities with any direct or indirect interest in, or who derive any benefit from, a covered lease unless they renegotiate the lease to include such price thresholds or have paid or formally agreed to pay all conservation of resources fees established under this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish a conservation of resources fee for producing and nonproducing federal oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico. Applies the same lease renegotiation and conservation of resources fee payment eligibility criteria to any lessee or other interested person who seeks to obtain by sale or transfer any covered lease, the economic benefit of any covered lease, or any other lease for the production of oil or natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico under OCSLA."
