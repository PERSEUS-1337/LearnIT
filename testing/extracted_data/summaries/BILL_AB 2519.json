    "content": "Existing law expresses the intent of the Legislature for all public schools teaching kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, operated by a school district, to develop, in cooperation with specified community partners, a comprehensive school safety plan, as defined. This bill would express the intent of the Legislature to include coaches among the community partners. The bill would also express the intent of the Legislature to expand the scope of the safety plan. Existing law provides that each school district and county office of education is responsible for the overall development of all comprehensive school safety plans for its schools operating kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive. This bill would expand the school safety plans to address sanctioned activities before and after school. To the extent this expansion would impose additional duties on school districts and county offices of education, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing law requires the schoolsite council of each school of a school district and of a county office of education to write and develop a comprehensive school safety plan relevant to the needs and resources of that particular school, except as specified for small school districts. Existing law authorizes the schoolsite council to delegate this responsibility to a school safety planning committee made up of specified members. Existing law requires the comprehensive school safety plan to include, among other things, the identification of appropriate strategies and programs that will provide or maintain a high level of school safety and address the school\u2019s procedures for complying with existing laws related to school safety, including the development of specified procedures and policies. This bill would include a coach of the school, if the school has a coach, to the list of specified members to serve on a school safety planning committee. The bill would additionally require a comprehensive school safety plan to include any other strategies aimed at the prevention of, response to, and education about, potential incidents involving crime, violence, or medical emergency on the school campus, including sanctioned activities before and after school. campus. By imposing additional duties on school districts and county offices of education regarding the development of school safety plans, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
