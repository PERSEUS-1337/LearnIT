    "content": "Medication Therapy Management Empowerment Act of 2011 - Amends part D of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA), as amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to increase the number of diseases and conditions for which beneficiaries may be targeted for medication therapy management (MTM) services. Requires a Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) sponsor to establish a process, subject to approval by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), for identifying individuals who are not targeted beneficiaries, are not otherwise offered MTM services, and whom a pharmacist or other qualified provider determines may benefit from MTM services. Requires any such individual to be treated as a targeted beneficiary. Requires any MTM program to offer both comprehensive and targeted medication reviews to individuals dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid , regardless of whether they are MTM-targeted beneficiaries. Requires a PDP sponsor to offer any willing pharmacy in its network and any other qualified health care provider the opportunity to provide MTM services. Requires the PDP sponsor to reimburse pharmacists and other qualified health care providers furnishing MTM services based on the resources used and the time required to provide such services. Directs the Secretary of HHS to: (1) establish measures and standards for data collection by PDP sponsors to evaluate performance of pharmacies and other entities in furnishing MTM services. And (2) support the continued development and refinement of performance measures. Provides pharmacies and other entities that furnish MTM services with additional incentive payments based on their performance in meeting quality measures established under this Act."
