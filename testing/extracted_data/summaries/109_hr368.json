    "title": "To establish and rapidly implement regulations for State driver's license and identification document security standards.",
    "content": "Driver's License Security and Modernization Act - Prohibits a Federal agency from accepting a State-issued driver's license or identification card unless it includes certain information, including a digital photograph, a common machine-readable technology, and certain anti-fraud physical security features. Prescribes minimum license or identification card issuance standards and other special requirements States must meet. Requires a State, among other things, to require, before issuing a driver's license or other identification card, valid documentary evidence that a person has: (1) US citizenship, (2) lawful permanent residence in the United States. Or (3) another specified lawful immigrant or nonimmigrant status. Requires a State, to be eligible for a grant to assist it in conforming to such minimum standards, to participate in the interstate compact, Driver License Agreement, in order to provide electronic access by a State to information contained in the motor vehicle databases of all other States. Repeals similar requirements contained in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004."
