    "content": "The United States has had a continuous relationship with the Philippine Islands since 1898, when they were acquired by the United States as a result of the Spanish-American War. Filipinos have served in, and with, the U.S. Armed Forces since the Spanish-American War, and especially during World War II. The Islands remained a possession of the United States until 1946. Since 1946, Congress has passed several laws affecting various categories of Filipino veterans. Many of these laws have been liberalizing laws that have provided Filipino World War II veterans with medical and monetary benefits similar to benefits available to U.S. veterans. However, not all veterans' benefits are available to veterans of the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines, Recognized Guerrilla Forces, and New Philippine Scouts. In the 110th Congress, two measures, H.R. 760 and S. 57, have been introduced that would eliminate the distinction between the Regular, or \"Old,\" Philippine Scouts and the other three groups of veterans\u2014the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines, Recognized Guerrilla Forces, and New Philippine Scouts\u2014making them all fully eligible for veterans' benefits similar to those received by U.S. veterans. This report defines the four specific groups (Regular Philippine Scouts, Commonwealth Army of the Philippines, Recognized Guerilla Forces, and New Philippine Scouts) of Filipino nationals who served under the command of the United States, outlines the Rescission Acts of 1946, benefit changes since 1946, current benefits for Filipino veterans by group, and recent legislative proposals and legislation, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5). It will be updated as legislative events warrant."
