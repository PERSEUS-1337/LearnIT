    "content": "In recent decades, many federal policies have attempted to help prepare students with disabilities to complete high school and to continue into postsecondary education. Corollary interest has arisen in being able to track the progress being made toward achieving these aims. This report offers a brief overview of what is currently known about the U.S. population of students with disabilities as they advance through secondary education and into postsecondary education. It devotes particular attention to high school graduation trends and data on postsecondary enrollment. Within the limitations of available data, some of the noteworthy information presented in the report includes the following: Roughly 70% of high-school aged students receiving services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the primary federal act providing services to students with disabilities in elementary and secondary schools, graduated with a regular high school diploma in the 2014-2015 school year (SY), up substantially from the 27% receiving regular diplomas nearly 20 years earlier. A different measure of graduation rates, the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate (ACGR), which captures those graduating within four years of entering high school, suggests that in SY2014-2015 roughly 65% of students with disabilities graduated high school within that time frame, compared to approximately 82% of the total population of students. Data on post-high school experiences of a nationally representative sample of 13 to 16 year old students receiving special education services in 2000 (who were followed for eight years through the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2) found that 60% enrolled in postsecondary education within eight years of leaving high school; two-year postsecondary programs were the most common destination. More recent data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, examining a nationally representative sample of all students enrolled in postsecondary institutions in SY2011-2012, indicates that roughly 11% of all undergraduates and 5% of all post-baccalaureate students self-identify as having a disability, with higher percentages among older undergraduate students (16%) and veterans (21%); however, there are many known limitations associated with self-reported data of this nature."
