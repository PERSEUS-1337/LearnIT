    "content": "Under the Higher Education Act (HEA), institutions of higher education (IHEs) must be accredited by an agency or association recognized by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education (ED) to participate in HEA Title IV federal student aid programs. While this process is voluntary, failure to obtain accreditation could have a dramatic effect on an institution's student enrollment, as only students attending accredited institutions are eligible to receive federal student aid (e.g., Pell grants and student loans). Accrediting agencies are private organizations set up to review the qualifications of member institutions based on self-initiated quality guidelines and self-improvement efforts. This report provides an overview of some of the possible accreditation issues that Congress may address during the HEA reauthorization process. For example, as Congress considers reauthorizing the HEA, it may consider making changes to the role accreditation plays with respect to federal student aid or to the accreditation process itself, such as the factors accrediting agencies must consider when evaluating an institution. More specifically, potential issues for consideration include, but are not limited to, the use of accreditation as a gauge of institutional quality, the elimination of accreditation as a prerequisite for participation in HEA Title IV programs, accreditation and distance education, accreditation and transfer of credit, and due process requirements that apply to accrediting agencies. In the 109th Congress, both H.R. 609, the College Access and Opportunity Act of 2005, and S. 1614, the Higher Education Amendments of 2005, the primary vehicles for HEA reauthorization, would have altered accreditation requirements. Most notably, both bills would have added new requirements related to considering the mission of an institution when performing evaluations, outcome measures, distance education, transfer of credit, due process, and accrediting agency operations. HEA reauthorization may also be considered by the 110th Congress. This report will be updated as warranted by legislative action."
