    "content": "Henry Ford Scholarship Program Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to establish a program awarding scholarships to high-achieving students who graduate from secondary school after May 1, 2007, and pursue undergraduate degrees in mathematics, science, engineering, and health-related fields at institutions of higher education. Awards each scholarship for one academic year, but gives recipients who continue to meet scholarship eligibility criteria priority for additional one-year scholarships, for up to four years of undergraduate study. Sets forth eligibility criteria requiring applicants to have a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.5, and family or individual adjusted gross income of less than $200,000 or $100,000, respectively."
