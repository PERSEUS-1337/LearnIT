    "content": "Do-Not-Call Registry Fee Extension Act of 2007 - Amends the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act to replace provisions relating to fees regarding the do-not-call registry of the Telemarketing Sales Rule with provisions requiring the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to collect an annual fee to implement and enforce the registry or any other regulation issued by the FTC under specified provisions of the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act. Sets the fee amount per area code accessed, subject to a maximum amount, and indexes the amount to inflation. Prohibits any arrangement to divide the fee among various clients of a telemarketer or service provider. Replaces current reporting requirements with provisions requiring the FTC to report biennially to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives. Requires an additional, one-time FTC report to those committees on the effectiveness of do-not-call outreach and enforcement efforts to senior citizens and immigrant communities, the impact of the exceptions to the do-not-call registry on businesses and consumers, and the impact on do-not-call enforcement of abandoned calls made by predictive dialing devices."
