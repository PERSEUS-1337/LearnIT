    "title": "AB 1449",
    "content": "Existing law, the Ortiz-Pacheco-Poochigian-Vasconcellos Cal Grant Program, establishes the Cal Grant A and B Entitlement awards, the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement awards, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B awards, the Cal Grant C awards, and the Cal Grant T awards under the administration of the Student Aid Commission, and establishes eligibility requirements for awards under these programs for participating students attending qualifying institutions. Under the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement Program, a student who transfers from a California community college to a qualifying institution that offers a baccalaureate degree receives a Cal Grant A or B award if the student meets specified requirements, among which is that the student graduate from a California high school or its equivalent during or after the 2000\u201301 academic year. This bill would, commencing with the 2017\u201318 academic year, exempt a student from the requirement that the student graduate from a California high school or its equivalent if he or she did not graduate from high school or its equivalent and was a California resident, as determined pursuant to specified provisions of law, on his or her 18th birthday. This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 69436 of the Education Code proposed by SB 1314 that would become operative if this bill and SB 1314 are both enacted and this bill is chaptered last."
