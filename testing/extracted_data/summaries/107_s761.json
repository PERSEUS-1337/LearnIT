Establishes in the Treasury the Native American Telecommunications Improvement Revolving Fund to make loans and award grants to eligible tribes. Limits loan interest rates dependent upon tribal per capita income. Directs the Secretary to award grants to enable tribes to conduct feasibility studies with respect to telecommunications projects. Limits grants to $200,000. Terminates the program on the earlier of: (1) ten years after the first loan is made. Or (2) the date on which the Secretary determines that the telecommunications penetration rate is at least 90 percent of all households on reservation lands."
