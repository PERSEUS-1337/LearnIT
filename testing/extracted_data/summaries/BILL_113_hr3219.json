    "content": "Free Market Royalty Act - Amends federal copyright law to provide a public performance right for all audio transmissions of sound recordings, thereby extending such right to require terrestrial AMFM broadcast radio stations to pay royalties for non-digital audio transmissions. Eliminates statutory licensing royalty rates set by Copyright Royalty Judges (CRJs) for the public performance of sound recordings by noninteractive digital audio services. Allows any noninteractive services performing sound recordings publicly by means of an audio transmission to collectively negotiate royalty rates for such performances. Designates SoundExchange, Inc. or any successor entity, as the sole common agent to negotiate, agree to, pay, and receive royalty payments. Authorizes copyright owners of sound recordings, if a license is agreed to by the common agent, to subsequently negotiate and agree to royalty rates and license terms and conditions with any noninteractive services for the performance of such sound recordings . Sets forth the royalty payment distributions to be made by the common agent to copyright owners, featured recording artists, and non-featured musicians and vocalists. Establishes procedures for CRJs to set rates and terms for nonsubscription broadcasts consisting solely of noncommercial educational and cultural radio programs when such rates and terms are not negotiated and agreed upon collectively between the common agent and the noncommercial educational broadcast station. Modifies ephemeral recording requirements to account for the removal of statutory licensing procedures."
