    "content": "Security Officer Screening Improvement Act of 2014 - Amends the National Child Protection Act of 1993 to direct the Attorney General to establish policies and procedures for: (1) informing entities that employ private security officers about how to request state and national background checks on officers and applicants, and (2) completing a check of the national criminal history background check system and providing information received to the entity designated by the Attorney General to carry out the criminal history review program. Requires a request for such a check to include the fingerprints of the covered individual, other documents required by state law for a state criminal history background check, and the appropriate fee, which shall be remitted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), to offset the costs of conducting the criminal history review. Requires the Attorney General to: (1) establish a criminal history review program to provide requesting entities with information on the criminal history of officers or applicants, (2) establish procedures to securely receive criminal history records. (3) make determinations regarding whether such records indicate that the officer or applicant has a criminal history that may bear on his or her fitness to perform security services. And (4) convey to the requesting entity such determinations and guidance that the entity should consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Enforcement Guidance 915.002, dated April 25, 2012, and entitled Consideration of Arrest and Conviction Records in Employment Decisions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Authorizes the FBI to retain any fingerprints submitted to it under this Act."
