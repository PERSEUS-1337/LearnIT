    "content": "Protect Marriage from the Courts Act of 2015 Prohibits federal courts from having jurisdiction to adjudicate or enforce any claim pertaining to the validity, under the US Constitution, of a state law or a state administrative or judicial decision that: (1) defines marriage as limited to the union of one man and one woman, or (2) refuses state recognition of, or allows the state to refuse recognition of, same-sex marriages performed and licensed in other states. Allows final judgments entered by federal courts before the enactment of this Act to remain binding on the parties to the case, but persons who are not a party to such a case are not obligated to comply with such decisions."
