    "content": "Safe Aviation and Flight Enhancement Act - Amends Federal aviation law to direct the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations requiring all commercial aircraft to carry both a cockpit voice recorder and digital flight data recorder equipped with two combination cockpit voice and digital flight data recording systems. Mandates that one system be located as close to the cockpit as practicable, and that the other be a deployable recorder system mounted as far rear on the airframe as practicable. Sets forth minimum recorder capabilities. Directs the Secretary to: (1) purchase and make available, at no cost, to an air carrier such fixed recorder systems and deployable recorder systems as may be necessary for the air carrier to comply with regulations. And (2) reimburse aircraft manufacturers owned or controlled by a US citizen for engineering, certification, and installation costs incurred in developing and installing fixed recorder and deployable recorder systems in compliance with regulations."
