    "content": "Paraguay is a South American country wedged between Bolivia, Argentina, and Brazil. It is about the size of California but has a population of less than 7 million. The country is known for its rather homogenous culture\u2014a mix of Latin and Guarani influences, with 90% of the population speaking Guarani, a pre-Columbian language, in addition to Spanish. The Paraguayan economy is one of the most agriculturally dependent in the hemisphere and is largely shaped by the country's production of cattle, soybeans, and other crops. In 2016, Paraguay grew by 4.1%; it is projected to sustain about 4.3% growth in 2017. Since his election in 2013, President Horacio Cartes of the long-dominant Colorado Party (also known as the Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional Republicana [ANC]), has moved the country toward a more open economy, deepening private investment and increasing public-private partnerships to promote growth. Despite steady growth, Paraguay has a high degree of inequality and, although poverty levels have declined, rural poverty is severe and widespread. Following Paraguay's 35-year military dictatorship in the 20th century (1954-1989), many citizens remain cautious about the nation's democracy and fearful of a return of patronage and corruption. In March 2016, a legislative initiative to allow a referendum to reelect President Cartes (reelection is forbidden by the 1992 constitution) sparked large protests. Paraguayans rioted, and the parliament building in the capital city of Asunci\u00f3n was partially burned. In response to the effort to change the Paraguayan Constitution to allow for presidential reelection, which included a secret vote in Paraguay's Senate, the U.S. Embassy in Asunci\u00f3n declared that constitutional revisions should be done transparently and called on all parties to work together to resolve issues sparking the disturbances. In April 2017, President Cartes announced that he would not run in the 2018 elections, and subsequently the initiative to enable reelection was withdrawn. U.S.-Paraguayan relations have been close for decades. The U.S. government has provided development assistance to Paraguay, and the two governments have collaborated on security, counternarcotics, and efforts to promote and strengthen democracy. In July 2017, Paraguay hosted the annual multination special operations competition held in the region, known as Fuerzas Comando. At the time, Admiral Tidd, commander of the U.S. Southern Command, held meetings with President Cartes and Paraguay's military leadership focused on U.S.- Paraguayan bilateral relations in security cooperation, humanitarian aid, fighting transnational crime, and counterterrorism. In addition, the Peace Corps has had a significant presence in Paraguay, with more than 200 volunteers in recent years. In FY2017, the program in Paraguay is estimated at nearly $5 million and is proposed to remain at the same level in FY2018. The Trump Administration's FY2018 foreign aid request for Paraguay would reduce U.S. assistance to $400,000, a 95% cut compared to FY2016, concentrating on military training and eliminating traditional development programs. Congress may wish to consider if the long-term U.S. focus on strengthening democracy and promoting development in Paraguay remains relevant."
