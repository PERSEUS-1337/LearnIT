    "content": "Cleaning Product Labeling Act of 2017 This bill requires chemically formulated cleaning products to bear a label with, and requires manufacturers to include on their Internet websites, a list of all of the product's ingredients in descending order of predominance by weight, except that ingredients that constitute less than 1 of the product can be listed at the end in any order. Product websites must include: (1) the CAS Registry Number of each ingredient, and (2) an explanation of each ingredient's purpose. A product that is not in conformity with the labeling and website listing requirements shall be treated as: (1) a misbranded hazardous substance under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act if it is under the jurisdiction of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), or (2) a violation of rules under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 if it is under the jurisdiction of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The CPSC and OSHA must issue regulations to enforce this bill. A person may petition the CPSC or OSHA to investigate claims that a product does not satisfy these requirements."
