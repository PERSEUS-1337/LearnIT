    "content": "Disaster Assistance Equity Act of 2015 This bill amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to modify the definition of quot, private nonprofit facilityquot. To include any facilities owned or operated by a common interest community that provide essential services of a governmental nature. The bill also defines additional terms under such Act, including quot, condominiumquot, and quot, housing cooperative. quot, quot, Common interest communityquot. Is defined as: (1) any nonprofit mandatory membership organization comprised of owners of real estate described in a declaration or created pursuant to a covenant or other applicable law with respect to which a person, by virtue of the person's ownership of a unit, is obligated to pay for a share of real estate taxes, insurance premiums, maintenance or improvement of, or services or other expenses related to, common elements, other units, or any other real estate other than the unit described in the declaration. And (2) a condominium project that is comprised entirely of detached single family units or that is comprised of four or more multi-unit housing structures and that owns or operates facilities that provide essential services of a governmental nature. The bill amends such Act to provide that for purposes of the provision of federal disaster assistance with respect to residential elements that are the legal responsibility of an association for a condominium or housing cooperative, the terms quot, individualquot, or quot, householdquot. Include the association. The President must determine the maximum amount of assistance that any such association may receive under such Act for a single disaster."
