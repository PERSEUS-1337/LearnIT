    "content": "The federal government provides financial assistance to individuals for higher education expenses in two major ways: tax benefits and traditional student aid (loans, grants, and work-study assistance). Since 1997, education tax benefits have become an increasingly important component of federal higher education policy. In 2017, 14 tax benefits are available for college students and their parents to help pay for higher education. The available tax benefits are a mixture of credits, deductions, exclusions, and other incentives. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates the cost to the federal government of education tax benefits\u2014the revenue foregone from offering these benefits\u2014to be $142 billion between 2017 and 2021. This report provides a brief overview of the higher education tax benefits that are currently available to students and their families. These tax benefits can be divided into three groups: 1. incentives for current year expenses, 2. incentives for preferential tax treatment of student loan expenses, and 3. incentives for saving for college. In 2017, incentives for current expenses include two tax credits: the American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning tax credits; two deductions: an above-the-line deduction for tuition and fees and a deduction for work-related education expenses; two exclusions: an exclusion for scholarships, fellowship income, and tuition reductions, and an exclusion for employer-provided education benefits; and a personal exemption for student dependents aged 19 to 23. Under current law the tuition and fees deduction expired at the end of 2017 and the personal exemption (including for student dependents aged 19 to 23) is temporarily suspended from 2018 through the end of 2025. Tax benefits for student loan expenses include a deduction for interest paid on student loans and an exclusion from income for the amount of forgiven student loans. College saving tax incentives include Qualified Tuition Plans (529 plans); Coverdell education savings accounts (ESAs); an education savings bond program; withdrawals from individual retirement accounts (IRAs) to pay for college expenses without penalty; and the allowance of uniform transfers to minors. (Both Coverdells and 529s can also be used for certain K-12 education expenses, subject to limitations.)"
