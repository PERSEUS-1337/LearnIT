    "content": "In 2005, Congress considered a number of issues relating to the Andean region and drugtrafficking, including continued funding for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) and conditionson U.S. assistance. In addition to ACI, Andean countries benefit from Foreign Military Financing(FMF), International Military Education and Training (IMET) funds, and other types of economicaid. Congress continues to express concern with the volume of drugs readily available in the UnitedStates and elsewhere in the world. The three largest producers of cocaine are Colombia, Bolivia, andPeru. Ninety percent of the cocaine in the United States originates in, or passes through, Colombia. The United States has made a significant commitment of funds and material support to helpColombia and the Andean region fight drug trafficking since the development of Plan Colombia in1999. From FY2000 through FY2005, the United States has provided a total of about $5.4 billionfor the region in both State Department and Defense Department counternarcotics funds. The UnitedStates also provides funding for Development Assistance (DA), Child Survival and Health (CSH),and Economic Support Funds (ESF) to some countries in the region. Since 2002, Congress hasgranted expanded authority to use counternarcotics funds for a unified campaign to fight both drugtrafficking and terrorist organizations in Colombia. Three illegally armed groups in Colombiaparticipate in drug production and trafficking, and have been designated foreign terroristorganizations by the State Department. In 2004, Congress also increased the level of U.S. militaryand civilian contractor personnel allowed to be deployed in Colombia, in response to anAdministration request. For FY2006, Congress approved the Administration's request for $734.5 million for ACI inthe Foreign Operations Appropriations Act ( H.R. 3057 / P.L. 109-102 ). As part of therequested amount for ACI, the Administration had requested $21 million for the Air Bridge DenialProgram; Congress provided $14 million. The request also included $40 million for a Critical FlightSafety Program that is described as the first installment of a multi-year program to upgrade andrefurbish aircraft used for eradication and interdiction missions. Congress provided $30 million. In the House, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act ( H.R. 2601 ) was passedwith provisions relating to the demobilization process, tax code enforcement in Colombia, and thetransfer of aircraft to the Colombian Navy. The Senate did not finish consideration of its version( S. 600 ). It would authorize funding for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative and includesa number of conditions on assistance consistent with current law. The FY2006 National DefenseAuthorization Act ( H.R. 1815 , P.L. 109-163 ) authorized funds for Defense Departmentinterdiction activities. This report will not be updated.
