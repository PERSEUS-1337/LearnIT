    "content": "Chinese Human Rights Act of 1995 - Declares null and void any waiver by the President of human rights and emigration requirements for nondiscriminatory treatment for China under the Trade Act of 1974. Denies most-favored-nation treatment to China until the Congress provides so by statute. Amends the Trading with the Enemy Act to define China as an enemy for purposes of the export of military products to such country until the Congress, by joint resolution, determines that China does not engage in any significant violation of human rights and poses no significant threat to the United States. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide that a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion and entitled to political refugee status under such Act."
