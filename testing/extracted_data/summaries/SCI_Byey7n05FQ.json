    "content": "We propose a \"plan online and learn offline\" framework for the setting where an agent, with an internal model, needs to continually act and learn in the world. Our work builds on the synergistic relationship between local model-based control, global value function learning, and exploration. We study how local trajectory optimization can cope with approximation errors  in the value function, and can stabilize and accelerate value function learning. Conversely, we also study how approximate value functions can help reduce the planning horizon and allow for better policies beyond local solutions. Finally, we also demonstrate how trajectory optimization can be used to perform temporally coordinated exploration in conjunction with estimating uncertainty in value function approximation. This exploration is critical for fast and stable learning of the value function. Combining these components enable solutions to complex control tasks, like humanoid locomotion and dexterous in-hand manipulation, in the equivalent of a few minutes of experience in the real world. We consider a setting where an agent with limited memory and computational resources is dropped into a world. The agent has to simultaneously act in the world and learn to become proficient in the tasks it encounters. Let us further consider a setting where the agent has some prior knowledge about the world in the form of a nominal dynamics model. However, the state space of the world could be very large and complex, and the set of possible tasks very diverse. This complexity and diversity, combined with limited computational capability, rules out the possibility of an omniscient agent that has experienced all situations and knows how to act optimally in all states, even if the agent knows the dynamics. Thus, the agent has to act in the world while learning to become competent.Based on the knowledge of dynamics and its computational resources, the agent is imbued with a local search procedure in the form of trajectory optimization. While the agent would certainly benefit from the most powerful of trajectory optimization algorithms, it is plausible that very complex procedures are still insufficient or inadmissible due to the complexity or inherent unpredictability of the environment. Limited computational resources may also prevent these powerful methods from real-time operation. While the trajectory optimizer may be insufficient by itself, we show that it provides a powerful vehicle for the agent to explore and learn about the world.Due to the limited capabilities of the agent, a natural expectation is for the agent to be moderately competent for new tasks that occur infrequently and skillful in situations that it encounters repeatedly by learning from experience. Based on this intuition, we propose the plan online and learn offline (POLO) framework for continual acting and learning. POLO is based on the tight synergistic coupling between local trajectory optimization, global value function learning, and exploration.We will first provide intuitions for why there may be substantial performance degradation when acting greedily using an approximate value function. We also show that value function learning can be accelerated and stabilized by utilizing trajectory optimization integrally in the learning process, and that a trajectory optimization procedure in conjunction with an approximate value function can compute near optimal actions. In addition, exploration is critical to propagate global information in value function learning, and for trajectory optimization to escape local solutions and saddle FIG4 : Examples of tasks solved with POLO.

In POLO, the agent forms hypotheses on potential reward regions, and executes temporally coordinated action sequences through trajectory optimization. This is in contrast to strategies like \u2212greedy and Boltzmann exploration that explore at the granularity of individual timesteps. The use of trajectory optimization enables the agent to perform directed and efficient exploration, which in turn helps to find better global solutions.The setting studied in the paper models many problems of interest in robotics and artificial intelligence. Local trajectory optimization becomes readily feasible when a nominal model and computational resources are available to an agent, and can accelerate learning of novel task instances. In this work, we study the case where the internal nominal dynamics model used by the agent is accurate. Nominal dynamics models based on knowledge of physics , or through learning (Ljung, 1987) , complements a growing body of work on successful simulation to reality transfer and system identification BID34 BID31 Lowrey et al., 2018; BID23 . Combining the benefits of local trajectory optimization for fast improvement with generalization enabled by learning is critical for robotic agents that live in our physical world to continually learn and acquire a large repertoire of skills. Through empirical evaluation, we wish to answer the following questions:1. Does trajectory optimization in conjunction with uncertainty estimation in value function approximation result in temporally coordinated exploration strategies?2 . Can the use of an approximate value function help reduce the planning horizon for MPC?3 . Does trajectory optimization enable faster and more stable value function learning?Before answering the questions in detail, we first point out that POLO can scale up to complex high-dimensional agents like 3D humanoid and dexterous anthropomorphic hand BID23 which are among the most complex control tasks studied in robot learning. Video demonstration can be found at: https://sites.google.com/view/polo-mpc In this work we presented POLO, which combines the strengths of trajectory optimization and value function learning. In addition, we studied the benefits of planning for exploration in settings where we track uncertainties in the value function. Together, these components enabled control of complex agents like 3D humanoid and five-fingered hand. In this work, we assumed access to an accurate internal dynamics model. A natural next step is to study the influence of approximation errors in the internal model and improving it over time using the real world interaction data."
