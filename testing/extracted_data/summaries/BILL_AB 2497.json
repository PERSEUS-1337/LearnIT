    "title": "AB 2497",
    "content": "Under existing law, taxpayers are allowed to contribute amounts in excess of their personal income tax liability for the support of the California Senior Legislature Fund until the year in which the minimum contribution is not received, or January 1, 2019, whichever occurs first. Existing law also contains administrative provisions that are generally applicable to voluntary contributions. This bill would repeal these provisions regarding contributions for the support of the California Senior Legislature Fund and would instead allow a taxpayer, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, to designate an amount in excess of personal income tax liability to be deposited to the California Senior Citizen Advocacy Fund, which the bill would create. This bill would require moneys transferred to the California Senior Citizen Advocacy Fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to be allocated to the Franchise Tax Board and the Controller, as provided, and to the California Senior Legislature for the purpose of funding the activities of the California Senior Legislature, as provided. The bill would require the California Senior Legislature\u2019s Internet Web site to report specified information, including all events the California Senior Citizen Advocacy Fund supports each year. This bill would repeal these voluntary contribution provisions by a specified date or, if contributions made on returns would be less than a specified amount, by an earlier date as provided."
