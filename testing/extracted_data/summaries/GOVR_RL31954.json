Title XI, Subtitle A, of the law authorizes the Secretary of Defense and the Director of theOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish a new human resources management (HRM)system for DOD's civilian employees and to jointly prescribe regulations for the system. TheSecretary and the Director are authorized to establish and adjust a labor relations system and arerequired to provide a written description of the proposed personnel system or any adjustments tosuch system to the labor organizations representing DOD employees. A collaboration proceduremust be followed by the Secretary, Director, and employee representatives.

The Secretary also is authorized to establish anappeals process that provides fair treatment for DOD employees covered by the NSPS.

A qualifying employee subject to some severe disciplinary actions maypetition the MSPB for review of the department's decision. The board could dismiss any petition thatdoes not raise a substantial question of fact or law and order corrective action only if the board findsthat the department's personnel decision did not meet some prescribed standards. An employeeadversely affected by a final decision or order of the board could obtain judicial review. Subtitle Cof Title XI includes amendments to the government-wide policies for the federal employee overtimepay cap, military leave, and Senior Executive Service pay, and creates a Human Capital PerformanceFund to reward the highest-performing and most valuable employees in an agency. DOD and OPM jointly published final regulations for the NSPS in the Federal Register onNovember 1, 2005. The regulations state that \"issuances\" to implement the regulations will beprepared by DOD. Draft versions of the \"issuances\" are currently under discussion by thedepartment and labor organizations. A coalition of federal unions, including the AmericanFederation of Government Employees, filed a lawsuit in federal district court challenging the finalregulations. On February 27, 2006, the court enjoined the regulations because they failed to ensurecollective bargaining rights, did not provide for independent third-party review of labor relationsdecisions, and failed to provide a fair process for appealing adverse actions. DOD said that it willappeal the decision. In early March 2006, DOD stated that the phased implementation of the newsystem and its classification, performance management, compensation, staffing, and workforceshaping components would begin in April 2006, with some 11,000 employees. This report will beupdated to reflect changes in the status of implementation."
