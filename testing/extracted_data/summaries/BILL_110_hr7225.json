    "content": "National Parents Corps Act of 2008 - Directs the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, subject to the availability of appropriations, to award a grant to a nonprofit entity to establish a National Parents Corps program to promote safety and combat youth violence and substance abuse in public middle or secondary schools. Requires the NPCP Nonprofit Partner to: (1) select for program participation annually schools that agree to host a Parent Leader for a number of years equal to the number of grade levels they offer. And (2) employ, after a background check, a Parent Leader from among the parents of students enrolled in the lowest grade at each participating school to work on a full-time basis with students, other parents, and school officials to treat, prevent, and reduce violence and drug, alcohol, and tobacco addiction among students. Urges participating schools to take the measures necessary to secure funding for the employment of Parent Leaders after federal funding becomes unavailable."
