    "content": "Safe Toys for Kids Act - Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to require every manufacturer of an article for use by a child under 60 months of age which is subject to a consumer product safety standard or a rule under any Act administered by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) declaring a consumer product a banned hazardous product to certify, based on testing conducted by a nongovernmental independent third party, that the product conforms to such standard or is not a banned hazardous product. Bars importation of such articles lacking independent third party certification. Allows the CPSC, by rule, to designate as a banned manufacturing site any facility in which consumer products are manufactured that has regularly produced consumer products which fail to comply with any applicable consumer product safety standard or engages in acts or practices likely to result in the production of imminently hazardous consumer products. Prohibits imports from banned sites."
