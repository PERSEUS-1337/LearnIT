    "title": "AB 982",
    "content": "Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to adopt rules and regulations on eligibility, enrollment, and priority of services needed to implement laws relating to child care and development services. Existing law requires families to meet certain requirements in order to be eligible for subsidized child development services, including that the family needs child care services because the child is identified by a legal, medical, or social services agency, or emergency shelter as being a recipient of a protective service or being neglected, abused, or exploited, as provided. This bill would expand the list of entities that can identify a child in need to include a local educational agency liaison for homeless children and youths, a Head Start program, or a transitional shelter. The bill would expand the list of children to be identified to include a homeless child."
