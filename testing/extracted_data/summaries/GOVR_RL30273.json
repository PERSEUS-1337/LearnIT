    "content": "Encryption exports are controlled under the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and the Export Administration Act (EAA),the latter statute to expire August 20, 2001. The more stringent AECA controls, administered by the StateDepartment,apply to encryption items classified as defense articles or services. Items not so classified are subject to regulationby theDepartment of Commerce (DOC) under the extended EAA authorities. DOC requires licenses for certaincommodities andsoftware, but allows other encryption items to be exported under license exceptions. The U.S. Government has traditionally maintained that controls over strong encryption are necessary for nationalsecurity, foreign policy, and law enforcement reasons. Industry has argued that federal regulatory policiesinsufficientlyaddress rapid technological developments, prevent manufacturers from marketing products available abroad, andharm U.S.national interests by making strong U.S. encryption unobtainable by legitimate users worldwide. While mostencryptionwas originally controlled under the AECA, in late 1996 the President transferred jurisdiction over nonmilitary itemstoDOC, which at the same time eased controls over commercial encryption that used a key recovery feature or wasdestinedfor financial institutions. In 1998 the Administration further relaxed controls over 56-bit technology generally andstrongerencryption destined for U.S. subsidiaries, insurance companies, and other end-users, retreating from earlier keyrecoveryrequirements. Further modifications were announced in September 1999, allowing license exceptions for the exportofencryption of any key length after a technical review to most end-users in all but terrorist countries; draft regulationswereissued in late 1999. Following criticism by companies, privacy groups and Internet proponents, DOC expandedaspects ofits original proposal and issued new regulations in January 2000. Regulations issued in October 2000 furtherstreamlinedcontrols over encryption exports to 23 countries including European Member states. Restrictive export licensingregulations have raised constitutional concerns, some arguing that they impose a prior restraint on speech inviolation of theFirst Amendment. Federal courts have both upheld and dismissed First Amendment challenges to export controls,theoutcome generally turning on whether the court viewed the encryption item and its export as essentially expressiveorfunctional. Courts in California and Ohio have allowed challenges to proceed, holding that encryption source codeisprotected speech for First Amendment purposes. Legislation introduced in the 106th Congress would have required increased liberalization of encryption export controls. H.R. 850 , the Security and Freedom Through Encryption (SAFE) Act, was reported fromthe HouseJudiciary Committee, House Commerce Committee (as amended), and House International Relations Committee(asamended); significantly more restrictive versions of the bill had been reported by the House Armed ServicesCommitteeand House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ( H.Rept. 106-117 , Pts 1-5). S. 798 , the PromoteReliable On-Line Transactions to Encourage Commerce and Trade (PROTECT) Act of 1999, was reported favorablyandwithout amendment by the Senate Commerce Committee ( S.Rept. 106-142 ). No further action was taken on thesebills. This report will be updated periodically."
