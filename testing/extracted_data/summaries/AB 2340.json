    "title": "An act to amend Sections 626.9 and 30310 of the Penal Code, relating to firearms.",
    "content": "Existing law, the Gun-Free School Zone Act of 1995, subject to exceptions, prohibits a person from possessing a firearm in a place that the person knows, or reasonably should know, is a school zone, unless with the written permission of certain school district officials. Existing law defines a school zone as an area on the grounds of a school providing instruction in kindergarten or grades 1 to 12, inclusive, or within a distance of 1,000 feet of that school. Existing law, subject to exceptions, prohibits a person from bringing or possessing a firearm upon the grounds of a campus of a public or private university or college, or buildings owned or operated for student housing, teaching, research, or administration by a public or private university or college, that are contiguous or are clearly marked university property, as specified, unless with the written permission of specified university or college officials. Under existing law, a violation of these provisions is a felony, or, under specified circumstances, a misdemeanor. Under existing law, certain persons are exempt from both the school zone and the university prohibitions, including, among others, a retired peace officer authorized to carry a concealed or loaded firearm. This bill would exempt from both the school zone and the university prohibitions a person holding a valid license to carry a concealed firearm who is also protected by a domestic violence protective order, as specified. Existing law, subject to exceptions, prohibits carrying ammunition or reloaded ammunition onto school grounds unless it is with the written permission of the school district superintendent, the superintendent\u2019s designee, or equivalent school authority. This bill would exempt from that prohibition a person holding a valid license to carry a concealed firearm who is also protected by a domestic violence protective order, as specified. The bill would make additional technical, nonsubstantive changes."
