    "content": "The 109th Congress, like the two before it, is expected to consider proposals to controlemissions of multiple pollutants from electric power plants. The bills include anAdministration-based proposal, the Clear Skies Act (S. 131), which would control emissions ofsulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and mercury, and other bills that would control thethree pollutants plus the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Much of the debate surrounding the Administration's Clear Skies proposal has focused onits cap-and-trade implementation scheme. But in some ways, the proposal's cap-and-trade provisionsare its least significant aspects in terms of the proposal's interaction with the structure of the CleanAir Act. EPA has already promulgated regulations using a regional cap-and-trade program to controlNOx emissions over the eastern United States (the \"NOx SIP Call\") under existing Clean Air Actauthority, and has proposed other cap-and-trade regulations to achieve Clear Skies' level ofreductions over 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia for both SO 2 and NOx (in the CleanAir Interstate Rule). In addition, EPA has proposed cap-and-trade regulations to achieve mercuryreductions similar to those in Clear Skies, although the legality of these regulations is morequestionable. Critical to the fabric of the Clean Air Act are the various provisions in Clear Skies to alteror to delete existing sections of the Act with respect to both electric generating units (EGUs) andindustrial sources that choose to opt into the program. The Administration has made it clear that withClear Skies' comprehensive approach to EGUs and opt-ins, it believes certain CAA provisions needno longer apply to them, in some cases permanently, in others for as long as 20 years or under certainconditions. These include most statutory requirements for Prevention of Significant Deteriorationand attainment of National Ambient Air Quality Standards under Title I of the Act, as well as mostcontrols on hazardous air pollutants as they apply to EGUs and opt-ins. These changes woulddiminish the suite of options states currently have to achieve compliance with air quality standards. In July 2001 testimony, then-EPA Administrator Whitman identified the central issue inClear Skies' interaction with current law: Are the emission reduction targets stringent enough topermit the relaxing or removal of current provisions of the Clean Air Act designed to achieve thesame thing with respect to electric utilities? EPA's analysis indicates that Clear Skies will notachieve either the 8-hour ozone or the fine particulate ambient air quality standards that the agencyrecently implemented within current CAA compliance deadlines. Some nonattainment areas willneed additional controls and time to reach attainment. Clear Skies addresses these issues in part byproviding 5 to 15 years of additional time, while effectively removing additional electric utilitycontrol from the suite of options available to states to achieve the standards. Similarly, withmercury, Clear Skies proposes relatively modest controls on electric utilities, and, as currentlydrafted, would effectively remove additional electric utility controls from the suite of optionsavailable to the states. The ability of industrial sources to opt into Clear Skies could further reducestate control options for both mercury and criteria pollutants. This report will not be updated."
