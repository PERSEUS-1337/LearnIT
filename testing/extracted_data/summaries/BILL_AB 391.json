    "title": "AB 391",
    "content": "Existing law establishes conditional voter registration, using an affidavit of registration, whereby a person is permitted to register to vote after the 15th day before an election or on election day, and cast a provisional ballot to be counted if the conditional voter registration is deemed effective. Existing law establishes the procedures and requirements for determining whether a conditional voter registration is deemed effective, requires the county elections official to offer conditional voter registration and provisional voting at its permanent offices, and authorizes the official to offer this registration and voting at satellite offices on election day. This bill would require that a registrant provide proof of residence, as specified, in order for a conditional voter registration to be deemed effective. If a conditional voter registration is not deemed effective, the bill would require the elections official to process the affidavit of registration, as specified, and if all other eligibility requirements are met, would require the registration to be effective in forthcoming elections. By imposing additional duties on county election officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
