    "content": "Most of the funding for the activities of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) comes from discretionary appropriations provided each year in the annual appropriations acts, typically as a part of the Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies appropriations bill (THUD). HUD's programs are primarily designed to address housing problems faced by households with very low incomes or other special housing needs. This report tracks FY2017 appropriations for the department. Full-Year Appropriations: On May 5, 2017, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017 was signed into law (P.L. 115-31). Title II of Division K provides $48.1 billion in gross appropriations for HUD's programs and activities; after accounting for savings from offsets, the net new budget authority for the department totals $38.8 billion. The law provides a $1 billion increase in funding for HUD's policies and programs over FY2016, which is primarily attributable to funding increases for the largest accounts in HUD's budget: the tenant-based rental assistance (TBRA) account (+$663 million) and project-based rental assistance (PBRA) account (+$196 million). Those increases largely maintain current services for the roughly 3 million low-income families who receive housing assistance through the Housing Choice Voucher program and the project-based Section 8 program. The largest relative increase in funding was provided for HUD's lead hazard reduction programs (+32%). Continuing Resolutions: Congress did not enact regular full-year FY2017 appropriations for HUD prior to the end of FY2016. Instead, HUD and most other federal agencies were funded through a series of continuing resolutions. Senate Action: On May 19, 2016, the full Senate approved FY2017 appropriations for HUD as a part of a substitute amendment to H.R. 2577 (which incorporated both the committee-reported version of the THUD bill (S. 2844) and the committee-reported version of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies bill). It included $48.4 billion in gross discretionary appropriations for HUD's programs and activities, a 3% increase from the FY2016 level. After accounting for savings from offsets and rescissions, the bill included $39.2 billion in net discretionary budget authority, a 2% increase from the FY2016 level. House Action: On May 24, 2016, the House Appropriations Committee approved its version of a FY2017 THUD appropriations bill (H.R. 5394). It included $48 billion in gross discretionary appropriations and $38.7 billion in net discretionary budget authority for HUD, nearly $1 billion less than was requested and about $500 million less than was included in the Senate version. Like the Senate bill, H.R. 5394 proposed increases to the TBRA and PBRA accounts, but the increases were smaller than those in the Senate bill or requested by the President. President's Budget Request: Congressional action followed the release of the Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request to Congress on February 9, 2016. The request included $48.9 billion in gross discretionary appropriations for HUD (+4% from FY2016) and $39.6 billion in net discretionary budget authority (+3.5% from FY2016). The largest funding increases proposed were for the PBRA and TBRA accounts."
