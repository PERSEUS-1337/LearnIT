    "content": "Agricultural Trade Reform Act of 1996 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to include within the definition of domestic industry the producers of a like or directly competitive perishable agricultural, citrus, or potato product, in a specific geographic area of the United States whose collective production of such article constitutes a significant proportion of its total domestic production. Authorizes the International Trade Commission (ITC) to treat as a domestic industry only that portion of the production of such products located in such geographic area. Amends provisional relief guidelines to require the ITC to expedite its determination procedure upon request by either the President or the US Trade Representative , stating that provisional relief may be necessary to prevent or remedy actual or threatened serious injury to the domestic industry. Cites conditions under which the ITC may waive the 90-day monitoring requirement."
