    "content": "Every four years, at noon on January 20, the President-elect is sworn in as President of the United States. The year before the inauguration, Congress establishes the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. The Joint Inaugural Committee is responsible for the planning and execution of the swearing-in ceremony and hosting an inaugural luncheon for the President and Vice President at the U.S. Capitol. Pursuant to S.Con.Res. 28 and S.Con.Res. 29 in the 114th Congress (2015-2016), the 2017 inaugural ceremony will be held at the U.S. Capitol, with the swearing-in ceremony on the West Front Steps and special events held in the Rotunda and Emancipation Hall of the Capitol Visitor Center. The tradition of authorizing a Joint Inaugural Committee dates to 1901 for the inauguration of President William McKinley. At that time, the House and Senate authorized that inaugural expenses be paid by the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate and created a committee of three Representatives and three Senators appointed by the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House. Since 1901, the Joint Inaugural Committee has been authorized quadrennially. On February 3, 2016, Congress authorized the Joint Inaugural Committee for the 2017 Inauguration. Representing the Senate on the 2017 Joint Inaugural Committee are Senator Roy Blunt, chair of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration; Senator Mitch McConnell, Senate majority leader; and Senator Charles Schumer, ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. Representing the House of Representatives are Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. This report provides historical information on the Joint Inaugural Committee, including the committee's origin, membership, leadership, staffing, and inaugural activities."
