    "content": "Social Security Reporting Information and Right to Know Act of 2001 - Amends part A of title XI of the Social Security Act (SSA) with regard to Social Security account statements to require them to contain additional statements of specified information relating to projections of the future financial operations and status of the Social Security program under SSA title II (OASDI). Amends SSA title II with regard to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund to require the Board of Trustees of the Trust Funds annual report to Congress on the operation and status of such Trust Funds to include similarly related information. Amends SSA title XVII (Administration) to direct the Commissioner of Social Security to submit an annual report to Congress that includes specified information relating to program solvency and expected benefits. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) Congress and the President should not miss a critical opportunity to enact comprehensive bipartisan Social Security reform legislation that meets the standard of 75-year actuarial solvency and also addresses specified issues, such as the permanent sustainability of the Social Security program. And (2) the recommendations of the Technical Panel on Assumptions and Methods of the Social Security Advisory Board should be implemented to the extent deemed reasonable by the Board of Trustees of the Trust Funds."
