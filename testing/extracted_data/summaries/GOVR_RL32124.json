    "content": "Since the 1980s, Guatemala has been consolidating its transition from a centuries-long tradition of mostly autocratic rule toward representative government. A democratic constitution was adoptedin 1985, and a democratically-elected government was inaugurated in 1986. Democratic institutionsremain fragile. A 36-year civil war ended in 1996 with the signing of the Peace Accords betweenthe government and the left-wing guerrilla movement. The accords not only ended the civil conflict,but constituted a blueprint for profound political, economic, and social change to address theconflict's root causes. They outline a profound restructuring of state institutions, with the goals ofending government security forces' impunity from prosecution, consolidating the rule of law;shifting government funding away from the military and into health, education, and other basicservices to reach the rural and indigenous poor; and the full participation of the indigenouspopulation in local and national decision making processes. From1997-2003, U.S. assistance toGuatemala focused on support of the peace process. Aid has declined from about $60 million inFY2002 to $38 million requested for FY2005. In the conference report for the FY2004 omnibusappropriations bill ( H.Rept. 108-401 ), Congress criticized the Administration's strategy of reducingstaffing and funding for Guatemala. Current conditions on aid are in P.L. 108-199 ; proposedlegislation related to Guatemala includes H.R. 1300 ; H.R. 2534 ; and S.Res. 289 . Former Guatemala City mayor Oscar Berger of the center-right coalition Great National Alliance was elected president with 54% of the vote and inaugurated on January 14, 2004, for afour-year term. Since taking office, he has pursued corruption charges against his predecessor,Alfonso Portillo, of the Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG), and other former FRG officials. Berger has also proposed military reforms including cutting troops by a third, slashing defensespending, and modernizing defense policy. His proposed economic reforms include new income taxrates and a temporary tax to fund programs related to the peace process. Despite his decisive loss in the first round presidential elections, retired General Efrain Rios Montt remains a divisive force. Berger's top defense official, General Otto Perez, resigned in Mayto protest negotiations between Berger officials and the FRG, of which Rios Montt is still leader. Rios Montt was military dictator from 1982-1983, while the army carried out a counter-insurgencycampaign resulting in what is now characterized as genocide of the Mayan population. Regarding respect for human rights, Guatemala has made enormous strides, but significant problems remain. The armed conflict is definitively ended, and the state policy of human rightsabuses has been ended. On the other hand, strengthening of civilian power over military forces isslow, and security forces reportedly continue to commit gross violations of human rights withimpunity. The U.N., the OAS, and the United States have all expressed concern that human rightsviolations have increased over the past several years, and that past Guatemalan governments havetaken insufficient steps to curb them or to implement the Peace Accords.
