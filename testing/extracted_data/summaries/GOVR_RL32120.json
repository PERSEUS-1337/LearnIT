    "content": "The purpose of this report is to provide Congress with an overview of the nature and statusof the designated foreign terrorist organizations list, as a potential tool in overseeing theimplementation and effects of U.S. legislation designed to sanction terrorists. It centers on the listof terrorist groups that are formally designated by the Secretary of State pursuant to section 219 ofthe Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended under the Antiterrorism and Effective DeathPenalty Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-132 ). These groups are often collectively referred to as the \"FTO list.\" FTO list designations, which last for two years and must be renewed, occur after aninteragency process involving the departments of State, Justice, Homeland Security, and theTreasury. Since the designations can be challenged in court, they require a detailed administrativerecord often based on classified information. An organization that is placed on the FTO list issubject to financial and immigration sanctions, potentially including the blocking of assets, theprosecution of supporters who provide funds, refusal of visas, and deportations of members. Therehave been a number of designations and changes since the list was established, but it currentlyincludes thirty-six organizations. (See Appendix A.) The FTO list is often confused with some of the other \"terrorist lists\" that are maintained bythe U.S. government. These include the \"state-sponsors of terrorism\" list, which is pursuant toSection 6(j) of the 1979 Export Administration Act ( P.L. 96-72 ; 50 U.S.C. app. 2405(6)(j)); the\"Specially Designated Terrorists\" (SDTs) list, which is pursuant to the International EmergencyEconomic Powers Act ( P.L. 95-223 ; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq .) and was initiated in 1995 underPresidential Executive Order 12947; the \"Specially Designated Global Terrorists\" (SDGT) list,initiated in 2001 under Presidential Executive Order 13224; and, finally, the \"Specially DesignatedNationals and Blocked Persons\" (SDN) list, a master list that contains the other lists. All of theseare summarized and maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Treasury Department. Lastly, the \"Terrorist Exclusion List\" or \"TEL,\" which relates to immigration and is pursuant toSection 411 of the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (8 U.S.C.1182) is maintained by the State Department. Like the FTO list, the TEL includes the names of terrorist organizations, but it has a broader standardfor inclusion, is subject to less stringent administrative requirements, and is not challengeable incourt. There is a complicated interplay among all of these lists, and it is important to distinguishthem from the better-known FTO list. The FTO list has been of considerable interest to Congress, and there are arguments in favorand against it. It publicly stigmatizes groups and provides a clear focal point for interagencycooperation on terrorist sanctions; however, some argue that it is inflexible and misleading, sincegroups that are not on the list are still often subject to U.S. sanctions. The report concludes with adiscussion of potential policy options for Congress, including some of the recently proposedamendments to the legislation that establishes it. It will be updated as events warrant."
