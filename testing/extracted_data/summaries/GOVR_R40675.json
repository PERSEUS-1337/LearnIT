    "content": "This report addresses the duties and functions of statutory Inspectors General (IGs); the numbers of each type of IG; the differences between IGs appointed by the President and those appointed by the agency head; considerations for whether certain IGs should be appointed by the President as opposed to the agency head; and the Inspector General Reform Act of 2008 (Reform Act), P.L. 110-409. In October 2008, Congress enacted the Reform Act, which created additional protections and authorities for IGs with regard to removal or transfer of an IG, budgets, law enforcement authority, pay, subpoena power, and websites. This report also addresses proposed changes affecting offices of inspectors general (OIGs) or establishing new OIGs in select bills in the 111th Congress: H.R. 885/S. 1354, the Improved Financial Commodity Markets Oversight and Accountability Act; H.R. 3126, the Consumer Financial Protection Agency Act of 2009; and H.R. 3962, the Affordable Health Care for America Act. On March 25, 2009, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's Subcommittee on Government Management, Organization, and Procurement held a hearing entitled, \"The Roles and Responsibilities of Inspectors General within Financial Regulatory Agencies,\" at which the subcommittee discussed H.R. 885 and other issues. The House passed H.R. 885 on a voice vote under suspension of the rules on June 8, 2009."
