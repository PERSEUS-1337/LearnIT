    "content": "Trends in U.S. assistance to the Latin America and Caribbean region generally reflect the trends and rationales for U.S. foreign aid programs globally. Aid to the region increased during the 1960s with the Alliance for Progress, and during the 1980s with aid to Central America. Since 2000, aid levels have increased, especially in the Andean region, as the focus has shifted from Cold War issues to counternarcotics and security assistance. Current aid levels to Latin America and the Caribbean comprise about 5.8% of the worldwide FY2007 aid budget, including both bilateral and multilateral assistance. Amounts requested for the regular FY2008 budget would increase this ratio to 6.1%, and to 7.2% if Congress approves supplemental funds for a new counternarcotics initiative in Mexico and Central America. Three countries\u2014Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador\u2014have signed compacts for Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) funds worth a combined $851 million. Aid levels to the region could increase further as more countries become eligible for MCA. Both Haiti and Guyana are focus countries for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). For the FY2008 regular budget, the Administration has requested $1.57 billion in assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, the largest portion of which would be allocated to the Andean region, or $823.8 million. Mexico and Central America are slated to receive $220.4 million in regular funds, plus $550 million in supplemental counternarcotics funds. The Caribbean would receive $365.5 million. Brazil and the Southern Cone of South America are to receive an estimated $18.5 million. Aid programs are designed to achieve a variety of goals, from poverty reduction to economic growth. Child Survival and Health (CSH) funds focus on combating infectious diseases and promoting child and maternal health. Development Assistance (DA) promotes sustainable economic growth in key areas such as trade, agriculture, education, the environment, and democracy. The Economic Support Fund (ESF) assists countries of strategic importance to the United States, and funds programs relating to justice sector reforms, local governance, anti-corruption, and respect for human rights. Counternarcotics programs seek to assist countries to reduce drug production, interdict trafficking, and promote alternative crop development. Military assistance provides grants to nations for the purchase of U.S. defense equipment, services, and training. The annual State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations bills are the vehicles by which Congress provides funding for foreign assistance programs. Congress will likely continue to take interest in a number of related issues, including the level of aid, the effectiveness of counternarcotics assistance, and how best to address the spread of HIV/AIDS, and address poverty in the region. This report will be updated as country level funding figures for FY2008 become available."
