    "content": "The ADA Amendment Act (ADAAA), P.L. 110-325, was enacted in 2008 to amend the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) definition of disability. On March 25, 2011, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued final regulations implementing the ADAAA. The final regulations track the statutory language of the ADA but also provide several clarifying interpretations. Several of the major regulatory interpretations are, including the operation of major bodily functions in the definition of major life activities; adding rules of construction for when an impairment substantially limits a major life activity and providing examples of impairments that will most often be found to substantially limit a major life activity; interpreting the coverage of transitory impairments; interpreting the use of mitigating measures; and interpreting the \"regarded as\" prong of the definition."
