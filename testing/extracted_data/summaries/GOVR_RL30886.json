Share of Traffic. Mexico continued to be the transit point for about 50-65% of the cocaine entering the United Statesfrom South America in 2000, with the uncertain and varying estimates being similar to estimates in recent years. Mexicoalso continued to be a major source country for heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine, and a major center formoneylaundering activities. Control Efforts. Seizures of cocaine by Mexico in 2000 were down 31% from 1999, and down 12% from the 1994-1999average, which might be viewed as lagging performance. Seizures of opium were down from unusually high levelsin1999, but represented a 32% increase over the 1994-1999 average. Seizures of heroin were up slightly, whileseizures ofmarijuana, methamphetamine, and drug labs were up significantly. Arrests were up slightly in2000, to reach the highestlevels in the last seven years except for 1996, but numerous instances of apparent corruption persist. Severalimportantdrug traffickers were arrested in 2000, including key members of the Arellano Feliz or Tijuana cartel, Ismael \"ElMayel\"Higuera Guerrero (chief operations officer) and Jesus \"Chuy\" Labra Aviles (financial manager). While only oneMexicannational was extradited to the United States in 2000 on drug-related charges, a January 2001 ruling by the MexicanSupreme Court, and Mexican Senate approval of the temporary surrender protocol are promising developments. Eradication of opium and marijuana declined somewhat in 2000, but with fewer hectares ofcultivation, the potential yieldof opium declined markedly to a new record low, and the potential yield of marijuana was lower than four of theprevioussix years. Cooperative Efforts. U.S.-Mexico counter-narcotics cooperation continued at unprecedented levels during the final yearsof the presidencies of Zedillo and Clinton, with the full range of law enforcement, military, border, and drug controlagencies being involved. In the last two years the countries agreed on measures to gauge the effectiveness of thejointanti-drug strategy, they established a new interdiction working group that led to significantly increased maritimeinterdiction cooperation, and they took various cooperative steps to control money laundering activities. They alsocooperated on U.N. and OAS anti-drug activities, including the development and first application of the multilateralevaluation mechanism (MEM) of the Inter-American Drug Control Commission (CICAD) to assess thecounter-narcoticsperformance of all member countries. Following elections in both countries, Presidents Fox and Bush met inMexico inmid-February 2001, and agreed to strengthen law enforcement and counter-narcotics cooperation between thecountries."
