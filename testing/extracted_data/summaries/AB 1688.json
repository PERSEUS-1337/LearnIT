    "title": "An act to amend Section 361.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to juveniles.",
    "content": "Existing law prohibits a social worker, when he or she must place a dependent child outside the county, from making the placement until he or she has served written notice on the parent or guardian at least 14 days prior to the placement, except as specified. Existing law authorizes the parent or guardian to object to the placement. This bill would require that the notice also be served on the child\u2019s attorney and, if the child is 10 years of age or older, on the child, and would authorize the child to object to the placement. By imposing additional duties on county social workers, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
