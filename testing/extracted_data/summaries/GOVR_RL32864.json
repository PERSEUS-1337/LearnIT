    "content": "Kyrgyzstan is a small and poor country that gained independence in 1991 with the breakupof the Soviet Union. It was long led by Askar Akayev -- who many observers warned was becomingincreasingly autocratic -- but the country was still considered \"the most open, progressive andcooperative in Central Asia,\" according to the U.S. Agency for International Development. TheUnited States has been interested in helping Kyrgyzstan to enhance its sovereignty and territorialintegrity, increase democratic participation and civil society, bolster economic reform anddevelopment, strengthen human rights, prevent weapons proliferation, and more effectively combattransnational terrorism and trafficking in persons and narcotics. The significance of Kyrgyzstan tothe United States increased after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. TheKyrgyz government permitted the United States to establish a military base that trans-shipspersonnel, equipment, and supplies to support coalition operations in Afghanistan. Many people both inside and outside Kyrgyzstan were hopeful that the national legislativeelection on February 27, 2005 would strengthen political pluralism, easing the way for a peacefulhandover of executive power in late 2005 when President Akayev was expected to step down. Thelegislative race proved highly contentious, however, and necessitated a second round of voting onMarch 13. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe tentatively concluded thatserious irregularities took place in the first round. After the February 27 vote, protestors occupiedgovernment offices in the southern part of the country, and protests spread throughout the rest of thecountry after the second round of voting. On March 24, thousands of protesters stormed thepresidential and other offices in the capital of Bishkek and Akayev and his family fled. He resignedas president on April 4. Acting president Kurmanbek Bakiyev has pledged to focus on combatingcorruption that siphons away investment capital, and stressed that foreign policy would not change,including Kyrgyzstan's close relations with Russia and the United States. Looming challenges toKyrgyzstan's stability include a planned presidential election, possible legislative by-elections to fillseats under dispute, and a possible referendum to adopt democratic changes to the constitution. Indicating early support for democratization and continued security ties, Defense SecretaryDonald Rumsfeld briefly visited Kyrgyzstan on April 14. Cumulative U.S. budgeted assistance toKyrgyzstan for FY1992-FY2004 was $749.0 million (FREEDOM Support Act and agency funds). Kyrgyzstan ranks third in such aid per capita among the Soviet successor states, indicative of U.S.government and Congressional support in the early 1990s for its apparent progress in makingreforms and more recently for anti-terrorism and border protection. Of this aid, 14.6% supporteddemocratization programs. While this aid has bolstered the growth of civil society in Kyrgyzstan,the Administration also has stressed that the United States did not orchestrate the coup. As Congressand the Administration consider how to assist democratic and economic transformation inKyrgyzstan, several possible programs have been suggested, including those to buttress civil rights,construct a federal government, and bolster private sector economic growth.
