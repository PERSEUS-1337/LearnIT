    "content": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) impose a tax equal to 15 percent of the gross income received from the lease of any taxable outdoor advertising display. And (2) establish in the Treasury the Outdoor Advertising Program Trust Fund into which the revenues collected from the imposition of such tax shall be deposited. Amends Federal aid highway law to repeal a provision which allows outdoor advertising to be placed within a certain distance of unzoned commercial or industrial areas on or near the Interstate and primary highway systems. Prohibits: (1) any new sign, display, or device from being erected after the enactment of this Act in specified areas adjacent to such systems. And (2) compensation from being paid for the removal of such signs and related advertising, with exceptions. Requires funds for the control of outdoor advertising to be appropriated from the Fund. Provides that a State shall not be considered to have made provision for effective control of the erection and maintenance of signs along the Interstate and primary systems: (1) unless it maintains and annually submits to the Secretary of Transportation an inventory of all State signs for which such control is required. And (2) if it carries out or permits the removal of vegetation in, or alteration of, certain rights-of-way in order to improve the visibility of any sign located outside a right-of-way. Requires such State inventory to identify each sign that is located along a system highway designated as a scenic byway."
