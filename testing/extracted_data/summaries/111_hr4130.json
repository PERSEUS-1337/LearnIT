Exempts members of the Armed Forces who have received combat zone compensation, family members of such members who received a death gratuity on or after September 11, 2001, and taxpayers whose adjusted gross income does not exceed $30,000. Authorizes the President to delay the implementation of such tax for up to one year if the President determines that the US economy is too weak to absorb it."
