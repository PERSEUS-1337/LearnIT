    "title": "AB 283",
    "content": "Existing law prescribes the instruments in, and criteria by which, a local agency, as defined, may invest and deposit its funds, including its surplus funds. Existing law, until January 1, 2017, authorizes, under certain conditions, a local agency to invest up to a certain percentage of its surplus funds in deposits at specified types of financial institutions that use a private sector entity to assist in the placement of deposits, whether those investments are certificates of deposit or in another form. With respect to investments other than a certificate of deposit, existing law limits the percentage of local agency funds that may be invested by any one private sector entity. Existing law, on and after January 1, 2017, limits this authority to invest surplus funds to investments in certificates of deposit. This bill would extend the existing temporary authority for a local agency to invest its surplus funds, in certificates of deposit or in another form of investment, until January 1, 2021, and for that time period, would remove a limitation on the percentage of local agency funds that may be invested in certificates of deposit. This bill would, on and after January 1, 2021, indefinitely authorize a local agency to invest surplus funds to investments in certificates of deposit, as specified. This bill would also remove the limit on the percentage of local agency funds that may be invested by any one private sector entity, as specified."
