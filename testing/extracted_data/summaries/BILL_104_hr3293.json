    "content": "Safe Drinking Water Estrogenic Substances Screening Program Act - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to develop and, under specified conditions, implement a screening program, using appropriate validated test systems, to determine whether certain substances may have an effect in humans that is similar to an effect produced by a naturally occurring estrogen, or such other endocrine effect as the Administrator may designate. Allows the Administrator to exempt a biologic or other substance if the Administrator determines that the substance does not have any effect in humans similar to an effect produced by a naturally occurring estrogen. Requires the Administrator to order a manufacturer of a substance for which such testing is required to conduct such testing and submit results within a certain time period. Provides for suspension of the sale or distribution of the substance if the manufacturer fails to submit required information. Requires the Administrator to: (1) take such action as is necessary to ensure the protection of public health in the case of any substance that is found to have a potential adverse effect on humans, and (2) report findings and recommendations to the Congress."
