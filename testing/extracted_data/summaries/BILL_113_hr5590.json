Deems students who would be eligible for a Federal Pell Grant if not for their enrollment in secondary school to be eligible for an Early College Federal Pell Grant upon their completion of a full-time postsecondary semester or its equivalent. Allows students to receive Early College Federal Pell Grants in an amount equal to the cost of not more than four full-time postsecondary semesters or the equivalent while enrolled in postsecondary courses offered by an early college high school. Counts Early College Federal Pell Grants toward the twelve semester, or equivalent, limit on a student's receipt of Federal Pell Grants."
