    "content": "The population of persons age 65 and older in the United States is expected to grow both in numbers and as a percentage of the total population over the coming years, through 2030. In 2002, a bipartisan commission created by Congress issued a report, A Quiet Crisis in America, that detailed the need for affordable assisted housing and supportive services for elderly persons and the shortage the country will likely face as the population ages. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) operates a number of programs that provide assisted housing and supportive services for low-income elderly persons (defined by HUD as households where one or more persons are age 62 or older) to ensure that elderly residents in HUD-assisted housing can remain in their apartments as they age. This report describes those programs, along with current developments in the area of housing for elderly households. HUD operates five programs that designate assisted housing developments for either low-income elderly residents alone, or low-income elderly residents and residents with disabilities. The primary HUD program that provides housing for low-income elderly households is the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program. Established in 1959, it is the only HUD program that provides housing exclusively for elderly residents. The Section 221(d)(3) Below Market Interest Rate and Section 236 programs are mortgage subsidy programs that provide housing for all age levels, but have properties specifically dedicated to elderly households. The Public Housing and project-based Section 8 housing programs also have projects dedicated to elderly households. In addition to providing housing, HUD operates four supportive services programs for elderly persons residing in HUD-assisted properties. The Congregate Housing program, Service Coordinator program, and Resident Opportunity and Self-Sufficiency (ROSS) Service Coordinator program each provide services such as meals and assistance with activities of daily living. The Assisted Living Conversion Program makes grants to HUD-assisted developments so that they can convert units or entire buildings into assisted living facilities or service enriched housing. Congress has not funded new units of Section 202 housing since FY2011, though funds sufficient to pay rental assistance on existing units continue to be appropriated. In budget requests, the Administration has proposed to change the way in which new units of Section 202 housing are financed. The FY2013 and FY2014 budgets proposed that rental assistance through the Section 202 program be combined with other forms of capital financing (such as Low Income Housing Tax Credits) to fund new units. The Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities program has already adopted this structure. In the FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-76), Congress provided that excess amounts in residual receipts accounts could, upon Section 202 contract termination, be used to fund a housing and services demonstration project to analyze effects on delay or avoidance of nursing home entry. According to congressional budget justifications, HUD set aside $20 million for this purpose and, in January 2016, announced the availability of $15 million to owners of assisted multifamily properties serving elderly residents."
