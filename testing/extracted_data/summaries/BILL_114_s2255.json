    "content": "Stop Debt Collection Abuse Act of 2015 This bill amends the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act to redefine: (1) debt to include any obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay a loan, an overpayment, a fine, penalty, a fee, or other money to a federal agency and that is at least 180 days past due. And (2) debt collector to include any person who regularly collects debts owed or allegedly owed to a federal agency. A federal agency that is a creditor may sell or transfer a debt to a debt collector beginning 180 days after the obligation or alleged obligation arises. The Act is further amended by making the collection of any amount an unfair practice unless: the amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law. Or in the case of a debt owed a federal agency, the collection charge is reasonable in relation to actual collection costs, is authorized by a contract between the debt collector and the federal agency, and does not exceed 10 of the amount the debt collector collects. The Government Accountability Office must study the use of debt collectors by state and local government agencies."
