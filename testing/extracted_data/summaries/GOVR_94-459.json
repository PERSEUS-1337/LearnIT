    "content": "In 1915, the United States undertook a military occupation of Haiti to preempt anyEuropean intervention, to establish order out of civil strife, and to stabilize Haitian finances. Duringthe nineteen-year occupation, U.S. military and civilian officials, numbering less than 2,500 for the most part,supervised the collection of taxes and the disbursement of revenues, maintained public order, and initiated a programofpublic works. The Haitian government remained in place, but was subject to U.S. guidance. The Haitian peoplebenefitted from the end of endemic political violence and from the construction of roads, bridges, and ports as wellas from improved access to health care. The U.S. occupation was, nonetheless, deeply resented throughout Haitiansociety, and many of its accomplishments did not long endure its termination in 1934."
