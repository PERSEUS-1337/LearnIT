    "title": "AB 1344",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school district, by a 23 vote of its members, to render a city or county zoning ordinance inapplicable to a proposed use of school district property, except when the proposed use is for nonclassroom facilities. This bill would extend this authorization to the governing board of a county office of education. Existing law prohibits a school district from rendering a city or county ordinance inapplicable to a charter school facility, unless the charter school facility is physically located within the geographic jurisdiction of the school district. This bill would also prohibit a county office of education from rendering a city or county ordinance inapplicable to a charter school facility, unless the charter school is physically located within the geographic jurisdiction of the county office of education. The bill would authorize, when a charter school facility is physically located within the geographic jurisdiction of a school district or county office of education , a charter school to make a written request for this school district or county office of education to render a city or county zoning ordinance inapplicable to a proposed use of the facility by the charter school, as specified. The bill would authorize the school district or county office of education to require specified documentation and payment of a reasonable fee along with this request. The bill would require the school district or county office of education to notify the city or county concerned that the school district or county office of education has taken this action. The bill would authorize the charter school to request a county office of education to provide the notice if the school district does not within a specified time period. The bill would also authorize the charter school, if the county office of education does not provide the notice within a specified time period, to file an appeal with the State Board of Education, which would be required to notify the city or county concerned of the inapplicability of the city or county ordinance to the charter school facility. By increasing the duties of local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
