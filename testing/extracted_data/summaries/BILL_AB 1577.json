    "title": "AB 1577",
    "content": "Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to establish and administer the State Emergency Food Assistance Program (SEFAP), to provide food and funding for the provision of emergency food to food banks, as provided. Existing law creates the State Emergency Food Assistance Program Account and, upon appropriation by the Legislature, allocates the moneys in the account to SEFAP and requires that those moneys be used for the purchase, storage, and transportation of food grown or produced in California and for the department\u2019s administrative costs. This bill would rename the State Emergency Food Assistance Program as the CalFood Program and would rename the State Emergency Food Assistance Program Account as the CalFood Account. The bill would make other conforming changes in this regard. This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 18995 of the Welfare and Institutions Code proposed by AB 1747 that would become operative if this bill and AB 1747 are both enacted and this bill is enacted last."
