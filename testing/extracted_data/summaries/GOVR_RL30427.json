    "content": "This report provides a current summary of ballistic and cruise missile activity in selectedcountries and discusses implications for U.S. national security policy. The Defense ThreatReduction Agency's Weapons of Mass Destruction Terms of Reference Handbook defines a ballisticmissile as \"a missile that is guided during powered flight and unguided during free flight when thetrajectory that it follows is subject only to the external influences of gravity and atmospheric drag\"and a cruise missile as \"a long-range, low-flying guided missile that can be launched from air, sea,and land.\" Ballistic and cruise missile development and proliferation continue to pose a threat toU.S. national security interests both at home and abroad. Approximately 35 countries currentlypossess operational ballistic missiles of various ranges and approximately 25 countries haveoperational cruise missiles with a range greater than 150 km (90 miles). Some analysts considercruise missile proliferation to be of more concern than that of ballistic missile proliferation, primarilydue to their low threshold of use, availability, affordability, and accuracy. This report will beupdated annually. With the fall of Iraq and the voluntary termination of Libya's ballistic missile program, manyview North Korean and Iranian missile and WMD programs as the primary \"rogue nation\"long-range ballistic missile threat to U.S. national security. Russia and China continue to be the onlytwo countries that could conceivably attack the United States with intercontinental ballistic missilesarmed with nuclear weapons, but improved relationships with both countries have done a great dealto diminish this threat over past decades. India's and Pakistan's ongoing missile developmentprograms are viewed by many as highly aggressive and even provocative, but are generally viewedin a regional context as opposed to a direct threat to the United States. The renewal of dialoguebetween these two countries in an attempt to settle their disputes by diplomatic means may also helpin slowing proliferation as well as preventing their potential use in this region. The implications of ballistic and cruise missile proliferation to the United States hasnecessitated both nonproliferation and counterproliferation approaches in trying to stem thedevelopment, deployment, and export of missiles. Past Administrations have been characterized asnonproliferation-oriented by some analysts while the current Bush Administration is viewed by someas having abandoned traditional nonproliferation for a more action-oriented approach towardsmissile proliferation. Other experts have suggested that the United States must somehow find theright balance between missile nonproliferation and counterproliferation policies if meaningful,long-term progress is to be made. While some believe that missile proliferation can be \"rolled back\"by some combination of these approaches, others note that both ballistic and cruise missiles havebecome such an integral part of many countries' national security frameworks, that it is highlyunlikely that countries will abandon their programs in deference to U.S. pressure."
