    "content": "Water Use Efficiency and Conservation Research Act - Requires the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Assistant Administrator for Research and Development to establish a research and development program to promote water use efficiency and conservation, including: (1) technologies and processes that enable the collection, storage, treatment, and reuse of rainwater, stormwater, and greywater, (2) water storage and distribution systems. And (3) behavioral, social, and economic barriers to achieving greater water use efficiency. Requires the Assistant Administrator to coordinate the development of a strategic research plan for the water use efficiency and conservation research and development program established by this Act with all other EPA research and development strategic plans. Requires the Assistant Administrator to: (1) facilitate the adoption of technology and processes to promote water use efficiency and conservation. And (2) collect and disseminate information on technologies and processes to promote water use efficiency and conservation, including information on incentives and impediments to development and commercialization, best practices, and anticipated increases in water use efficiency and conservation resulting from the implementation of specific technologies and processes. Requires at least four projects under which funding is provided for the incorporation into a building of the latest water use efficiency and conservation technologies and designs. Requires biennial reports to Congress on research and development projects initiated under this Act, outreach and communication activities concerning water use efficiency and conservation, and development and implementation of the strategic research plan. Directs the EPA Administrator to enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences for completion of a study of low impact and soft path strategies for management of water supply, wastewater, and stormwater. Authorizes appropriations."
