    "content": "Defense of Environment and Property Act of 2015 This bill amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to specify the types of water bodies that are quot, navigable watersquot. And therefore fall under the scope of the Act. Groundwater is considered to be state water. Activities carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the US Army Corps of Engineers may not impinge upon states' power over land and water use. States or individual property owners may obtain judicial review of jurisdictional determinations by the EPA or the Army Corps that would affect their ability to plan the development and use of land and water resources within 30 days after a determination. The EPA may not use a significant nexus test to determine federal jurisdiction over navigable waters and waters of the United States. The following rules are nullified: (1) the Army Corps' rule entitled quot, Final Rule for Regulatory Programs of the Corps of Engineers,quot, (2) the EPA's proposed rule entitled quot. Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the Clean Water Act Regulatory Definition of 'Waters of the United States,'quot, (3) the guidance document entitled quot. Clean Water Act Jurisdiction Following the US Supreme Court's Decision in Rapanos v. United States amp, Carabell v. United Statesquot. , and (4) any subsequent regulation or guidance issued by federal agencies that defines or interprets the term quot, navigable waters. quot. The Army Corps and the EPA may not promulgate rules or issue guidance that expands or interprets the definition of navigable waters unless expressly authorized by Congress. Federal agencies must obtain the consent of private property owners prior to entering their land to collect information about navigable waters. Federal agencies that issue regulations that relate to the definition of navigable waters or waters of the United States and diminish the fair market value or economic viability of a property must pay the affected property owner an amount equal to twice the value of the loss. Until the landowners have been compensated, such a regulation will have no force or effect."
