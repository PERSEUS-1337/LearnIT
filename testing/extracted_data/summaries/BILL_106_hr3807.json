    "content": "Directs the Secretary to: (1) issue an order requiring the establishment of a private home heating oil reserve for the Northeast if a certified plan has not been implemented within a specified time frame for an importer, refiner, or wholesaler that stores heating oil for sale in the Northeast. (2) periodically monitor supply levels to ensure that home heating oil inventories in the Northeast are adequate to supply customer needs during the present or following winter season so as to obviate sudden price increases caused by inadequate inventories. (3) require an importer, refiner, or wholesaler to increase its inventory if the Secretary determines that inventories are insufficient. And (4) establish civil penalties and cooperate with State energy authorities in carrying out this Act. Instructs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to take action to enable importers, refiners, or wholesalers to sell their remaining excess inventories at the end of each winter season."
