    "content": "Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Amendments of 1993 - Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 to establish mandatory sanctions and discretionary sanctions to be imposed on persons who contribute knowingly and materially to efforts by Iran or Iraq to acquire weapons of mass destruction or the means of their delivery. Authorizes the President to exercise the authorities of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to prohibit any transaction involving the property of a sanctioned person. Provides exceptions to the mandatory sanctions. Urges the President to initiate consultations with the government of a person sanctioned under this Act and to take steps in the United Nations and other multilateral groups to negotiate comprehensive multilateral sanctions under the United Nations Charter. Requires a report to the Congress concerning such consultations. Adds the conduct of knowingly contributing to the efforts of Iran or Iraq to acquire weapons of mass destruction or the means of their delivery to prohibited conduct for which certain sanctions shall be imposed against foreign countries under such Act. Adds to the authorized sanctions against such countries the denial of most-favored-nation status, the downgrading or suspension of diplomatic relations, the suspension of special trade privileges and trade agreements, the revocation of licenses for the export of nuclear materials, and the suspension of air flights to and from the United States. Provides exceptions and waivers. Requires imposed sanctions to apply for at least 24 months and to cease only if the President makes certain certifications to the Congress with respect to the cessation by the country or person of the action for which the sanctions were imposed."
