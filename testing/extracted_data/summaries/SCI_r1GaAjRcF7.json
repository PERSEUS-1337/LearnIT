    "content": "Optimal selection of a subset of items from a given set is a hard problem that requires combinatorial optimization. In this paper, we propose a subset selection algorithm that is trainable with gradient based methods yet achieves near optimal performance via submodular optimization. We focus on the task of identifying a relevant set of sentences for claim verification in the context of the FEVER task. Conventional methods for this task look at sentences on their individual merit and thus do not optimize the informativeness of sentences as a set. We show that our proposed method which builds on the idea of unfolding a greedy algorithm into a computational graph allows both interpretability and gradient based training. The proposed differentiable greedy network (DGN) outperforms discrete optimization algorithms as well as other baseline methods in terms of precision and recall. In this paper, we develop a subset selection algorithm that is differentiable and discrete, which can be trained on supervised data and can model complex dependencies between elements in a straightforward and comprehensible way. This is of particular interest in natural language processing tasks such as fact extraction, fact verification, and question answering where the proposed optimization scheme can be used for evidence retrieval.Conventional evidence retrieval methods that look at lexical or semantic similarity typically treat sentences or documents independently, potentially missing dependencies between them and therefore select redundant evidence. One way to address this shortcoming is by adding a diversity promoting submodular objective function BID28 BID17 BID18 BID6 BID13 . Submodularity is a property of set functions that can be expressed by the notion of diminishing returns that allows near-optimal solutions to be found in polynomial time for NP-hard problems.A submodular set function is a function that maps sets to scalar values and has the property that the incremental value of the function computed with an additional element to an input set never increases as the input set grows. Submodular functions are defined by this natural diminishing returns property, which makes them well suited for tasks such as claim verification. With respect to a claim, the amount of relevant information in a set of sentences has diminishing returns as the set grows, meaning that the amount of additional information in an additional piece of evidence shrinks as the set of selected evidence grows. Thus, any relevancy-measuring function that is learned from data would potentially benefit from a diminishing returns constraint as it would discount redundancy in favor of diverse but relevant evidence. Claim verification often requires complicated induction from multiple sentences, so promoting diversity among selected sentences is important to capture all facets of the claim. The resulting submodular optimization model can then handle dependencies between sentences and features, and despite making the sentence selection problem more difficult computationally, a near-optimal solution can be found efficiently using a simple forward greedy algorithm.The main contribution of this paper is a new optimization scheme which integrates continuous gradient-based and discrete submodular frameworks derived by unfolding a greedy optimization algorithm: the Differentiable Greedy Network (DGN). By unfolding a greedy algorithm into a computational graph, we can combine the advantages in interpretability and representation learning. Deep unfolding is a technique that transforms inference algorithms into computational graphs, thereby allowing the original model parameters to be trained discriminatively on labeled data while still exactly corresponding to the original model parameters BID9 . We show that making a greedy algorithm differentiable and adding trainable parameters leads to promising improvements in recall@k of 10%-18% and precision@k of 5%-27% for a sentence selection task, where k = 1, 3, 5, 7 is the number of selected evidence sentences, on the Fact Extraction and Verification (FEVER) dataset BID27 and, with fewer parameters, performs very similarly to a conventional deep network. As the DGN is bootstrapping a greedy algorithm, it can be easily extended to work on other information retrieval tasks such as question answering as well as other problems that rely on greedy approaches. While more sophisticated neural architectures can deliver better performance, we focus on showing the power of our new optimization scheme on a simpler model.In Section 2, we discuss related work in the domains of information retrieval, submodularity, and deep unfolding. In Section 3, we define submodularity and present the proposed Differentiable Greedy Network (DGN). Section 4 contains experiments and results for baseline models and DGN applied to sentence selection for the FEVER dataset as well as an ablation study. We draw conclusions in Section 5. Also, the attached Appendix 6 contains an additional example demonstrating the utility of promoting diversity. In this paper, we have shown that unfolding a greedy algorithm into a computational graph, allowing us to retain the interpretability and unsupervised initialization of a conventional greedy sentence selection approach while benefiting from supervised learning techniques. The proposed differentiable greedy network (DGN) outperforms conventional discrete optimization algorithms in terms of both recall and precision. Furthermore, as sentence retrieval is often part of a larger pipeline as in the FEVER shared task, using a differentiable greedy network serves as a step towards an end-end trainable system."
