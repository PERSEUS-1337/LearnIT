    "title": "An act to amend Sections 2263 and 2265 of the Elections Code, relating to elections.",
    "content": "Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue driver\u2019s licenses and state identification cards to applicants who meet specified criteria and provide the department with the required information. Existing law generally requires an applicant for an original driver\u2019s license or state identification card to submit satisfactory proof to the department that the applicant\u2019s presence in the United States is authorized under federal law. Existing law, the California New Motor Voter Program, requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to electronically provide to the Secretary of State the records of each person who is issued an original or renewal of a driver\u2019s license or state identification card or who provides the department with a change of address, as specified. The person\u2019s motor vehicle records will then constitute a completed affidavit of registration and the person will be registered to vote, unless the person affirmatively declines to become registered to vote during a transaction with the department, among other conditions. This bill would require the Department of Motor Vehicles to electronically provide records of a person to the Secretary of State pursuant to this program only if the person has submitted proof that he or she is a citizen of the United States, as specified. This bill would also require that a person affirmatively agree to become registered to vote during a transaction with the department in order for his or her records to constitute a completed affidavit of registration and for the Secretary of State to register him or her to vote."
