    "content": "National Domestic Violence Victim Notification Act - Amends the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 to authorize the Attorney General to make grants to private non-profit entities to create and operate a national victim notification (VINE) system to serve as a comprehensive community and individual awareness program that connects communities and victims of domestic violence with vital criminal justice information about individuals who have been charged with a domestic violence crime, and prison inmates who have been convicted of a crime involving domestic violence. Directs the Attorney General to study and report to the Congress on the integration of a national victim notification system with the National Domestic Violence Hotline, databases developed under certain State sexual offender registration programs, and the National Crime Information Center."
