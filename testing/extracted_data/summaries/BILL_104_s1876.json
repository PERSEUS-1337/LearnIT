    "content": "Amends Federal law to require that a contract for a health insurance plan offered to a Member of Congress or a former Member of Congress shall provide that a carrier may: (1) include preexisting condition exclusions and impose a limitation or exclusion of benefits relating to treatment based on the fact that the condition existed prior to enrollment. (2) exclude an individual from enrollment due to health status or preexisting condition. Or (3) refuse to renew the health plan of an individual due to health status or preexisting condition. Eliminates coverage for departing Members of Congress. Repeals all of the above on and after the date on which a statute has been enacted that: (1) makes health coverage for US citizens portable by limiting exclusions for preexisting conditions, (2) guarantees availability of health insurance to US citizens. And (3) guarantees renewability of health insurance coverage to employers and individuals."
