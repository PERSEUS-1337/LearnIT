    "content": "This report is part of a suite of reports that discuss appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2017. It specifically discusses appropriations for the components of DHS included in the second title of the homeland security appropriations bill\u2014Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Secret Service. Collectively, Congress has labeled these components in recent years as \"Security, Enforcement, and Investigations.\" The report provides an overview of the Administration's FY2017 request for these components, and the appropriations proposed by the Senate and House appropriations committees in response. Rather than limiting the scope of its review to the first titles of the bills, the report includes information on provisions throughout the bills and reports that directly affect these components. Security, Enforcement, and Investigations is the largest of the four titles that carry the bulk of the funding in the bill. The Administration requested $32.27 billion for these components in FY2017, $797 million less than was provided for FY2016. The amount requested for these components is 68% of the Administration's $47.7 billion request in net discretionary budget authority and disaster relief funding for DHS. The largest budget increase proposed in the request for these components was a $625 million (5.7%) increase for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, while the largest budget decrease proposed was a $745 million (15.3%) reduction in the budget for the Transportation Security Administration, which was proposed to be replaced with an $880 million increase in fee collections. Senate Appropriations Committee-reported S. 3001 would provide the components included in this title $32.92 billion in net discretionary budget authority. This would be $652 million (2.0%) more than requested, but $145 million (0.4%) less than was provided in FY2016. House Appropriations Committee-reported H.R. 5634 would provide the components included in this title $32.85 billion in net discretionary budget authority. This would be $592 million (1.8%) more than requested, but $206 million (0.6%) less than was provided in FY2016. Additional information on the broader subject of FY2017 funding for the department can be found in CRS Report R44621, Department of Homeland Security Appropriations: FY2017, as well as links to analytical overviews and details regarding appropriations for other components. On September 29, 2016, the President signed into law P.L. 114-223, which contained a continuing resolution that funds the government at the same rate of operations as FY2016, minus 0.496% through December 9, 2017. A second continuing resolution was signed into law on December 10, 2016 (P.L. 114-254), funding the government at the same rate of operations as FY2016, minus 0.1901%, through April 28, 2017. For details on the continuing resolution and its impact on DHS, see CRS Report R44621, Department of Homeland Security Appropriations: FY2017, which also includes additional information on the broader subject of FY2017 funding for DHS as well as links to analytical overviews and details regarding components in other titles. This report will be updated once the annual appropriations process for DHS for FY2017 is concluded."
