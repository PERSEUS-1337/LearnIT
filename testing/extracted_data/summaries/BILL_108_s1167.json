    "content": "Establishes procedures for resolving the status of Federal land in Barry and Stone Counties, Missouri, claimed by private property owners based on land surveys subsequent to the Public Land Survey System land surveys upon which the original land patents were issued. Directs the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of Agriculture to rectify boundary conflicts and landownership claims against Federal lands resulting from subsequent Federal land surveys and correctly reestablish the corners of the System in such counties and to attempt to do so in a manner that imposes the least cost and inconvenience to affected private landowners. Requires qualifying claimants to submit notice and information relating to the claim of ownership of the Federal lands to the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of Agriculture within 15 years of enactment of this Act. Authorizes the appropriate Secretary, in addition to using existing authorities, to take any of the following actions to resolve boundary conflicts: (1) convey by quitclaim deed right, title, and interest in the disputed Federal land. (2) if there are Federal interests in such land, confirm Federal title to it and retain it in Federal management. And (3) compensate the qualifying claimant where title is confirmed and retained pursuant to item (2). Requires conveyance of land under this Act without consideration. Requires the appropriate Secretary to pay costs associated with the resolution of boundary disputes pursuant to this Act and to reimburse qualifying claimants for survey costs necessary to establish a claim. Makes the appropriate Secretary responsible for compensation provided as a result of subsequent Federal land surveys conducted or commissioned by such Secretary's Department. Provides that the requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act regarding the transfer of real property by Federal agencies which is owned by the United States and on which any hazardous substance was stored for at least a year and was known to have been released or disposed of shall not apply to conveyances or transfers of jurisdiction pursuant to this Act, but the United States shall continue to be liable for cleanup costs of any hazardous substances on the lands so conveyed or transferred if the contamination by such substances is caused by Federal actions. Establishes rules for the treatment of preexisting conditions, existing reservations, and existing rights and uses. Authorizes appropriations."
