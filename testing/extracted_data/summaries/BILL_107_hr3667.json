    "content": "Self-Sufficiency Act - Amends part A (TANF) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to require State TANF plans to include a specification of the income needs of families adequate for attaining self-sufficiency. Requires the State to: (1) collect information on the monthly income of the family as of the time participation in the State TANF program ends and during the same quarter in each of the next two fiscal years. And (2) submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services annually a report that among other things describes the ways in which, during the fiscal year, the State program funded under this part and support services provided by the State to TANF recipients moved families toward self-sufficiency. Authorizes the Secretary to provide financial or technical assistance to enable an eligible State to develop or improve the State self-sufficiency standards and produce required State reports. Amends SSA title IV part A to direct the Secretary to make a grant for each specified fiscal year for which the self-sufficiency score of a State is greater than its self-sufficiency score for the preceding fiscal year."
