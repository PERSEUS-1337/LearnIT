Permits a Center to receive additional funding if it has received a positive evaluation through an independent review at least every two years after such sixth year. Limits the proportion of funding that a Center may receive from the Government after the sixth year to one-third of its capital and annual operating and maintenance costs under the Program. Amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 respecting the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award to: (1) expand the list of categories for awards to include health care providers and education providers. And (2) permit a third award to be made in a subcategory in any year if the Secretary of Commerce determines that it is merited and can be given at no additional cost to the Government. Amends NISTA to require notice of any reprogramming of funds to be provided to the House Committee on Science and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation concurrently with any such notice provided to the Appropriations Committees.

Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Director of the Institute should donate educationally useful Federal equipment to schools to enhance science and mathematic programs. Mandates annual reports to the President. Establishes within the Institute a summer teacher science and technology enhancement program to provide for the professional development of mathematics and science school teachers. Establishes within the Department of Commerce an Office of Space Commercialization to be the principal unit for the coordination of space-related issues, programs, and initiatives within the Department. Directs the Secretary to establish, for FY 1999, the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Technology (EPSCOT) to strengthen the technological competitiveness of States that have historically received less Federal research and development funds than those received by a majority of the States. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Under Secretary, to: (1) enter into arrangements for the coordination of EPSCOT through the State committees established under the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) of the National Science Foundation.
