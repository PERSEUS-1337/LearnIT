    "content": "The Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 ), signed by President Bush on August 8, 2005,was the first omnibus energy legislation enacted in more than a decade. Major provisions include taxincentives for domestic energy production and energy efficiency, a mandate to double the nation'suse of biofuels, faster procedures for energy production on federal lands, and authorization ofnumerous federal energy research and development programs. This report describes the electricityprovisions. It will not be updated. Title XII authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to certify a nationalelectric reliability organization (ERO) to enforce mandatory reliability standards for the bulk powersystem. All ERO standards must be approved by FERC. The ERO can impose penalties on a user,owner, or operator of the bulk power system for violations of any FERC-approved reliabilitystandard. The Secretary of Energy is required to conduct a study of electric transmission congestionevery three years and may designate a geographic area as being congested. Under certain conditions,FERC is authorized to issue construction permits in congested areas. Permit holders may petitionin U.S. District Court to acquire rights-of-way through eminent domain. An applicant for federalauthorization to site transmission facilities on federal lands could request that the Department ofEnergy be the lead agency to coordinate environmental review and other federal authorization. Ifa federal agency has denied an authorization required by a transmission or distribution facility, thedenial could be appealed by the applicant or relevant state to the President. Section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) had required utilities topurchase power from all qualifying facilities and small power producers at a rate based on theutilities' avoided cost. The Energy Policy Act repeals the PURPA mandatory purchase requirementfor new contracts if FERC finds that a competitive electricity market exists and a qualifying facilityhas adequate access to wholesale markets. Also repealed is the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA), which restrictedthe structure of holding companies of investor-owned utilities and provided for Securities andExchange Commission (SEC) regulation of mergers and diversification proposals. FERC and stateregulatory bodies must be given access to utility books and records. FERC is directed to facilitate price transparency in wholesale electric markets, relying onexisting price publishers and providers of trade processing services to the maximum extent possible. However, FERC may establish an electronic information system if it determines that existing priceinformation is not adequate. FERC is given approval authority over the acquisition of securities andthe merger, sale, lease, or disposition of facilities under FERC's jurisdiction with a value in excessof $10 million."
