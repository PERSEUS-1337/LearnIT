    "content": "Auction Reform Act of 2002 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to determine the timing of and deadlines for the conduct of competitive bidding for, and the auctioning of, electromagnetic spectrum used by analog television broadcasters. Prohibits the FCC from commencing or conducting spectrum auctions 31 and 44 on June 19, 2002. Provides exceptions for the auction of certain C- and D-block licenses within the 700 megahertz band, requiring that auction to occur between August 19 and September 19, 2002. Requires the FCC to: (1) report to Congress specifying when it intends to reschedule such auctions and describing progress made in the transition from analog to digital television and in the assignment and allocation of additional spectrum for advanced mobile communications services that warrants the scheduling of such auctions. (2) return to the bidders for specified licenses of auction 44 the full amount of all up-front payments made. And (3) conduct auctions 31 and 44 prior to the September 30, 2007, termination of such auction authority. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to relieve television broadcast licensees of their current obligation to complete conversion from analog to digital television. Prohibits the FCC, in granting a request by a television broadcast station licensee assigned to any of channels 52-69 to utilize any of channels 2-51 assigned for digital broadcasting in order to continue analog broadcasting during the transition to digital broadcasting, from waiving or otherwise reducing the current spacing requirements provided for analog broadcasting licensees within channels 2-51, or the interference standards provided for digital broadcasting licensees within such channels, if such waiver or reduction will result in any degradation or loss of service or an increased level of interference to any television household except as the FCC's rules would otherwise expressly permit. Makes such restrictions inapplicable to a licensee seeking authority to vacate the frequencies that constitute channels 63, 64, 68, or 69 in order to make such frequencies available for public safety purposes."
