    "content": "The Bush Administration requested $138.5 billion (after scorekeeping adjustments) for these agencies for FY2007, an increase of $2.3 billion over the $136.2 billion Congress provided in the agencies' FY2006 appropriations act (this FY2006 figure reflects a 1.0% across-the-board rescission that was included in the FY2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, P.L. 109-148). The total FY2006 funding (after scorekeeping adjustments) for the agencies in this bill was $146.3 billion, due to emergency supplemental funding provided to deal with the effects of the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005. In the appropriations process during the 109th Congress, the House-passed version of H.R. 5576, the FY2007 Departments of Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, District of Columbia, and Independent Agencies appropriations bill provided a net total of $139.6 billion for FY2007, $3.4 billion (2%) over the amount provided in the FY2006 act and $1.1 billion (less than 1%) over the Administration's request (after scorekeeping adjustments). The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported out H.R. 5576 on July 26, 2006, recommending a net total of $141.2 billion, $3.6 billion (3%) over the amount provided in the FY2006 Act and $2.6 billion (2%) over the Administration request. Both the House-passed and Senate-reported bills provided significant increases over the requested levels of funding for aviation programs and Amtrak, for a number of programs under the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and for the Executive Office of the President. H.R. 5576 expired with the close of the 109th Congress. The Senate did not consider H.R. 5576, and Congress did not enact a regular FY2007 TTHUD appropriations bill (nor most other FY2007 appropriations bills). Instead, FY2007 funds were provided in a series of continuing resolutions (P.L. 109-289, P.L. 109-369, and P.L. 109-383), which funded agencies at the lower of the House- or Senate-passed levels or their FY2006 levels (since the Senate had not passed an FY2007 TTHUD appropriations bill, TTHUD agencies were funded at the lower of the House-passed or FY2006 levels). On February 15, 2007, President Bush signed the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution for FY2007 (P.L. 110-5), which provided funding for most federal agencies for the remainder of FY2007. The law provided agencies with funding for FY2007 essentially at their FY2006 levels, except where otherwise statedi. Both DOT and HUD received increases over their regular FY2006 levels (excluding FY2006 supplemental funding). FY2007 funding levels for programs, projects, and activities were not specified in P.L. 110-5. This report will not be updated."
