    "content": "Debate over a national energy policy has been ongoing since the 107th Congress. Both the 107th and 108th Congresses were unable to complete action on an omnibus energy bill. The 109th Congress debated and passed H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which was signed by President Bush August 8, 2005 (P.L. 109-58). The enacted law contains various provisions involving environmental protection and regulation. This report briefly summarizes and discusses the background and implications of key environmental provisions. Title XV of P.L. 109-58 eliminates the reformulated gasoline (RFG) oxygen standard, and in its place establishes a renewable fuel mandate for gasoline. Because of related concerns over MTBE (a gasoline additive that competes with ethanol) contamination, the enacted law modifies existing authority for cleanup of leaking underground storage tanks, and authorizes funding for MTBE cleanup. Title XVI establishes a program to promote the development and deployment of low-carbon technologies both domestically and in developing countries. Section 322 amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to exempt certain hydraulic fracturing techniques from EPA regulation. Hydraulic fracturing involves the underground injection of fluids into coal beds to enhance recovery of oil gas. Section 323 gives permanent exemption from Clean Water Act stormwater runoff rules for the construction of exploration and production facilities by oil and gas companies and roads that service those sites. Various sections in Titles VII, VIII, and XIII authorize R&D funding for hydrogen, fuel cells, and alternative fuel vehicles or establish tax incentives for their use. Section 241 gives applicants for hydroelectric licenses increased flexibility in complying with conditions imposed by federal agencies. These conditions can include water release controls to limit erosion, and protection of habitat. Section 966 requires EPA to work with state and local officials in western Michigan to determine ozone pollution and transport, and assess alternatives to achieve compliance with air quality standards. A variety of provisions are intended to expedite the process for completing or complying with environmental requirements. Not included in the enacted law are provisions on oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and a renewable portfolio standard. This report will not be updated."
