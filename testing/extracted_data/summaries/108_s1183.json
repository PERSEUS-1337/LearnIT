    "content": "Global Internet Freedom Act of 2003 - Establishes in the International Broadcasting Bureau the Office of Global Internet Freedom to develop and implement a comprehensive global strategy to combat state-sponsored and state-directed Internet jamming and persecution of those who use the Internet. Requires an annual report from the Office to Congress on the status of state interference with Internet use and of US efforts to counter such interference. Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should: (1) denounce governments that restrict, censor, ban, and block access to information on the Internet. (2) direct the US Representative to the United Nations to submit a resolution condemning such actions. And (3) deploy technologies aimed at defeating state-directed Internet censorship and the persecution of those who use the Internet."
