Appropriations bills reflect the jurisdiction of the subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees in which they are considered. Jurisdictions for the subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees changed at the beginning of the 109th Congress. On September 29, 2006, Congress passed the Defense Department Appropriation (H.R. 5631/P.L. 109-289), which included a continuing resolution (CR) to fund the most other agencies, including SSJC agencies, through November 17, 2006. On November 15, 2006, Congress passed a second CR (H.J.Res. 100) which extended funding provided in the initial continuing resolution through December 8, 2006. On December 8, the House passed a third CR (H.J.Res. 102), which extended funding through February 15, 2007. The Senate passed the measure on December 9. On February, 15, 2007, the President signed into law H.J.Res. 20 (P.L. 110-5), which amended P.L. 109-289, the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, extending continuing appropriations through FY2007. For the FY2007 SSJC/CJS appropriations, the Administration requested $62.5 billion/$52.3 billion in the budget that it sent to Congress on February 6, 2006. The Administration request for the major departments and their related agencies are Department of Justice (DOJ), $21.3 billion; Department of Commerce (DOC), $6.3 billion; Department of State, $10.2 billion; Science, $22.8 billion; and Related Agencies, $2.3 billion. (The numbers may not add to the total due to rounding.) The House passed its SSJC appropriation bill (H.R. 5672) on June 29, providing a total of $62.6 billion. The House funding level included $22.5 billion for DOJ, $5.9 billion for DOC and related agencies, $22.7 billion for the Science agencies, $9.7 billion for the Department of State and international broadcasting, and $2.3 billion for related agencies. The Senate committee reported its bill covering State Department funding (H.R. 5522) on July 10. The enacted FY2006 appropriation provided $62.1 billion ($63.1 billion, including FY2006 supplemental funds) for the agencies under the jurisdiction of the Science, State, Justice, Commerce Appropriations subcommittee of the House. The appropriations enacted for the major departments and their related agencies were DOJ, $21.7 billion; DOC, $6.6 billion; Department of State, $9.5 billion; Science, $22.2 billion; and Related Agencies, $2.5 billion. This report is the final update for the FY2007 SSJC report. Any future adjustments of the FY2007 numbers will be in the FY2008 appropriation report."
