    "content": "Advance Directives Education Act of 2005 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require a service provider, Medicare Advantage organization, or prepaid or eligible organization to: (1) provide each individual receiving medical care through such provider or organization with the opportunity to discuss issues relating to an individual's rights under State law to make decisions concerning medical care and formulate advance directives. And (2) give effect to an advance directive executed outside the State even if such directive does not appear to meet State requirements, unless the provider or organization can reasonably demonstrate that the directive is not an authentic expression of the individual's health care wishes. Makes such advance directive requirements applicable under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act. Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide for the establishment of a national, toll-free, information clearinghouse for State-specific information regarding advance directives and end-of-life decisions. Requires the Comptroller General to study and report on the feasibility of a national registry for advanced directives. Requires each State to establish a program that: (1) provides information to residents at the State's department of motor vehicles on the advance directives clearinghouse. And (2) is modeled after the State's organ donation program at the department of motor vehicles."
