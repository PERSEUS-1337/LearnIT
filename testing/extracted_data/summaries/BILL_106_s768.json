    "content": "Military and Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 1999 - Amends the Uniform Code of Military Justice to make subject to its provisions civilian employees of the Department of Defense (DOD) and civilian employees of DOD contractors who, in support of a contingency operation as designated by the Secretary of Defense, are serving with and accompanying an armed force outside the United States. Amends the Federal criminal code to provide penalties for conduct engaged in by such individuals that would constitute an offense punishable by imprisonment for more than one year if such conduct had been engaged in within the maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Prohibits a Federal criminal action if a recognized foreign government has prosecuted or is prosecuting such person for the conduct constituting the offense. Provides for the arrest of such individuals outside the United States and their release to US civilian law enforcement personnel. Authorizes the release to a recognized foreign government of persons who engage in such conduct in that country. Directs the Secretary to: (1) prescribe regulations governing the apprehension, detention and removal of persons under this Act. And (2) issue regulations requiring that notice be provided to any person covered by this Act who is not a US national that such person is potentially subject to the criminal jurisdiction of the United States. States that failure to provide such notice shall not defeat such jurisdiction."
