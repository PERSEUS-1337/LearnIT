    "title": "AB 2121",
    "content": "The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, administered by the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, regulates the granting of licenses for the manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages within the state. Under existing law, any on-sale license authorizes the sale of the alcoholic beverage specified in the license for consumption on the premises where sold. Currently, the Licensee Education on Alcohol and Drugs (LEAD) program is a voluntary prevention and education program for retail licensees, their employees, and applicants, regarding alcohol responsibility and the law. This bill would, in addition to the LEAD program, establish the Responsible Beverage Service (RBS) Training Program Act of 2016, beginning July 1, 2020, that would require an alcohol server, as defined, to successfully complete an RBS training course offered by an accredited training provider within 3 months of employment and every 3 years thereafter. The bill would require a nonprofit organization that obtained a temporary daily on-sale or off-sale license to designate a person or persons to receive RBS training before the event and would require that person or those persons to remain on site for the duration of the event. The bill would provide that an RBS training course include information on, among other things, state laws and regulations relating to alcoholic beverage control and the impact of alcohol on the body. The bill would require the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, on or before January 1, 2020, to establish a list published on the department\u2019s Internet Web site of RBS training courses and would authorize the department to collect fees to cover the reasonable costs of review and approval of accreditation agencies. The bill, beginning January 1, 2019, would require the department to provide information on RBS training requirements on applications for, and renewals of, authorized licenses. The bill, beginning July 1, 2020, would require all authorized licensees to maintain, and provide upon request by the department, all records necessary to establish compliance with these provisions. The bill, beginning July 1, 2020, would provide that an authorized licensee, the licensee\u2019s agent or employee, or an alcohol server who knowingly and intentionally violates any of these provisions is subject only to civil and administrative penalties, as specified."
