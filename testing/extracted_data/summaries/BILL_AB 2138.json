    "title": "AB 2138",
    "content": "Existing law regulates sellers of travel, as defined, and requires their registration with the Attorney General. Under existing law, a seller of travel is deemed to do business in this state if the seller of travel solicits business from locations in this state or solicits prospective purchasers who are located in this state. This bill would clarify that a seller of travel is deemed to do business in this state if the seller of travel solicits business from locations in this state regardless of the geographic location of the prospective purchaser including persons located outside of this state or the country. This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 17550.20 of the Business and Professions Code proposed by AB 2106 that would become operative if this bill and AB 2106 are enacted and this bill is enacted last."
