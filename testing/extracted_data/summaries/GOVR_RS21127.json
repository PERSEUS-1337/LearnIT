    "content": "Insider trading in securities may occur when a person in possession of material nonpublic information about a company trades in the company's securities and makes a profit or avoids a loss. Certain federal statutes have provisions that have been used to prosecute insider trading violations. For example, Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the disgorgement of short-swing profits by named insiders\u2014directors, officers, and 10% shareholders. The 1934 Act's general antifraud provision, Section 10(b), is frequently used in the prosecution of insider traders. Although the statute does not specifically mention insider trading but, instead, forbids the use of \"manipulative or deceptive\" means in buying or selling securities, case law has clarified that insider trading is the type of fraud that is prohibited by Section 10(b). Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules issued to implement Section 10(b), particularly Rule 10b-5, have also been frequently invoked in insider trading prosecutions. With the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984 and the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988, Congress enacted legislation that imposed up to treble damages (and in some cases the greater of $1 million or up to treble damages) on persons found guilty of insider trading. More recently, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-105) explicitly stated that there is no exemption from the insider trading prohibitions for Members of Congress, congressional employees, or any federal officials. As noted above, SEC Rule 10b-5 is the most frequently used SEC rule in lawsuits that charge violations of insider trading prohibitions. However, other SEC rules, some of which specifically target insider trading, are also important. There are numerous cases in which Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 have been used to prosecute insider trading violations. The most recent case of note is the Supreme Court's decision in Salman v. United States. On December 6, 2016, the Court unanimously upheld the conviction of Bassam Yacoub Salman for insider trading on tips that he had received from his brother-in-law. The Court agreed with federal prosecutors that a trader can be guilty of violating insider trading prohibitions even if the insider did not receive a tangible benefit, such as money or property, for passing the tip so long as the trader and insider are friends or relatives. No bill concerning insider trading appears to have been introduced in the 115th Congress to date. However, several bills, including H.R. 1173, H.R. 1625, and S. 702, were introduced in the 114th Congress before the Supreme Court's Salman decision. The Salman decision appears not to go as far as these bills would have in prohibiting the acts of trading in securities with inside information and disclosing inside information."
