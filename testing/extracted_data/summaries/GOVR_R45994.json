    "content": "Management of lands and resources is a principal mission for four federal agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Forest Service (FS), and National Park Service (NPS). Most of the appropriations for these agencies come from discretionary appropriations enacted by Congress through annual appropriations laws. However, each of the agencies also receives mandatory appropriations under provisions of authorizing statutes enacted by Congress. Under these laws, the agencies spend money without further action by Congress. A number of issues arise for Congress in deciding the type of appropriations to provide and the terms and conditions of appropriations. One consideration is whether mandatory (rather than discretionary) appropriations best suit the purposes of the program or activity and Congress's role in authorizing, appropriating, and conducting oversight. Another question is how to fund any mandatory appropriation\u00e2\u0080\u0094namely, whether through general government collections (in the General Fund of the Treasury) or through a specific collection (e.g., from a particular activity or tax). A third issue is how to use the funds in a mandatory account, such as for agency activities, revenue sharing with state and local governments, or grant programs. In FY2018, the four agencies together had $3.17 billion in mandatory appropriations, which was 19% of their total discretionary and mandatory appropriations for the year ($16.36 billion). This funding was provided through 68 separate accounts, of which each agency had a dozen or more. The dollar amount of mandatory appropriations varied widely among the agencies (from $300.4 million for BLM to $1.46 billion for FWS), as did the percentage of each agency's total appropriations that was mandatory (from 10% for FS to 45% for FWS). (See the figure below.) BLM had 18 accounts with mandatory spending authority in FY2018. Of these, seven had mandatory appropriations each exceeding $5.0 million, with the largest account containing $157.8 million. The accounts typically are funded from agency receipts of various sorts. Most accounts support BLM activities, although several are compensation programs that share revenue with state or local governments. FY2018 total mandatory appropriations for BLM were $300.4 million, which was 18% of combined BLM mandatory and discretionary appropriations of $1.65 billion. FWS had 12 accounts with mandatory spending authority in FY2018. Of these, seven had mandatory appropriations each exceeding $5.0 million, and the largest had $829.1 million. Funding mechanisms for these accounts vary, including receipts; excise and fuel taxes; and fines, penalties, and forfeitures. Several accounts, including some of the largest, provide grants to states (and other entities); other accounts fund agency activities or provide compensation to counties. FY2018 total mandatory appropriations for FWS were $1.46 billion, which was 45% of combined FWS mandatory and discretionary appropriations of $3.27 billion. FS had 22 accounts with mandatory spending authority in FY2018. Of these, 10 had mandatory appropriations each exceeding $5.0 million, with the largest account containing $234.6 million. Agency receipts fund many accounts, although one is supplemented by the General Fund of the Treasury, as needed. Almost all accounts support agency activities, but one is for a compensation program. FY2018 total mandatory appropriations for FS were $705.1 million, which was nearly 10% of combined FS mandatory and discretionary appropriations of $7.29 billion. NPS had 16 accounts with mandatory spending authority in FY2018. Of these, 11 had mandatory appropriations each exceeding $5.0 million; the largest had $301.5 million. Funding sources for the accounts vary, including agency receipts, offshore energy development revenues, District of Columbia payments, the General Fund of the Treasury, donations, and an endowment. Almost all of the accounts support agency activities, but one is for recreation assistance grants to states and another is a compensation program. FY2018 total mandatory appropriations for NPS were $704.9 million, which was 17% of the combined NPS mandatory and discretionary total of $4.16 billion.
