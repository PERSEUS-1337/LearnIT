    "content": "The \"child nutrition programs\" (National School Lunch Program [NSLP] and certain other institutional food service programs) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA, P.L. 111-296). Some of the authorities created or extended in the last reauthorization law expired on September 30, 2015, but the vast majority of operations and activities continue because appropriations laws continued funding. In the 114th Congress, both committees of jurisdiction\u2014the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce\u2014completed markups of reauthorization legislation but did not complete reauthorization. (At the final adjournment of a Congress, all legislation that has not yet been sent to the President dies. When the new Congress convenes, the formal legislative process must begin anew.) Legislative activity in the 114th Congress, though historical, may provide helpful background for the 115th Congress. On January 20, 2016, by a unanimous voice vote, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry voted to report its WIC and child nutrition reauthorization proposal, the Improving Child Nutrition Integrity and Access Act of 2016 (later introduced as S. 3136). On May 18, 2016, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce marked up its reauthorization proposal, the Improving Child Nutrition and Education Act of 2016 (H.R. 5003). The committee approved the bill, 20 to 14, largely along partisan lines. While both proposals would have extended authorities and included many of the same policies, the House committee's proposal would have made three major policy changes to the school meals programs that are not in the Senate committee's proposal: (1) a demonstration project for up to three states to receive a block grant in lieu of funding from a number of open-ended child nutrition programs, (2) a higher threshold for school participation in the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), and (3) increased reimbursement rates for the School Breakfast Program. In other school meal policies, both proposals included different changes to school meal nutrition standards, including whole grain and sodium requirements. The proposals would both have revamped the current law procedures for the verification of household applications for free and reduced-price school meals. The Senate and House committees' proposals would have piloted or expanded a number of alternatives for feeding low-income children during the summer months through the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). Proposals would have streamlined SFSP with afterschool meals and snacks and created off-site alternatives to the congregate feeding site model. Both proposals included a continuation of the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) pilot, although the Senate committee would have expanded it and made it permanent. The proposals are similar in their policy changes for the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and the Farm to School Grant Program. Both proposals would have expanded the types of snacks served through the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. They would each have expanded offerings beyond fresh to frozen, dried, and canned, although the Senate committee's proposal would have done so in a more limited way. Both proposals included a number of changes to Special Supplemental Nutrition program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) policy. Only the Senate committee would have raised the age of child eligibility and increased infant certification periods. Both proposed changes to income eligibility calculation, WIC-eligible foods policy, integrity of benefit redemption, transition to EBT, and competitive bidding for infant formula and foods. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the Senate committee's proposal would have increased the deficit by $1.1 billion over 10 years (FY2016-FY2025) and that the House committee's proposal would have reduced the deficit by $67 million over 10 years (FY2017-FY2026)."
