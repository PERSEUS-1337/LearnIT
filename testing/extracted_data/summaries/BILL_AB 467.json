    "content": "Existing law authorizes the State Fire Marshal to issue and renew licenses for the manufacture, import, export, sale, and use of all fireworks and pyrotechnic devices. Existing law provides that a license shall not be required for the retail sale, use, or discharge of model rocket engines. Existing law requires the State Fire Marshal to classify all fireworks and pyrotechnic devices and prohibits the importation, sale, or offering for sale prior to the classification. Existing law requires all fireworks or toy propellant devices containing pyrotechnic compositions that the State Fire Marshal finds come within the definition of a \u201cmodel rocket\u201d or \u201cmodel rocket engine\u201d to be classified as model rocket engines. Existing law prohibits a person from launching a model rocket from a site without first securing authorization from the authority having jurisdiction. Existing law defines a model rocket as a toy or educational device that weighs not more than 500 grams, including the engine and any payload, that is propelled by a model rocket engine. Existing law defines a model rocket engine as a commercially manufactured, nonreusable rocket propulsion device that is constructed of nonmetallic casing and solid propellant, as provided. This bill would add to the definition of \u201cmodel rocket\u201d a requirement that it conform to the definition of \u201cmodel rocket\u201d as used in the 2013 edition of the \u201cNFPA 1122: Code for Model Rocketry,\u201d or a more recent edition as adopted by the State Fire Marshal, and would increase the maximum weight of a model rocket to not more than 1500 grams. This bill would change all references in statute to model rocket engines to instead refer to model rocket motors. The bill would revise the definition of \u201cmodel rocket motor\u201d to mean a rocket propulsion device using commercially manufactured solid propellant that does not require mixing by the user and that conforms to the definition of \u201cmodel rocket motor\u201d as used in the 2012 edition of the \u201cNFPA 1125: Code for the Manufacture of Model Rocket and High Power Rocket Motors,\u201d or a more recent edition as adopted by the State Fire Marshal."
