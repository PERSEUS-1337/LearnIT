And (2) nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize funding for land acquisition, facility development, or operation. Requires the Secretary to establish the Wekiva River System Advisory Management Committee to: (1) assist in the development of the comprehensive management plan to be developed as required by the Act for the Wekiva River system.
