    "title": "An act to add Section 1524.4 to the Penal Code, relating to law enforcement.",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes a court or magistrate to issue a warrant for the search of a place and the seizure of property or things identified in the warrant if there is probable cause to believe that specified grounds exist. This bill would require service providers to maintain a law enforcement contact process that meets specified criteria and, by July 1, 2017, file a statement with the Attorney General describing that process. The bill would require a service provider to file a statement with the Attorney General describing any material change to its process as soon as practicable after making that change. The bill would require the Attorney General to consolidate the statements received pursuant to these provisions in one discrete record and regularly make that record available to law enforcement agencies. The bill would make the statements confidential and prohibit their disclosure pursuant to any state law. By increasing the duties of local law enforcement agencies to maintain confidential records, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest. This bill would make legislative findings to that effect. The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose. This bill would make legislative findings to that effect. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
