    "content": "Furthering Accountability and Individual Rights within the Military Act of 2014 or the Fair Military Act - Directs each Secretary of a military department to ensure that: (1) the written performance appraisals of each member of the Armed Forces include an assessment of the extent to which the member supports that Armed Force's sexual assault prevention and response program, and (2) the performance appraisals of each commanding officer indicate the extent to which such officer has established a command climate in which allegations of sexual assault are properly managed and fairly evaluated and in which a victim can report criminal activity without fear of retaliation. Requires modification of the Military Rules of Evidence to clarify that the general military character of an accused is not admissible for the purpose of showing the probability of his or her innocence, except that an accused may offer evidence of a trait of his or her military character when that trait is relevant to an element of the offense for which he or she has been charged. Directs the Secretaries of the military departments and any department in which the Coast Guard is operating to ensure that the provisions of Title XVII of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY2014 and this Act apply to the United States Military Academy, the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy, and the Coast Guard Academy. Requires the independent judicial proceedings panel to conduct assessments of: (1) the use of mental health records by the defense during preliminary hearing and court-martial proceedings, and (2) the use of such records in similar civilian proceedings to determine whether any significant discrepancies exist between the two legal systems. Directs the Comptroller General (GAO) to submit to the Senate and House Armed Services Committees a report describing the status of the implementation of the sexual assault provisions contained in the NDAAs for FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014 and the sexual assault prevention initiatives announced in memoranda by the Secretary of Defense (DOD) on May 6, 2013, and August 14, 2013."
