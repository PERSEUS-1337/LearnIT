    "content": "Promoting Transparency in Trade Act This bill amends the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 to require the President to publish on a publicly available website the proposed US text for a trade agreement regarding trade barriers before the start of a negotiating round and the considered text for such an agreement at the conclusion of each negotiating round. Congress may disapprove of trade authorities procedures if the President has not published required negotiation texts for a proposed trade agreement. The bill amends the Trade Act of 1974 to direct the US Trade Representative (USTR) to ensure that the Chief Transparency Officer of the Office of the USTR does not have, or appear to have, any conflict of interest in ensuring the transparency of the activities of the Office, including trade negotiations."
