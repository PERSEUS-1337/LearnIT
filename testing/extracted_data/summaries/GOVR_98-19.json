    "content": "This report lists the independent counsels (called \"special prosecutors\" until 1983) appointedby the Special Division of the United States Court of Appeals upon application from the AttorneyGeneral of the United States, under the provisions of the law originally enacted in the Ethics inGovernment Act of 1978. The report specifies the dates of the appointments of the independentcounsels and the dates of their final reports; sets out in summary fashion the areas or subjects ofinvestigation by the independent counsels; highlights the results of those investigations; and providesthe costs of the investigations through September 30, 2005, the date through which the GovernmentAccountability Office has completed the latest published audit of the offices of independent counsels(published March 31, 2006). The information provided from public documents indicates that there have been 20 reportedindependent counsel or special prosecutor investigations initiated under the provisions of title VI ofthe Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended. Because Congress did not pass a reauthorizationof the law, the provisions of the independent counsel law expired under a five-year \"sunset\"provision on June 30, 1999, and independent counsels are no longer named by the Special Divisionof the Court. Investigations by independent counsels who had already been appointed before June30, 1999, however, were allowed to continue under the old provisions of the law until the mattersassigned to them had been completed (28 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 599). Of the 20 independent counsel investigations, 12 of the investigations returned noindictments against those investigated. Of the eight investigations that did return at least oneindictment, in three of those instances, there was no indictment brought against the principalgovernment official originally named as the target of that independent counsel's investigation; inthree other instances, the principal government official indicted was either acquitted or hisconviction was overturned on appeal. Thus, of the 20 independent counsel investigations initiated,although several independent counsels obtained multiple convictions of certain persons relating tothe original subject matter or peripheral matters (including convictions of several federal officialsor former federal officials), only two federal officials who were actually the named or principalsubjects of the 20 investigations were finally convicted of or pleaded guilty to the charges brought;in one of those two instances, that person was pardoned by the President. According to reports from the Department of Justice concerning early \"special prosecutor\"and independent counsel investigations, and later published audits from the GovernmentAccountability Office, it is estimated that the total costs of all 20 independent counsel investigationsthrough September 30, 2005, including unaudited expenses of other agencies assisting theindependent counsels and the government-reimbursed costs of attorneys' fees when provided, hasbeen approximately $228,712,589."
