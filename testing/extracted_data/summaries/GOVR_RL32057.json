    "content": "Balancing public needs for surface transportation infrastructure with protecting the environment has been a long-standing issue among states and local communities. These two objectives can oftenconflict due to the rise in pollution that typically results when new highways or roadways areconstructed, or a highway is expanded, to provide greater traffic capacity. Expanding highwaycapacity can be especially challenging for states, if the resulting rise in pollution would be greatenough to make compliance with federal air quality standards more difficult. In order to receivefederal highway funds, the Clean Air Act requires states with air quality problems to demonstratethat their transportation plans conform to their plans to control emissions, referred to as\"transportation conformity.\" To help reduce potential conflicts between highway capacity needs and environmental requirements, Congress has authorized the use of federal highway funds to alleviate some of thepollution resulting from highway construction and travel. The most recent multi-year fundingauthorization for these activities was provided in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century(TEA-21, P.L. 105-178 ), which expired at the end of FY2003. How to meet state needs for highwayinfrastructure, while ensuring compliance with environmental requirements, is among the key issuesfor reauthorization. TEA-21 authorized a total of $218 billion for federal highway and transit programs from FY1998 to FY2003. It set aside $9 billion for air quality projects, including $8 billion for theCongestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ) to offset some of theemissions from highway travel, as a means to assist states in complying with federal air qualitystandards. The other $1 billion was authorized for the purchase of clean fuel transit buses. TEA-21also expanded funding eligibility to allow states to use federal highway funds for mitigating waterpollution from highway runoff. The law also authorized funding for environmental research and thedevelopment of advanced vehicle technologies, and it included several other provisions related toenvironmental protection. The use of federal highway funds to address environmental needs has focused mostly on air quality projects, due primarily to requirements for states to demonstrate conformity as a conditionfor receiving federal highway funds. Most of this funding has been provided under the CMAQprogram. While the program's effectiveness has been questioned, there is broad support forincreasing its funding in response to an upcoming rise in air quality needs among the states. Otherair quality issues involve the use of transit funding for the purchase of clean fuel buses, offering taxbenefits for cleaner-burning alcohol-based fuels, and exempting certain low-emission vehicles fromHigh Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane requirements. The extent to which water pollution mitigationprojects and environmental research and development activities should be eligible for federalhighway funds are issues as well. This report provides background information and analysis of key issues to serve as a resource document for the reauthorization debate. It will not be updated."
