The bill defines: (1) apprenticeship as one registered under the National Apprenticeship Act of 1937. And (2) pre-apprenticeship as an initiative or set of strategies that provides training, that is designed to prepare individuals to enter and succeed in an apprenticeship program, and that includes a formal agreement enabling participants who complete it to enter an apprenticeship program with an employer, joint labor-management partnership, trade association, professional association, labor organization, or other entity and agreements concerning earning credit recognized by a postsecondary educational institution. A joint team of employees from Labor and the Department of Education shall review, and make recommendations regarding approval of, grant applications. A state that receives a grant shall use the funds to defray related costs of tuition and fees, textbooks, equipment, curriculum development, and other required educational materials. Labor shall: (1) establish performance measures and an evaluation system for such grant program. And (2) identify in-demand occupations that lack the use of apprenticeships, analyze the use of the apprenticeship model in those occupations, and report on such analysis to states and Congress."
