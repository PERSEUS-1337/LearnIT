    "content": "Stigler Act Amendments of 2017 This bill amends the Act of August 4, 1947 to revise the qualifications that must be met by a person who inherits land originally allotted to members of the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma for that land to remain in restricted status. When land is in restricted status, it is not subject to taxation and may not be sold or transferred without permission of the Department of the Interior. Under current law, the restricted fee status of land allotted to the Five Tribes is maintained only if the individual holding title has at least 50 Indian blood from one of the Five Tribes. This bill removes this requirement. Thus, the restricted fee status is maintained for all lineal descendants of an original enrollee whose name appears on the membership rolls of the Five Tribes."
