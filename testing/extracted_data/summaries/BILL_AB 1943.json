    "content": "Existing law establishes county transportation commissions in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura counties for the coordination of public transportation services and the performance of various transportation planning activities. Existing law authorizes each commission to make contracts of any nature whatsoever, including to employ labor. This bill would authorize the Riverside County Transportation Commission to enter into contracts with private vendors for the enforcement of parking regulations and the removal of vehicles parked in violation of parking regulations adopted by the commission. Existing law prohibits a person from driving or parking a vehicle or animal upon the driveways, paths, parking facilities, or grounds of specified public entities, including a public transportation agency and a county transportation commission, except with the permission of, and subject to any condition or regulation that may be imposed by, the governing body of the specified public entity. Existing law defines \u201cpublic transportation agency\u201d for these purposes. This bill would revise the definition of \u201cpublic transportation agency\u201d to include a county transportation commission."
