    "content": "This report reviews U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases in the contexts both of domestic policy and of international obligations and proposals. On October 15, 1992, the United States ratified theUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which entered into forceon March 21, 1994. This committed the United States to \"national policies\" to limit \"itsanthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases,\" with a voluntary goal of returning \"emissions ofcarbon dioxide [CO 2 ] and other greenhouse gases [methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide(N 2 O),hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 )]\" at the \"endof the decade\" to \"their 1990 levels.\" Subsequently, in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC, the United States participated in negotiations that ended with agreement on further reductions that could become legally binding. TheUnited States signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998, but President Clinton did not send it to the Senatefor advice and consent. President Bush has said that he rejects the Protocol, and former U.S.Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christine Todd Whitman told reporters that theAdministration would not be pursuing the UNFCCC commitment either. Instead, President Bushhas proposed to shift the nation's climate change program from a goal of reducing emissions per seto a goal of reducing energy intensity -- the amount of greenhouse gases emitted per unit ofeconomic productivity. Under the proposal, the intensity, which has been declining for a numberof years, would decline 18% between 2002 and 2012, as opposed to a 14% projected \"business asusual\" decline. Meanwhile, the UNFCCC \"end of the decade\" deadline has passed and U.S. greenhouse gas emissions continue on an upward trend, though with dips in 1991 and in 2001, attributed mostly toeconomic slowdowns. Based on historical data, 2001 emissions were about 13% in excess of theUNFCCC goal. Overall, from 1990 to 2001, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (weighted by globalwarming potential) have increased an average of about 1.1% per year. Projections suggest that U.S.emissions will continue to rise for at least the next decade. Reversing the upward trend ingreenhouse gas emissions would represent an extraordinary technical and political challenge to U.S.energy and environmental policy. This report will be updated as necessary."
