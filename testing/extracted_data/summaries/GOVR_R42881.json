    "content": "The 21st century has seen the operation of elementary, secondary, and postsecondary educational institutions and the education of the students they enroll disrupted by natural disasters, such as hurricanes and floods, and by national emergencies, such as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. This report is intended to inform Congress of existing statutory and regulatory provisions that may aid in responding to future disasters and national emergencies that may affect the provision of or access to education and highlight the actions of previous Congresses to provide additional recovery assistance. This report reflects the most recently available guidance, as of the date of publication, related to education-related disaster response and flexibilities. It will be updated should new or additional statutes be enacted or guidance be issued. The majority of federal aid for disaster management is made available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under the authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act; P.L. 93-288). Under the Stafford Act, public school districts, charter schools, private nonprofit educational institutions, public institutions of higher education (IHEs), and federally recognized Indian tribal governments are eligible to receive assistance for activities such as debris removal, infrastructure and equipment repair and replacement, hazard mitigation, and temporary facilities. In addition to the assistance available through the Stafford Act, assistance is available through numerous provisions in education laws. At the elementary and secondary level, there are several existing provisions that may be helpful in providing assistance in response to a disaster. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) grants the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) authority to issue waivers of any statutory or regulatory requirement of the ESEA for a state educational agency (SEA), local educational agency (LEA), Indian tribe, or school that receives funds under an ESEA program and requests a waiver. In response to past disasters, waivers have been granted to address funding flexibility issues and accountability requirements. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) grants the Secretary authority to waive state maintenance of effort (MOE) requirements and requirements to supplement, not supplant, federal funds under certain circumstances. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act grants the Secretary authority to waive certain accountability metrics and provides some flexibility with regard to MOE requirements. The Secretary is not, however, able to waive all statutory and regulatory requirements with respect to the acts. Under the ESEA, for example, the Secretary may not waive civil rights requirements or prohibitions against the use of funds for religious worship or instruction. Under IDEA, for example, the Secretary may not grant waivers from the right to a free appropriate public education. At the postsecondary level, various provisions exist to ensure continuity of operations and continuity of federal funding following a disaster. Under the Higher Education Act (HEA), the Secretary of Education has authority to waive several of the requirements for aid recipients, IHEs, and financial institutions when a disaster has been declared. In particular, waivers have been provided from various requirements related to the disbursement, repayment, and administration of federal student aid. Under Title 38 of the U.S. Code, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may extend payment of veterans educational assistance benefits to cover periods when enrollment is interrupted. In addition, various provisions exist to provide flexibilities in other Department of Education-administered programs. The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) and accompanying regulations grant the Secretary the authority to waive state MOE and reporting requirements for AEFLA state grants due to uncontrollable circumstances such as natural disasters. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and accompanying regulations grant the Secretary the authority to waive state MOE and reporting requirements for state vocational rehabilitation grants due to uncontrollable circumstances, such as natural disasters. In response to the multiple hurricanes and tropical storms in 2017, Congress enacted the Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria Education Relief Act of 2017, P.L. 115-64, which amended the ESEA to make private schools eligible for funds under the Project School Emergency Response to Violence Program, which provides funds to help schools recover from violent or traumatic events in which the learning environment has been disrupted. The act also provided short-term authority for the Secretary to waive or modify statutory or regulatory requirements to ensure funds were targeted to affected populations and institutions at the elementary, secondary, and postsecondary levels. On February 9, 2018, the Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2018 (Division B, Subdivision 1 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, P.L. 115-123) was enacted. It includes FY2018 supplemental appropriations for disaster relief for, among other things, education-related programs and activities for \"covered disasters or emergencies,\" which include the aforementioned hurricanes and tropical storms and also the California wildfires of 2017."
