(3) does not knowingly provide employment, refuge, freedom of movement, cash assistance, food assistance, housing rehabilitation assistance, or any other type of social services assistance to members of foreign terrorist organizations. And (4) does not promote anti-Semitism or the denial of Israel's right to exist. Authorizes a maximum 180-day waiver of such limitation for US national security interests.
