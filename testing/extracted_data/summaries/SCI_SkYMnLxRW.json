    "content": "State-of-the-art results on neural machine translation often use attentional sequence-to-sequence models with some form of convolution or recursion. Vaswani et. al. (2017) propose a new architecture that avoids recurrence and convolution completely. Instead, it uses only self-attention and feed-forward layers. While the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on several machine translation tasks, it requires a large number of parameters and training iterations to converge. We propose Weighted Transformer, a Transformer with modified attention layers, that not only outperforms the baseline network in BLEU score but also converges 15-40% faster. Specifically, we replace the multi-head attention by multiple self-attention branches that the model learns to combine during the training process. Our model improves the state-of-the-art performance by 0.5 BLEU points on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task and by 0.4 on the English-to-French translation task. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) BID12 , form an important building block for many tasks that require modeling of sequential data. RNNs have been successfully employed for several such tasks including language modeling BID23 BID24 BID25 , speech recognition BID9 BID19 , and machine translation BID34 . RNNs make output predictions at each time step by computing a hidden state vector h t based on the current input token and the previous states. This sequential computation underlies their ability to map arbitrary input-output sequence pairs. However, because of their auto-regressive property of requiring previous hidden states to be computed before the current time step, they cannot benefit from parallelization.Variants of recurrent networks that use strided convolutions eschew the traditional time-step based computation BID15 BID20 BID4 BID7 BID6 BID16 . However, in these models, the operations needed to learn dependencies between distant positions can be difficult to learn BID13 BID11 . Attention mechanisms, often used in conjunction with recurrent models, have become an integral part of complex sequential tasks because they facilitate learning of such dependencies BID22 BID26 BID27 BID17 .In BID33 , the authors introduce the Transformer network, a novel architecture that avoids the recurrence equation and maps the input sequences into hidden states solely using attention. Specifically , the authors use positional encodings in conjunction with a multi-head attention mechanism. This allows for increased parallel computation and reduces time to convergence. The authors report results for neural machine translation that show the Transformer networks achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French tasks while being orders-of-magnitude faster than prior approaches.Transformer networks still require a large number of parameters to achieve state-of-the-art performance. In the case of the newstest2013 English-to-German translation task, the base model required 65M parameters, and the large model required 213M parameters. We propose a variant of the Transformer network which we call Weighted Transformer that uses self-attention branches in lieu of the multi-head attention. The branches replace the multiple heads in the attention mechanism of the original Transformer network, and the model learns to combine these branches during training. This branched architecture enables the network to achieve comparable performance at a significantly lower computational cost. Indeed, through this modification, we improve the state-of-the-art performance by 0.5 and 0.4 BLEU scores on the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French tasks, respectively. Finally, we present evidence that suggests a regularizing effect of the proposed architecture. We present the Weighted Transformer that trains faster and achieves better performance than the original Transformer network. The proposed architecture replaces the multi-head attention in the Transformer network by a multiple self-attention branches whose contributions are learned as a part of the training process. We report numerical results on the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French tasks and show that the Weighted Transformer improves the state-of-the-art BLEU scores by 0.5 and 0.4 points respectively. Further, our proposed architecture trains 15 \u2212 40% faster than the baseline Transformer. Finally, we present evidence suggesting the regularizing effect of the proposal and emphasize that the relative improvement in BLEU score is observed across various hyper-parameter settings for both small and large models."
