    "title": "AB 2492",
    "content": "The Community Redevelopment Law authorizes the establishment of redevelopment agencies in communities to address the effects of blight, as defined, by means of redevelopment projects financed by the issuance of bonds serviced by tax increment revenues derived from the project area. Existing law dissolved redevelopment agencies and community development agencies, as of February 1, 2012, and provides for the designation of successor agencies to wind down the affairs of the dissolved agencies and to fulfill the enforceable obligations of those agencies. Existing law also provides for various economic development programs that foster community sustainability and community and economic development initiatives throughout the state. Existing law authorizes certain local agencies to form a community revitalization and investment authority (authority) within a community revitalization and investment area, as defined, to carry out provisions of the Community Redevelopment Law in that area for purposes related to, among other things, infrastructure, affordable housing, and economic revitalization. Existing law requires not less than 80 of the land calculated by census tracts or census block groups, as defined by the United States Census Bureau, within the area to be characterized by several conditions, including a condition that the land has an annual median household income of less than 80 of the statewide annual median income. This bill would authorize the calculation to be made with a combination of census tracts and census block groups. The bill would also revise the conditions to require, among other things, an annual median household income that is less than 80 of the statewide, countywide, or citywide annual median household income. The bill would also authorize an authority to carry out a community revitalization plan if the census tract or census block groups within the community revitalization and investment area are within a disadvantage community, as prescribed. Existing law authorizes certain entities that receive ad valorem property taxes to adopt a resolution in a specified manner to allocate their share of tax increment funds within the area covered by a community revitalization plan to the authority. Existing law authorizes an authority to borrow money, receive grants, or accept financial or other assistance or investment from the state or any other public agency for any project within its area of operation. This bill would authorize an authority to also receive funds allocated to it pursuant to a resolution adopted by a city, county, or special district to transfer these funds from certain tax and assessment revenues, subject to specified requirements as to the use of those funds."
