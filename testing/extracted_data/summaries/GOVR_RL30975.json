    "content": "A United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor (UNTAET) was established in October 1999 following the entranceof U.N.-sponsored international peacekeepers into East Timor. These measures came in response toIndonesian-instigatedviolence against East Timorese who had voted overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia in a referendumofAugust 30, 1999. UNTAET's mandate is broad. It is to help East Timor recover from the violence throughhumanitarianaid and reconstruction of facilities that were damaged or destroyed. It is to help East Timor establish a functioninggovernment, which will take over from the United Nations when East Timor formally becomes independent. Independenceis estimated for the end of 2001, but recent statements by U.N. officials suggest that it could be postponed. TheUnitedNations also has been involved in Indonesian West Timor in assisting about 240,000 displaced East Timorese whofled orwere forcibly transported to West Timor during the violence. The U.N. operations are financed through assessments on all member nations and voluntary contributions from governments. Current funding levels are to cover the period 2000-2002. The U.S. Agency for InternationalDevelopmentprovided $29 million in FY2000 and $25 million in FY2001 in bilateral assistance. U.S. aid is helping to establishajudicial system, train civil servants, assist local radio and television programming, educate voters, and assist thecoffeeindustry (East Timor's main export). The Bush Administration requested $10 million for FY2002, but Congressalreadyhas indicated that $25 million may be appropriated. East Timor faces a continuing threat from Indonesia. East Timorese militia groups, who committed much of the violencein September 1999, regrouped in West Timor after the establishment of UNTAET. They controlled the campshousingdisplaced East Timorese, preventing many from returning home. In August 2000, militia members murdered U.N.workersin the camps. The militia rearmed with assistance from the Indonesian military, and they infiltrated back into EastTimor. The Indonesian military also has resisted attempts to bring to trial military officers and militia leaders responsiblefor theviolence of September 1999. The United States faces several policy issues: levels of future aid to East Timor, the U.S. role in assisting an indigenousEast Timorese military force, and influencing Indonesian policy toward East Timor."
