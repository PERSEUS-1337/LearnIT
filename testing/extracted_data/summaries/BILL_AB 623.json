    "title": "AB 623",
    "content": "Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of that act a crime. Existing law also provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. These provisions require specified services and drugs to be covered by the various plans. This bill would, where an abuse-deterrent opioid analgesic drug product, as defined, is available, prohibit a health care service plan or insurer from requiring the use of opioid analgesic drug products without the abuse-deterrent properties in order to access abuse-deterrent opioid analgesic drug products. The bill would require a health care service plan or insurer to allow a provider to prescribe, and if otherwise covered, to provide coverage for, a less than 30-day supply of an opioid analgesic drug product. Because a willful violation of these requirements with respect to health care service plans would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing law, the Pharmacy Law, the knowing violation of which is a crime, provides for the licensing and regulation of pharmacists by the California State Board of Pharmacy. Existing regulations require a pharmacist to provide oral consultation to his or her patient or the patient\u2019s agent in all care settings upon request or whenever the pharmacist deems it warranted. This bill would require a pharmacist to inform a patient receiving an opioid analgesic drug product on proper storage and disposal of the drug, and authorizes this information to be included as part of the required oral consultation. would require the board to adopt regulations to implement that provision. Because a violation of this requirement would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
