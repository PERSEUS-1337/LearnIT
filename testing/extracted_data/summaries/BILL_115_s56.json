    "content": "Regulations Endanger Democracy Act of 2017 or the RED Tape Act of 2017 This bill prohibits a federal agency from issuing a rule that causes a new financial or administrative burden on businesses or people in the United States unless the agency has repealed or amended two or more existing rules causing such a burden and the cost of the rule to be issued is less than or equal to that of the rules repealed or amended. The bill exempts a rule that: (1) relates to the internal policy or practice of, or procurement by, the agency. Or (2) is being revised to be less burdensome by decreasing requirements imposed by, or compliance costs of, the rule. In determining whether to repeal such a rule, an agency must consider: (1) whether the rule has achieved its purpose, has become obsolete, or overlaps with a rule to be issued. (2) any adverse effects that could materialize if the rule is repealed. And (3) whether the costs of the rule outweigh its benefits. Each agency must submit semiannuallynbsp. To the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for publication in the Unified Agenda a list of such rules the agency intends to issue, repeal, or amend during the following six months and the cost of each such rule."
