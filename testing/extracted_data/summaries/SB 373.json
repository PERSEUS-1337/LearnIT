    "title": "An act to add Section 84362.5 to the Education Code, relating to community college faculty.",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as one of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law establishes community college districts, administered by governing boards, throughout the state, and authorizes these districts to provide instruction to students at the community college campuses maintained by the districts. Existing law authorizes the employment of community college faculty and establishes certain rights for these employees. This bill would require community college districts to report to the board of governors, by March 31, 2016, the total number of full-time equivalent faculty (FTEF) positions staffed by faculty teaching overload assignments attributable to part-time temporary faculty and to contract or regular faculty while working on overload assignments during the period of July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, inclusive. Effective July 1, 2016, the bill would require that reported number to become that district\u2019s maximum allowable number of FTEF positions that may be staffed by faculty teaching overload assignments part-time temporary faculty and by contract or regular faculty while working on overload assignments until the district\u2019s full-time faculty percentage is greater than or equal to 75. Upon reaching the 75 threshold, the bill would require a district to maintain a full-time faculty percentage of 75 or higher, or not exceed the district\u2019s previously calculated maximum allowable number of FTEF positions that may be staffed by faculty teaching overload assignments. part-time temporary faculty and by contract or regular faculty while working on overload assignments. The bill would require the governing board to determine if a district has failed to comply with the above requirements, and, if so, to designate a specified amount of the district\u2019s apportionment or apportionments that would be required to be deposited in the county treasury, but unavailable to the district. The bill would authorize a district to submit an application for an exemption from the requirements of the bill in cases of serious hardship, as specified. Upon receipt of the exemption application, the bill would require the governing board to grant exemptions, as specified. The bill would require the amount exempted to be immediately available for expenditure by the governing board and the amount not exempted to be returned to the State School Fund. The bill would require the board of governors to enforce the requirements of the bill and would authorize them to adopt necessary rules and regulations. This bill would prohibit a district from assigning a person hired as a contract faculty member after July 1, 2016, to teach any overload assignment in excess of the equivalent of a full-time teaching load until the person achieves tenured status as a full-time regular faculty member. By placing additional requirements on community college districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
