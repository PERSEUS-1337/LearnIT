Have revoked any law, decree, or document authorizing or implementing a system of compensation for imprisoned individuals that uses the sentence or incarceration period to determine compensation. Have terminated payments for acts of terrorism against US and Israeli citizens to any individual who has been fairly tried and imprisoned for such acts, to any individual who died committing such acts, and to family members of such an individual. And are publicly condemning such acts of violence and are investigating such acts. This assistance limitation shall not apply to: (1) the East Jerusalem Hospital Network, (2) wastewater projects, and (3) children's vaccination projects. Withheld funds shall remain available for up to two years before being reallocated. The bill prescribes initial and annual reporting requirements."
