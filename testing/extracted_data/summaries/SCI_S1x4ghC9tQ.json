    "content": "To act and plan in complex environments, we posit that agents should have a mental simulator of the world with three characteristics: (a) it should build an abstract state representing the condition of the world; (b) it should form a belief which represents uncertainty on the world; (c) it should go beyond simple step-by-step simulation, and exhibit temporal abstraction. Motivated by the absence of a model satisfying all these requirements, we propose TD-VAE, a generative sequence model that learns representations containing explicit beliefs about states several steps into the future, and that can be rolled out directly without single-step transitions. TD-VAE is trained on pairs of temporally separated time points, using an analogue of temporal difference learning used in reinforcement learning. Generative models of sequential data have received a lot of attention, due to their wide applicability in domains such as speech synthesis BID18 , neural translation BID3 , image captioning BID22 , and many others. Different application domains will often have different requirements (e.g. long term coherence, sample quality, abstraction learning, etc.), which in turn will drive the choice of the architecture and training algorithm.Of particular interest to this paper is the problem of reinforcement learning in partially observed environments, where, in order to act and explore optimally, agents need to build a representation of the uncertainty about the world, computed from the information they have gathered so far. While an agent endowed with memory could in principle learn such a representation implicitly through model-free reinforcement learning, in many situations the reinforcement signal may be too weak to quickly learn such a representation in a way which would generalize to a collection of tasks.Furthermore, in order to plan in a model-based fashion, an agent needs to be able to imagine distant futures which are consistent with the agent's past. In many situations however, planning step-by-step is not a cognitively or computationally realistic approach.To successfully address an application such as the above, we argue that a model of the agent's experience should exhibit the following properties:\u2022 The model should learn an abstract state representation of the data and be capable of making predictions at the state level, not just the observation level.\u2022 The model should learn a belief state, i.e. a deterministic, coded representation of the filtering posterior of the state given all the observations up to a given time. A belief state contains all the information an agent has about the state of the world and thus about how to act optimally.\u2022 The model should exhibit temporal abstraction, both by making 'jumpy' predictions (predictions several time steps into the future), and by being able to learn from temporally separated time points without backpropagating through the entire time interval.To our knowledge, no model in the literature meets these requirements. In this paper, we develop a new model and associated training algorithm, called Temporal Difference Variational Auto-Encoder (TD-VAE), which meets all of the above requirements. We first develop TD-VAE in the sequential, non-jumpy case, by using a modified evidence lower bound (ELBO) for stochastic state space models (Krishnan et al., 2015; BID12 BID8 which relies on jointly training a filtering posterior and a local smoothing posterior. We demonstrate that on a simple task, this new inference network and associated lower bound lead to improved likelihood compared to methods classically used to train deep state-space models.Following the intuition given by the sequential TD-VAE, we develop the full TD-VAE model, which learns from temporally extended data by making jumpy predictions into the future. We show it can be used to train consistent jumpy simulators of complex 3D environments. Finally , we illustrate how training a filtering a posterior leads to the computation of a neural belief state with good representation of the uncertainty on the state of the environment.2 MODEL DESIDERATA In this paper, we argued that an agent needs a model that is different from an accurate step-by-step environment simulator. We discussed the requirements for such a model, and presented TD-VAE, a sequence model that satisfies all requirements. TD-VAE builds states from observations by bridging time points separated by random intervals. This allows the states to relate to each other directly over longer time stretches and explicitly encode the future. Further, it allows rolling out in state-space and in time steps larger than, and potentially independent of, the underlying temporal environment/data step size. In the future, we aim to apply TD-VAE to more complex settings, and investigate a number of possible uses in reinforcement learning such are representation learning and planning."
