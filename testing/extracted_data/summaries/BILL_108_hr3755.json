Requires: (1) independent mortgagor counseling prior to applying for a loan, including specific counseling regarding real estate property management for mortgagors purchasing dwellings with two to three units. And (2) the mortgagee to provide the mortgagor with an option for notice of foreclosure prevention counseling, which shall become effective 60 days after delinquency. Requires: (1) the Secretary to monitor and make adjustments to such program. (2) mortgagor credit evaluation by the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) TOTAL Mortgage Scorecard or other standardized credit scoring system. (3) additional underwriting standards for borrowers purchasing two- to three-unit dwellings. And (4) written mortgagee disclosure to the mortgagor of incremental costs. Limits the program to not more than ten percent of the aggregate number of FHA mortgages and loans insured in the preceding fiscal year.
