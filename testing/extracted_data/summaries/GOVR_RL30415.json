    "content": "The term \"partial-birth abortion\" refers generally to an abortion procedure where the fetus is removed intact from a woman's body. The procedure is described by the medical community as \"intact dilation and evacuation\" or \"dilation and extraction\" (\"D & X\") depending on the presentation of the fetus. Intact dilation and evacuation involves a vertex or \"head first\" presentation, the induced dilation of the cervix, the collapsing of the skull, and the extraction of the entire fetus through the cervix. D & X involves a breech or \"feet first\" presentation, the induced dilation of the cervix, the removal of the fetal body through the cervix, the collapsing of the skull, and the extraction of the fetus through the cervix. Since 1995, at least thirty-one states have enacted laws banning partial-birth abortions. Although many of these laws have not taken effect because of temporary or permanent injunctions, they remain contentious to both pro-life advocates and those who support a woman's right to choose. This report discusses the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Stenberg v. Carhart, a case involving the constitutionality of Nebraska's partial-birth abortion ban statute. In Stenberg, the Court invalidated the Nebraska statute because it lacked an exception for the performance of the partial-birth abortion procedure when necessary to protect the health of the mother, and because it imposed an undue burden on a woman's ability to have an abortion. This report also reviews various legislative attempts to restrict partial-birth abortions during the 106th, 107th, and 108th Congresses. S. 3, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, was signed by the President on November 4, 2003. On April 18, 2007, the Court upheld the act, finding that, as a facial matter, it is not unconstitutionally vague and does not impose an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. In reaching its conclusion in Gonzales v. Carhart, the Court distinguished the federal statute from the Nebraska law at issue in Stenberg."
