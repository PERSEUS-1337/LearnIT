    "content": "The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA, Title I of P.L. 107-279) established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) as an independent research arm of the Department of Education (ED). The IES Director, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, serves a six-year term and is advised by a technical panel composed primarily of educational researchers, the National Board of Educational Sciences (NBES). The IES consists of four research centers, the National Center for Education Research (NCER), the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE), and the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER). NCER sponsors research leading to the accumulation of knowledge and understanding of education. NCES's mission is to collect and analyze education information and statistics in a manner that meets the highest methodological standards. NCEE supports evaluation, technical assistance, development, and dissemination activities. NCSER sponsors research to expand knowledge and understanding of the needs of infants, toddlers, and children with disabilities. Along with ESRA, P.L. 107-279 enacted two additional acts\u2014the Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA, Title II of P.L. 107-279) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act (NAEPAA, Title III of P.L. 107-279). ETAA authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to local entities for the purpose of supporting varied technical assistance activities and to states for statewide, longitudinal data systems. NAEPAA authorizes the Commissioner of Education Statistics to carry out a national assessment, state assessments, and a long-term trend assessment in reading and mathematics. Authorities under ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA expired in FY2008; however, funding for these programs and activities has continued through annual appropriations legislation. In the 113th Congress, the House of Representatives passed the Strengthening Education through Research Act (H.R. 4366) by a voice vote on May 8, 2014. In the 114th Congress, the Senate adopted a largely similar bill by the same name (S. 227) by unanimous consent on December 17, 2015. Both bills would have provided for reauthorization of ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA and would have amended several provisions related to IES independence, research standards, technical assistance, evaluation, privacy protection, student assessment oversight, and IES accountability."
