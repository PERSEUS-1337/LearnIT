    "title": "A bill entitled the \"Hybrid HOV Access Act\".",
    "content": "Amends the Federal Aid Highways program to require a State agency with jurisdiction over the operation of a HOV facility to establish the occupancy requirements of vehicles operating on the facility. Requires such agency to permit motorcycles and bicycles to use the HOV facility. Permits a State agency to restrict use of the HOV facility by motorcycles or bicycles if it certifies to the Secretary of Transportation that such use would create a safety hazard. Prescribes guidelines under which a State agency may permit use of an HOV facility by: (1) public transportation vehicles and high occupancy toll vehicles, (2) inherently low-emission vehicles and low emission and energy-efficient vehicles. And (3) advanced lean burn technology vehicles. Permits tolls to be charged on a HOV facility on the Interstate System. Requires a State agency that allows low-emission and energy-efficient vehicles to use a HOV facility to certify to the Secretary that it will establish: (1) a continuous monitoring, assessment, and reporting program regarding the impacts such vehicles may have on the operation of the facility and adjacent highways. And (2) an enforcement program that ensures the facility is operated in accordance with this Act. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection to issue a final rule establishing certification requirements for low emission and energy-efficient vehicles and for advanced lean burn technology vehicles."
