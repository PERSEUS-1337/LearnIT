    "content": "On October 30, 2017, the House Rules Committee posted an amendment in the nature of a substitute for the Community Health And Medical Professionals Improve Our Nation Act of 2017 (CHAMPION Act, H.R. 3922). The amendment considered by the House struck the text of the CHAMPION Act and replaced it with the text of the amendment in the nature of the substitute. The amendment in the nature of a substitute is entitled the Continuing Community Health And Medical Professional Programs to Improve Our Nation, Increase National Gains, and Help Ensure Access for Little Ones, Toddlers, and Hopeful Youth by Keeping Insurance Delivery Stable Act of 2017 (CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act). In revising the language of the CHAMPION Act, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act includes revised language for the CHAMPION Act in Division A. Division A would extend funding for several public health programs that had received directed appropriations through FY2017. It would also make a number of changes to these programs and would provide offsets for the proposed funding extensions. Division B of this act would, among other things, extend funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). On November 1, 2017, the House Rules Committee adopted an amendment (H.Res. 601) to this bill that would lessen the amount that would be reduced from the Public Health and Prevention Fund (PPHF), one of the offsets included in Division A. The House passed the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act on November 3, 2017, by a vote of 242 to 174. On December 13, 2017, the chair of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, introduced H.J.Res 124. This measure would extend temporary continuing appropriations for most federal agencies (Division A) and provide full-year appropriations for the Department of Defense (Division B). Division C, Subdivision 1 (\u00a7\u00a721001-21202), of this measure is largely identical to the text of Division A of the House-passed CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act (H.R. 3922). This report summarizes provisions in Division A of the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. CRS Report R44989, Comparison of the Bills to Extend State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Funding, summarizes provisions in Division B."
