    "content": "Working Student Act of 2015 This bill amends title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to modify the income protection allowance levels used to calculate a student's expected family contribution and need for financial assistance. Specifically, the bill increases, in academic year 2016-2017, income protection allowance levels for students who are dependent, independent without non-spouse dependents , and independent with non-spouse dependents to reduce such students' income available to cover postsecondary educational expenses. The Department of Education must, in subsequent years, adjust the income protection allowance levels for inflation."
