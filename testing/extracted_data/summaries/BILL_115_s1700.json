    "content": "Water Efficiency Improvement Act of 2017 This bill amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to codify the WaterSense Program of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that allows water-efficient products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services to bear a WaterSense label. The EPA must establish certification criteria for the WaterSense label, enhance public awareness regarding the label, preserve the label's integrity, and review, and if appropriate, revise the WaterSense label requirements. To the maximum extent practicable and no less than annually, the EPA must estimate and publish the aggregate production, aggregate market penetration, and savings of water, energy, and capital costs of water, wastewater, and stormwater attributable to the use of WaterSense-labeled products, buildings and building landscapes, facilities, processes, and services."
