    "content": "Survival Analysis (time-to-event analysis) in the presence of multiple possible adverse events, i.e., competing risks, is a challenging, yet very important problem in medicine, finance, manufacturing, etc. Extending classical survival analysis to competing risks is not trivial since only one event (e.g. one cause of death) is observed and hence, the incidence of an event of interest is often obscured by other related competing events. This leads to the nonidentifiability of the event times\u2019 distribution parameters, which makes the problem significantly more challenging. In this work we introduce Siamese Survival Prognosis Network, a novel Siamese Deep Neural Network architecture that is able to effectively learn from data in the presence of multiple adverse events. The Siamese Survival Network is especially crafted to issue pairwise concordant time-dependent risks, in which longer event times are assigned lower risks. Furthermore, our architecture is able to directly optimize an approximation to the C-discrimination index, rather than relying on well-known metrics of cross-entropy etc., and which are not able to capture the unique requirements of survival analysis with competing risks. Our results show consistent performance improvements on a number of publicly available medical datasets over both statistical and deep learning state-of-the-art methods. Competing risks settings are ubiquitous in medicine. They can be encountered in cardiovascular diseases, in cancer, and in the geriatric population suffering from multiple diseases. To solve the challenging problem of learning the model parameters from time-to-event data while handling right censoring, we have developed a novel deep learning architecture for estimating personalized risk scores in the presence of competing risks which is based on the well-known Siamese network architecture. Our method is able to capture complex non-linear representations missed out by classical machine learning and statistical models. Experimental results show that our method is able to outperform existing competing risk methods by successfully learning representations which can flexibly describe non-proportional hazard rates with complex interactions between covariates and survival times that are common in many diseases with heterogeneous phenotypes."
