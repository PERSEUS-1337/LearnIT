    "content": "The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) has been ratified by 183 nations, including the United States. It regulates the international trade in animals and plants that may be threatened by trade. CITES entered into force in 1975 and currently regulates the trade of approximately 30,000 species of plants and 5,600 species of animals. Many believe that CITES has been a success, noting that no species listed under CITES has gone extinct in the last 30 years. Others believe that CITES, although successful, has had implementation difficulties, such as a lack of enforcement and failures to enact laws that relate to the treaty in some nations. Protected species are organized under CITES into three appendixes. Species in Appendix I are threatened with extinction due primarily to trade, and trade in Appendix I species is prohibited for commercial purposes. Appendix II contains species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction but require controlled trade to prevent population declines. Species under Appendix III are listed because at least one country has requested other countries to assist it in regulating trade of that species. In the United States, the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205, 87 Stat. 884. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71531-1544) implements CITES and contains separate provisions for protecting rare foreign species. Many species listed under the ESA are also listed under CITES. However, listings under the ESA are based on several criteria that may threaten the survival of the species. Species listed under CITES are evaluated solely on the threat of trade to a species' survival. CITES might allow for the trade in a listed species if trade is not detrimental to the survival of the species, whereas the ESA might allow imports of foreign endangered species if trade enhances the survival of the species in its native country. In the United States, the implementation and enforcement of laws related to CITES is of potential interest for Congress due to constituent interest in the protection of foreign species and as the treaty relates to the global illegal wildlife trade. Further, wildlife protection under the ESA and CITES for the import and export of particular species and their products, such as trophies for sport-hunted animals, has been of interest to Congress."
