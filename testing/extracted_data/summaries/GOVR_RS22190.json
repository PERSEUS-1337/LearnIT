    "content": "Military food items, also known as subsistence items, are generally procured under the auspices of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), an agency of the Department of Defense (DOD) which provides worldwide logistics support for the U.S. military services. Under DLA, DLA Troop Services (formerly the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia) is the inventory control point for food, clothing, textiles, medicines, medical equipment, general and industrial supplies, and services for the military, their eligible dependents, and other non-DOD customers worldwide. DLA Troop Services buys and manages about $13.4 billion worth of food, clothing, textiles, and other products. Under DLA Troop Services, the Subsistence Directorate serves as the operational manager for all food operations. These items are procured in accordance with the provisions of the Berry Amendment and the Buy American Act (BAA). The Berry Amendment requires DOD to give preference to the procurement of domestically produced, manufactured, or home grown products, notably food, clothing, and fabrics. This report will describe the origin, authority, and policy in the procurement of food for the military."
