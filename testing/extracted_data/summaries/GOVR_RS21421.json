    "content": "Mountaintop removal mining involves removing the top of a mountain in order to recover the coal seams contained there. This practice occurs in six Appalachian states (Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and Ohio). It creates an immense quantity of excess spoil (dirt and rock that previously composed the mountaintop), which is typically placed in valley fills on the sides of the former mountains, burying streams that flow through the valleys. Mountaintop removal mining is regulated under several laws, including the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA). Critics say that, as a result of valley fills from mountaintop removal mining, stream water quality and the aquatic and wildlife habitat that streams support are destroyed by tons of rocks and dirt. The mining industry argues that mountaintop removal mining is essential to conducting surface coal mining in Appalachia and that it would not be economically feasible there if operators were barred from using valleys for the disposal of mining overburden. Critics have used litigation to challenge the practice. Environmental groups have been successful at the federal district court level in challenging some permits for mountaintop removal mining projects, only to be later overturned on appeal. Nonetheless, the criticisms have prompted some regulatory changes. In 2009, officials of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), and the Department of the Interior signed a Memorandum of Understanding outlining a series of administrative actions under these laws to reduce the harmful environmental impacts of surface coal mining in Appalachia. The plan included a series of actions that emphasize specific steps, improved coordination, and greater transparency of decisions to be implemented through regulatory proposals, guidance documents, and review of applications for permits to authorize surface coal mining operations in Appalachia. Viewed broadly, the Administration's combined actions displease both industry and environmental advocates. The additional scrutiny of permits and more stringent requirements have angered the coal industry and many of its supporters. Controversy also was generated by EPA's 2011 veto of a CWA permit that had been issued by the Corps for a surface coal mining project in West Virginia. At the same time, while environmental groups support EPA's steps to restrict the practice, many favor tougher requirements or even total rejection of mountaintop removal mining in Appalachia. The enhanced permit review procedures and EPA guidance on factors used in evaluating water quality impacts of Appalachian surface mining permits were challenged in court, but they were upheld by a federal appellate court. EPA's veto of the West Virginia mine permit was overturned by a federal court, but that ruling was reversed on appeal and the Supreme Court declined to review the case. Several bills to clarify and restrict EPA's veto authority were introduced in the 113th Congress. Legislation to restrict EPA's veto authority also was introduced in the 114th Congress (S. 55/S. 234, H.R. 896, and H.R. 1203). This report provides background on regulatory requirements, controversies and legal challenges to mountaintop removal mining, and recent Administration actions, including a Stream Protection Rule proposed by the Office of Surface Mining in July 2015. Attention to EPA's veto of the West Virginia mining permit and other federal agency actions has increased in Congress. Congressional interest in these issues is discussed, including legislation seeking to restrict the practice of mountaintop removal mining and other legislation intended to block the Obama Administration's regulatory actions."
