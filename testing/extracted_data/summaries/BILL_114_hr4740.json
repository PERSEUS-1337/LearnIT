A cybercrime against an individual is a criminal offense that involves use of a computer, including a computer network or interactive electronic device, to harm an individual. DOJ must also award a grant to a nonprofit private cybercrime organization to establish and maintain the National Resource Center on Cybercrimes Against Individuals. It must provide technical assistance and training resources, maintain a resource library, and conduct research to improve the capacity of governments, communities, and individuals to prevent, enforce, and prosecute cybercrimes against individuals."
