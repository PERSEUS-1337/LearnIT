    "content": "Air Ambulance Consumer Protection Act This bill requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish an advisory committee to make recommendations for a rulemaking to: (1) require air ambulance operators to clearly disclose charges for air transportation services separately from charges for non-air transportation services within any invoice or bill, and (2) provide other consumer protections for customers of air ambulance operators. The bill makes provisions relating to air transportation consumer complaints applicable to air ambulance transportation. It also allows an air ambulance customer to file a complaint requiring DOT to investigate whether air carriers or ticket agents have engaged in unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition. An air ambulance operator shall include the hotline telephone number established for consumer complaints on any invoice, bill, or other communication provided to a passenger or customer of the operator."
