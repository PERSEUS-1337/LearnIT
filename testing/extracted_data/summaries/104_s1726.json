Or (2) requiring, as a condition of such a sale, that a decryption key be given to any other person . Grants the Secretary exclusive authority to control exports of all computer hardware, software, and technology with encryption capabilities, except that which is specifically designed or modified for military use, including command, control, and intelligence applications. Prohibits requiring any validated license for the export or reexport of any: (1) computer software, including that with encryption capabilities, that is generally available, as is, and designed for installation by the purchaser, or that is in the public domain or publicly available because it is generally accessible to the public in any form. Or (2) computing device or computer hardware solely because it incorporates or employs in any form such computer software . Directs the Secretary to authorize the export or reexport of computer software with encryption capabilities under a general license for nonmilitary end-uses in any country to which exports of software or hardware of similar capability are permitted for use by financial institutions not controlled in fact by US persons, unless there is substantial evidence that such software and hardware will be diverted to a military end-use or an end-use supporting international terrorism, modified for military or terrorist end-use, or reexported without requisite Federal authorization. Declares that nothing in this Act may be construed to affect any law in effect before this Act's enactment designed to prevent the distribution of descramblers and any other equipment for illegal interceptions of cable and satellite television signals."
