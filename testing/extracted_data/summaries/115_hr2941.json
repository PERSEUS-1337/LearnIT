USDA shall convey a portion of that land to Collins Camp Properties, Inc. USDA may configure the federal land to be conveyed so as to maximize the marketability of the conveyance or to achieve management objectives. Consideration for a conveyance of federal land under this bill shall be in cash. In any conveyance of federal land under this bill, USDA shall meet disclosure requirements for hazardous substances but shall not otherwise be required to remediate or abate such substances. USDA shall deposit the proceeds from such conveyances in the fund established under the Sisk Act. USDA shall require Collins Camp Properties to pay at closing reasonable appraisal costs and the cost of any administrative and environmental analyses required by law. An offer by Collins Camp Properties for acquiring the federal land must be accompanied by a written statement from each holder of a Forest Service special use authorization with respect to such land specifying that the holder agrees to relinquish that authorization upon the conveyance of such land to Collins Camp Properties. If a holder fails to furnish such a written statement, USDA shall require Collins Camp Properties to administer that authorization in accordance with its terms until it expires."
