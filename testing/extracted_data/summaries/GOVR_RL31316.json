    "content": "On July 12, 2001, President Bush announced a Medicare-endorsed prescription drug discount card program to help seniors lower their out-of-pocket drug costs. The President stated that the discount card program would be an interim measure until a broader Medicareprescription drug benefit for seniors can be created. Many seniors do not have adequate prescription drug coverage. In 1998, an estimated 10 million elderly people,or 27% of Medicare beneficiaries, did not haveany form of prescription drug coverage. The Administration planned to implement the card program in January 2002, but it was put on hold because of a federal court order. Pharmacy groupssuccessfully filed a lawsuit against CMS in 2001, asking a federal court to issue an injunction that would halt thecard program on the grounds that theAdministration had no statutory authority to establish the program. The Administration proceeded with plans tomodify the program and use a formal rulemakingprocess for a new proposal. On August 30, 2002, CMS issued the final rule. Pharmacies continued to claim thatthe Administration lacked the statutory authorityto implement the initiative. On January 29, 2003, a federal district court ruled that the Administration did not havethe statutory authority to offer the cardprogram. CMS issued a statement saying that it would be evaluating its options and it would likely appeal. In the108th Congress, Representative Mark Foleyintroduced a bill ( H.R. 513 ) in the House on January 31, 2003 to authorize the Secretary of Health and HumanServices to endorse prescription drugdiscount cards for use by Medicare beneficiaries. The proposed card program would be similar to prescription drug discount card programs that are currently available from a number of sources. TheAdministration's card would endorse and promote a number of qualified privately-administered prescription drugdiscount card plans which would have aone-time maximum enrollment rate of $25 per plan. Since the announcement of President Bush's proposal, severalpharmaceutical companies have implementedtheir own senior discount card plans for low-income seniors beginning in early 2002. The Administration has stated that the Medicare-endorsed card plans would offer discounts in the range of 10%to 13%, and up to 15%, on retail prescription drugprices. The net overall effects of President Bush's proposed program would depend on the details of the individualcard plans, which are not yet available. Congressional critics of President Bush's proposal dispute the Administration's estimates of potential discounts. Some Members of Congress believe that thecard program would not provide additional benefits for seniors. They cite a recent study by the U.S. GeneralAccounting Office (GAO) on prescription drugdiscount prices available at retail pharmacies, Internet pharmacies, and existing drug discount card programs. TheMembers believe that the study indicates thatseniors already have access to drug discount cards and that these programs offer little savings for seniors. This report will be updated as events warrant."
