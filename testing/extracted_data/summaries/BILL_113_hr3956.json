Conducting community-wide market analysis to help recruit andor retain Class 1 commercial investment. Creating employment training programs for Class 1 business customer service, sales, and managerial positions. Retail marketing strategies to solicit new Class 1 commercial investment starts in the community. Program allowances for activities such as the publication of marketing materials, development of economic development web pages, and educational outreach activities with retail trade associations. And hiring business recruitment specialists. Authorizes the Administrator to only make such a grant to communities: (1) whose demographics include a median per capita income no higher than $35,000 and a lack of Class 1 commercial investment. (2) that submit an application that describes the activities the community carries out, and the difficulty the community has faced, to recruit, retain and grow their economy through Class 1 commercial investment. And (3) that agree to match 10 of grant funds with certain non-federal contributions. Allows the Administrator to waive or reduce the non-federal contribution if the community involved demonstrates that it cannot meet the contribution requirement due to financial hardship."
