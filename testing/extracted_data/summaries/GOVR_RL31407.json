    "content": "The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) contains several requirements related to student assessments for states and local educational agencies (LEAs) participating in Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Title I-A (Education for the Disadvantaged). Under the NCLB, in addition to previous requirements for standards and assessments in reading and mathematics at three grade levels, all states participating in Title I-A were required to implement standards-based assessments for students in each of grades 3-8 in reading and mathematics by the end of the 2005-2006 school year. States must also implement assessments at three grade levels in science by the end of the 2007-2008 school year. Students who have been in U.S. schools for at least three years must be tested (for reading) in English, and states must annually assess the English language proficiency of their limited English proficient (LEP) students. The grants to states program for assessment development was appropriated $410.7 million for FY2010. In addition, the NCLB requires all states receiving grants under Title I-A to participate in National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests in 4th and 8th grade reading and mathematics to be administered every two years, with all costs to be paid by the federal government. NAEP is a series of ongoing assessments of the academic performance of representative samples of students primarily in grades 4, 8, and 12. Beginning in 1990, NAEP has conducted a limited number of state-level assessments wherein the sample of students tested in each participating state is increased in order to provide reliable estimates of achievement scores for students in the state. Previously, all participation in state NAEP was voluntary, and additional costs associated with state NAEP were borne by participating states. The statutory provisions authorizing NAEP are amended by the NCLB to maximize consistency with the NCLB requirements and prohibit the use of NAEP assessments by agents of the federal government to influence state or LEA instructional programs or assessments. The authorization for ESEA programs expired at the end of FY2008, and the 111th Congress is expected to consider whether to amend and extend the ESEA. Issues regarding expanded ESEA Title I-A student assessment requirements that are being addressed by the 111th Congress include the following: Are states meeting the expanded assessment requirements on schedule? Will federal grants be sufficient to pay the costs of meeting the assessment requirements? What might be the impact on NAEP of requiring state participation, as well as the impact of NAEP on state standards and assessments? What are the likely major benefits and costs of the expanded ESEA Title I-A student assessment requirements? And should the assessment requirements be expanded further? This report will be updated regularly to reflect major legislative developments and available information."
