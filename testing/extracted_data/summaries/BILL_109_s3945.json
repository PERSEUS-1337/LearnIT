    "content": "Compassionate Assistance for Rape Emergencies Act - Prohibits any federal funds from being provided to a hospital unless the hospital meets certain conditions related to a woman who is a victim of sexual assault, including that the hospital: (1) provides the woman with accurate and unbiased information about emergency contraception, (2) offers emergency contraception to the woman. (3) provides the woman such contraception at the hospital on her request. And (4) does not deny any such services because of the inability of the woman to pay. Prohibits any federal funds from being provided to a hospital unless the hospital provides to survivors of sexual assault, regardless of ability to pay: (1) an assessment of the individual's risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections. (2) advice concerning significantly prevalent infections for which effective post-exposure prophylaxis exists and for which the deferral of treatment either would significantly reduce treatment efficacy or would pose substantial risk to the individual's health, and (3) such prophylactic treatment for infections, upon request."
