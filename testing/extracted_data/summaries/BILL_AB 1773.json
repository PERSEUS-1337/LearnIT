    "title": "AB 1773",
    "content": "Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission is vested with regulatory authority over public utilities. Existing law authorizes a local governmental entity, except a joint powers authority, to receive a bill credit to a designated benefiting account, for electricity exported to the electrical grid by an eligible renewable generating facility and requires the commission to adopt a rate tariff for the benefiting account. This bill would include as a local governmental entity for this purpose a joint powers authority, except as specified. Under existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or an order or direction of the commission is a crime. Because the provisions of this bill would require an order or other action of the commission to implement and a violation of that order or action would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program by creating a new crime. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
