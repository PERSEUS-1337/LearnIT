    "content": "Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) remain popular and have a firm hold on power in Turkey. The AKP is trying to recast itself from anIslamist-rooted party to a centrist \"conservative democratic\" party. Although some AKP actions fuelsecularist suspicions of a hidden Islamist agenda, the high priority that the party gives to attainingEuropean Union (EU) membership may mitigate fears about its intentions and support its centristambitions. The government remains focused on the economy. With the aid of the International MonetaryFund (IMF), it has undertaken major macroeconomic reforms, achieved solid growth, and reducedinflation. The IMF has reviewed the government's economic performance positively and is expectedto approve a new three-year stand-by agreement for 2005-2007. The government also has been challenged by terrorism and is dealing with both Kurdish terrorism, a radical religious terrorist threat with possible international links, and remnants of leftistterrorism. In order to obtain a date to begin accession talks with the European Union (EU), the Turkish parliament has passed many reforms to harmonize Turkey's laws and Constitution with EUstandards. The EU is expected to scrutinize implementation of the reforms carefully before settinga date for accession talks. The situation on Cyprus is not expected to affect EU decision-making. U.S.-Turkish relations were shaken on March 1, 2003, when the Turkish parliament rejected a resolution to allow the deployment of U.S. troops to Turkey to open a northern front against Iraq. Bilateral ties have been strained by other developments in Iraq. The Turkish parliament's October2003 decision to authorize the deployment of Turkish peacekeepers to Iraq helped to improve ties,even though the offer was not accepted. However, Turkey continues to be concerned about thesituation in Iraq and U.S. actions there, which fuel anti-Americanism. Turkey remains important to the United States. Turkish air bases were used in the Afghan war and its airspace in the Iraq war. Its ports, airbases, and roads are used to resupply coalition forcesand for reconstruction efforts in Iraq. U.S. troops rotate to and from Iraq via Turkey. Turkey willbe an important transit route for pipelines carrying energy resources from the Caucasus and CentralAsia to the West, and the often sabotaged oil pipeline from Iraq to Turkey could be helpful to Iraq'srecovery. Turkish and U.S. intelligence agencies are cooperating closely in the war on terrorism. Turkish peacekeepers have served in many hot spots in support of U.S. policies, and commandedthe International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. Finally, some U.S. officials andanalysts believe strongly that Turkey, as a predominantly Muslim, democratic country, could serveas an example to others."
