    "title": "A bill to preserve the effectiveness of medically important antibiotics by restricting their use as additives to animal feed.",
    "content": "Preservation of Antibiotics for Human Treatment Act of 2002 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to deem unsafe animal feed containing a new animal drug which is a member of the fluoroquinolone class of antimicrobial drugs, unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services receives information from the drug's sponsor that there exists a reasonable certainty of no harm to human health due to the development of antimicrobial resistance attributable to the use of such drug in animal feed. Requires the Secretary to withdraw or rescind approval of previously approved drugs that are either critical antimicrobial drugs or in the same chemical class as critical antimicrobial drugs, unless the Secretary receives information from the drug's sponsor that there exists a reasonable certainty of no harm to human health due to the development of antimicrobial resistance attributable to the use of such drug in animal feed. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to make payments to producers of livestock or poultry who have reduced or are substantially reducing the nontherapeutic use of critical antimicrobial drugs."
