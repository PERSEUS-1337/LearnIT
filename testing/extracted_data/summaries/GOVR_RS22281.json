    "content": "Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005, causing widespread flooding and significant infrastructure damage to 83 federal facilities in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The General Services Administration (GSA) is the federal government's primary real property agency, with 11 regional offices that oversee GSA owned and leased federal buildings and courthouses. As of September 21, 2007, one leased building remained closed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in GSA's Southeast Region 4, which includes Alabama and Mississippi. In GSA's Greater Southwest Region 7, one GSA facility remained closed in Louisiana. GSA courthouse facilities in New Orleans, LA, which were temporarily relocated to Houston, TX, reopened in New Orleans on January 9, 2006. The 109th Congress authorized $38 million to GSA's Federal Buildings Fund for repairs to damaged federal facilities (119 Stat. 2782). No legislation pertaining to hurricane-damaged federal facilities has been introduced in the 110th Congress. This report will not be updated."
