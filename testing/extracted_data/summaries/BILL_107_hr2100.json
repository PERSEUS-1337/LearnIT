Allows under specified instructional conditions the performance and display of reasonable and limited portions of any copyrighted work in an amount comparable to that which is typically displayed in the course of a live classroom session, by or in the course of a transmission. Exempts from infringement liability, under specified conditions, governmental bodies, accredited nonprofit educational institutions, and nonprofit libraries by reason of the transient or temporary storage of material carried out through the automatic technical process of a digital transmission of the performance or display of that material. Extends the current ephemeral recording exemption, under specified conditions, to copies or phonorecords embodying a performance or display in digital and analog form for use in making transmissions authorized by this Act."
