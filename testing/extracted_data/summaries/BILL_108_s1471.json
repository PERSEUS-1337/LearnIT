    "content": "Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to require each electric utility to make net metering service available upon consumer request. Permits a State regulatory authority, one year after enactment of this Act, to determine whether it is in the public interest to decline to implement such requirement. Permits a State to establish incentives to encourage on-site generating facilities and net metering in addition to the requirements of this Act. Requires an electric utility to charge the owner or operator of an on-site generating facility rates that are identical to those charged to its other electric consumers in the same rate class. Bars such utility from charging the owner or operator of an on-site generating facility any additional standby, capacity, interconnection, or other charges. Prescribes guidelines for: (1) electric energy sales to the owner or operator of an on-site generating facility. And (2) measurements of electric energy consumed. Directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to promulgate additional control, testing, and interconnection requirements for on-site generating facilities and net metering systems deemed necessary to protect public safety and system reliability."
