    "content": "Congressional interest in climate change legislation has grown in recent years. In the 110th Congress, Members have introduced numerous bills that directly address various aspects of climate change. These bills cover a wide spectrum, ranging from climate change research to comprehensive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions cap-and-trade programs. As of the date of this report, Congress has enacted six broader pieces of legislation that\u2014among many other non-climate-related provisions\u2014address climate change in some fashion: P.L. 110-140 expands the carbon capture research and development program, requires a national assessment of geologic storage capacity for CO2, and supports technologies for the large-scale capture of CO2 from industrial sources. The act also establishes an Office of Climate Change and the Environment to coordinate research and implement strategies to address climate change-related transportation issues. P.L. 110-161 directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop regulations that establish a mandatory GHG reporting program that applies \"above appropriate thresholds in all sectors of the economy.\" P.L. 110-181 directs the Department of Defense (DOD) to assess the risks of projected climate change to the department's facilities, capabilities, and missions. P.L. 110-229 requires the Secretary of Energy, when reviewing research and development activities for possible inclusion in the steel research and development initiative, to expand the plan in order to consider among steel project priorities the development of technologies that reduce GHG emissions. P.L. 110-246 directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish technical guidelines to \"measure the environmental services benefits from conservation and land management activities in order to facilitate the participation of farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners in emerging environmental services markets.\" USDA is to give priority to carbon markets. P.L. 110-343 provides a tax credit for select (geologic) carbon sequestration activities. In addition, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is \"to identify the types of and specific tax provisions that have the largest effects on carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions and to estimate the magnitude of those effects.\" NAS is to report its findings to Congress by October 3, 2010. This report briefly discusses the basic concepts on which climate change bills are based, and compares major provisions of the bills in each of the following categories: climate change research; emissions reduction technologies; U.S. actions pursuant to international emission reduction agreements; adaptation to the effects of climate change; GHG reporting and registration; and GHG emissions reduction programs."
