Sets forth the conditions to be met prior to taking lands into trust for the Tribe pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire: (1) private lands. And (2) through condemnation, with funds provided by the Tribe, certain interspersed lands that are owned by the State of Arizona in order to have both the private and the State lands taken into trust for the Tribe. Prohibits the Secretary, pursuant to the provisions of this Act and the Settlement Agreement, from placing lands, any portion of which are located within or contiguous to a five-mile radius of an incorporated town or city in Northern Arizona, into trust for the Tribe without specific statutory authority.

Authorizes an appropriation to the Department of the Interior of $250,000 for FY 1998 to be used for making a payment to the State of Arizona.
