The S-K Act created a fund (known as the S-K fund) that is financed by a permanent appropriation of a portion of import duties on marine products. S-K funds are distributed by the Secretary of Commerce as grants and cooperative agreements to address needs of the U.S. fishing industry, including but not limited to harvesting, processing, marketing, and associated infrastructure. However, Congress allocates most funding to the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to fund agency activities related to marine fisheries research and management. Some have questioned whether the allocation of S-K funds reflects the original intent of the S-K Act and whether the S-K Grant Program addresses the needs and priorities of the fishing industry. Since its creation, the S-K fund's authorizing language and priorities have evolved with changes to the fishing industry, new or amended federal laws governing fisheries management, and changing federal agency responsibilities. In 1980, the American Fisheries Promotion Act (AFPA) amended the S-K Act to authorize a competitive grant program, known as the Saltonstall-Kennedy Grant Program (S-K Grant Program) and the National Program to support fishing industry research and development projects. Both programs are administered by NMFS, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In the 1980s, the S-K Grant Program focused on fisheries development, but in subsequent years, as U.S. fisheries became fully or overexploited, priorities generally shifted to resource conservation and management. The S-K Grant Program has supported a variety of different projects, such as gear technology research, seafood marketing, aquaculture, and others. The S-K Grant Program is funded by a permanent appropriation of 30% of the previous calendar year's customs receipts from imports of fish and fish products. These funds are transferred into NOAA's Promote and Develop American Fisheries Products and Research Pertaining to American Fisheries Fund (P&D account). Transfers of revenue into the P&D account have grown steadily from $26.7 million in 1980 to $182.8 million in 2020. Congress subsequently transfers most funds into the Operations, Research, and Facilities (ORF) account within NOAA. Congress has directed NMFS to use funds allocated to the ORF account for specific activities including stock assessments, fishing information networks, survey and monitoring projects, cooperative research, and interjurisdictional fisheries. The remaining funds are available for supporting the annual competitive S-K Grant Program and in some cases the National Program. Since the early 1980s, Congress has transferred most P&D account funds into the ORF discretionary account, sometimes leaving little or no funding for the specified purposes of the S-K Act. Some critics have questioned whether funds from the P&D account could be used more effectively by targeting fishing industry needs, as Congress originally intended. For example, in the 112 th , 113 th , and 114 th Congresses, bills were introduced that would have used most S-K funds to establish a regional fisheries grant program. By contrast, some have expressed concerns that if significant funding is shifted away from NMFS fisheries management programs, additional funds would need to be appropriated or activities such as data collection and fish population assessments could be compromised. These NMFS activities provide information and analyses used to manage and conserve fish populations. Some also have questioned whether the S-K Grant Program could be modified to provide the fishing industry with more direct input into the S-K grant process. Currently, NMFS, in consultation with the fishing industry, identifies S-K Grant Program priorities and selects the recipients of S-K grants. Over the last several Congresses, bills have been introduced that would change the procedure for screening, evaluating, and awarding S-K grants. In the 116 th Congress, the American Fisheries Advisory Committee Act ( H.R. 1218 and S. 494 ) would establish an industry advisory committee to identify the needs of the fishing industry, develop requests for proposals, review grant applications, and select grant applications for approval. S. 494 was reported on August 16, 2019, by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation; on September 18, 2019, H.R. 1218 was ordered to be reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources."
