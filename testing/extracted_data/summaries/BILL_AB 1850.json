    "title": "AB 1850",
    "content": "The existing California Civil Liberties Public Education Act has been enacted for the stated purpose of sponsoring public educational activities and development of educational materials to ensure that the events surrounding the exclusion, forced removal, and internment of persons of Japanese ancestry will be remembered and so that the causes and circumstances of this and similar events may be illuminated and understood. Existing law requires, to the extent that federal financial analysis methodology incorporates this exemption, income received as reparation payments paid pursuant to federal law for the purpose of redressing the injustice done to persons of Japanese ancestry who were interned during World War II not be considered in determining an applicant\u2019s financial need for purposes of student financial aid programs. This bill would delete the term \u201cresident aliens\u201d from these provisions and replace it with the term \u201cpermanent residents.\u201d Existing law expresses findings of the Legislature with respect to the impact of the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 on illegal aliens. Existing law also states the intent of the Legislature to establish a state test that may be used by eligible aliens to attest to their understanding of English and understanding of the history and government of the United States to meet the requirements of that act. Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction, in consultation with the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, to develop the state test referenced above. This bill would delete the word \u201cillegal\u201d from the legislative findings relating to these aliens. This bill would also replace the word \u201calien\u201d with the term \u201cforeign national\u201d in various provisions relating to educational services provided to immigrants, relating to adult education, and relating to the determination of residence for students of specified public postsecondary educational institutions, but this replacement would be operative only if the Superintendent certifies, in writing, to the Secretary of State of California on or before January 20, 2017, that this terminology has been changed in federal law as specified."
