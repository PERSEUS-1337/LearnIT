    "content": "A number of legislative proposals and executive branch initiatives designed to increase domestic energy supply, enhance energy security, or amend the requirements of environmental statutes that apply to energy development are before the 115th Congress. There are legislative proposals that include new revenue-sharing provisions for coastal states that would allow states the authority to manage federal energy leases within their state. The Trump Administration's theme of \"energy dominance\" has translated into several administration initiatives and executive orders, including the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) under the 2017 tax revision (P.L. 115-97), modifying monument designations, streamlining the permitting process for energy projects on federal land, and authorizing more leasing in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) under a new Draft Proposed Program (DPP) for 2019-2024. The new DPP would supersede the current five-year leasing program (2017-2022). Conversely, there are congressional proposals that oppose this Administration's policy direction. A key question addressed in this discussion is how much oil and gas is produced in the United States each year and how much of that comes from federal versus nonfederal areas. Oil production has risen in federal areas (onshore and offshore) over the past 10 years but has increased at a faster rate on nonfederal lands. Nonfederal crude oil production rapidly increased in the past few years, primarily due to improved extraction technology, favorable geology, and the ease of leasing, more than doubling daily production between FY2008 and FY2017. The federal share of total U.S. crude oil production fell from its peak at nearly 36% in 2009 to less than 24% in 2017 at the same time overall production increased. Natural gas production in the United States overall has steadily increased since 2008. In contrast, production on federal lands declined each year from 2009 through 2017. Much of the decline can be attributed to offshore production falling by over 55%. Onshore production declines were less steep. Based on the federal government's 2008 inter-agency Phase III report, 113 million acres of onshore federal lands were open and accessible for oil and gas development and about 166 million acres were off-limits or inaccessible. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM\u2014a land and mineral managing agency within the Department of the Interior) says it is addressing public concerns (including legal challenges) prior to a lease sale at a higher rate than in the past. Congressional debate has been ongoing for decades over how much federal land should be available for energy development or other uses and how much should be set aside (e.g., off limits or restricted) for conservation and environmental concerns. There has been recent controversy over revoking or modifying previously withdrawn areas. Another issue that Congress is addressing (for onshore federal lands) is streamlining the processing of applications for permits to drill (APDs). Some Members contend that this would be one way to help boost energy production on federal lands and would be consistent with the Trump Administration's energy policy. Critics, including other Members of Congress and environmental groups, argue that the streamlining proposals would limit public input into land use decisions and possibly overlook important environmental impacts."
