    "content": "Indian Tribal Surface Transportation Act of 2001 - Amends the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) to prohibit the Secretary of Transportation from distributing the obligation authority for Federal-aid highway and highway safety construction programs for FY 2002 and 2003 with respect to amounts authorized for Indian reservation roads under the Federal Lands Highways Program. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a demonstration project under which all funds made available for Indian reservation roads and highway bridges located on such roads shall be made available to an Indian tribal government, upon its request, for contracts and agreements for planning, research, engineering, and construction of any highway, road, bridge, parkway, or transit facility that provides access to or is located within the reservation or community of the Indian tribe. Deems an Indian tribe eligible to participate in the Indian reservation roads program to be a State eligible for: (1) safety incentive allocations to assist Indian communities in developing innovative programs to promote increased seat belt use rates. And (2) safety incentive grant funding to assist such communities in the prevention of the operation of motor vehicles by intoxicated persons."
