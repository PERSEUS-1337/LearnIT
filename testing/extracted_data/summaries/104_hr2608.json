    "content": "Health Care Consumer Protection Act of 1995 - Requires health insurers to provide notice regarding the extent of plan coverage to enrollees annually and to potential enrollees on request. Requires that, under a health plan, the determination of what is medically necessary and appropriate for a patient be made only by a health care practitioner directly involved in the patient's care. Requires an insurer to pay for a service that is so determined if the service is covered by the plan. Mandates regulations to ensure against insurers offering monetary rewards, penalties, or inducements to a practitioner, or conditioning continued practitioner participation in the plan, on the basis of the practitioner's decisions to limit the availability of appropriate tests, services, or treatments. Imposes a civil monetary penalty for violations of this Act. Prohibits insurers from including provisions in a plan to hold itself harmless for liability. Prohibits States from establishing or enforcing standards weaker than those of this Act."
