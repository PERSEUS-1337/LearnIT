    "content": "The price of crude oil began to increase in the last quarter of 2003, and has led to the high prices observed from 2004 through 2007. The Iraq War, unexpectedly high demand growth in China, India, and the United States, and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, along with a number of other factors, all contributed to the rising price. An important result of these largely unexpected events was that the oil industry, as represented by the five major integrated oil companies doing business in the United States, experienced rapidly expanding revenues and profits. Some observers characterized these profits as \"windfall\" gains, while others pointed to the increasing scarcity and rising costs observable in the oil industry. Some saw \"price gouging\" in high gasoline prices, while others saw the market working to avoid physical supply shortages. The larger profits experienced by the oil industry and the five major integrated oil companies can be used in a variety of ways. Profits might be used to expand exploration and development of crude oil resources to expand the supply of oil. Refineries might be constructed, and technology improved at existing refineries, to expand the supply of petroleum products, most notably, gasoline. Profits might also be used to provide increased returns to the owners of the oil companies, the shareholders. This end might be accomplished through dividend payments and share repurchase plans. Profits might also be used to improve the balance sheets of the companies through debt reduction, potentially improving their financial health should they face a downturn in the market in the future. Until the effects of corporate plans that reflect a market characterized by higher oil prices can be observed, profits might tend to build up as cash reserves, as experienced by some of the five firms since 2004. How the profits generated over the past four years are used will help to determine whether oil and petroleum product markets remain tight with high prices, or whether they loosen, develop extra capacity, and lead to moderating prices. This report will be updated."
