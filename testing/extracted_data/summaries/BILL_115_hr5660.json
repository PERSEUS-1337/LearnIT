The bill defines quot, qualified small businessquot. As any business concern having 50 or fewer employees, whether or not: (1) the credit card account is in the name of an individual or a business entity, and (2) any credit transaction involving such account is for business or personal purposes. A qualified small business may elect to opt out of such coverage. A creditor is prohibited from: (1) discriminating against a qualified small business in connection with any credit card account. Or (2) requiring any qualified small business to make an opt-out election as a condition for opening a credit card account, or for providing more advantageous terms for such an account."
