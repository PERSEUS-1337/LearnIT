    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; P.L. 114-95 ), provides federal aid for elementary and secondary education. The largest ESEA program is Title I-A, Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged. As a condition of receiving Title I-A funds, states and local educational agencies (LEAs) must meet requirements related to academic standards, assessments, accountability, and reporting. Academic Standards Each state must adopt (1) challenging academic content standards in reading/language arts (RLA), mathematics, and science; and (2) achievement standards representing three levels of achievement. States must also adopt English language proficiency standards for English Learners (ELs), covering four domains: speaking, listening, reading, and writing. States may adopt alternate achievement standards for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. Academic Assessments Each state must administer academic assessments in RLA, mathematics, and science. The state is required to administer RLA and mathematics assessments in grades 3 through 8 and once in high school, and it is required to administer science assessments once in each of three grade spans (3-5, 6-8, and 10-12). Each state may assess a certain percentage of students with the most significant cognitive disabilities with an alternate assessment based on alternate achievement standards. Each state must administer an annual assessment of English proficiency to all ELs. Accountability Systems Each state must submit a plan that describes its accountability system. Accountability systems must establish long-term goals and include indicators based on these long-term goals. The indicators must include (1) student performance on RLA and mathematics assessments in all public schools and may include a measure of student growth for public high schools, (2) a measure of student growth or another indicator that allows for meaningful differentiation in school performance for all public elementary and secondary schools that are not high schools, (3) graduation rates for public high schools, (4) progress in English language proficiency by English learners in all public schools, and (5) at least one indicator of student school quality or student success that allows for meaningful differentiation in all public schools. The accountability systems must provide data for all students and allow for the disaggregation of student performance by subgroups: (1) economically disadvantaged students, (2) students from major ethnic/racial groups, (3) children with disabilities, and (4) ELs. States must establish a system of meaningfully differentiating among all public schools in the state based on established indicators. The differentiation among schools must include any school in which any subgroup is consistently underperforming. Using the system of meaningful differentiation, a state must identify schools that require comprehensive support and improvement (CSI), including (1) the lowest performing 5% of all schools receiving Title I-A funds, (2) all public high schools failing to graduate 67% or more of their students, (3) schools required to implement additional targeted support and improvement that have not improved in a state-determined number of years, and (4) additional statewide categories of schools (at the state's discretion). Additionally, states are required to identify schools for targeted support and improvement (TSI), which includes any school in which a subgroup of students is consistently underperforming. Schools may also be identified for additional targeted support and improvement (ATSI), which includes any school in which one or more subgroups performs at a level that, if reflective of an entire school's performance, would result in its identification for CSI. Report Cards Each state is required to prepare and disseminate an annual r eport card . The report card must include (1) information about the s tate's accountability system; (2) schools identified for CSI or schools implementing TSI; (3) information on student performance dis aggregated by various subgroups; (4) teacher qualifications; (5) LEA- and school-level per pupil expenditures of federal, state, and local funds; and (5) additional information related to student assessments. Each LEA that receives Title I-A funds is required to prepare and disseminate an an nual LEA report card that includ es information on the LEA and each public school served by the LEA ."
