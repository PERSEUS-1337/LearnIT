    "content": "Amends the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 to prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from authorizing a person to use any land or water in the National Wildlife Refuge System for any commercial activity conducted to provide accommodations, facilities, or services for visitors' recreational, educational, or interpretive enjoyment of System lands or waters, except under a standardized concession contract established pursuant to this Act. Excludes certain activities from coverage of such requirement, including volunteer and government activities and the operation of a bookstore in a refuge facility by a national wildlife refuge Friends organization, as well as performance of any authorized guide or outfitter services. Exempts from such standardized contract requirement administrative sites, visitor facilities, and revenue producing visitor services mandated or authorized pursuant to the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, to issue regulations that authorize a contract to use a provision other than those specified by the Secretary as part of a standardized contract, subject to certain conditions. Directs the Secretary to require in each contract provisions requiring any activity conducted in the System under the contract to be: (1) a compatible use. And (2) designed to conserve the System's natural and cultural resources, facilitate the enjoyment of System lands and waters, and enhance visitors' knowledge of the natural resources. Requires the Secretary to include in any such contract provisions that: (1) authorize the person to maintain or repair any improvement on or in such land or water that the person is authorized to use. And (2) treat costs incurred by the person for such maintenance or repair as consideration otherwise required to be paid to the United States for such use. Makes available to the Secretary for specified expenditures any amounts received by the United States as fees or other payments required under any contract for use of real property located in an area of the System, other than lands withdrawn for Native selection pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) include in the comprehensive conservation plan for each refuge a description of the activities that may be conducted in the refuge and the lands, water, and facilities of the refuge that may be used under concession contracts. And (2) report by December 31 each year to specified congressional committees on concessions activities in the System."
