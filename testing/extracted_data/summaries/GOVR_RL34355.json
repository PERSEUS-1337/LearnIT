    "content": "The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7601-612) requires federal agencies to assess the impact of their forthcoming regulations on \"small entities\" (i.e., small businesses, small governments, and small not-for-profit organizations). For example, the act requires the analysis to describe why a regulatory action is being considered; the small entities to which the rule will apply and, where feasible, an estimate of their number; the projected reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements of the rule; and any significant alternatives to the rule that would accomplish the statutory objectives while minimizing the impact on small entities. This analysis is not required, however, if the head of the agency certifies that the rule will not have a \"significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\" The RFA does not define \"significant economic impact\" or \"substantial number of small entities,\" thereby giving federal agencies substantial discretion regarding when the act's requirements are triggered. Other requirements in the RFA and elsewhere (e.g., that agencies reexamine their existing rules, develop compliance guides, and convene advocacy review panels) also depend on the whether the agencies determine that their rules have a \"significant\" impact on a \"substantial\" number of small entities. GAO has examined the implementation of the RFA many times during the past 20 years, and has consistently concluded that the lack of clear definitions for key terms like \"significant economic impact\" and \"substantial number of small entities\" have hindered the act's effectiveness. Therefore, GAO has repeatedly recommended that Congress define those terms, or give the Small Business Administration or some other federal agency the authority and responsibility to do so. In the 112th Congress, H.R. 527, the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act of 2011, proposes to (among other things) define \"economic impact\" as including indirect effects that are \"reasonably foreseeable,\" and require the chief counsel for advocacy of the Small Business Administration to issue rules governing agency compliance with the RFA. The bill would also broaden the definition of a covered rule, and would expand the use of advocacy review panels before proposed rules are published. This report will be updated as events warrant."
