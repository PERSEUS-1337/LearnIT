    "content": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), the economic stimulus legislation signed into law on February 17, 2009 (P.L. 111-5), included supplemental FY2009 discretionary appropriations for biomedical research, public health, and other health-related programs within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Generally, the appropriations are to remain available through September 30, 2010. P.L. 111-5 also incorporated new authorizing language to promote health information technology (HIT) and established a federal interagency advisory panel to coordinate comparative effectiveness research. As enacted, ARRA included $17.15 billion for community health centers, health care workforce training, biomedical research, comparative effectiveness research, HIT, disease prevention, and Indian health facilities. This report discusses the health-related programs and activities funded by ARRA and provides details on how the administering HHS agencies and offices are allocating, awarding, and spending the funds. It will be regularly updated as new information becomes available."
