    "content": "Cutting Red Tape, Green-Lighting Small Businesses Act of 2013 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an employer with not less than 2 or more than 150 employees in a calendar year a business-related tax credit for the cost of up to 5 newly-hired employees who are employed, on average, at least 30 hours per week. Makes such credit available to tax-exempt eligible small employers. Terminates such credit for wages paid after December 31, 2015. Amends the Small Business Act to direct the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to: (1) determine, for a new small business concern, what SBA applications, submissions, or other paperwork are not essential to file during the first year of operation of such small business concern, and (2) make rules for the waiver of such filings."
