Requires each locality receiving a grant for a control program to make available matching funds in an amount not less than 13 of the cost of the program, unless the Secretary waives the requirement due to extraordinary economic conditions in the locality. Permits the Secretary, acting through the Director, to make grants to localities for conducting assessments and plans for control programs, and to make grants to States for the purpose of coordinating control programs. Allows the Secretary to provide training and technical assistance to localities with respect to the planning, development, and operation of control programs and assessments and plans, either directly or through award of grants or contracts to public and private entities. Requires the Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to conduct or support research into methods to control the population of insects that transmit dangerous diseases to humans. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the Food and Drug Administration should comprehensively review its protocols and regulations for screening of blood and platelet donors and their donated specimens and report on the ability of the protocols to protect the blood supply from West Nile virus. Directs the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to: (1) revise protocols and regulations to protect the blood supply and blood supply products from the West Nile virus to the maximum extent possible. And (2) expedite review of appropriate blood screening tests for the West Nile virus."
