    "title": "AB 2838",
    "content": "Existing law sets forth the courses a pupil is required to complete while in grades 9 to 12, inclusive, in order to receive a diploma of graduation from high school. The governing board of a school district is required to adopt alternative means for pupils to complete the prescribed course of study for high school graduation. Those alternative means may include, among other things, career technical education classes offered in high schools and courses offered by regional occupational centers or programs. This bill would authorize those alternative means to include online advanced placement courses that are approved by the College Board. The bill would also authorize a school district to contract with a provider of the approved online advanced placement courses to provide the courses free of charge to its pupils. Existing law establishes a system of public elementary and secondary education in this state. Under this system, local educational agencies are authorized to operate public schools and provide instruction to pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive. This bill would express the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation relating to public elementary and secondary education in this state."
