    "content": "Concerned by reported security and counterintelligence (CI) lapses at the Department ofEnergy (DOE), Congress in 1999 established a semi-autonomous agency -- the National NuclearSecurity Administration (NNSA) -- to oversee DOE's national security-related programs. WithinNNSA, Congress established the Office of Defense Nuclear Counterintelligence to implement NNSA's counterintelligence program. Although DOE's existing Office of Counterintelligencedevelops CI policy for both agencies, it implements policy only at non-NNSA facilities. Somestudies have questioned the effectiveness of a dual office structure in combating foreign espionageand have urged the adoption of an alternative structure. Several alternative organizationalapproaches have been discussed, including the following. One approach, which DOE has initiated, merges under the control of a new DOE Office ofIntelligence and Counterintelligence DOE's Office of Intelligence, which assesses foreign nuclearweapons programs, and DOE's CI office. Under an anticipated second phase, which would requirecongressional approval, the new office would absorb NNSA's CI program. Proponents assert thatconsolidation would improve command, control, and communication. Opponents argue thatconsolidation would dilute the focus on counterintelligence at DOE's weapons labs. Under a second approach, the DOE and NNSA CI programs could be consolidated under thecontrol of the NNSA administrator. Proponents argue that a semi-autonomous agency such asNNSA, by virtue of its independence, is better able to implement CI measures than is DOE.Opponents contend that such a consolidation would undermine the effectiveness of acounterintelligence program, which they argue requires a consolidated DOE-wide program thatincludes NNSA and is under the direct control and supervision of the Energy Secretary. Under a third approach, DOE could integrate its Office of Intelligence and CI office undera new DOE intelligence agency, but allow NNSA's CI office to remain as a separate entity.Proponents argue that such an approach would not eliminate the current bifurcated structure -- apreferred outcome -- but would enhance overall communication and coordination between the twoexisting programs. Opponents counter that only way to resolve coordination and communicationproblems is to consolidate the two CI programs within DOE. A fourth approach would be to completely separate the DOE and NNSA counterintelligenceprograms. Proponents suggest that such an approach would clarify the chain of command.Opponents assert that separation could further undermine coordination and communication. A final approach would be to maintain the status quo. Proponents suggest that the currentstructure is required for counterintelligence to receive focused attention at the weapons labs. Opponents counter that dual offices are inefficient and ultimately ineffective. This report will beupdated as warranted."
