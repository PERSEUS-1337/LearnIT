    "title": "SB 1085",
    "content": "Existing law makes the Board for Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors, and Geologists responsible for the certification, licensure, and regulation of the practice of professional engineering, the practice of professional geologists and geophysicists, and the practice of professional land surveyors. Except for an applicant for a geophysicist license, existing law requires these applicants for a certificate or license to complete an examination that tests knowledge of state laws, as provided. Existing law subjects these certificates and licenses to renewal and requires the holder of the certificate or license to apply for renewal on a form prescribed by the board and pay a prescribed fee, as provided. This bill would additionally require an applicant for renewal to complete a board-administered online assessment to reinforce the certificate holder\u2019s or licenseholder\u2019s knowledge of laws applicable to his or her practice area. The bill would authorize the failure to complete the assessment within a specified period of time to be a cause for disciplinary action. The bill would prohibit the board from charging the renewal applicant a fee for the administration or development of the assessment. The bill would also require an applicant for a geophysicist license to complete an examination that tests knowledge of state laws, as provided."
