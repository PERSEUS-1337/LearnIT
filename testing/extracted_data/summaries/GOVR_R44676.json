    "content": "Education has long been considered an important part of the U.S. foreign assistance strategy. There is general agreement that education is crucial to bettering livelihoods and improving economic stability in developing countries. According to the World Bank, an increase of one standard deviation in student reading and math scores is associated with an increase of two percentage points in annual gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth. Access to and quality of education continues to pose a challenge to foreign aid donors. Approximately 263 million children and youth worldwide do not attend school. For those who attend school, the quality of education is lacking\u2014one estimate suggests that 25% of children who complete four years of primary school have not learned basic literacy and numeracy skills. Congress has played a role in education-sector assistance through authorization of education programs and annual funding of appropriations. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (P.L. 87-195, as amended) includes provisions on education assistance. Congress has also directed that specific amounts of foreign aid budgets be spent on basic and higher education purposes. In FY2016, combined U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Department of State education programming amounts to about $856 million. On September 7, 2016, the Education for All Act (H.R. 4481) was approved by the House of Representatives. Multiple U.S. departments and agencies provide education assistance to developing countries. However, three agencies\u2014USAID, the Peace Corps, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC)\u2014accounted for 92% of assistance in FY2014. USAID makes up about two-thirds of annual funding for education. It offers an array of activities aimed at improving reading skills for 100 million primary school children, improving workforce development programs to build appropriate skills to meet developing country needs, and increasing equitable access to education in crisis and conflict environments. More than one-third of Peace Corps volunteers are in the education sector, teaching students and teachers in rural communities in 45 different countries. The MCC currently conducts programs in the education sector in two countries (El Salvador and Georgia); a program in Morocco is expected to begin soon. To achieve its education development goals, the U.S. government implements different types of assistance activities, such as education management and policy reform, teacher training, developing and distributing textbooks and learning materials, improving literacy, participant training and workforce development, and school construction. In 2015, the Obama Administration launched the Let Girls Learn initiative to address the challenges girls face in educational attainment. When girls are educated, the development impact is especially strong\u2014for example, an extra year of secondary school for girls can increase future earnings by 18%. USAID, MCC, the Peace Corps, and the Department of State are participants in Let Girls Learn efforts. This report provides a descriptive profile of recent foreign aid education sector activities, outlining actors, policy, funding levels, and programs."
