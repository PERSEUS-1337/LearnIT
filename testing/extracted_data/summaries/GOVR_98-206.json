The request for Interior and Related Agencies totals $14.26 billion compared to the $13.79 billion enacted forFY1998 ( P.L. 105-83 ), an increase of $470 million. The actual increase for Title I and Title IIagencies in the FY1999 request is $1.17 billion, offset by a nonrecurring appropriation of $699million for priority land acquisitions and exchanges in Title V of the FY1998 Interior AppropriationsAct. However, the Emergency Supplemental ( P.L. 105-174 ) increased the FY1998 enacted level toa total of $14.1 billion.

On July 23, the House passed H.R. 4193 by a voteof 245-181, and increased funding by $60 million to $13.49 billion.
