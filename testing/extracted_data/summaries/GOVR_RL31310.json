    "content": "The military construction (MilCon) appropriations bill provides funding for (1) military construction projects in the United States and overseas; (2) military family housing operations andconstruction; (3) U.S. contributions to the NATO Security Investment Program; and (4) the bulk ofbase realignment and closure (BRAC)costs. On February 4, 2002, the Administration submitted a $379 billion FY2003 defense budget request. Of this, $9.0 billion was designated for accounts falling within the jurisdiction of theAppropriations Committees' subcommittees on military construction. This request wasapproximately $1.7 billion less than that appropriated for FY2002. The decrease resulted from a$2.1 billion reduction in domestic military construction that was offset somewhat by increases forfamily housing and for building at military installations overseas. The Department of Defense statedthat some projects were withheld anticipating the FY2005 base realignments and closures (BRAC)round. To offset the decrease, DOD increased its request to maintain and rehabilitate existing defenseproperty (funded from other appropriations) by approximately $677 million above the amountenacted in FY2002. $4.2 billion of this year's request is devoted to military construction projects.According to the President's current national defense budget estimate, requests for these sameaccounts are expected to rise to $12.7 billion by FY2007. Amendments to the FY2003 militaryconstruction appropriation are included in H.J.Res. 2 of the 108th Congress. In a separate action for the Defense Emergency Response Fund (DERF), the Administration requested an additional $594 million (subsequently raised to $717 million) in military constructionbudget authority.
