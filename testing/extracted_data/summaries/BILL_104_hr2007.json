    "content": "Amends Federal civil service law to provide for the continuance of civilian pay at current levels during periods of lapsed appropriations. Provides for an automatic continuing appropriation for the US Government whenever a regular appropriation bill for a fiscal year does not become law prior to the beginning of such fiscal year. Provides that such funds shall be appropriated at a rate not in excess of the lower of the rate provided for such expenditure or obligation in the corresponding appropriation Act for the preceding fiscal year or the rate provided for in the House or Senate appropriation bill for the present fiscal year. Sets forth the terms and conditions relating to such continuing appropriations. Excludes certain operations from the provisions of this Act if during the fiscal year any other provision of law: (1) makes an appropriation, makes funds available, or grants continuation authority for such project or activity for such period. Or (2) specifically prohibits funding or authority for such project or activity for such period. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop a plan for the orderly shutdown of all or any part of the Government during a period of lapsed appropriations."
