    "content": "Interstate Slamming Prevention Act of 1997 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to make telecommunications carriers that execute illegal changes in a subscriber's selection of telephone exchange or toll service liable for any fees associated with changing the subscriber back to the carrier previously selected. Subjects carriers that violate verification procedures with respect to such changes to additional fines and penalties, including a forfeiture penalty. Authorizes the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in order to provide subscribers with additional protections against such illegal changes, to require carriers to: (1) establish toll-free telephone numbers to register complaints regarding service changes. And (2) provide the FCC with information relating to such complaints. Directs the FCC to report annually to the Congress on unauthorized changes of subscribers' selections of telephone exchange or toll service."
