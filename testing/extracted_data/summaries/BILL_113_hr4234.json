Requires an individual, to be eligible to obtain such a loan repayment, to: (1) be either licensed to practice psychiatric medicine in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or enrolled in the final year of a residency program leading to a specialty qualification in psychiatric medicine that is approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. And (2) demonstrate a commitment to a long-term career as a psychiatrist in the VHA, including through a period of obligated service. Directs the Secretary to select at least 10 individuals to participate in each year of the program. Allows a loan repayment to consist of payment of the principal, interest, and related expenses of such a loan. Prohibits the Secretary from paying more than $60,000 on behalf of the individual for each year of obligated service the individual agrees to serve. Makes an individual who participates in the pilot program who fails to satisfy the service commitment liable for prorated loan repayment. Prohibits an individual who is participating in any other federal program that repays his or her educational loans from participating in the program under this Act. Directs the Comptroller General (GAO) to conduct a study of pay disparities among VHA psychiatrists."
