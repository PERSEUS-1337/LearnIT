    "title": "AB 2795",
    "content": "Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including telephone corporations. Existing law prohibits a telephone corporation selling or licensing lists of residential subscribers from including the telephone number of any subscriber assigned an unpublished or unlisted access number, as defined, without his or her written waiver of this protection. Existing law prohibits a provider of mobile telephony services, as defined, or any affiliate or agent of the provider, providing the name and dialing number of a subscriber for inclusion in a directory or directory database, from including the dialing number of any subscriber without first obtaining the express consent of that subscriber. Existing law prohibits a subscriber from being charged for making the choice to not have his or her name and mobile telephony dialing number listed in a publicly available directory assistance database. This bill would prohibit a subscriber from being charged for making a choice to not have the above information listed in a directory. The bill would additionally prohibit a subscriber from being charged for making the choice to not have his or her name and residential telephone number listed in a directory or a publicly available directory assistance database. Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission to consider and adopt a code of conduct, associated rules, and enforcement procedures to govern the conduct of electrical corporations relative to the consideration, formation, and implementation of a community choice aggregation program. Existing law requires the commission to ensure that the code of conduct, associated rules, and enforcement procedures are implemented by no later than January 1, 2013. This bill would make a nonsubstantive change to that provision."
