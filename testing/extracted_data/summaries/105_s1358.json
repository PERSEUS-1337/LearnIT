    "content": "FAA Research, Engineering, and Development Authorization Act of 1997 - Amends Federal transportation law to authorize FY 1998 appropriations for specified aviation programs. Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to establish a grant program to utilize undergraduate and technical colleges in research on subjects of relevance to the FAA. Sets forth criteria for the award of such grants. Authorizes appropriations for such grants, but limits the FY 1998 authorization for the FAA Research, Engineering, and Development account to sums specified by this Act. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the FAA should: (1) give priority to correcting all two-digit date-related problems in its computer systems to ensure its continued operation in the year 2000 and beyond. And (2) develop contingency plans for FAA systems it is unable to correct in time."
