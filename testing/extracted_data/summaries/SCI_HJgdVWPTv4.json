Width-based lookaheads have shown state-of-the-art performance in classical planning problems as well as over the Atari games with tight budgets. In this work we investigate width-based lookaheads over Stochastic Shortest paths (SSP). We analyse why width-based algorithms perform poorly over SSP problems, and overcome these pitfalls proposing a method to estimate costs-to-go. We formalize width-based lookaheads as an instance of the rollout algorithm, give a definition of width for SSP problems and explain its sample complexity. Our experimental results over a variety of SSP benchmarks show the algorithm to outperform other state-of-the-art rollout algorithms such as UCT and RTDP. Model-based lookahead algorithms provide the ability to autonomously solve a large variety of sequential decision making problems. Lookaheads search for solutions by considering sequences of actions that can be made from the current state up to a certain time into the future. For realworld applications decisions often need to be computed in real-time, requiring algorithms to perform with a restricted computational budget. Limiting search in this way can result in considering states and trajectories which do not provide useful information. To address this, lookaheads can be augmented with heuristics that estimate costs-to-go to prioritise states and trajectories, and have been shown to perform well where computation budgets are restricted BID8 .This paper is concerned with Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems which are often used to compare and evaluate search algorithms. We consider the width-based family of planning algorithms, first introduced by BID15 , which aim to prioritise the exploration of novel areas of the state space. Two width-based planners, Lipovetzky and Geffner's breadth-first search, IW(1), and the depth-first search, Rollout-IW(1) BID1 , are investigated on SSP problems. We first provide the necessary background for SSP problems and width-based algorithms, while also formalising width-based algorithms as instances of the rollout algorithm BID4 . We then show the motive to augment width-based lookaheads with cost estimates on SSP problems, define the width of SSP problems and propose a novel width-based algorithm that estimates costs-to-go by simulating a general base policy. Our experimental study shows that the algorithm compares favourably to the original Rollout-IW(1) algorithm and to other state-of-the-art instances of the rollout algorithm. MCTS approaches typically combine lookaheads and cost-togo approximations, along with statistical tests to determine what are the most promising directions and focus their sampling effort. The width-based methods described in this paper do so too, but in ways which are, at first sight, orthogonal to existing strategies. It remains an area of active research to map out exactly how the width-based methods described in this paper, and those elsewhere by BID11 too, provide alternatives to the limitations of existing MCTS approaches. Having said this, there is no general theory guiding the design of MCTS algorithms BID4 , and to avoid generating ad-hoc, problem dependent solutions involuntarily it is important to follow strict protocols that alert of potential lack of statistical significance in results, while relying on a diverse set of benchmarks that can be both easily understood, and highlight limitations of existing state-of-theart methods and overcome them."
