    "content": "Peaceful Learning Act of 2014 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to study railway noise in the United States. Requires the Secretary, by regulation, to: establish a single system of measuring railway noise that: (1) has a highly reliable relationship between projected railway noise exposure and surveyed reactions of individuals to noise, and (2) is applied uniformly in measuring railway noise near urbanized areas. Establish a single system for determining the exposure of individuals to railway noise in urbanized areas. And determine, based on the study findings, minimum standards for railway noise levels on the property of a school located in an urbanized area. Requires each rail operator to submit to DOT a noise exposure map showing any areas of nonconforming railway noise levels that: (1) adversely impact a school located in an urbanized area, and (2) are caused by operations of the rail operator. Authorizes a rail operator that submitted a noise exposure map to DOT also to submit a noise compatibility program. Authorizes the Secretary to incur obligations to make grants to specified entities for up to 80 of the costs of carrying out a project under an approved noise compatibility program. Bars admission of a noise exposure map and related information into evidence, or their use for any other purpose, in a civil action asking for relief for noise resulting from the operation of a fixed rail public transportation facility."
