    "content": "Since September 11, 2001, the effectiveness of America's communications capabilities in support of the information needs of first responders and other public safety workers has been a matter of concern to Congress. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) included sections that responded to recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission, in its report of July 2004, and by others in recent years, regarding public safety communications. Most public safety advocates consider that the communications failures following the onslaught of Hurricane Katrina demonstrate that there is much still to be done to provide the United States with adequate communications capabilities in emergencies. Senator Susan M. Collins introduced a bill (S. 3595), to reinforce the authority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including planning and organizational responsibilities for emergency communications. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act for 2007 (H.R. 5441, Representative Rogers) incorporated provisions from S. 3595 that were accepted by the Senate as S.Amdt. 4560. Many of the provisions in the agreed version of S.Amdt. 4560 were based on provisions in H.R. 5351 (Representative Reichert). The House passed H.R. 5351, the National Emergency Reform and Enhancement Act, on July 25, 2006. The appropriations bill was agreed in conference and signed by the President on October 4, 2006 (P.L. 109-295). The sections that deal with emergency communications (Title VI, Subtitle D) add substantive language for improving emergency communications to the Homeland Security Act, building on provisions included in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act. Many of the proposed bills introduced in the 109th Congress that would have aided public safety and emergency communications were written to strengthen the federal government's capabilities in responding to emergencies. Bills introduced include S. 3721 (Senator Collins); H.R. 5852 (Representative Reichert ); S. 3172 (Senator Clinton); H.R. 5759 (Representative Harris); S. 1725 (Senator Lieberman) and S. 1703 (Senator Kerry). The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-171) includes provisions for up to $1 billion for interoperable communications, as well as for improvements in 911 and emergency alert systems. H.R. 5252 as amended in committee by the Senate, re-titled the Advanced Telecommunications and Opportunities Reform Act, includes detailed language on the dispersal of funds designated for interoperable communications, including 911. This report has been updated to cover key events through December 31, 2006. It is a reference document, only."
