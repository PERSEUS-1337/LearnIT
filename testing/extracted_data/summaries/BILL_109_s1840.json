    "content": "Safety Net Inpatient Drug Affordability Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to expand the discount drug program to include any inpatient or outpatient drug purchased by qualified hospitals without a group purchasing arrangement. Requires such hospitals to provide the state with a rebate on the estimated annual costs of single source, innovator multiple source, and noninnovator multiple source drugs provided to Medicaid recipients for inpatient use. Sets forth a method for calculating the amount of such rebate. Allows critical access hospitals that do not obtain covered outpatient drugs through a group purchasing organization or other group purchasing arrangement to participate in the discount drug program."
