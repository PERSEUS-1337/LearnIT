Limits certain obligations for specified departments, agencies, international organizations, and funds to 20 of the amount that would have been made available to satisfy such obligations if such limit had not been reached. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, during any funding gap, to make emergency appropriations: (1) to continue to provide pay and allowances to members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including the reserve components thereof, who perform active service. And (2) for such amounts as the President certifies to Congress as are necessary to carry out vital national security priorities. Requires the President to submit a specified prioritization report to Congress."
