    "title": "AB 607",
    "content": "Existing law, the Real Estate Law, provides for the licensure and regulation of real estate brokers by the Real Estate Commissioner. Existing law requires a real estate broker who accepts funds belonging to others in connection with a transaction to deposit all those funds in either a neutral escrow depository, into the hands of the broker\u2019s principal, or into a trust fund account, as specified. This bill would authorize certain persons, including, among others, a real estate salesperson licensed to the broker to withdraw funds from a trust fund account of the broker if specifically authorized in writing. The bill would authorize an unlicensed employee of the broker to withdraw funds from the broker\u2019s trust fund account if the broker has fidelity bond coverage equal to the maximum amount of the trust funds to which the unlicensed employee has access to at any time. The bill would authorize this bond to have a deductible of up to 5 of the coverage amount, if the employing broker has evidence of financial responsibility and require financial responsibility to be a separate fidelity bond coverage or a cash deposit adequate to cover the amount of the fidelity bond deductible, as specified, or any other evidence of financial responsibility approved by the commissioner. The bill would prohibit an arrangement from relieving the persons authorized by a broker or officer from responsibility or liability in handling trust funds in the broker\u2019s custody, as specified."
