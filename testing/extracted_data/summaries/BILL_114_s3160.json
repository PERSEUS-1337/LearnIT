The State Department must report annually on: (1) every security violation, including unauthorized transfers of classified information into electronic systems, transmissions, or storage not certified for handling classified information. And (2) its justification for failing to terminate an employee who commits a violation after having committed previous security violations during the prior 10 years or to request a Federal Bureau of Investigation review of such a violation. State Department employees holding security clearances are subject to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security's quarterly collection of random samples of their emails to detect classified information spillage. The State Department must submit a plan to train State Department employees to: (1) identify classified information in materials subject to Freedom of Information Act requests, (2) ensure that intelligence community officials have an opportunity to make classification determinations on information potentially originating with the intelligence community, and (3) certify annually that they have archived their emails and documents in accordance with federal law."
