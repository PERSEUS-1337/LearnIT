    "content": "The global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is affecting communities around the world and throughout the United States, with case counts growing daily. Containment and mitigation efforts by federal, state, and local governments have been undertaken to \"flatten the curve\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, to slow widespread transmission that could overwhelm the nation's health care system. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA, P.L. 116-127 ) was enacted on March 18, 2020. It is the second of three comprehensive laws enacted in March specifically to support the response to the pandemic. The FFCRA, among other things, increases appropriations to the Department of Defense, the Indian Health Service, the Department of Health and Human Services Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, and the Veterans Health Administration for testing and ancillary services associated with the SARS-Co V-2 virus, that virus that causes COVID-19 disease. Beginning on the date of enactment through any portion of the COVID-19 public health emergency (declared pursuant to Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act), the FFCRA provides payment for or requires coverage of testing for the COVID-19 virus, and items and services associated with such testing, such as supplies and office visits, without any cost sharing, for individuals who are covered under Medicare, including Medicare Advantage, traditional Medicaid, CHIP, TRICARE, Veterans healthcare, the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program, most types of private health insurance plans, the Indian Health Service, and individuals who are uninsured (as defined under FFCRA). It prohibits private health insurance plans and Medicare Advantage plans from employing utilization management tools, such as prior authorization, for the COVID-19 test, or the visit to furnish it. In addition, FFCRA provides for an increase to all states, the District of Columbia, and territories in the share of Medicaid expenditures financed by the federal government, subject to specific requirements. It provides additional Medicaid funding to territories. FFCRA modifies requirements related to waiving certain Medicare telehealth restrictions during the emergency. Finally, FFCRA waives liability, with a narrow exception, for manufacturers, distributors, or providers of specified respiratory protective devices used for COVID-19 response."
