    "content": "The overthrow of Haiti's first democratically elected president in September 1991 propelledHaiti into its worst crisis since protests brought down the 29-year dictatorship of the Duvalier familyin 1986. The leaders of the coup faced stronger international sanctions than did previous coupleaders in Haiti, largely because a democratic government was overthrown. For more than three years, the regime resisted international demands that PresidentJean-Bertrand Aristide be restored to office. U.S. policy consisted of pressuring the de facto Haitiangovernment to restore constitutional democracy to Haiti. Measures included: cutting off assistanceto the Haitian government; imposing trade embargoes, as called for by the Organization of AmericanStates (OAS) and the United Nations (U.N.); supporting OAS and U.N. diplomatic efforts; andimposing sanctions targeted at the leadership blocking Aristide's return. On September 18, 1994, when it learned that a U.S. military intervention had been launched,the military regime signed an agreement with the United States providing for Aristide's return. Italso called for the immediate, unopposed entry of U.S. troops, a legislative amnesty for the military,and the resignation of the military leadership. Under the protection of some 20,000 U.S. troops, President Aristide returned to Haiti onOctober 15, 1994, calling for reconciliation and an end to violence. On March 31, 1995, havingdeclared that a \"secure and stable environment\" had been established, the United States transferredresponsibility for the mission to the U.N. During this period, the main U.S. foreign policy concern was the restoration of thedemocratic process to Haiti. Closely related to this was the issue of Haitians attempting to flee tothe United States by boat. Congressional concerns focused on human rights, Haitian migration,socioeconomic conditions, and drug trafficking."
