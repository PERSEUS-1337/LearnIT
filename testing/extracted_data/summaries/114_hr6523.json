    "content": "Safe Transfer Act This bill amends the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 by prohibiting federal funds for any institution of postsecondary education that fails to disclose to other institutions information related to campus sexual assault on the transcript of: (1) a student who violated the institution's rules or polices with respect to sex offenses, or (2) a student who is accused of sex offenses in a pending disciplinary proceeding. The disclosure requirement terminates five years after a disciplinary proceeding is completed, or one year after the initiation of a proceeding if it is still pending. The student who is subject to the disciplinary proceeding must be notified of the disclosure and be allowed to inspect and copy the disciplinary proceeding, which does not include the name of any other student, such as a victim or witness. The student must also be given the opportunity to write a statement to accompany the disclosure."
