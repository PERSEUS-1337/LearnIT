In this paper, we advocate for and experimentally investigate the use of logit regularization techniques as an adversarial defense, which can be used in conjunction with other methods for creating adversarial robustness at little to no cost. We demonstrate that much of the effectiveness of one recent adversarial defense mechanism can be attributed to logit regularization and show how to improve its defense against both white-box and black-box attacks, in the process creating a stronger black-box attacks against PGD-based models.\n Neural networks, despite their high performance on a variety of tasks, can be brittle. Given data intentionally chosen to trick them, many deep learning models suffer extremely low performance. This type of data, commonly referred to as adversarial examples, represent a security threat to any machine learning system where an attacker has the ability to choose data input to a model, potentially allowing the attacker to control a model's behavior.Today, adversarial examples are typically created by small, but carefully chosen transformations of data that models are otherwise high-performant on. This is primarily due to the ease of experimentation with existing datasets BID4 , though the full threat of adversarial examples is only limited by the ability and creativity of an attacker's example generation process.Even with the limited threat models considered in current research, performance on adversarially chosen examples can be dramatically worse than unperturbed data -for example, white-box accuracy on adversarially chosen examples for the CIFAR-10 image classification task BID10 ) is lower than 50%, even for the most robust defenses known today BID12 BID9 , while unperturbed accuracy can be as high as 98. 5% Cubuk et al. (2018) .Current defenses against adversarial examples generally come in one of a few flavors. Perhaps the most common approach is to generate adversarial examples as part of the training procedure and explicitly train on them (\"adversarial training\"). Another approach is to transform the model's input representation in a way that thwarts an attacker's adversarial example construction mechanism. While these methods can be effective, care must be taken to make sure that they are not merely obfuscating gradients BID1 . Last, generative models can be built to model the original data distribution, recognizing when the input data is out of sample and potentially correcting it BID18 BID16 . Of these, perhaps the most robust today is adversarial logit pairing BID9 , which extends the adversarial training work of BID12 by incorporating an additional term to make the logits (pre-softmax values) of an unperturbed and adversarial example more similar.In this work, we show that adversarial logit pairing derives a large fraction of its benefits from regularizing the model's logits toward zero, which we demonstrate through simple and easy to understand theoretical arguments in addition to empirical demonstration. Investigating this phenomenon further, we examine two alternatives for logit regularization, finding that both result in improved robustness to adversarial examples, sometimes surprisingly so -for example, using the right amount of label smoothing BID21 can result in greater than 40% robustness to a projected gradient descent (PGD) attack BID12 on CIFAR-10 while training only on the original, unperturbed training examples, and is also a compelling black-box defense. We then present an alternative formulation of adversarial logit pairing that separates the logit pairing and logit regularization effects, improving the defense. The end result of these investigations is a defense that sets a new state-of-the-art for PGD-based adversaries on CIFAR-10 for both white box and black box attacks, while requiring little to no computational overhead on top of adversarial training. In this work, we have shown the usefulness of logit regularization for improving the robustness of neural networks to adversarial examples. We first presented an analysis of adversarial logit pairing, the current state-of-the-art in adversarial defense, showing that roughly half of its improvement over adversarial training can be attributed to a non-obvious logit regularization effect. Based on this, we investigated two other forms of logit regularization, demonstrating the benefits of both, and then presented an alternative method for adversarial logit pairing that more cleanly decouples the logit pairing and logit regularization effects while also improving performance.By combining these logit regularization techniques together, we were able to create both a stronger defense against white-box PGD-based attacks and also a stronger attack against PGD-based defenses, both of which come at almost no additional cost to PGD-based adversarial training. We also showed the surprising strength of label smoothing as a black-box defense and its corresponding weakness to only highly-optimized white-box attacks.We anticipate that future work will push the limits of logit regularization even further to improve defenses against adversarial examples, possibly using more techniques originally devised for other purposes BID14 . We also hope that these investigations will yield insights into training adversarially-robust models without the overhead of multi-step adversarial training, an obstacle that has made it challenge to scale up adversarial defenses to larger datasets without a sizable computational budget."
