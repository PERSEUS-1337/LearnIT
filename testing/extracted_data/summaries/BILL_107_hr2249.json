    "content": "Gasoline Access and Stabilization Act of 2001 - Amends the Clean Air Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate regulations for reformulated and oxygenated gasoline sold for use in all States that: (1) require such gasoline to comply with a national formula. And (2) prohibit the sale in any State of any such gasoline that does not comply with the formula. Allows reformulated gasoline approved by the Administrator for a State for which a waiver is in effect to satisfy this Act's requirements. Allows a State Governor to elect to have an area within the State, or the entire State, treated as a covered area for purposes of reformulated gasoline requirements, without regard to existing opt-in requirements. Prohibits States and localities, after December 31, 2004 , from prescribing or enforcing a control of any characteristic of a gasoline or additive that is not identical to EPA regulations. Prohibits, after September 1, 2006, the manufacture or introduction into commerce of motor vehicle diesel fuel that contains a concentration of sulfur exceeding 15 parts per million or fails to meet a cetane minimum index of 40 and a maximum aromatic content of 35 volume percent."
