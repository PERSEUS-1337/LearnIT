    "title": "AB 451",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes a city or county, by ordinance or resolution, to find and declare that there are privately owned and maintained offstreet parking facilities within the city or county that are generally held open for use of the public for purposes of vehicular parking and requires, upon enactment of the ordinance or resolution, that specified traffic laws apply, including those related to basic speed law, reckless driving, and speed contests and exhibitions of speed, except as specified. This bill would authorize a city or county to include in that ordinance or resolution authorization for the operator of a privately owned and maintained offstreet parking facility to regulate unauthorized parking in that facility. The bill would, if a city or county has exercised that authority and unauthorized parking is regulated in a privately owned and maintained offstreet parking facility, require the owner or operator of the facility to post language, as specified, stating that violators may be subject to a parking invoice fee, and include in a parking fee invoice instructions that describe the manner in which to contest the parking fee invoice and prohibit the owner or operator from filing with, or transmitting to, the Department of Motor Vehicles a parking fee invoice, as specified. The bill would also require a city or county that authorizes private parking regulation to include, in its ordinance or resolution, specified provisions, including those related to dispute resolution."
