    "content": "This report summarizes findings from a congressional staff trip to Taiwan (Republicof China), December 10-17,2000, with supplemental material from other sources. The staff delegation met with Taiwan government andmilitary officials, political party representatives,leading private citizens, and United States officials and business persons in Taipei, the capital. The findings includemajor factors that have shaped relationsbetween Taiwan and the People's Republic of China (PRC) since Chen Shui-bian's election as President of Taiwanin March 2000. Taiwan's democratization andthe growth of cross-strait economic ties have, in some respects, helped to stabilize relations in the short run. Taiwan's legislative elections in December 2001 willlikely focus largely on domestic issues; its impact on cross-strait relations is uncertain. Chinese nationalism andmilitary modernization in the PRC will likelycontinue to contribute to tensions. This report will not be updated."
