    "title": "An act to amend Sections 69510, 69511, and 69511.5 of the Education Code, relating to student financial aid.",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the Student Aid Commission as the primary state agency for the administration of state-authorized student financial aid programs available to students attending all segments of postsecondary education. Existing law requires the commission to include 2 members, appointed by the Governor, who are students enrolled in a California postsecondary educational institution. This bill would instead require the commission to include 4 student members, one from each of the following: the University of California, the California State University, the California Community Colleges, and a California private postsecondary educational institution. The bill would make conforming and nonsubstantive changes. This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 69511 of the Education Code proposed by AB 2154 that would become operative if this bill and AB 2154 are both enacted and this bill is enacted last."
