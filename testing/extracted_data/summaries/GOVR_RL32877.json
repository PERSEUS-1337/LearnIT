    "content": "Over the next few months, Congress will be considering Administration requests for morethan half a trillion dollars for national defense, including money in the regular defense budget forFiscal Year 2006 (FY2006), supplemental appropriations for costs of ongoing military operationsin FY2005, and, possibly, additional funds in FY2006 to provide a \"bridge\" until future supplementalappropriations for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are available. The Administration's defense budget plans face some potentially daunting, though by nomeans unprecedented, long-term challenges, including: Will projected budget deficits constrain the Administration's long-term defensebudget plans? Should Congress try to restrain further increases in military personnel pay andbenefits, as some Administration officials have argued, in view of dramatic increases in personnelcosts in recent years? What are the implications of continuing, perennial increases in defenseoperation and maintenance costs for the affordability of the Administration'splan? How affordable is the Administration's long-term plan for modernizing militaryforces in light of substantial and continuing cost growth in many systems? How might recent widely discussed changes in defense strategy affect prioritieswithin the defense budget? This report reviews long-term trends in the defense budget and discusses the challengesCongress and the Defense Department may face in trying to adjust plans in the face of fiscalconstraints. It will be updated periodically to reflect congressional action and new information."
