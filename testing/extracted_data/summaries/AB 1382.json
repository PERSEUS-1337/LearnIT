    "title": "An act to amend Section 368 of the Penal Code, relating to crimes.",
    "content": "Existing law makes it a crime for a person who knows or reasonably should know that a person is an elder or dependent adult to willfully cause or permit the person or health of the elder or dependent adult to be injured, or willfully cause or permit the elder or dependent adult to be placed in a situation in which his or her person or health is endangered. Existing law specifies penalties for a person who violates any provision of law proscribing theft, embezzlement, forgery, fraud, or specified identify theft provisions of law when the victim is an elder or a dependent adult. This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions."
