    "content": "Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to redefine anabolic steroid to mean any drug or hormonal substance, chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone . Sets forth a list of substances included as anabolic steroids, including tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), androstenedione, and specified related chemicals. Authorizes the Attorney General, upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to exempt from regulation under the Controlled Substances Act any compound, mixture, or preparation that contains any anabolic steroid that is intended for administration to a human being or an animal and that does not present any significant potential for abuse because of its concentration, preparation, formulation, or delivery system. Directs the US Sentencing Commission to review the Federal sentencing guidelines with respect to offenses involving anabolic steroids and consider amending such guidelines to provide for increased penalties. Directs the Secretary to: (1) award grants to enable public and nonprofit private entities to carry out science-based education programs in elementary and secondary schools to highlight the harmful effects of anabolic steroids. (2) give preference for such grants to programs helping athletes to avoid steroid use. And (3) ensure that the National Survey on Drug Use and Health includes questions concerning the use of anabolic steroids. Authorizes appropriations."
