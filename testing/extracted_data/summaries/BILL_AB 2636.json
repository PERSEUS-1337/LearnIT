    "title": "AB 2636",
    "content": "Under existing law, a certified copy of a birth, death, marriage, or military service record may only be supplied by the State Registrar, local registrar, or county recorder to an authorized person, as defined, who submits a written, faxed, or digitized image request accompanied by a notarized statement sworn under penalty of perjury that the applicant is an authorized person. This bill would, until January 1, 2021, if the request for a certified copy of a birth, death, or marriage record is made electronically, authorize the official to accept an electronic acknowledgment verifying the identity of the applicant using a multilayered remote identity proofing process. If an applicant\u2019s identity cannot be established electronically, the bill would require the applicant to include with his or her request a statement of identity notarized pursuant to existing law. The bill would require the verification to comply with specified provisions and protect the personal information of the applicant and guard against identity theft. The bill would require the State Registrar and any city or county that fulfills electronic requests without a notarized statement of identity to report to the Attorney General and the Legislature on or before January 1, 2019, regarding the number and types of requests and the availability of consumer protection mechanisms, as specified. This bill would authorize the State Department of Public Health to implement its procedures relating to electronic verification through an all-county letter or similar instruction from the State Registrar without taking regulatory action. The bill would specifically authorize the department to accept an electronic verification of identity accompanied by an electronic statement sworn under penalty of perjury for the above purposes. By expanding the crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
