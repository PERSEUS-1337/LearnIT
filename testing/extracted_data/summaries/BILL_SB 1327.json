    "title": "SB 1327",
    "content": "Existing law requires the Board of State and Community Corrections to collect and maintain available information and data about state and community correctional policies, practices, capacities, and needs, as specified. Existing law requires the board, in consultation with certain individuals, including a county supervisor or county administrative officer, a county sheriff, and the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, to develop definitions of specified key terms in order to facilitate consistency in local data collection, evaluation, and implementation of evidence-based programs. This bill would enact the Criminal Justice Reinvestment Assessment Grant Program of 2016. The bill would require the grant program to be administered by the Board of State and Community Corrections for the purpose of establishing and implementing reporting systems to identify and expand programs that provide proven, evidence-based, local programming opportunities for the successful reintegration of offenders into society. The bill would authorize the board to award grants to assist counties with the creation or expansion of infrastructure that allows each county to consistently collect and report specified criminal justice information. The bill would require each local community corrections partnership, on or before June 1, 2016, to report to the board on the county\u2019s capacity to collect and report the data required. The bill requires the board to review each assessment and to prioritize and award grants to the counties. The bill would require each county to report specified data to the board, on or before January 1, 2017, and annually thereafter, pertaining to offenders sentenced as felons to serve in local correctional facilities and felons released from prison to community supervision. The bill would require the board to summarize these data and report the summaries to the Governor and the Legislature, on or before May 15, 2017, and annually thereafter. By imposing data collection and reporting duties on local governments, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would appropriate an unspecified sum to the board for purposes of funding the grants. The bill would state findings and declarations of the Legislature regarding criminal justice realignment. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions. The bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute. Existing law defines grand theft as the wrongful taking of money, labor, or property of a value exceeding $950, except as specified. This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to that provision."
