    "content": "Existing law establishes the State Department of Education, under the administration of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and assigns to the department numerous duties relating to the financing, governance, and guidance of the public elementary and secondary schools in this state. This bill would establish a grant program under the administration of the department for full-time, credentialed teachers, as defined. The bill would provide that, commencing with the 2017\u201318 school year, and each school year thereafter, a full-time, credentialed teacher who has completed his or her first school year of full-time teaching as of the end of that school year would receive a grant of $1,000 during the next school year. The bill would provide that, commencing with the 2018\u201319 school year, and each school year thereafter, a full-time, credentialed teacher who has completed 2 school years of full-time teaching as of the end of that school year would receive a grant of $1,000 during the next school year. The bill would further provide that, commencing with the 2019\u201320 school year, and each school year thereafter, a full-time, credentialed teacher who has completed 3 school years of full-time teaching as of the end of that school year would receive a grant of $2,500 during the next school year. The bill would also provide that, commencing with the 2020\u201321 school year, and each school year thereafter, a full-time, credentialed teacher who has completed 4 school years of full-time teaching as of the end of that school year would receive a grant of $2,500 during the next school year. The bill would also provide that, commencing with the 2021\u201322 school year, and each school year thereafter, a full-time, credentialed teacher who has completed 5 school years of full-time teaching as of the end of that school year would receive a grant of $5,000 during the next school year. The bill would further provide that, commencing with the 2022\u201323 school year, and each school year thereafter, a full-time credentialed teacher who has completed 6 or more school years of full-time teaching would receive a grant of $5,000 during the next school year. The bill would specify that a qualifying teacher may receive grants under these provisions in multiple school years, but would prohibit a teacher from receiving more than one grant in a school year under these provisions. The bill would require the department to submit a report to the Legislature on or before July 1, 2022, on the effectiveness of the grant program. The Personal Income Tax Law allows various credits against the taxes imposed by that law. This bill would, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, allow a credit under the Personal Income Tax Law in an amount equal to $5,000 to a qualified taxpayer, as defined to include specified full-time teachers. This bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to provide that the credit amount in excess of tax liability would be refundable in those years in which an appropriation for that purpose is made by the Legislature and includes findings relating to that appropriation. This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."
