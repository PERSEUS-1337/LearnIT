    "content": "On June 6, 2003, the United States and Chile signed a long anticipated bilateral free tradeagreement (FTA) in Miami, Florida, concluding a 14-round negotiation process that began onDecember 6, 2000. Following hearings before the House Ways and Means, Senate Finance, and bothJudiciary Committees, the House passed the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Implementation Act( H.R. 2738 ) by a vote of 270 to 156, followed by the Senate one week later, 66 to 31. President George W. Bush signed the bill into law on September 3, 2003 ( P.L. 108-77 ) and it willtake effect on January 1, 2004. Chile has now joined a select group of only five other countries that have an FTA with theUnited States (Canada, Mexico, Jordan, Singapore, and Israel). Although many point to the potentialfor trade growth between the two countries, the significance of this FTA runs deeper: 1) it is the firstagreement with a South American country; 2) it is an agreement with one of the most open andreformed economies in Latin America; 3) it exemplifies how trade policy issues, including thosewith social and economic implications, can be resolved between a small developing country and alarge developed one; and, 4) it may prove to be a step toward completing the Free Trade Area of theAmericas. The FTA allows increased market access, with 85% of bilateral trade in consumer andindustrial products eligible for duty-free treatment immediately, and other product tariff rates beingreduced over time. Some 75% of U.S. farm exports will enter Chile duty-free within four years andall duties will be fully phased out within 12 years after implementation of the agreement. For Chile,95% of its export products gain duty-free status immediately and only 1.2% fall into the longest12-year phase-out period. Other critical issues resolved included environment and labor provisions,more open government procurement rules, increased access for services trade, greater protection ofU.S. investment and intellectual property, and creation of a new e-commerce chapter. The traderemedies chapter is limited to safeguards so there is no change to the antidumping and countervailingduty options currently available to both countries. The bilateral negotiation was a challenging exercise for both countries and although abroad-based agreement was struck, a few issues were controversial for many Members of Congress,as expressed at hearings in both the House and the Senate. Overall, because there are now multipleFTAs being contemplated, there was an overarching concern that provisions in the Chile FTA mightbecome a \"template\" for others that follow. In particular, attention turned to language governingdispute resolution treatment of labor provisions, and financial transfers (capital controls), as well asthe temporary entry for business persons. These and other issues are discussed in this report, whichprovides background and analysis on Chile's economy, trade relations, and the bilateral FTA. Because Congress has completed action on this FTA and it has become law, this is the final versionof the report."
