    "content": "Satellite Access to Local Stations Act - Amends Federal copyright law to cite circumstances under which the secondary transmission by a satellite carrier of a primary transmission of a television broadcast station into the station's local market shall be subject to statutory licensing. Sets forth reporting requirements for a satellite carrier whose secondary transmissions are subject to such licensing requirements. Precludes any royalty obligation for such secondary transmissions. States that noncompliance with such reporting requirements by a satellite carrier of a television broadcast station is actionable as an act of infringement and fully subject to copyright remedies. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 regarding the retransmission of broadcasting station signals. Prohibits cable systems and other multichannel video programming distributors from retransmitting a broadcasting station's signal without the station's express consent. Directs the Federal Communications Commission to commence a rulemaking proceeding to revise regulations governing the exercise by television broadcast stations of the right to grant retransmission consent. Prescribes requirements for the carriage of local television signals by satellite carriers, including: (1) carriage obligations. (2) carriage of all local television stations on contiguous channels and in a nondiscriminatory manner on any navigational device, on-screen guide, or menu, (3) compensation for carriage, and (4) remedies for failure to meet obligations."
