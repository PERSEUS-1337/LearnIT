    "content": "For well over a decade international terrorism has been a major concern of the U.S. Intelligence Community. Collection assets of all kinds have long been focusedon Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Intensive analytical expertise has been devoted to determining such groups'memberships, locations, and plans. Intelligence agencies had been acutely aware of the danger for years. In February 2001, Director of CentralIntelligence (DCI) George Tenet publicly testified toCongress that \"the threat from terrorism is real, it is immediate, and it is evolving.\" Furthermore, \"[Osama] binLadin and his global network of lieutenants andassociates remain the most immediate and serious threat.\" Nevertheless, the Intelligence Community gave no specific warning of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Although all observers grant that terrorist groups are verydifficult targets and that undetected movements of small numbers of their members in an open society cannotrealistically be prevented, serious questions remain. An extensive investigation by the two intelligence committees of the September 11 attacks was undertaken in 2002. Although the final report is not yet public, thecommittee members found that the Intelligence Community, prior to 9/11, was neither well organized nor equippedto meet the challenge posed by globalterrorists focused on targets within the U.S. A separate independent commission was established in early 2003 totake another look at the events precedingSeptember 11. Counterterrorism is highly dependent upon human intelligence (humint), the use of agents to acquire information (and, in certain circumstances, to carry outcovert actions). Humint is one of the least expensive intelligence disciplines, but it can be the most difficult andis undoubtedly the most dangerous forpractitioners. Mistakes can be fatal, embarrass the whole country, and undermine important policy goals. Congressmakes decisions regarding the extent towhich the importance of humint outweighs the inherent risks. Countering terrorism requires close cooperation between law enforcement and intelligence agencies; some terrorists will need to be brought to justice in courts,but others are dealt with by military forces or covert actions. In recent years, important steps have been taken toencourage closer cooperation between the twocommunities, but some believe terrorist acts may have been facilitated by continuing poor information exchangesbetween intelligence and law enforcementagencies and by blurred lines of organizational responsibility. Congress will oversee the implementation of theevolving relationship that affects importantprinciples of law and administration, and may choose to modify the roles and missions of intelligence and lawenforcement agencies. Military operations to counter terrorism are dependent on the availability of precise, real-time intelligence to support bombing campaigns using precision guidedmunitions. The linkage between sensor and \"shooters\" will be crucial as will access to global geospatial databases. As defense transformation progresses,Congress will also oversee the development of increased intelligence support to military operations including,especially, counterterrorist missions."
