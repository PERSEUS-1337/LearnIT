    "content": "The physical design of a robot and the policy that controls its motion are inherently coupled. However, existing approaches largely ignore this coupling, instead choosing to alternate between separate design and control phases, which requires expert intuition throughout and risks convergence to suboptimal designs. In this work, we propose a method that jointly optimizes over the physical design of a robot and the corresponding control policy in a model-free fashion, without any need for expert supervision. Given an arbitrary robot morphology, our method maintains a distribution over the design parameters and uses reinforcement learning to train a neural network controller. Throughout training, we refine the robot distribution to maximize the expected reward. This results in an assignment to the robot parameters and neural network policy that are jointly optimal. We evaluate our approach in the context of legged locomotion, and demonstrate that it discovers novel robot designs and walking gaits for several different morphologies, achieving performance comparable to or better than that of hand-crafted designs. An agent's ability to navigate through and interact with its environment depends not just on its skill at planning and controlling its motion, but also on its physical design. Different physical designs are inherently better suited to different tasks and environments. By making appropriate choices during fabrication, mechanical elements can be designed to improve robustness to non-idealities such as errors in perception, delays in actuation, etc., and indeed, make control problem an easier one to solve. At the same time, robots that take different forms may find completely different control strategies to be optimal to complete the same task. Therefore, the physical and computational design of an agent are inherently coupled, and must ideally be jointly optimized if the robot is to successfully complete a task in a particular environment.Consider the development of a legged robot for locomotion. Variations in physical design will require changes to the joint torques in order to preserve a particular locomotion behavior (e.g., a heavier torso requires greater torque at the ankle), and will likely result in completely different walking gaits, even when the morphology is preserved. In fact, some changes to design may render locomotion impossible for the target operating environment (e.g., a robot with long feet may be unable to locomote up an incline). Meanwhile, careful choice of bipedal design enables passive walking BID20 BID9 BID4 . It is therefore beneficial to not simply consider the robot's design or gait to be fixed, but to optimize both jointly for the target environment and task. Similar co-design can be beneficial in other settings-for example for the control policy and physical characteristics of digits in robotic grippers for grasping.While a robot's physical design and the corresponding control policy are inherently coupled, most existing methods ignore this coupling, instead choosing to alternate between separate design and control phases. Existing approaches that jointly reason over design and control BID7 BID12 BID46 assume knowledge of an accurate model of the robot dynamics and require expert supervision (e.g., to provide a suitable initial design and guide the optimization process). However, these restrictive assumptions limits their applicability to a handful of specific settings, and often yield solutions heavily influenced by expert intuition.In this work, we seek a general approach-one that can optimize a robot's physical characteristics jointly with controllers of a desired complexity (Fig. 1) , that can be applied to general tasks in some DISPLAYFORM0 Figure 1: Our algorithm learns a robot's physical design jointly with the control policy. Here we show the learned designs evolving over time for the Hopper (top left), the Walker2d (top right) and the Ant (bottom), each with the default Roboschool design for comparison. Scale is fixed for each robot. Note that these designs correspond to modes of the distribution over robot designs that our algorithm maintains during training.given environment, and that can explore the joint search space of physical design and computational control in a purely data-driven way, without a model of the robot dynamics and independent of the biases of expert intuition. We develop this approach in the context of determining the physical parameters of an articulated agent-the lengths and thicknesses of each limbs in a given morphologythrough joint training with a neural network for control, with the objective of achieving locomotion. Our method maintains a distribution over these physical parameters, and simultaneously trains the parameters of this distribution with those of a neural network controller, using deep reinforcement learning. In this way, we pursue a design distribution and control policy that are jointly optimal for the given task and environment. Experimental results show that starting from random initializations, our approach is able to find novel designs and walking gaits that match or exceed the performance of manually designed agents. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to successfully carry out such a joint optimization of design and control in a completely model-free manner. We proposed what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first model-free algorithm that jointly optimizes over the physical design of a robot and the corresponding control policy, without any need for expert supervision. Given an arbitrary morphology, our robot maintains a distribution over the robot design parameters and learns these parameters together with a neural network controller using policy gradient-based reinforcement learning. This results in an assignment to the policy over robot parameters and the control policy that are jointly optimal. We evaluated our approach on a series of different legged robot morphologies, demonstrating that it results in novel robot designs and walking gaits, achieving performance that either matches or exceeds that of manually defined designs.Our findings suggest several avenues for future work. The most direct is extending the current approach to find optimized designs for uneven terrain, the presence of obstacles, changes in slope, variations in friction, etc. We are also interested in extending our framework to relax the assumption that the morphology is pre-defined. Finally, we are investigating applications to different types of agents and design spaces beyond legged robots (e.g., end-effectors), and exploring appropriate stochastic parameterization for such designs."
