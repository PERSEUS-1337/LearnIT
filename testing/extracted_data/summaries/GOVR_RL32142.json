    "content": "A succinct provision in an 1866 statute known as \"R.S. 2477\" granted rights of wayacross unreserved federal lands for \"the construction of highways.\" The provision was repealed in1976 by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), an act that also protected validrights of way already established by that time. What definitions, criteria, and law should be appliedto confirm or validate these R.S. 2477 rights of way has been controversial. The issuesare important to states and communities whose highway systems are affected. The issues are alsoimportant because the rights of way may run either through undeveloped federal lands that mightotherwise qualify for wilderness designation or across lands that are now private or within federalreserves (such as parks or national forests) created after the highways might have been established. Section 315 of FLPMA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue a \"disclaimer ofinterest\" if an interest or interests of the United States in lands has \"terminated by operation of lawor is otherwise invalid.\" A disclaimer is a recordable document that can help remove a cloud fromland title because it has the same effect as if the United States had conveyed the interest in question. The Department of the Interior has finalized amendments to existing regulations on disclaimers ofinterest that allow states, state political subdivisions, and others to apply for disclaimers thatpreviously were time-barred. A recent Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Utah andthe Department of the Interior establishes an \"acknowledgment process\" whereby R.S.2477 rights of way on certain federal lands can be validated and a disclaimer to themissued by the United States. Several other states have requested negotiations to develop MOUsregarding R.S. 2477 rights of way. The disclaimer regulation changes are controversial for many reasons; one of which is thatCongress in \u00c2\u00a7 108 of P.L. 104-208 prohibited regulations \"pertaining to\" R.S. 2477 frombecoming effective without Congressional approval. The use of disclaimers to acknowledge R.S.2477 rights of way is also controversial because the criteria that will be used to determinethe validity of asserted R.S. 2477 claims are not set out, and without clearly stated criteriaand standards, it is not clear whether the terms of \u00c2\u00a7 315 have been met -- whether a disclaimableinterest of the United States has terminated or not. Most agree that a resolution of R.S.2477 validity issues is desirable, but there is disagreement on standards and on whetherand how the Congress and the courts should be involved. H.R. 1639 in the 108thCongress would authorize a process for determining the validity of R.S. 2477 claims anddefine crucial terms for those determinations. A House-passed amendment to FY2004 Interior andRelated Agencies Appropriations ( H.R. 2691 ) would have prohibited implementationof the disclaimer regulation amendments in certain federal conservation areas, but was removed inconference. This report reviews the disclaimer provision of \u00c2\u00a7 315 of FLPMA, the Utah MOU, theR.S. 2477 grant to construct highways and interpretation of it, the relationship of the newdisclaimer regulations to that statute and to the statutory prohibition against rules that \"pertain to\"R.S. 2477, and H.R. 1639. It will be updated as events warrant; see CRS Report RS21402 for information on recent events."
