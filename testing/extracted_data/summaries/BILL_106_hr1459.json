(2) the participation of small business in the programs, through outreach and assistance initiatives and program requirements that address the needs of small businesses. Authorizes the Secretary to provide for development of equivalent programs in State-plan States (under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA)). Sets forth program requirements for applications, on-site evaluations, information, and reevaluations. Exempts worksites participating in the program from inspections or investigations under OSHA, except inspections or investigations arising from employee complaints, fatalities, catastrophes, or significant toxic releases.
