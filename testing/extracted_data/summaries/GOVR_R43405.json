    "content": "Four continuing resolutions (CRs) were enacted during the FY2014 appropriations process, to provide temporary funding until the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2014, was enacted on January 17, 2014 (P.L. 113-76). The first two CRs were enacted before and during the FY2014 funding gap, which commenced on October 1, 2013, and terminated on October 17, 2013. Both of these were \"narrow\" CRs, in that they only funded certain prior year projects and activities. The first CR, the Pay Our Military Act (H.R. 3210; P.L. 113-39), was enacted on September 30, 2013. It provided funds for certain Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) activities in the absence of a general CR or annual appropriations. An additional CR was enacted during the funding gap (the Department of Defense Survivor Benefits Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014; H.J.Res. 91; P.L. 113-44), to provide appropriations for military death gratuities. The funding gap terminated on October 17, 2013, through the enactment of a \"broad\" CR that funded the previous fiscal year's projects and activities through January 15, 2014 (the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014; H.R. 2775; P.L. 113-46). The funding rate for these projects and activities was based upon the amount available under the previous year's appropriations acts, including any reductions to those amounts through provisions in those prior year acts. It also reflected the reductions that occurred pursuant to the March 1 presidential sequestration order. When accounting for the anomalies that were included in the CR, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the annualized budget authority subject to the statutory spending limits was $986.3 billion. The total amount of annualized budget authority (including spending designated for overseas contingency operations/global war on terror, continuing disability reviews and redeterminations, health care fraud abuse control, and disaster relief) was $1.088 trillion. To allow additional time to conclude the annual appropriations process, funding provided by the third CR was extended to January 18, 2014, through the enactment of a fourth CR (Making further continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2014, and for other purposes; H.J.Res. 106; P.L. 113-73)."
