    "content": "California is experiencing serious water shortages due to widespread drought. Even though much of the state is served by two large water infrastructure projects that store water for future use\u2014the federal Central Valley Project (CVP) and the State Water Project (SWP)\u2014both projects have had to reduce water deliveries to the farmers and communities that they serve. Many water users have received no water from the CVP and SWP this year and are supplementing surface water supplies with groundwater. Some water basins are experiencing overdraft of local aquifers (i.e., extracting of more ground water than will be replenished over time). The dry hydrological conditions, in combination with regulatory restrictions on water being pumped from the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers Delta confluence with San Francisco Bay (Bay-Delta) to protect water quality and fish and wildlife, have resulted in historic water supply cutbacks for senior water rights users in some areas. The effects are widespread and are being felt by many economic sectors. The extent and severity of the drought is also taking its toll on fish and wildlife resources and has increased concern for wildfires. California also experienced severe water supply shortages during a three-year drought, which lasted from 2008 \u2013 2010 and during a five-year drought from 1987 to 1992. Several bills have been introduced in the 113th Congress to address California water supply and drought in particular. This report discusses the similarities and differences between two bills that have been passed by their respective chambers: H.R. 3964, which passed the House on February 5, 2014; and S. 2198, which passed the Senate on May 22, 2014. H.R. 3964 and S. 2198 have few similarities in their specific approaches to addressing drought conditions in California; however, to different degrees, they both aim to provide more water for users that receive water from the CVP and SWP. The primary thematic similarity shared between the bills is to authorize or direct activities that would attempt to increase water supplies for users while, in some cases, decreasing or meeting the minimum water needs of the environment (e.g., fish and wildlife, and water quality). The duration of the authorization for these activities varies under each bill. In some cases, activities aimed to increase water supplies are authorized in times of a declared drought or decreased water supplies, and in other cases, these activities are authorized permanently without conditions. The differences between the bills hinge on the approach the bills take towards allocating water supplies for users. S. 2198 would authorize the approval of projects and actions to maximize water supplies for users within existing laws and regulations; whereas H.R. 3964 would amend laws, and in some cases, pre-empt state and federal law to re-allocate water supplies and achieve its objectives. A short-term issue for Congress is how to address the drought, and in particular, demands for more water from the CVP and SWP without jeopardizing the continued existence of several fish species, degrading water quality, or overriding state water rights allocations. A long-term issue for Congress is how to improve the supply and reliability of federal water deliveries and stabilize, and potentially restore, the aquatic ecosystems upon which water and power users and diverse economies depend upon. Efforts to address the long-term water and environmental needs of the state have been focused, in part, on the Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP). However, the BDCP is controversial and if approved is expected to take years, if not decades, to implement. In the meantime, questions continue to be raised about annual Bay-Delta pumping levels and their adequacy in providing water supply to state and federal contractors and their effects on fish and wildlife, particularly on threatened and endangered species."
