    "content": "The Lisbon Treaty, the latest institutional reform treaty of the European Union (EU), went into effect on December 1, 2009. The document was signed by the heads of state or government of the 27 EU member countries in December 2007. The process of completing ratification by each individual member country lasted nearly two years, concluding with ratification by the Czech Republic on November 3, 2009. The Lisbon Treaty reforms the EU's governing institutions and decision-making process to enable the EU to operate more effectively. The treaty grew out of the proposed \"constitutional treaty\" that foundered after French and Dutch voters rejected it in referendums in 2005. The Lisbon Treaty seeks to give the EU a stronger and more coherent voice with the creation of a new position, President of the European Council. The first holder of this office is former Belgian Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy. He chairs the activities of the 27 EU heads of state or government, working to facilitate consensus and ensure policy continuity, and acting as the group's spokesman. Additionally, the Lisbon Treaty seeks to increase the weight and visibility of the EU on the world stage by creating the new position of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Catherine Ashton (from the United Kingdom), formerly European Commissioner for Trade, serves in this position. She will be supported by a newly created EU diplomatic corps, the European External Action Service. The treaty also makes changes to the EU's internal decision-making mechanisms. These changes have been designed to streamline the process and make it less susceptible to gridlock or blockage. Additional reforms attempt to address concerns about democratic accountability and transparency in EU policy-making by granting a greater role to the directly elected European Parliament, national parliaments, and citizens' initiatives. Experts assert that the Lisbon Treaty could have positive implications for U.S.-EU relations. Some observers believe that it could eventually allow the EU to take on a more active and effective role as a U.S. partner in tackling global challenges. The adoption of the treaty could also help make the EU more amenable to future enlargement, including to the Balkans and perhaps Turkey, which the United States supports. On the other hand, some observers doubt how much of an impact the Lisbon Treaty will have, and some skeptics maintain that a stronger EU poses a potentially detrimental rival to NATO and the United States. This report provides information on the Lisbon Treaty and possible U.S.-EU implications that may be of interest to the 112th Congress.
