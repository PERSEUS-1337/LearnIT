(2) a cardiomyopathy risk assessment worksheet for use by parents, guardians, or other caregivers. (3) guidelines regarding the placement of automated external defibrillators in schools and child care centers, (4) training information on defibrillators and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. And (5) recommendations for how schools and child care centers can develop and implement a cardiac emergency response plan. The CDC must update these materials and resources as necessary and, in support of such effort, HHS is encouraged to establish an advisory panel and engage in a memorandum of understanding or cooperative agreement with a national nonprofit advocacy organization with expertise in cardiomyopathy."
