The President signed the bill on November 24, 2003( P.L. 108-384 ). On September 30, just in time for the new fiscal year, the President signed H.R. 2658 , the FY2004 DOD Appropriations Act ( P.L. 108-87 ), completing action onFY2004 defense appropriations. The recently enacted FY2004 DOD authorization bill provides a total of $401.3 billion fordefense programs, including funds in the DOD and military construction appropriations as well asseveral other defense-related programs funded in other appropriations measures. The totalauthorized for these defense and defense-related programs that make up the national defense functionis $1.5 billion above the Administration's request and $9.3 billion above the FY2003 enacted level. The conference version of the FY2004 DOD authorization is the culmination of months ofnegotiation about several contentious issues: Buy American provisions, the Air Force's controversialtanker lease proposal, a new concurrent receipt benefit for military retirees, a new National SecurityPersonnel System, a new health benefit for reservists, and special exemptions for DOD to certainenvironmental regulations. Substantial differences about these issues between the houses and withthe Administration had stymied completion of the authorization bill. In conference, Buy American restrictions mandating that DOD rely exclusively on U.S.suppliers for certain items were dropped in favor of provisions that require DOD to assess the U.S.industrial base and possibly provide incentives to certain U.S. producers. In the case of the Boeing767 tanker aircraft, DOD accepted a Senate-proposed compromise allowing them to lease 20 and buy80 rather than lease100 aircraft. After the Administration dropped its veto threat, Congress passed a new concurrent receiptbenefit that is expected to provide about 200,000 military retirees with both their military retirementand disability benefits, reversing a prohibition in effect for over 100 years. DOD also received newauthority to design and implement its own civilian personnel system and new exemptions to certainenvironmental rules. The bill also provides access to DOD's TRICARE health care to unemployed, non-deployed reservists and maintains current higher levels of imminent danger pay and familyseparation allowance for eligible military personnel through December 2004. The FY2004 DOD Appropriations Act provides appropriations totaling $368.7 billion forthe defense programs it covers. That total is $3.5 billion below the Administration's request and $4.0billion above last year's enacted level. The programmatic impact of the cut is cushioned, however,because the bill receives credit for $3.5 billion rescinded from funds provided in the $62.6 billionFY2003 supplemental appropriations bill that Congress approved in April 2003.
