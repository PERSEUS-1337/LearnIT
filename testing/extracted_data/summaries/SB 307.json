    "title": "An act to amend Section 136.2 of the Penal Code, relating to restraining orders.",
    "content": "Existing law requires, in all cases in which a criminal defendant is convicted of specified crimes, including any crime for which the defendant must register as a sex offender, the court to consider issuing an order, valid for up to 10 years, restraining the defendant from any contact with the victim. Existing law authorizes the order to be issued by the court regardless of whether the defendant is sentenced to state prison or a county jail, or whether the imposition of sentence is suspended and the defendant is placed on probation. This bill would additionally authorize the order to be issued by the court regardless of whether the defendant is subject to mandatory supervision."
