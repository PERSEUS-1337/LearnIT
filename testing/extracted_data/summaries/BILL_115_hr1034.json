    "content": "Zero Waste Development and Expansion Act of 2017 This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to award grants to local governments for developing solid waste prevention, reuse, and recycling tactics and operations. Applicants must set specific waste prevention, reuse, recycling, composting, or public education goals that will bring communities closer to zero waste. Zero waste is a goal to guide people towards emulating sustainable natural cycles, where all discarded materials are designed to become resources for others to use. The EPA must convene an annual conference for grantees and other stakeholders to learn about moving toward a zero waste goal."
