    "content": "Head Start Improvement Act of 2015 This bill amends the Head Start Act to replace the existing Head Start program with block grants to states and Indian tribes for prekindergarten (pre-K) education. Instead of providing direct financial assistance to Head Start agencies, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall allot block grant funds for pre-K education among eligible states and Indian tribes in accordance withnbsp. Their relative proportions of children, age five and younger, from low-income households. nbsp, Grant recipientsnbsp, shall use the grant funds to: (1)nbsp, award subgrants to eligible entitiesnbsp, that providenbsp, pre-K education programs, (2) administer such programs. And (3) provide technical assistance, oversight, monitoring, research, and training. Under current law, HHS is authorized to designate, monitor, and establish standards fornbsp, Head Start agencies. The bill instead shiftsnbsp, pre-K program oversight and controlnbsp, to states and Indian tribes, whichnbsp. Shall have full flexibility to use grant funds to finance the pre-K programs ofnbsp, their choice. nbsp, In addition,nbsp. Grant recipients may use grant funds to establish portable voucher systems that allow costs to be paidnbsp, for attendance atnbsp. Private pre-K education programs. Under current law, federal financial assistance for a Head Start programnbsp, is generally limited tonbsp, 80 of total program costs. The bill maintains thisnbsp, limitation bynbsp. Requiring grant recipients to provide matching funds equal to 20 of the grant amount."
