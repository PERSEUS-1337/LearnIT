Restoring Access to Medication Act of 2016 The bill repeals provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, as added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, that limit payments for medications from HSAs, medical savings accounts, and health flexible spending arrangements to only prescription drugs or insulin . Health Care Security Act of 2016 The bill modifies the rules for HSAs with respect to catch-up contributions for married couples, medical expenses incurred before an HSA is established, and contribution limits. If both spouses of a married couple have family coverage under a high deductible health plan, each spouse may make catch-up contributions to the same HSA. If an HSA is established within 60 days of the beginning of coverage under a high deductible health plan, any distribution from the HSA used to pay a qualified medical expense incurred during that 60-day period after the health coverage began is excludible from gross income. The bill increases the maximum contribution limits for HSAs to equal the maximum for the sum of the annual deductible and out-of-pocket expenses that may be required to be paid for covered benefits under a high deductible health plan. Protecting Taxpayers by Recovering Improper Obamacare Subsidy Overpayments Act The bill eliminates the limitation on the increase in tax imposed upon certain low-income families for advance payments of the tax credit for health insurance premium assistance that exceed the allowable amount of such credit."
