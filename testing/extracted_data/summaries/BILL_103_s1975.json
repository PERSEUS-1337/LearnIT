    "content": "Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic Building Restoration and Preservation Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to make grants to historically black colleges and universities for the preservation and restoration of historic buildings and structures on their campuses. Requires a grantee to covenant, for the period of time specified by the Secretary, that: (1) no alteration shall be made to the property with respect to which the grant is made without the concurrence of the Secretary. And (2) reasonable public access to such property shall be permitted for interpretive and educational purposes. Limits the Federal share of a grant for a building or structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places to 50 percent of the cost of the grant project. Authorizes the Secretary to waive the cost-share requirement if an extreme emergency exists or if such a waiver is in the public interest to assure the preservation of historically significant resources. Directs the Secretary to make such grants from amounts made available to carry out the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. Limits amounts made available for this Act for FY 1995 through 1998. Earmarks funds for FY 1995 for grants to: (1) Fisk University.
