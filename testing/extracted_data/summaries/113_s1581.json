    "content": "Survivors of Military Sexual Assault and Domestic Abuse Act of 2013 - Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide counseling and care and services for sexual trauma to active-duty members of the Armed Forces. Prohibits such a member from being required to obtain a referral before receiving such services. Directs the Secretary to develop and implement a screening mechanism to be used when a veteran seeks VA health care services to detect if such veteran has been a victim of domestic abuse in order to improve such treatment and assess the prevalence of such abuse in the veteran population. Requires the Secretary to report to the congressional veterans committees on treatment and services available from the VA for male veterans who experience military sexual trauma compared to such treatment and services available to female veterans who experience such trauma. Directs the Department of Veterans Affairs-Department of Defense Joint Executive Committee, annually for a six-year period, to report to the defense and appropriations committees on the transition from the Department of Defense (DOD) to the VA of treatment of individuals who have experienced military sexual trauma or domestic abuse."
