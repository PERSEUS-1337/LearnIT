    "content": "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill in the past included funding for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), most of the Department of Energy (DOE), and a number of independent agencies. For FY2006, the Congress reorganized the appropriations subcommittees and the content of the various appropriations bills to be introduced. In the case of Energy and Water Development, the only changes were the consolidation of DOE programs that had previously been funded by the Interior and Related Agencies bill. That organization was followed by the Administration in submitting its FY2007 budget request in February 2006. Key budgetary issues involving these programs include the need to balance efforts by the Army Corps of Engineers to prevent storm damage in Louisiana with the rest of the agency's portfolio of authorized projects (Title I); support of major ecosystem restoration initiatives, such as Florida Everglades (Title I) and California \"Bay-Delta\" (CALFED) (Title II); funding for the proposed national nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, and proposals to store nuclear spent fuel temporarily (Title III: Nuclear Waste Disposal); and the Administration's proposed Global Nuclear Energy Partnership to supply plutonium-based fuel to other nations (Title III: Nuclear Energy)."
