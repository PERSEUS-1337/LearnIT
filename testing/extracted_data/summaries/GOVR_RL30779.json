    "content": "Across-the-board income tax cuts were an important feature of H.R. 1836 , the comprehensive tax cut of 2001. Distributional issues have been centralto the analysis of across-the-board tax cuts (although issues of growth and simplification are also of concern). Someplans have been described as primarilybenefitting the middle class; some plans, or even the same plans, have been criticized as unduly favoring highincome taxpayers. The distributional measure used to characterize a tax cut affects how the cut is perceived. Absolute measures include tax cut per return and the distribution of therevenue cost: these measures show most tax cuts to favor high income individuals because income (and income taxliability) is concentrated in higher incomeclasses. A variety of relative distributional measures are used, but the measure that indicates the change in income inequality is percentage change in disposable income. Using this measure, recent proposed tax cuts have had very different effects on inequality. A 10% cut in tax rates,for example, increases income inequality,causing disposable income in the top 20% of the population to rise by around 5%, while causing disposable incomein the bottom 80% to rise by less than 1%.(Note that outside of a refundable credit, however, the bottom fifth of the distribution would have a very small taxcut from any tax change because tax liability istypically zero in that income category.). A one percentage point cut in rates still increases income in higherbrackets by slightly more, but has a much smallereffect on increasing income inequality. To make a tax cut neutral or decrease inequality would require (using ratecuts) a larger percentage point cut in the lowerbrackets. An expansion of bracket widths would have no effect on the 70% of taxpayers who fall in the lowestbrackets; an increase in the standard deduction,however, would benefit these taxpayers. (These findings would be affected by the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)and capital gains tax rates.) The 2001 tax cut, when permanently in place, would reduce the progressivity of the tax system and increase income inequality by this relative measures. Tax cuts favoring higher income individuals are more likely to reduce marginal tax rates, which can have benefits for growth and efficiency. Cutting onlyindividual tax rates can worsen distortions (such as those between corporate and non-corporate investments) orundermine desirable subsidies. There are concernsabout using tax cuts for counter-cyclical purposes because of ; however, tax cuts used in this fashion are mosteffective if they can be reflected in withholding andif they provide benefits to lower and moderate income individuals (rather than high income individuals). Tax cuts in general do not have important implications for simplification, although they do reduce the incentive to shelter income. They can complicate the taxlaw by increasing the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT, however. Tax cuts could also be focused on changesthat provide simplification (e.g. eliminatingphase outs and raising the exemption levels of the AMT). This report will be updated to reflect legislativedevelopments."
