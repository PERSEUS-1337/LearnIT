    "content": "The military construction (MilCon) appropriations bill provides funding for (1) military construction projects in the United States and overseas; (2) military family housing operations andconstruction; (3) U.S. contributions to the NATO Security Investment Program; and (4) the bulk ofbase realignment and closure (BRAC) costs. Funding for rebuilding parts of the Pentagon destroyed in the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, is likely to be included in military construction appropriations. Preliminary estimates of thetotal cost vary from $100 million to $1 billion. Part of the emergency funding legislation, H.R. 2888 ( P.L. 107-38 ), passed by Congress Friday, September 14, will be allocatedfor this rebuilding. To date, $173.4 million in contracts have been awarded for emergency structuralassessment, repair, and restoration to the Pentagon, with provision for additional awards at 60-dayintervals. On June 27, the Administration submitted a $343.5 billion amended FY2002 defense budget request. $10.0 billion of this is intended for military construction. Of that amount, $4.6 billion isintended for the active services and DOD; $0.6 billion for the National Guard and Reserves; $4.1billion for construction and operation of military family housing; $0.2 billion for the NATO SecurityInvestment Program, and $0.5 billion for BRAC. Separate versions of appropriations bills (bothgranting $10.5 billion in new budget authority) have been passed by Congress ( H.R. 2904 and S. 1460 ). A key issue in Congress is funding for quality of life construction. Military work facilities, particularly those overseas and those by the National Guard and Reserves, are perceived by manyas being deteriorated and underfunded. Recently, Congress has often appropriated more inconstruction funds than the Administration has requested. Congress has similarly augmented budgetrequests for military family housing appropriations. The FY2002 military construction bill exceedsthe requested amount by 5.3%. An additional key issue is the future of the Efficient Facilities Initiative (EFI). DOD recommended legislation on August 3 to initiate a worldwide assessment of military installationrequirements, based on the results of the current Quadrennial Defense Review, and a subsequentround of base closures and realignments. The legislation as submitted would permanently authorizethe service secretaries to convey base property to local or state government or private enterprise andlease back what is necessary for military use. This is modeled on a demonstration project begunduring FY2000 at Brooks Air Force Base, Texas. If enacted, the EFI is likely to affect the future needfor military construction and operations and maintenance funding. Other issues include the provision of construction contingency funds in budget requests (to enable uninterrupted construction), an understanding of the total costs of DOD real property (spreadacross several budget accounts), and recent conflicts between Administration and congressionalconstruction priorities and funding. Conference action on the bill is pending. Key Policy Staff * FDT = Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division of the Congressional Research Service"
