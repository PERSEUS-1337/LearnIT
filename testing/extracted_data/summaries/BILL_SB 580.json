    "title": "SB 580",
    "content": "Existing law declares the intent of the Legislature to preserve, upgrade, and expand the supply of housing to persons and families of low or moderate income, through the sale of specified surplus residential property owned by public agencies. Existing law establishes priorities and procedures that any state agency disposing of that surplus residential property is required to follow. Under existing law, specified single-family residences must first be offered to their former owners or present occupants, as specified. If the property is not sold to a former owner or present occupant, existing law requires that the property be offered to a housing-related private or public entity at a reasonable price for either limited equity cooperative housing or low and moderate income rental or owner-occupied housing, as specified. This bill would authorize a local housing authority to purchase and rehabilitate surplus residential property within Pasadena, South Pasadena, Alhambra, La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, and the 90032 postal ZIP Code. The local housing authority would be required to dedicate any profits realized from a subsequent sale to the construction of affordable housing. The bill would also require that, prior to offering the property to a housing-related private or public entity as specified above, that property that is a historic home, as defined, be first offered to a housing-related public entity or a nonprofit private entity dedicated to rehabilitating and maintaining the historic home for public and community access and use. Existing law requires the Department of Transportation to deposit proceeds from sales of surplus residential property into the SR-710 Rehabilitation Account, a continuously appropriated fund, to be distributed, as specified, exclusively to fund projects located in Pasadena, South Pasadena, Alhambra, La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, and the 90032 postal ZIP Code. This bill would specifically require the department to deposit proceeds from the sale of surplus residential property from the department to a new owner in the SR-710 Rehabilitation Account. This bill would establish the Affordable Housing Trust Account within the Housing Finance Fund and require the net proceeds from a subsequent market sale of surplus residential property sold pursuant to these provisions at an affordable or reasonable price, as specified, be deposited in this account. The bill would continuously appropriate funds in this account to the California Housing Finance Agency to carry out specified activities for the benefit of persons residing exclusively within Pasadena, South Pasadena, Alhambra, La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, and the 90032 postal ZIP Code. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for Pasadena, South Pasadena, Alhambra, La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, and the 90032 postal ZIP Code. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."
