Treasury shall: deposit all money received under such asset confiscation requirements into the Confiscated Assets Fund, and sell any non-monetary assets received under the bill and deposit the proceeds into the Fund. Treasury shall establish the Confiscated Assets Fund, which shall be made available to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to make grants under the Urban Area Security Initiative . The Government Accountability Office shall study how Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control can better track frozen assets, manage data related to them, and improve reporting to Congress about them across all sanctions programs the Office of Foreign Assets Control administers."
