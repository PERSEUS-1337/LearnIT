    "title": "SB 1111",
    "content": "Existing law vests control of the state park system with the Department of Parks and Recreation and authorizes the department to enter into an operating agreement with a qualified nonprofit organization for the development, improvement, restoration, care, maintenance, administration, or operation of a unit or units, or portion of a unit, of the state park system, subject to certain conditions and requirements. This bill would repeal those provisions on January 1, 2025. The bill would also provide that an operating agreement may not eliminate jobs maintained under a memorandum of understanding. This bill would authorize the department to enter into a statewide agreement with a park support organization, as defined, to facilitate the implementation of reforms recommended by the Parks Forward Commission and to develop and secure expertise, services, resources, and projects that are not readily available to the state park system for specified purposes relating to the funding, visitation, use, facilities, and staffing of state parks, as provided. The bill would require the department to take specified actions relating to the development and implementation of such an agreement and would authorize the Director of Parks and Recreation and the Director of Finance, or their designees, to serve as ex officio, nonvoting members of the park support organization\u2019s board of directors. The bill would require the department, if it enters into an agreement with a park support organization, to collaborate with the park support organization to develop an annual list of strategic initiatives and projects that are statewide priorities for the state park system and the park support organization and that the park support organization will undertake in partnership with the department. The bill would authorize the department to enter into supplementary agreements and leases, as provided, with the park support organization and receive donations of projects, services, and funds to be used for the support of the state park system, subject to the review and approval of the statewide agreement or substantial amendment of such an agreement by the Director of Finance. Existing law authorizes the department to lease, for any use, all or any portion of any parcel of real property acquired for state park system purposes, if the director finds that the use would be compatible with the use of the real property as a unit or part of a unit and with the sound management and conservation of resources within the unit, but prohibits the department from entering into a lease that extends beyond 10 years unless certain conditions for the review and approval of a proposed lease as part of the annual budget process are met. Existing law imposes similar review and approval requirements of operating leases or agreements that are expected to generate over $500,000 in annual gross revenues. This bill would revise certain of those conditions for the review and approval of a proposed lease or operating lease or agreement by the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, as specified. The bill would make those conditions applicable only to operating leases or agreements that are expected to generate over $1,000,000 in annual gross revenues."
