    "content": "Voluntary Environmental Audit Protection Act - Provides that an environmental audit report constituting part of an environmental audit shall not be subject to discovery and admitted into evidence in civil or criminal actions or administrative proceedings before a Federal court or agency or under Federal law. Makes such exclusion inapplicable to information: (1) required to be collected or reported to a regulatory agency pursuant to specified Federal environmental laws. (2) obtained by observation, sampling, or monitoring by a regulatory agency. Or (3) obtained from a source independent of the audit. Makes such exclusion inapplicable if: (1) the owner or operator of the facility that initiated the audit expressly waives the right of the person or government entity that prepared the report to exclude such material from the evidence or proceeding. (2) after an in camera hearing, the appropriate Federal court determines that the environmental audit report provides evidence of noncompliance with a covered environmental law and efforts to achieve compliance were not pursued with diligence. Or (3) the person or government entity is asserting the exclusion for a fraudulent purpose. Places the burden of proof regarding the applicability of the exclusion on the person invoking its protection. States that a person or entity that performs an audit may not be required to give testimony in a Federal court or an administrative proceeding of a Federal agency without his or her consent. Sets forth conditions under which disclosures of information relating to a covered Federal law to an appropriate Federal or State agency are considered voluntary. Considers such disclosures involuntary if the person or government entity making the disclosure has committed repeated violations of Federal or State laws relating to environmental quality due to separate events giving rise to the violations during the three-year period prior to disclosure. Presumes disclosures to be voluntary if the person or entity provides information supporting a claim that the information is a voluntary disclosure and makes such persons or entities immune from administrative, civil, or criminal penalties for violations unless such presumption is rebutted. Places the burden of rebuttal on Federal agencies."
