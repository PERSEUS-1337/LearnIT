    "content": "State Wildlife Management Act of 2011 - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) to prohibit any gray wolf from being treated as an endangered species or threatened species or from being subject to such Act if the wolf: (1) is located in any state within the range of the Northern Rocky Mountain distinct population segment or anywhere in Nevada or Colorado and there are at least 450 gray wolves in such segment. (2) is located in any state within the range of the Western Great Lakes distinct population segment and the number of gray wolves within such state's boundaries is at least 1,200 for Minnesota, 150 for Michigan, and 150 for Wisconsin. Or (3) is located in Arizona or New Mexico if the combined total number of gray wolves in those states is at least 100. Provides for: (1) state regulation of gray wolves if the population meets or exceeds the applicable number for such state. Or (2) treatment as an endangered or threatened species if the number of gray wolves is less than that number until the Secretary determines that the number of gray wolves in such state equals at least that number during two consecutive years. Defines gray wolf as any taxonomic group traditionally associated with the gray wolf, including Canus lupus, Canus lupus lycaon, and Canus lupus baileyi, regardless of specific taxonomy of any particular gray wolf variety as a species, subspecies, or other designation."
