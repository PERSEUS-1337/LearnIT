    "title": "An act to add\nSection 510.5 to the Labor Code, relating to\nemployment\nChapter 10 (commencing with Section 31420) to Division 21 of, and to repeal Sections 31422 and 31423 of, the Public Resources Code, relating to coastal wildlife protection\n.",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the State Coastal Conservancy and prescribes the membership and functions and duties of the conservancy with respect to preservation of coastal resources in the state. This bill would enact the Safe Water and Wildlife Protection Act of 2016, which would require the State Water Resources Control Board, until January 1, 2020, to establish and coordinate the Harmful Algal Bloom Task Force, comprised of specified representatives of state agencies, including the conservancy, in consultation with the Secretary for Environmental Protection, and would prescribe the functions and duties of the task force. The bill would require the task force to review the risks and negative impacts of harmful algal blooms and microcystin pollution and to submit a summary of its findings and recommendations to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature, the Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency, and the secretary on or before January 1, 2019. The act would require the task force, before providing funding recommendations or submitting a summary of findings, to notify the public about ongoing activities and provide opportunities for public review and comment on applied research, projects, and programs. The act would authorize the conservancy, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Wildlife Conservation Board, and the State Water Resources Control Board to enter into contracts and provide grants, upon appropriation, from specified bond funds available under the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, the California Sea Otter Fund, or from other appropriate funds for applied research, projects, and programs, recommended by the task force, aimed at preventing or sustainably mitigating harmful algal blooms, including cyanotoxins and microcystin pollution in the waters of the state. Existing law, with certain exceptions, establishes 8 hours as a day\u2019s work and a 40-hour workweek, and requires payment of prescribed overtime compensation for additional hours worked. Existing law establishes the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement in the Department of Industrial Relations for the enforcement of labor laws, including overtime payment. Under existing law, a person who violates the provisions regulating work hours is guilty of a misdemeanor. This bill would establish a rebuttable presumption that an employee is exempt from overtime pay if the employee earns total gross annual compensation of at least $100,000 and regularly performs any of the exempt duties or responsibilities of an executive, administrative, or professional employee as set forth in the Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders. This bill, to rebut the presumption, would require evidence that the employee did not earn total gross annual compensation of at least $100,000, that the employee did not earn at least $1,000 per week, as specified, or that the employee did not regularly perform at least one exempt duty of an executive, administrative, or professional employee. This bill would only apply to an employee whose primary duty includes office or nonmanual work, as described."
