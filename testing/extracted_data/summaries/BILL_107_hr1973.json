    "content": "Integrity of the United States Courts Act of 2001 - Amends the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act to permit a party or person to file with the US Court of International Trade an appeal of a determination of a binational panel, alleging that a member of a binational panel is guilty of gross misconduct, bias, or serious conflict of interest, or that the panel seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure or exceeded its own authority, and such actions have materially affected panel determinations with respect to antidumping and countervailing duty cases and threaten the integrity of the panel review process. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to grant the US Court of International Trade jurisdiction over the review of a final determination of such a binational panel. Declares that the amendments made by this Act with respect to antidumping and countervailing duty law shall apply to goods from a NAFTA country ."
