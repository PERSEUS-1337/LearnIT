Those who are concerned about Russia's motives andgoals in the region see an independent Ukraine as a guarantee against the revival of a Russian empirethat would threaten the security of central Europe. Conversely, analysts worry that a weak or unstableUkraine could fall under Russian domination or become a focus of conflict between Russia and theWest. The spillover effects of crime, illegal immigration and other problems from an unstableUkraine could hurt other countries in the region. Ukraine continues to undergo a difficult transitionfrom communism to democracy and a free market economy. It is also undergoing a related searchfor its international identity, whether as an independent central European state or as a state closelyaligned with Russia, with which most of Ukraine has close linguistic, cultural and historic ties. A series of recent events have clouded Ukraine's relationship with the United States. In November 2000, an audio tape produced by a former bodyguard of Ukrainian President LeonidKuchma purportedly captured Kuchma's orders to top officials to neutralize independent journalistGeorgiy Gongadze, whose headless, mutilated body had been found by police. In September 2002,the United States authenticated another tape which implicated Kuchma in the possible sale ofsophisticated anti-aircraft radars to Iraq. These incidents led to a deterioration of U.S.-Ukrainianties. However, relations improved in 2003, when Ukraine deployed 1650 troops to Iraq as part ofa Polish-led peacekeeping force. However, despite recent setbacks, there is a consensus among U.S. policymakers that a strong, multi-faceted relationship with a stable, democratic, prosperous and sovereign Ukraine, integratedwith Europe and the wider world, is key to Europe's stability, a vital U.S. interest. The United Stateshas tried to bolster Ukraine with political support and over $3 billion in U.S. aid from FY 1992 toFY 2001, although aid has declined in recent years. U.S. policy has had notable successes,particularly in the areas of security policy and nuclear safety. Achievements since Ukraine'sindependence in political and economic reform have been significant, but U.S. policymakers haveoften been frustrated by Ukraine's slowness to reform and fight corruption. Congressional supporthas remained consistent despite Ukraine's troubles. Ukraine's current problems raise important issues for U.S. policy. One problem is how to deal with President Kuchma and the opposition to his rule. More broadly, the United States must decidehow to better support the building of the political, economic and social infrastructure that willprovide a foundation for democracy, rule of law and a market economy in the long term. Anotherproblem U.S. policymakers face is how to support Ukraine's sovereignty and independence andpromote closer ties with the West. Efforts could include helping reduce Ukraine's energydependency on Russia, and promoting greater security ties with the United States and NATO, in theface of possible Russian pressure against such a relationship."
