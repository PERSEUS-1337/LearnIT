    "content": "Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit any person from introducing a prescription drug into interstate commerce or delivering such a drug for introduction into commerce pursuant to a sale if: (1) any part of the sales transaction for the drug is conducted through an Internet site. And (2) such site, or any other Internet site used by such person for purposes of sales of a prescription drug, fails to meet specified requirements regarding inclusion of a page providing the identities of the seller and the persons serving as pharmacists or medical consultants and the States in which the seller and such persons are authorized to dispense drugs or provide consultations. Provides that a State that has in effect requirements for Internet sites that are no less stringent and that has adequate procedures for their enforcement shall have primary enforcement responsibility for any violation involving such a purchase made from within the State."
