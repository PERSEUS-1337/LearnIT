    "content": "Existing law imposes a 40-foot limitation on the length of vehicles that may be operated on the highways, with specified exemptions. Existing law exempts from this limitation a bus, except a schoolbus, operated by a public agency or a passenger stage corporation, as defined, used in transit system service if the bus is equipped with a folding device attached to the front of the bus that is designed and used exclusively for transporting bicycles, the device does not materially affect efficiency or visibility of vehicle safety equipment, and the length of the bus, exclusive of that device, does not exceed 40 feet in length. In addition, existing law prohibits, among other things, the above-described device from extending more than 40 inches from the front body of the bus when fully deployed. This bill would instead prohibit the above-described device from extending more than 40 inches from the front of the bus. Existing law provides a procedure that is generally applicable for a city to sell its real property. Existing law also establishes specific procedures for the sale of public utility property owned by a municipal corporation with certain provisions applicable to the sale of property of a water utility. This bill would authorize the City of Montebello to sell all or part of its water utility pursuant to the procedures that are generally applicable to a sale of real property by a city, if certain requirements are met. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City of Montebello. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."
