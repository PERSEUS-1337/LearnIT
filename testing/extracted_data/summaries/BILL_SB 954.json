    "title": "SB 954",
    "content": "Existing law requires, except for public works projects of $1,000 or less, that workers employed on public works be paid not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for work of a similar character in the locality that the public work is performed, and not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for holiday and overtime work fixed, as prescribed. Existing law requires the Director of Industrial Relations to determine the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for work of a similar character in the locality in which the public work is to be performed, and the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for holiday and overtime work. Existing law includes, as per diem wages, employer payment for industry advancement and collective bargaining agreements administrative fees, provided that these payments are required under a collective bargaining agreement pertaining to the particular craft, classification, or type of work within the locality or the nearest labor market area at issue. Per diem wages also include employer payments for other purposes similar to those specified, including, but not limited to, certain apprenticeship or other training programs, to the extent that the cost of training is reasonably related to the amount of the contributions, and worker protection and assistance programs or committees established under the federal Labor Management Cooperation Act of 1978, to the extent that the activities of the programs or committees are directed to the monitoring and enforcement of laws related to public works. This bill would instead require per diem wages to include industry advancement and collective bargaining agreements administrative fees if the payments are made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement to which the employer is obligated. The bill would also exclude from per diem wages, if the payments are not made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement to which the employer is obligated, employer payments for other purposes similar to certain apprenticeship or other training programs, worker protection and assistance programs or committees established under the federal Labor Management Cooperation Act of 1978, and industry advancement and collective bargaining agreements administrative fees, as specified. Existing law provides that employer payments are credits against the obligation to pay the general prevailing rate of per diem wages. Credit is prohibited for benefits required to be provided by other state or federal law or for payments made to monitor and enforce laws related to public works if those payments are not made to a program or committee established under the federal Labor Management Cooperation Act of 1978. This bill would also prohibit credit for payments for industry advancement and collective bargaining agreement administrative fees if those payments are not made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement to which the employer is obligated."
