    "content": "Supporting Families in Substance Abuse Treatment Act This bill amends part E of title IV of the Social Security Act to provide that the removal and foster care placement of a child shall meet the requirements for foster care maintenance payments on the child's behalf if the child has been placed with a parent residing in a licensed residential family-based treatment facility. Placement with such a parent shall meet these requirements only if: the placement recommendation is specified in the child's case plan before the placement. The treatment facility offers, as part of substance abuse treatment, parenting skills training, parent education, and individual and family counseling. And this training and counseling are delivered under an organizational structure and treatment framework that involves understanding, recognizing, and responding to the effects of all types of trauma, and in accordance with recognized principles of a trauma-informed approach and trauma-specific interventions, to address the consequences of trauma and facilitate healing. The bill specifies the amount the state may receive for a child placed with a parent who is in a licensed residential family-based treatment facility for substance abuse."
