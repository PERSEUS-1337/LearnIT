    "title": "AB 581",
    "content": "Existing law, the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, approved by the voters as Proposition 1 at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election, authorizes the issuance of general obligation bonds in the amount of $7,545,000,000 to finance a water quality, supply, and infrastructure improvement program. The act provides that it is the intent of the people that, to the extent practicable, a project supported by the funds made available by the act will include signage informing the public that the project received funds from the act. This bill would require certain recipients of funding pursuant to the act to post signs acknowledging the source of funds in accordance with guidelines that the Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency would be required to develop. The annual Budget Act appropriates funds to state agencies for operations as part of their respective agency budgets. Existing law requires the Department of General Services to report to the Legislature, as specified, on expenditures for seismic hazard abatement for state buildings and facilities, in connection with the Earthquake Safety and Public Buildings Rehabilitation Bond Act of 1990. This bill would enact the State Facilities Renewal Bond Act of 2016, which, if adopted by the voters at the June 7, 2016, statewide primary election, would authorize the issuance of bonds in the amount of $2,000,000,000, pursuant to the State General Obligation Bond Law, to finance deferred maintenance on state-owned property, subject to appropriation by the Legislature in the annual Budget Act."
