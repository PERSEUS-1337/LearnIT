    "content": "Presidential Innovation Fellows Program Act of 2016 This bill establishes in the General Services Administration (GSA) the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program to enable exceptional individuals with proven track records to serve time-limited appointments in executive agencies as Presidential Innovation Fellows to address some of the most significant challenges facing the United States and improve federal efforts that would particularly benefit from expertise using innovative techniques and technology. The functions of the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program established pursuant to Executive Order 13704, as in existence on the day before enactment of this bill, shall be functions of the program established by this bill. The program shall be administered by a Director, who shall be appointed by the GSA. The director shall appoint such fellows and facilitate their placement in projects that have the potential for significant positive effects and are consistent with the President's goals. Each agency shall: (1) work with the director and the program advisory board to attempt to maximize program benefits to the agency and the government, including by identifying initiatives that will have a meaningful effect on the people served and that will benefit from involvement by a fellow. And (2) ensure that each fellow placed at the agency works closely with a responsible senior official."
