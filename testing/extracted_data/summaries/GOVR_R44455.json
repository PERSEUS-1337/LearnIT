    "content": "This report focuses on cross-cutting management issues that affect the Intelligence Community's (IC's) ability to counter \"pervasive and emerging threats\" to the United States and balance resources both appropriately and wisely. As the IC's senior manager, these issues ultimately fall within the Director of National Intelligence's (DNI's) area of responsibility. The DNI is charged with integrating the community of intelligence agencies so that they operate effectively as one team. There are no easy solutions to the challenges examined in this report. The IC's efforts to demonstrate progress are hampered by difficulties such as the IC's diffuse structure\u2014a confederation of separately managed component parts; the unique demands of operating in secret; the interrelationships between many issues; and diminishing resources. The issues selected for examination in this report were chosen because they affect a number of agencies and are widely discussed by professionals within and external to the IC (and are not so complex that they need their own separate report). 1. Budget. Are the resources in the IC budget (the national and military intelligence programs) managed and balanced appropriately to meet the needs of every agency and the IC mission as a whole? 2. Analysis. The heart and soul of the intelligence function; analysis is the responsibility of every IC agency. How to improve analysis is an enduring focus of reform efforts. 3. \"Big Data.\" The IC Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE) is a major initiative focused on many of the challenges and opportunities associated with the current ocean of available information. How well is the IC putting vast amounts of unstructured data to valuable use? 4. Diversity. New initiatives designed to improve diversity in the entire IC workforce have been a recurring theme in intelligence-related legislation and IC policy directives over the past decade. Can anything else be done? 5. Global coverage. The IC's need to prepare for and respond to any and all crises and threats\u2014worldwide\u2014is referred to as global coverage. Do expectations about what the IC can and should cover need be adjusted? 6. Continuous Evaluation (CE). The expanded use of publicly available data when reviewing the backgrounds of a security clearance holder is the new standard for all IC agencies. What is the CE issue from a privacy and civil liberties perspective? 7. Polygraphs. Although polygraphs are required by every agency, their reliability and validity are questionable. As the IC moves toward CE, are they still necessary? 8. Transparency. What more can be done IC-wide to enhance public understanding of intelligence activities through greater transparency while still protecting national security? While the eight issues are different in many ways, they are similar in that they shine a light on important questions that can be applied to any IC issue in terms of balance, best practices, integration, privacy and civil liberties, transparency, and trust."
