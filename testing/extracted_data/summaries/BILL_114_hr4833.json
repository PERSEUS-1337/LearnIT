    "content": "Food Deserts Act of 2016 This bill establishes a Department of Agriculture program to provide grants to states for revolving funds to support the establishment and operation of grocery stores in underserved communities. An underserved community is a community that has: (1) limited access to affordable, healthy foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables, in grocery retail stores or farmer-to-consumer direct markets. And (2) a high rate of hunger or food insecurity or a high poverty rate. States must use the funds to make loans to support grocery stores in underserved communities, including for: opening a store , supporting an existing store, purchasing an existing store, or supporting a store located in a community that would be underserved without the store. States may only make loans for qualified grocery stores that: emphasize unprocessed, healthful foods. Provide staple foods and a variety of raw fruits and vegetables, have a plan to keep the foods in stock. And charge prices at or below municipal averages. States must prioritize loan applications from entities that meet criteria, including: hiring workers from the underserved community, providing classes or educational information about a healthful diet, sourcing food from local urban farms and gardens, not selling alcohol or tobacco products, or demonstrating existing supply chain relationships or expertise in the grocery industry."
