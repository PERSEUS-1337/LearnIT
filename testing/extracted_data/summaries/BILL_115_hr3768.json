    "content": "Reducing Waste in National Parks Act This bill directs each regional director of a region of the National Park System (NPS) to establish a program to recycle and reduce the use of disposable plastic bottles within each NPS unit located in its region. Regional directors may eliminate the sale of water in disposable plastic bottles within their NPS units after having considered several specified factors. Where an NPS unit is not offering water for sale in disposable plastic bottles, the superintendent of the unit may continue that practice, upon submission of an evaluation of those factors. Each regional director who establishes and implements such a program shall develop for each affected NPS unit a proactive visitor education strategy to address visitor expectations of water availability and explain the rationale for the program."
