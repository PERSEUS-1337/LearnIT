    "content": "Social Security Trust Fund Amendments of 1993 - Amends title II (OASDI) of the Social Security Act to require that the Board of Trustees of the OASDI trust funds include eight members of the public, rather than two, and meet at least ten times each calendar year. Imposes a duty on the Board to use prudent person standards in overseeing the investment of OASDI funds for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits for OASDI beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses in administering such funds. Limits the proportion of such funds which may be invested in interest-bearing obligations of the United States."
