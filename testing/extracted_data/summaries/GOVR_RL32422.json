    "content": "Administrations have periodically asked Congress to give the Department of Defense flexibility in allocating funds to cover the costs of military operations. Most recently, on May 12, 2004, theWhite House requested $25 billion as a \"contingent emergency reserve fund\" for FY2005 to coverthe costs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for part of the fiscal year. If enacted in its currentform, DOD could transfer funds, in any amounts, to individual accounts as long as the Office ofManagement and Budget agreed and Congress received a five-day advance notification. The issuefor Congress is a perennial one: to determine how much flexibility the Defense Department mayneed to carry out military operations Congress intends to support while also ensuring that funds areused for purposes and in amounts that Congress endorses. Faced with the challenge of balancing DOD's need for some funding flexibility for operations with congressional oversight responsibilities, Congress has responded in various ways to DODrequests. In general, Congress has rejected Administration requests to provide broad authority tofinance military operations in advance. In the run-up to the first Persian Gulf War in 1990, forexample, Congress rejected an Administration request for blanket authority to spend moneycontributed by allies. Congress has, however, periodically appropriated money for ongoing or anticipated military operations into flexible \"transfer accounts,\" where DOD can then move funds into regular accountsto meet evolving requirements. At the same time, Congress has generally imposed variousrestrictions and reporting requirements. The least restrictive requirements Congress has imposed in recent years applied to $20 billion that Congress appropriated in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11,2001. Although the Administration requested similar flexibility in later supplementals, Congressgradually reverted to normal practices by limiting the amount of funding in flexible accounts andby requiring advance notification if DOD decides to spend monies in ways that differ from thosespecified in statutory or report language. By the standards of earlier congressional action, the Administration's current request for a contingency reserve would allow the Defense Department broad flexibility comparable to thatgranted by Congress immediately after September 11. In congressional action on the FY2005 DODauthorization ( H.R. 4200 and S. 2400 ), and appropriations bills( H.R. 4613 ), both houses limited DOD's flexibility by allocating most of the $25 billionto regular appropriation accounts, and setting various reporting requirements. This report reviewsrecent precedents for funding military operations, outlines options for monitoring that spending, andanalyzes congressional action on the Administration's $25 billion request for FY2005. Congress isexpected to vote on the conference version of the FY2005 DOD Appropriations bill, H.R.4613, which includes the $25 billion, before going on recess on July 26, 2004."
