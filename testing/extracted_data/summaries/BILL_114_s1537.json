    "content": "Border Health Security Act of 2015 This bill amends the United States-Mexico Border Health Commission Act to require the commission to cooperate with the Canada-United States Pan-Border Public Health Preparedness Council and to recommend and implement initiatives that solve border health issues. Members of the commission may provide advice or recommendations to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or Congress without authorization or a request. HHS must award grants: (1) to address the priorities and recommendations of the commission and council to improve the health of border area residents, and (2) for infectious disease surveillance activities in border areas. Every five years, the commission and the council must each prepare a binational strategic plan that includes priority areas, recommendations to address these priority areas, and an evaluation framework to gauge progress. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response may coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security in establishing a system that alerts clinicians and public health officials to emerging health threats in border areas."
