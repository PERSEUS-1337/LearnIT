    "content": "Sandra Day O'Connor Civic Learning Act of 2011 - Expresses the sense of Congress that the Commissioner for Education Statistics, in administering the National Assessment of Educational Progress, should increase the number of students tested to improve disaggregation and analysis of data regarding progress in history and civics. Amends part C of title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to repeal We the People, a Civic Education program, and replace it with a program awarding competitive grants to nonprofit educational organizations to develop and implement programs that promote civic learning and engagement through instruction, professional development, and evaluations. Requires such programs to promote: (1) equity through access to funding and program benefits, (2) innovation through design, settings, and delivery, (3) scalability through broad, cost-effective implementation and institutionalization. And (4) accountability through program assessments and the identification of best practices."
