    "content": "In March 2010, Congress passed P.L. 111-148, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA), and amended it by passing P.L. 111-152, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA). Subsequently, lawsuits were filed in multiple courts challenging various aspects of the new law. Many of these cases were heard in the district courts and a few were appealed to appellate courts. In November 2011, the Supreme Court granted three petitions for certiorari in one of these cases. On June 28, 2012, the Court issued its decision in the case, National Federation of Independent Business et al. v. Sebelius. This report contains resources for retrieving background information and selected legal material relevant to these cases. It also includes information on CRS experts and products to assist in understanding the legal and policy issues related to the act. This report will be updated as needed."
