    "content": "Our Lady of Peace Act - Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to require the head of each US department or agency to ascertain whether it has such information on persons for whom receipt of a firearm would violate specified Federal provisions regarding excluded individuals or State law as is necessary to enable the National Instant Criminal Background Check System to operate. Directs that any such record that the department or agency has be made available to the Attorney General for inclusion in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System or transmission of a certification identifying the record for removal from the System. Directs the head of such department or agency, at the Attorney General's request, to furnish such information to the System electronically. Makes a State eligible to receive a waiver of the ten percent matching requirement for National Criminal History Improvement Grants if the State provides at least 95 percent of the information described in this Act, including the name of and other relevant identifying information related to each person disqualified from acquiring a firearm. Requires the Attorney General to make grants to each State: (1) to establish or upgrade information and identification technologies for firearms eligibility determinations. And (2) for use by the State's chief judicial officer to improve the handling of proceedings related to criminal history dispositions and restraining orders. Requires the Director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics to study and evaluate the operations of the System and to report on grants and on best practices of States."
