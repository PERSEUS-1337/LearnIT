    "content": "Coal Cleanup Taxpayer Protection Act This bill amends the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act to prohibit the Office of Surface Mining and Reclamation Enforcement (OSMRE)and state regulatory authoritiesfrom accepting new self-bonds for coal reclamation. Additionally, any existing self-bonds or corporate bondsutilized for coal reclamationmust be converted to surety or collateral bonds. The OSMRE may approve state or federal alternative coal miningbond programs thatresult in no greater risk of financial liability to the federalgovernment than a surety or collateral bond program. The bill also requires the OSMRE to issue rules establishing limitations on surety bondsto minimize the financial liability to the federal or stategovernment."
