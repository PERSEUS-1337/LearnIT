    "title": "An act to amend Section 19353 of the Business and Professions Code, and to amend Sections 11362.775 and 11362.9 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to medical marijuana.",
    "content": "Existing law, the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act (MMRSA), provides for the licensure of persons engaged in specified activities relating to medical marijuana and establishes other regulatory provisions. That act also requires each licensing authority to prepare and submit to the Legislature an annual report on the authority\u2019s activities and post the report on the authority\u2019s Internet Web site. This bill would require the report to also include the number of appeals from the denial of state licenses or other disciplinary actions taken by the licensing authority, the average time spent on these appeals, and the number of complaints submitted by citizens or representatives of cities or counties regarding licensees, as specified. Existing law authorizes the creation by the University of California of the California Marijuana Research Program, the purpose of which is to develop and conduct studies intended to ascertain the general medical safety and efficacy of marijuana, and if found valuable, to develop medical guidelines for the appropriate administration and use of marijuana. This bill would specify that the studies may include studies to ascertain the effect of marijuana on motor skills. Existing law, until one year after the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation posts a notice on its Internet Web site that licensing authorities have commenced issuing licenses pursuant to the MMRSA, exempts cooperatives and collectives who cultivate medical cannabis for qualified patients from criminal sanctions for specified activities related to the growing, sale, and distribution of marijuana. This bill, during that same period, would exempt collectives and cooperatives that manufacture medical cannabis products from criminal sanctions for manufacturing medical cannabis if the cooperative or collective meets specified requirements, including using specified manufacturing processes and possessing a valid local license, permit, or other authorization."
