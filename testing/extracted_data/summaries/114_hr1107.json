Such Report must include: (1) a detailed assessment of major repair and rehabilitation needs for all such works. And (2) an itemized list of major repair and rehabilitation needs of individual Reclamation facilities at each Reclamation project, including a budget level cost estimate of appropriations needed to complete each item and an assignment of a categorical rating for each item consistent with existing uniform categorization systems to inform the annual budget process and agency requirements. Interior may exclude from the public version of the Report any information that it identifies as sensitive or classified, but shall make available to specified congressional committees a version of the report containing the sensitive or classified information. Interior must: (1) coordinate with the non-federal entities responsible for the operation and maintenance of transferred works in developing reporting requirements for Asset Management Reports regarding major repair and rehabilitation needs for transferred works, and (2) develop and implement a categorical rating system for transferred works that incorporates the rating system for major repair and rehabilitation needs for reserved works."
