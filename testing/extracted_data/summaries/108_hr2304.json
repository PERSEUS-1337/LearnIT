Requires claimants to submit notice to the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of Agriculture within 15 years of enactment of this Act and to establish their qualifications for a remedy. Authorizes the appropriate Secretary, upon receiving notice from a qualifying claimant, to take any or a combination of the following actions to resolve boundary conflicts: (1) convey and quitclaim all right, title, and interest of the United States in the disputed land. (2) if there are Federal interests in such land, confirm Federal title to it and retain it in Federal management. And (3) compensate the qualifying claimant where title is confirmed and retained pursuant to item (2). Requires conveyance of land under this Act without consideration, if the appropriate Secretary determines that the boundary conflict was the result of innocent detrimental reliance by the qualifying claimant on a subsequent land survey. Requires the appropriate Secretary to pay costs associated with the resolution of boundary disputes pursuant to this Act and to reimburse qualifying claimants for survey costs necessary to establish a claim. Establishes rules for the treatment of preexisting conditions, existing reservations, and existing rights and uses."
