    "content": "This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on March 16, 2016. The Department of the Interior may accept title to any real property located within the boundaries of the original 1857 reservation of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon , if such real property is transferred to the United States by or on behalf of the tribes. Interior must treat such a transfer of real property as an on-reservation trust acquisition. Gaming is prohibited on such real property, except for real property within two miles of a specified gaming facility. Real property taken into trust within the boundaries of the original reservation after September 9, 1988, must be considered part of the reservation."
