    "content": "Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2009 - Amends the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 with respect to the state-established individual emergency unemployment compensation account (EUCA). Extends the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program through December 31, 2010. Amends the Assistance for Unemployed Workers and Struggling Families Act to extend through January 1, 2011: (1) federal-state agreements increasing regular unemployment compensation payments to individuals. And (2) requirements that federal payments to states cover 100 of EUC. Requires a further additional Tier-3 period for deposits to an individual's EUCA, using the current formula, if, at the time the amount added to such individual's account under the Act is exhausted or at any time thereafter, the individual's state is in an extended benefit period. Prescribes a formula for determining if a state is in an extended benefit period. Allows the Tier-3 period augmentation to be applied to the individual's EUCA only once. Authorizes a state to pay extended compensation to an otherwise eligible individual before any further additional EUC, if such individual claimed extended compensation for at least one week of unemployment after the exhaustion of additional EUC. Amends the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act to extend through December 31, 2010, the temporary increase in extended unemployment benefits for employees with 10 or more years of service and for those with less than 10. Makes additional appropriations to cover such cost. Amends the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to make additional appropriations to the Railroad Retirement Board to cover administrative expenses associated with such additional extended benefits. Amends title IV part D of the Social Security Act to require information entered into the data base of the National Directory of New Hires to be deleted 48 months after its entry. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to permit federal departments and agencies or their agents to use data in each component of the Federal Parent Locator Service and information reported by employers to assess the effectiveness of federal programs in achieving positive labor market outcomes. Allows personal identifiers to be provided to such entities, subject to certain privacy provisions."
