    "title": "SB 945",
    "content": "Existing law regulates the care and maintenance of animals in the care of a pet store. This bill would establish procedures for the care and maintenance of pets boarded at a pet boarding facility, including, but not limited to, sanitation, provision of enrichment for the pet, health of the pet, and safety. The bill would specifically authorize a city, county, or city and county to adopt ordinances that establish additional standards and requirements for a pet boarding facility. The bill would require an animal control officer, a humane officer, or a peace officer who detects a violation of specified provisions by a pet boarding facility operator to issue a notice to correct and would provide that if the operator complies with the notice to correct he or she would not be subject to an infraction, except as provided. The bill would provide that an operator that causes or allows harm or injury to an animal or allows an animal to be subject to an unreasonable risk of harm or injury is guilty of a misdemeanor. The bill, except as provided, would make a violation of these provisions an infraction punishable by a fine not to exceed $250 for the first violation and not to exceed $1,000 for each subsequent violation. Because it would create a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
