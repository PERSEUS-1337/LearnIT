    "title": "SB 1289",
    "content": "Existing law generally regulates formation and enforcement of contracts, including what constitutes an unlawful contract. Under existing law, a contract is unlawful if it is contrary to an express provision of law, contrary to the policy of express law, though not expressly prohibited, or otherwise contrary to good morals. Existing law authorizes a county board of supervisors on behalf of its sheriff, and a legislative body of a city on behalf of its chief of police, to contract to provide supplemental law enforcement services to private individuals, private entities, and private corporations in specified circumstances and subject to certain conditions. This bill would, commencing on January 1, 2018, prohibit a city, county, or a city and county, or a local law enforcement agency from entering into or renewing a contract, or modifying a contract to extend the length of the contract, with a private corporation, contractor, or vendor to detain immigrants in civil immigration proceedings for profit. Existing law requires the Board of State and Community Corrections to establish minimum standards for local correctional facilities, as specified. This bill would require a city, county, or city and county, or a local law enforcement agency that chooses to enter into a contract to detain immigrants in civil immigration proceedings to detain immigrants only pursuant to a contract that requires the immigration detention facility operator to adhere to specified standards. The California Public Records Act requires state and local agencies to make their records available for public inspection and to make copies available upon request and payment of a fee unless the records are exempt from disclosure. This bill would specify that any facility that detains an immigrant pursuant to a contract with a city, county, city and county, or a local law enforcement agency is subject to the California Public Records Act. Existing law, the Unruh Civil Rights Act, provides that all persons within the jurisdiction of California are free and equal no matter their national origin, citizenship, or immigration status and are entitled to full and equal accommodations, facilities, and privileges in all business establishments of every kind. Persons denied their rights under this act may obtain specified remedies, including treble damages. This bill would provide that an immigration detention facility operator, as defined, an agent thereof, or a person acting on its behalf, shall not deprive an immigrant detainee in civil immigration proceedings of specified rights, including access to an attorney or other authorized person, medical care, freedom from harm or harassment, or privacy. The bill would prohibit an immigration detention facility from involuntarily placing a detainee in segregated housing because of his or her actual or perceived gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation. This bill would authorize the Attorney General or any district attorney or city attorney to bring a civil action against an immigration detention facility, an agent thereof, or a person acting on its behalf that violates a detainee\u2019s rights, as specified. The bill would provide that its provisions are severable."
