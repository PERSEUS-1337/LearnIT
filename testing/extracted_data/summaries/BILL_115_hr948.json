(2) provide for a phaseout of the tax deduction for mortgage interest between 2017 and 2021. (3) allow a deduction for interest and taxes relating to land for dwelling purposes owned or leased by cooperative housing corporations. And (4) increase the state housing credit ceiling for the low-income housing tax credit. The bill directs the Department of the Treasury to apply the savings from the enactment of this bill to the Housing Trust Fund, rental assistance programs, and the Public Housing Capital Fund. The Department of Housing and Urban Development must revise regulations for the Housing Trust Fund to: (1) increase the limitation on funds that are available for operating assistance for housing, (2) allow public housing agencies and tribally designated housing entities to be the recipients of grants that are allocated to a state or a state designated entity, and (3) eliminate the applicability of rules for the fund that are based on the HOME Investment Partnerships Act."
