    "content": "Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment for veterans (VR&E) is an entitlement program that provides job training and other employment-related services to veterans with service-connected disabilities. In cases where a disabled veteran is not able to work, the VR&E program provides independent living (IL) services to help the veteran achieve the highest possible quality of life. The VR&E program is administered by the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). To be entitled to VR&E services, a veteran must have been discharged under conditions other than dishonorable and be found to have either (1) a service-connected disability rated at 20% or more and an employment handicap, or (2) a service-connected disability rated at 10% and a serious employment handicap. After a veteran is found to be entitled to VR&E, a vocational rehabilitation counselor helps the veteran identify a suitable employment goal and determine what services will be necessary to achieve that goal. The veteran is then assigned to one of five reemployment tracks: Reemployment for veterans who wish to return to work they held prior to their military service; Rapid Access to Employment for veterans who already have the skills necessary to compete in the job market and only need short-term services such as job search assistance; Employment through Long-Term Services for veterans who require postsecondary or vocational training to reach their employment goals; Self-employment for veterans who have the skills to start businesses; or Independent Living for veterans for whom employment is not a viable goal. Veterans may change tracks if a disability worsens or if their employment objective changes. Services may be provided by the VA, though they are more frequently purchased from an outside provider. VR&E benefits are typically limited to 48 months, though the benefit period can be extended under certain circumstances. In most cases, veterans are entitled to a subsistence allowance while they are enrolled in an education or training program. In FY2016, approximately 29,340 veterans developed a new plan of service with VR&E and 11,531 veterans completed rehabilitation. In FY2016, costs for mandatory VR&E benefits were approximately $1.3 billion. Discretionary support services and other administrative costs were approximately $218 million."
