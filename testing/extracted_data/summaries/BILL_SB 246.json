    "title": "SB 246",
    "content": "The Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases. The state board is required to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 to be achieved by 2020 and to adopt rules and regulations in an open public process to achieve the maximum, technologically feasible, and cost-effective greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The act requires all state agencies to consider and implement strategies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. An executive order establishes a climate action team consisting of specified ex officio members and requires the team to make a specified biannual report to the Legislature and Governor. This bill would establish the Integrated Climate Adaptation and Resiliency Program to be administered by the Office of Planning and Research to coordinate regional and local efforts with state climate adaptation strategies to adapt to the impacts of climate change, as specified. The bill also would require, within one year of an update to the Safeguarding California Plan, the Office of Emergency Services, in coordination with the Natural Resources Agency, the Office of Planning and Research, and relevant public and private entities, to review and update, as necessary, the Adaptation Planning Guide, as specified. The bill would establish an advisory council, as specified, to support the goals of the Office of Planning and Research as identified by the bill. The bill would require the Office of Planning and Research to establish a clearinghouse for climate adaptation information, as specified. The Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act, with specified exceptions, requires that meetings of a state body be open and public and that all persons be permitted to attend. Existing law establishes the Strategic Growth Council and requires the council, among other things, to identify and review the activities and funding programs of member state agencies that may be coordinated to improve air and water quality. Existing law also requires the council\u2019s meetings be open to the public and subject to the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act. This bill would specify certain council meetings that are not subject to the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act."
