Prohibits a cable operator from providing telephone exchange service or telephone exchange access service in the geographic area where it provides video programming so long as the local exchange carrier (LEC) for such area is prohibited from providing video programming directly to its subscribers. Requires the Federal Communications Commission to promulgate regulations ensuring that all providers of competitive telecommunications services are subject to equivalent regulation. Authorizes an LEC to: (1) provide video programming to its subscribers either directly or through an affiliate. And (2) provide channels of communication or pole line, conduit space, or other rental arrangements to an entity directly owned, operated, or controlled by the LEC to be used to provide video programming directly to subscribers."
