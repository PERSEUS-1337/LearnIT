    "content": "Periodically, since the inception of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in 1975, debate has occurred concerning its optimal size. In the 108th Congress, the House has passed energy legislation( H.R. 6 ) which would require the SPR to be filled to its current capacity ofapproximately 700 million barrels and would authorize funds to further expand the capacity of thereserve to 1 billion barrels. Analysis of the SPR issue has been carried out in a benefit/cost framework in which benefits, the avoided cost to the national economy of a supply disruption, are set against the real resourcecosts associated with investing in the SPR. The role of the privately held stock of crude oil has beenlargely static in these analyses. The data show, however, that private stock behavior has beenchanging. Industry holds less crude oil, and has less capacity to hold crude oil, than a decade ago.These changes reflect a decade long strategy of reducing operating costs to remain competitive.However, oil markets face greater exposure to supply disruption today because our dependence onimported crude oil has risen substantially since 1992. The effectiveness of the SPR in providingsecurity from crude oil supply disruptions may be primarily a function of its size, but may also bedependent on the underlying stocks of crude oil held by the private sector. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has studied the behavior of crude oil stocks in the U.S. since 1989. It finds that our total stocks, measured as days of net imports that can be replaced bystock draw-down, have been declining. This trend results from the interaction of increasing importdependency, the essentially constant size of the SPR over the period, and the declining size ofprivately held stocks. The IEA concludes that with no change in any of these factors, the U.S. willno longer be able to replace ninety days of net imports from domestic stocks in 2006. Because the IEA focuses on total reserves, its analysis may overstate the ability of U.S. stocks to mitigate oil supply disruptions. This is because not all privately held oil stocks can be drawn uponwithout disrupting the functioning of the system itself. Once these lower operational inventory levelsare considered, the thinness of privately held stocks is apparent. As a result, the ability of privatelyheld stocks to provide a buffer to supply disruptions is reduced. This report will be updated as events warrant."
