    "title": "A bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to recognize Alexander Creek, Alaska, as a Native village, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "This bill amends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to recognize Alexander Creek as a Native village. Currently, Alexander Creek is recognized as a Native group. Alexander Creek must file any amendments to its corporate charter that are necessary to convert from a Native group to a Native village. The Department of the Interior must negotiate with Alexander Creek to fairly and equitably settle aboriginal land claims and any other claims against the United States. Alexander Creek must notify its members that the Cook Inlet regional corporation will make future payments to the village instead of to individual members. The regional corporation is not liable for damages related to cessation of payments to individual members of Alexander Creek."
