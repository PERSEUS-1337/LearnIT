    "content": "One hundred sixteen million U.S. households watch television. Approximately 86% of those households subscribe to a service that carries the retransmitted signals of broadcast stations over fiber optic cables, telephone lines, or through satellite dishes on the premises. Such services, known as multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs), retransmit broadcast television signals pursuant to a regulatory framework constructed by Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The remaining households generally use an individual antenna that receives broadcast signals directly over the air from a television station. On December 4, 2014, President Barack Obama signed the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act Reauthorization Act (STELA Reauthorization Act; P.L. 113-200), extending legal provisions governing retransmission of distant network broadcast signals via satellite. In addition, the law both extends and changes rules for retransmission consent negotiations between television station owners and operators of satellite and cable systems. These portions of the regulatory framework are scheduled to expire on December 31, 2019. The STELA Reauthorization Act limits the ability of separately owned broadcasters to jointly enter retransmission consent negotiations (applying FCC rules to more stations), but extends their ability to jointly sell advertising time (delaying enforcement of FCC rules). The act also eliminates FCC rules barring satellite and cable operators from deleting broadcasters' programming or changing their channel assignments during certain periods. In addition, it repeals the FCC's ban on integrating the security and navigation functions of cable set-top boxes on December 5, 2015, one year after the law's enactment. The act directs the FCC to develop a streamlined process for small cable operators to file \"effective competition\" petitions that would free them from FCC rate regulation of their basic tiers of service. The act also has provisions to facilitate viewers' access to in-state programming. It directs the FCC, when considering whether to modify the local market of a television station to enable it to be carried on an MVPD, to consider whether doing so would promote consumers' access to in-state programming. The act directs the FCC to post information about the market modification process on its website. The act also extends the market modification process, previously applicable only to cable operators, to satellite operators as well. Finally, the act directs the FCC to issue a report to Congress analyzing alternatives to its current definition of local television markets."
