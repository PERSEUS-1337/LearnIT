States that no over-the-counter instrument to which a financial institution is a party shall be subject to rescission or held unenforceable based solely on the regulatory status or jurisdiction over such instrument under Federal or State law. Provides that an over-the-counter instrument does not fall within the purview of the Commodity Exchange Act as a consequence of being the subject of an electronic trade or communication. Authorizes the Board to appoint a conservator or receiver to take possession and control of a State bank which operates, or operates as, a multilateral clearing organization in the same manner as the Comptroller of the Currency may do so."
