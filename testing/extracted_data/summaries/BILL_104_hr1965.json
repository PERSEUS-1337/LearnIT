    "content": "Coastal Zone Protection Act of 1996 - Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to authorize annual grants to States to develop coastal zone management programs. Limits each State to four grants. Terminates the grant program after FY 1999. Authorizes grants to States to implement program changes. Authorizes appropriations for: (1) administering State management programs, (2) resource management improvement grants, (3) coastal zone enhancement grants, (4) grants under the National Estuarine Research Reserve System, (5) expenses incidental to the administration of the Act. And (6) such program development grants. Allows grants provided from amounts recovered as a result of damage to coastal zone natural resources to be used to pay 100 percent of the costs of the activities carried out with the grants. Allows resource management improvement grants to be used for the development of a coordinated process among State agencies to regulate and issue permits for coastal zone aquaculture facilities. Allows coastal zone enhancement grants to be used to evaluate and facilitate the siting of public and private coastal zone aquaculture facilities. Establishes consistency determination appeal procedures."
