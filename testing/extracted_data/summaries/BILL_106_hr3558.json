    "content": "Directs the Secretary to require an operator of a pipeline facility that: (1) has an instrumented internal inspection device to test the pipeline once every five years for corrosion and anomalies and make test results available to the public. And (2) is not covered by a certain certification under a State pipeline safety program or by a State pipeline safety agreement to test the pipeline hydrostatically once every five years to redetermine its maximum allowable operating pressure of the pipeline and make test results available to the public. Authorizes the Secretary, upon the request of an operator of a non-high-risk pipeline, to approve an alternative method of testing the pipeline, including inspection by smart pig, for structural weaknesses instead of hydrostatic testing if the Secretary first provides notification in the Federal Register and to interested State and local governments and other persons of the proposed approval and provides for public comment. Directs the Secretary to establish a list of high-risk pipelines . Requires pipeline operators to report to the Secretary hazardous liquid spills of more than 40 gallons and ruptures to pipelines. Directs the Secretary to make available on the Internet maps of the location of all pipeline facilities subject to the Act. Directs the Governor of each State desiring to administer its own pipeline safety standards for interstate pipelines to submit to the Secretary a complete description of its proposed program. Prohibits a State program from containing standards that are less stringent than those established by Federal law. Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the effectiveness of: (1) external leak detection systems for the purpose of improving pipeline leak detection. And (2) double-walled pipelines for the purpose of preventing ruptures and leaks. Directs the Secretary to complete cost-benefit analyses of all recommendations made by the National Transportation Safety Board to the Secretary that the Board classifies as being open. Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the optimal minimum burial depth of underground pipelines for the purpose of preventing the release of hazardous materials in the air."
