    "content": "Integrity of the United States Courts Act of 2003 - Amends the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act to permit a party or person to file with the US Court of International Trade an appeal of a determination of a binational panel or committee, alleging that a panel or committee determination was based on a misinterpretation of US law, a member of a binational panel or committee is guilty of gross misconduct, bias, or serious conflict of interest, or that the panel or committee seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure or exceeded its own authority, and such actions have materially affected panel or committee determinations with respect to antidumping and countervailing duty cases and threaten the integrity of the panel or committee review process. Authorizes a person to commence an action in the US Court of International Trade if such person has requested a panel or committee review of an antidumping or countervailing duty determination, but such panel or committee is not convened within 120 days. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to grant the US Court of International Trade jurisdiction over the review of a final determination of a binational panel or an investigating authority. Declares that the amendments made by this Act with respect to antidumping and countervailing duty law shall apply to goods from Canada and Mexico."
