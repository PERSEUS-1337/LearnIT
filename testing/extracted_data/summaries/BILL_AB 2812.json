    "title": "AB 2812",
    "content": "Existing law requires the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery to develop and adopt requirements relating to adequate areas for collecting, storing, and loading recyclable materials in state buildings. Existing law requires each state agency or large state facility, when entering into a new lease, or renewing an existing lease, to ensure that adequate areas are provided for, and adequate personnel are available to oversee, the collection, storage, and loading of recyclable materials in compliance with those requirements. This bill would require the department, on or before July 1, 2017, to develop guidance for collecting and recycling recyclable materials in office buildings of state agencies and large state facilities, except buildings and facilities of community college districts or their campuses. The bill would require that a covered state agency and large state facility, on and after July 1, 2018, provide adequate receptacles, signage, education, and staffing, and arrange for recycling services consistent with specified law, for each office building of the state agency or large state facility. The bill would require, at least once per year, a covered state agency and large state facility to review the adequacy and condition of receptacles for recyclable material and of associated signage, education, and staffing. Existing law requires each state agency to submit an annual report to the department summarizing its progress in reducing solid waste, as specified. This bill would require that report to include a summary of the state agency\u2019s compliance with this act. This bill would incorporate additional changes in Section 42926 of the Public Resources Code proposed by AB 2396 that would become operative only if AB 2396 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last."
