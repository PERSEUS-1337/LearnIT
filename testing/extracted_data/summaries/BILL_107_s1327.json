    "content": "Airline Labor Dispute Resolution Act - Amends Federal aviation law to grant the Secretary of Transportation authority to declare an air transportation emergency whenever he finds that a labor dispute between an air carrier providing service to a hub airport and an employee organization representing the carrier's employees threatens to: (1) interrupt the carriage of passengers or cargo in interstate transportation by an air carrier in any region of the country in a manner that is likely to curtail operations significantly at any hub airport and thereby cause injury to the region's economy. (2) interrupt the carriage of passengers or cargo in foreign transportation in a manner that is likely to cause injury to the foreign commerce of the United States or its balance of payments. Or (3) compromise the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. Requires the Secretary to issue an order of arbitration to resolve such disputes according to a specified procedure whenever an air transportation emergency is declared."
