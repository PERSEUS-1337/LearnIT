    "title": "An act to amend Section 730.6 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to juveniles.",
    "content": "Existing law provides that a minor who violates a criminal law may be adjudged to be a ward of the court. Existing law generally requires that the minor pay a restitution fine to be deposited into the Restitution Fund and restitution to any victim of his or her conduct. Existing law defines a victim to include the immediate surviving family of the actual victim and governmental entities, as specified. This bill would expand the definition of victim to include a corporation, estate, or other legal or commercial entity when that entity is a direct victim of a crime. The bill would also expand the definition of victim to include a person who has sustained economic loss as a result of a crime and who satisfies specified conditions."
