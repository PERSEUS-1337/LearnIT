The request for State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) totals $54.08 billion, or a 4% increase from FY2015-estimated levels. Within that amount $47.04 billion is requested for enduring or core funding and $7.05 billion is designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding, excluding add-ons and rescissions; $17.55 billion of the total request is for State Department Operations and related agencies (10.6% increase over FY2015 estimates); $36.53 billion is for Foreign Operations (1.2% above the FY2015 estimates); excluding the FY2015 Ebola supplemental funding, the State Department Operations FY2016 request is a 10.9% increase over FY2015 estimates, and the Foreign Operations FY2016 request is a 7% increase over FY2015 funding estimates. House and Senate committees held several hearings on various aspects of the international affairs budget in February and March. Both chambers passed FY2016 budget resolutions in late March. The House (on April 30, 2015) and the Senate (on May 5, 2015) reconciled budget resolution funding levels in conference (H.Rept. 114-96); however, OCO suballocations were not established. The House Appropriations Committee reported its FY2016 SFOPS bill out of committee on June 11, 2015. The House committee bill (H.R. 2772; H.Rept. 114-154) recommended $48.19 billion in total funding, excluding rescissions, but including $7.33 billion designated as OCO. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its FY2016 bill out of committee on July 9, 2015. The Senate committee bill (S. 1725; S.Rept. 114-79) recommended $49.77 billion in total funding, excluding rescissions, but including $9.48 billion designated as OCO and $759 million in emergency funds. On September 30, 2015, the House and Senate approved, and President Obama signed into law, a resolution (P.L. 114-53) to provide temporary FY2016 continuing appropriations through December 11, 2015. On October 5, 2015, the Senate SFOPS bill was incorporated in a national security-related \"minibus\" bill (S. 2130), one of four minibus bills into which Senate FY2016 appropriations bills were bundled. On October 6, Senate SFOPS leaders introduced supplemental appropriations legislation (S. 2145) to increase FY2016 migration and refugee assistance funding by $1 billion to address the Middle East refugee crisis. On November 2, 2015, the President signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (H.R. 1314; P.L. 114-74), which raises the discretionary spending limit by $50 billion for FY2016 and $30 billion for FY2017 (thus increasing spending caps for defense and nondefense for those years), and increases OCO funding by $16 billion for each year, equally divided between DOD and SFOPS. On December 18, 2015, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations law for FY2016 (Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016; P.L. 114-113/H.R. 2029), and the President signed it the same day. Division K of the law provides $52.83 billion for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) for FY2016. This amount is 1.7% greater than the FY2015 estimate and 0.2% below the President's FY2016 request. This report provides an overview of the FY2016 SFOPS request, a discussion of key issues and historic context, and account-by-account funding comparisons with FY2014 actuals, available FY2015 estimates, FY2016 proposals and P.L. 114-113. This is the final update of this report, unless supplemental appropriations legislation is considered by Congress during FY2016."
