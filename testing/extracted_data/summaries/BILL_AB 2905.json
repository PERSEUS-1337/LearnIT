    "title": "AB 2905",
    "content": "Existing law requires the Director of the Department of General Services and the directors of other state agencies to establish goals for the participation of small businesses, including microbusinesses, in the provision of goods, information technology, and services to the state, and in the construction of state facilities. This bill would state the intent of the Legislature to set and implement a 25 small business participation goal for state procurement and contracting. Existing law requires each state agency that was awarded any contract financed with the proceeds of the infrastructure-related bond acts of 2006 in the previous fiscal year to report to the Director of General Services statistics comparing the small business and microbusiness participation dollars for contracts funded by these bonds to the total contract dollars for contracts funded by the bonds. This bill would require that the goals established by the agency director for the participation of small businesses, as described above, be reported to the director in that report. Existing law requires the department to make available a report on contracting that contains information on the level of participation by small businesses in state contracting. The bill would also require the goals established by the director for the participation of small businesses, as described above, to be included in that report. The bill would also require that, require, to the extent feasible, beginning in 2018, with the report issued in 2018 covering contracting activity in the 2017\u201318 fiscal year, that specified information in the report about the participation of small businesses be provided by prime contractor and subcontractor, separately. The bill would define subcontractor and prime contractor for purposes of these provisions. The bill would also revise the categories, defined by the number of employees, by which a statistical summary relating to small and microbusinesses is required to be reported, and, to the extent feasible, beginning with the report issued in 2018 covering contracting activity in the 2017\u201318 fiscal year, the number of contracts awarded by the department in those categories."
