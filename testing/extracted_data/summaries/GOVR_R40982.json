    "content": "This report summarizes and compares provisions for green jobs training and worker adaptation assistance for climate change mitigation impacts in two recent bills: H.R. 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (also known as the Waxman-Markey bill), and S. 1733, the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act of 2009 (also known as the Kerry-Boxer bill). Under a two-part subtitle for \"Green Jobs & Worker Transition\" (Title IV Subtitle B of H.R. 2454, and Title III, Subtitle A of S. 1733), essentially identical provisions are focused (in Part I) on the development of programs to provide training and education in energy efficiency and renewable energy, and (in Part II) on providing retraining and financial assistance for workers made redundant (or whose earnings have been substantially reduced) by climate change mitigation measures. Since the provisions in both bills are so similar, this report will focus on the provisions as discussed in S. 1733. A \"Chairman's Mark\" of S. 1733 was released in October 2009. Any resulting modifications to applicable areas of the original Kerry-Boxer version are discussed in the report. The green jobs training provisions in Part 1 of S. 1733 focuses on the development of training programs in climate change mitigation, renewable energy and energy efficiency, the authorization of competitive grants to organizations and partnerships developed to provide relevant education, training, and an internet-based clearinghouse for general information on the programs and technologies. Part 2 of S. 1733 focuses on assisting workers impacted by climate change mitigation measures. If a group of workers can show how their current or prospective employment is impaired by climate change mitigation measures, then these workers would apply for climate change adjustment assistance. Assistance would include a monetary allowance while workers are retrained or otherwise seeking new jobs or seeking full employment if their work hours are reduced. Assistance may be provided for up to three years for eligible workers. Workers receiving assistance under Part 2 would not be eligible for any other form of unemployment insurance. The separate jobs retraining and assistance program envisioned by S. 1733 appears to be more comprehensive than existing workforce and apprenticeship programs, perhaps raising issues of equity for unemployed workers not eligible for Climate Change Worker Adjustment Assistance. More clarity may be sought with regard to the federal policies, oversight, and planning for the support or development of industries and businesses expected to absorb retrained workers. Growth in green industries and other sectors is assumed to provide future employment as companies look to climate change business opportunities. Coordination of government, education and retraining providers and potential employers on one hand, and corresponding efforts to create or rebuild competitive industrial sectors on the other hand, will likely be crucial if the desired economic growth and employment results are to be realized. \"Middle class careers\" and \"quality employment\" are described as goals of the Green Construction careers demonstration projects. But over the longer term, higher paying, less transient jobs are more likely to come from jobs in manufacturing companies rather than jobs in construction. Development of a competitive, domestic renewable energy industry which designs and produces the turbines, solar panels and related parts and components may provide these jobs, but may require a longer-term focus on the needs of future markets."
