    "title": "An act to amend Sections 20588 and 31657 of the Government Code, relating to public employees\u2019 retirement.",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes public agencies to contract with the Board of Administration of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System to have their employees become members of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (PERS). Existing law, with respect to the Counties of Kern, Los Angeles, and Orange, permits the board to enter into an agreement with the contracting agency\u2019s board of retirement for termination of the contracting agency\u2019s participation in PERS and inclusion of the agency\u2019s employees in the retirement system of the city or county, if specified requirements are met, with respect to certain safety members, including firefighters. The County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 establishes a corresponding authority for accepting these people as members for retirement systems created pursuant to its provisions, and granting them service credit for their service credited by PERS. This bill would expand the application of the provisions described above to the County of San Bernardino."
