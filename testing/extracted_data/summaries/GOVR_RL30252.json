    "content": "In the post-Cold War world, terrorism, narcotics trafficking, and related money laundering are perceived both as criminalmatters and as threats to the nation's security. Often collectively termed transnational threats, these issues havebecome theconcerns of law enforcement agencies as well as the U.S. Intelligence Community. Two foreign banking scandalsin thelate 1980s led to efforts to ensure that information in the possession of intelligence agencies would, in the future,be madeavailable to law enforcement officials. In the mid-1990s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began assigningadditionalagents to newly created offices worldwide. The tragic events of September 11, 2001 provide a clear demonstrationof howlarge a threat international terrorism can become to national security. The Bush Administration and Congress havemovedrapidly to promote intelligence/enforcement cooperation among U.S. agencies in the campaign against Al Qaeda. This report looks at the separate roles and missions and distinct identities of intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Coordinating their efforts has raised significant legal and administrative difficulties that have been only partiallyovercomedespite the creation of elaborate coordinative mechanisms under the oversight of the National Security Council. Someobservers also have expressed concerns about the greater use of information derived from intelligence sources injudicialproceedings, fearing that it may lead to over-reliance on surreptitious means of information collection and, thus,underminecivil liberties. Other observers have cautioned that redirecting intelligence assets to collect information for legalcases mayreduce support available to military commanders and policymakers. Some others believe that there may also beanoveremphasis on law enforcement in dealing with problems arising abroad. The report notes the employment ofcovertactions by intelligence agencies in certain law enforcement efforts. This report also addresses congressional oversight of the law enforcement-intelligence relationship that is spread among anumber of House and Senate committees, each of which has only partial jurisdiction. Some observers believe thatthereshould be further efforts to base the evolving relationship in statutory law. They have argued that closer attentionshould begiven to coordinating the emerging relationship between intelligence and law enforcement efforts while practicesaremalleable rather than to wait until bureaucratic rigidities set in or unfortunate precedents are established duringcrises. Even with conscientious efforts at coordination, others have noted that fundamental differences remain between matters oflaw and of national interest in a world of sovereign nation states. Enforcement of international law and theextraterritorialapplication of U.S. law can be vigorously and, at times, effectively resisted by other countries. The necessity toadapt U.S.responses to transnational threats to specific situations can also undermine respect for law by making enforcementappearinequitable."
