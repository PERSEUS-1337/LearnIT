Existing law requires a court to grant a petition of a party to a civil action who is over 70 years of age for a preference if the court makes certain findings. Existing law authorizes a court to grant a motion for preference that is supported by a showing that satisfies the court that the interests of justice will be served by granting this preference. This bill provide that a plaintiff is entitled to a trial preference if he or she has complied with specific disclosure requirements and would require a plaintiff in an asbestos tort action who files a motion for preference to submit a sworn affidavit that he or she has complied with those disclosure requirements."
