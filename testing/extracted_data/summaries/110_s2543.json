Or (2) was presented with documentation showing that a court waived parental notification requirements or authorized the minor's abortion. Defines abortion as the termination of a pregnancy with an intention other than to increase the probability of a live birth, preserve the life or health of the child after live birth, terminate an ectopic pregnancy, or remove a dead unborn child who died as the result of a spontaneous abortion, accidental trauma, or a criminal assault on the pregnant female or her unborn child. Imposes a fine andor prison term of up to one year on anyone who has committed an act of incest with a minor and knowingly transports such minor across a state line to obtain an abortion."
