Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to request the Institute of Medicine to enter into an agreement to conduct a study to: (1) review the current state of knowledge about the biological properties of stem cells obtained from embryos and fetal and adult tissues. (2) evaluate the current state of knowledge about biological differences among stem cells obtained from embryos and fetal and adult tissues and the consequences for research and medicine. And (3) assess what is currently known about the ability of stem cells to generate neurons, heart, kidney, blood, liver, and other tissues and the potential clinical uses of these tissues."
