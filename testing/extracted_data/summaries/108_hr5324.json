Requires such schools to formulate and implement a plan to accomplish at least two of specified goals, which include: (1) establishing or significantly expanding an accelerated baccalaureate degree nursing program designed to graduate new nurses in 12 to 18 months. (2) establishing cooperative interdisciplinary training between schools of nursing and other specified health related fields. (3) increasing admissions, enrollment, and retention of qualified individuals who are financially disadvantaged, (4) increasing enrollment of minority and diverse student populations. (5) increasing enrollment of new graduate baccalaureate nursing students in graduate programs that educate nurse faculty members. (6) developing post-baccalaureate residency programs to prepare nurses for practice in specialty areas where nursing shortages are more severe. And (7) increasing integration of geriatric content into the core curriculum. Requires the Comptroller General of the United States to study ways to increase participation in the nurse faculty profession and to submit a report to Congress that includes: (1) a discussion of the master's degree and doctoral degree programs that are successful in placing graduates as faculty in schools of nursing. And (2) an examination of compensation disparities throughout the nursing profession and between higher education instructional faculty generally and higher education instructional nursing faculty."
