    "content": "The Iraq war was launched on March 19, 2003, with a strike against a location where Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and top lieutenants were believed to be meeting. On March 17, PresidentBush had given Saddam an ultimatum to leave the country or face military conflict. Although someresistance was encountered after U.S. troops entered Iraq, all major Iraqi population centers had beenbrought under U.S. control by April 14. In November 2002, the United Nations Security Councilhad adopted Resolution 1441, giving Iraq a final opportunity to \"comply with its the disarmamentobligations\" or \"face serious consequences.\" During January and February 2003, a U.S. militarybuildup in the Persian Gulf intensified and President Bush, other top U.S. officials, and BritishPrime Minister Tony Blair repeatedly indicated that Iraq had little time left to offer full cooperationwith U.N. weapons inspectors. However, leaders of France, Germany, Russia, and China urged thatthe inspections process be allowed more time. The Administration and its supporters assert that Iraq was in defiance of 17 Security Council resolutions requiring that it fully declare and eliminate its weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Further delay in taking action against Iraq, they argued, would have endangered national security andundermined U.S. credibility. Skeptics, including many foreign critics, maintained that theAdministration was exaggerating the Iraq threat and argued that the U.N. inspections process shouldhave been extended. In October 2002, Congress authorized the President to use the armed forcesof the United States to defend U.S. national security against the threat posed by Iraq and to enforceall relevant U.N. resolutions regarding Iraq ( P.L. 107-243 ). Analysts and officials are concerned about the risk of instability and ethnic fragmentation in Iraq after the war. U.S. plans for post-war governance of Iraq are just starting to be implemented,and the role of the United Nations in administering Iraq, if any, is still under debate. Whether theoverthrow of Iraq President Saddam Hussein will lead to democratization in Iraq and the widerMiddle East, or promote instability and an intensification of anti-U.S. attitudes, is also an issue indebate. The Iraq war has created concerns over the humanitarian situation, particularly in Baghdadand other cities affected by the war, but large-scale refugee flows have not occurred. Constitutional issues concerning a possible war with Iraq were largely resolved by the enactment of P.L. 107-243 , the October authorization. International legal issues remain, however,with respect to launching a pre-emptive war against Iraq and the prospective occupation. Estimatesof the cost of a war in Iraq vary widely. If war or its aftermath leads to a spike in the price of oil,economic growth could slow, but oil prices have fluctuated widely during the conflict to date. Conceivably, global oil production could increase significantly after the war. This CRS report provides information and analysis with respect to the 2003 war with Iraq, reviews a number of war-related issues, and provides links to additional sources of information.
