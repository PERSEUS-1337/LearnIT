    "content": "Medicaid Physician Self-Referral Act of 2014 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act (SSA) with respect to physician self-referral limitations to repeal the prohibition against payment of federal funds to a state for medical assistance expenditures for a designated health service furnished to an individual on the basis of a referral (self-referral) that would result in denial of payment under SSA title XVIII (Medicare). Requires a state plan for medical assistance to prohibit payment for a Medicaid designated health service furnished to an individual on the basis of a physician's referral if the physician has an ownership or investment interest or a compensation arrangement with the entity furnishing the service that would not comply with Medicare requirements. Requires application of certain reporting requirements and sanctions to a provider of a Medicaid designated health service the same way they apply under Medicare. Amends SSA title XVIII to: (1) apply the False Claims Act to violations of the self-referral prohibition, and (2) declare the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue regulations under Medicaid limited to the application of self-referral limitations to state plan requirements. Directs the Secretary to establish a protocol consistent with the Medicare self-referral disclosure protocol required under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that enables health care providers to disclose an actual or potential violation of Medicare self-referral limitations as applied to Medicaid."
