    "title": "AB 848",
    "content": "Existing law requires the State Department of Health Care Services to license adult alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment facilities, as defined. Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of health care practitioners by various boards and other entities within the Department of Consumer Affairs, and prescribes the scope of practice of those health care practitioners. This bill would authorize an adult alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment facility that is licensed under those provisions to allow a licensed physician and surgeon or other health care practitioner, as defined, to provide incidental medical services, as defined, to a resident of the facility at the facility premises under specified limited circumstances, including, among others, that the resident signs an admission agreement and a physician and surgeon or other health care practitioner determines that it is medically appropriate for the resident to receive these services. The bill would require the department to establish and collect an additional fee from those facilities, in an amount sufficient to cover the department\u2019s reasonable costs of regulating the provision of those services. The bill would require the department, on or before July 1, 2018, to adopt regulations to implement its provisions. The bill would also make related findings and declarations."
