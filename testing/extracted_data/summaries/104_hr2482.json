    "content": "Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act of 1995 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to provide for the establishment of a nationwide toll-free telephone number to be used by State one-call notification systems to protect underground facilities from excavation damage. Requires each State to consider whether to adopt a comprehensive statewide one-call notification program containing all elements required under this Act. Outlines required elements of the program, including prior notification of any intended excavations and its application to all excavators and underground facility operators. Permits a State to elect not to require a person to contact the one-call notification system if the person owns or leases the property and operates all underground facilities at the excavation site. Provides penalties for violations of the requirements of a program, as well as enforcement procedures. Directs the Secretary to make grants to States which have elected to adopt or establish and maintain a notification system with all required elements. Allows grants for alternative programs if they are at least as protective of the public health and safety and environment as a State program under this Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) coordinate the implementation of this Act with appropriate Federal agencies. (2) review and report to the Congress on the extent to which Department of Commerce programs and procedures could be used to achieve the purposes of this Act. (3) develop and make available to States a model State one-call notification program, with suggested elements. And (4) develop public service announcements and other materials to educate the public about one-call notification systems and the national phone number. Requires each State to provide an initial and annual status reports on progress made in implementing a State program. Allows States to implement more protective notification systems than that required under this Act.
