(2) allow the Court to enter a default judgment against the Secretary of Veterans Affairs upon a determination that the Secretary has unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed action on a claim or has failed to plead or otherwise defend. And (3) allow judicial review by the Circuit Court of Appeals of any question of law, or application of law to the facts, that was relied upon by the Court. Directs the Secretary to provide for the expeditious treatment: (1) by the appropriate office of the Veterans Benefits Administration of any claim remanded to that office by the Board of Veterans' Appeals. And (2) by such Board of any claim remanded to the Secretary by the Court. Authorizes the Court, in claims remanded to the Secretary involving compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, to order the Secretary to pay interim benefits when a decision on such claim is not rendered within 180 days. Authorizes the Court, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal."
