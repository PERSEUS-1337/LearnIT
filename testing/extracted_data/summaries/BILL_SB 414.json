    "title": "SB 414",
    "content": "The Lempert-Keene-Seastrand Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act generally requires the administrator for oil spill response, acting at the direction of the Governor, to implement activities relating to oil spill response, including emergency drills and preparedness, and oil spill containment and cleanup. The act authorizes the administrator to use volunteer workers in response, containment, restoration, wildlife rehabilitation, and cleanup efforts for oil spills in waters of the state. Existing law requires the administrator to evaluate the feasibility of using commercial fishermen and other mariners for oil spill containment and cleanup. This bill would require the administrator, in cooperation with the United States Coast Guard, to establish a schedule of drills and exercises that are required under the federal Salvage and Marine Firefighting regulations. The bill would require the administrator, on or before January 1, 2017, to submit to the Legislature a report assessing the best achievable technology of equipment for oil spill prevention, preparedness, and response and to update regulations governing the adequacy of oil spill contingency plans before July 1, 2018. The bill would require the administrator to direct the Harbor Safety Committees for various regions to assess, among other things, the presence and capability of tugs within their respective regions of responsibility to provide emergency towing of tank and nontank vessels to arrest their drift or guide emergency transit. The act requires the administrator to study the use and effects of methods used to respond to oil spills and to periodically update the study to ensure the best achievable protection from the use of those methods. This bill would require the administrator, in conducting the study and updates, to consult current peer-reviewed published scientific literature. The bill would require the administrator, by May 1, 2016, to request that the federal California Dispersant Plan be updated, as provided, and to provide support and assistance in that regard. The act requires the administrator to license oil spill cleanup agents for use in response to oil spills. This bill would require the administrator, if dispersants are used in response to an oil spill, to submit to the Legislature a written notification of, and a written justification for, the use of dispersants and a report on the effectiveness of the dispersants used, as provided. Existing law establishes the Oil Spill Technical Advisory Committee and requires the committee to provide recommendations to, among other entities, the administrator on the implementation of the act. This bill would require the committee to convene a taskforce to evaluate the feasibility of using vessels of opportunity for oil spill response. The bill would require the taskforce to provide recommendations to the administrator and the Legislature on whether vessels of opportunity should be included in oil spill response planning. The act makes a person who causes or permits a spill or inland spill strictly liable for specified penalties for the spill on a per-gallon-released basis. The act provides that the amount of penalty is reduced by the amount of released oil that is recovered and properly disposed of. This bill would eliminate that reduction in the penalty by the amount of oil recovered and properly disposed of."
