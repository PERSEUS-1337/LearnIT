And (2) apply such policy to Transportation Improvement Program projects as well as to all aspects of the transportation project development process. Requires states and MPOs to certify that each road project has been reviewed for compliance with the policy statement and enhances the safety, convenience, and accessibility for all users of the transportation system to the extent reasonably possible.
