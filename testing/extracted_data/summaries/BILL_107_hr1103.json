    "content": "Teacher Liability Protection Act - Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to establish a new title XV, Teacher Liability Protection. Preempts State law except where it provides additional protection of teachers from liability. Makes this Act inapplicable to any civil action in State court against a teacher in which all parties are citizens of the State, if it enacts a statute electing that this Act not apply. Provides that no teacher in a school shall be liable, with specified exceptions, for harm caused by an act or omission on behalf of the school if the teacher was acting within the scope of employment or responsibilities relating to providing educational services. Limits punitive damages and liability for specified non-economic loss."
