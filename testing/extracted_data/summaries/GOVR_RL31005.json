    "content": "On June 27, the Administration submitted an amended fiscal year 2002 defense budget request to Congress. The request totaled $343.5 billion in funding for the national defense budget function,$32.9 billion above the amount originally enacted for FY2001, an 11% increase. The total includedfunding for the Department of Defense and for defense-related activities of the Department of Energyand other agencies. Both House and Senate versions of the DOD appropriations bill provided thetotal for national defense that the Administration requested. To accommodate that level, Congressadjusted limitations in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act and set aside provisions in this year'sconcurrent budget resolution that were designed to protect the social security surplus. With the onset of a recession last spring, along with higher defense spending and additional federal spending in response to the terrorist attacks, and lower revenues due to the tax cut, thegovernment is expected to run a deficit as well as use all of the surplus generated by social securityrevenues. With the destruction of the World Trade Center and the extensive damage to the Pentagonby terrorists on September 11th, congressional concerns shifted from whether the overall federalbudget could accommodate higher defense expenditures without spending the budget surplus toadding funding for defense programs that combat terrorism. Funding to aid the victims and provide for recovery from the attacks, for the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan, and for other programs to combat terrorism, was approved in the $40 billionEmergency Terrorism Response supplemental appropriations act ( P.L. 107-38 ) that passed CongressSeptember 14, 2001. Of that total, DOD receives $17.5 billion of the total funding in the EmergencyTerrorism Response supplemental, about 44% of the total (see P.L. 107-117 and H.Rept. 107-350 )with about 56% going to other agencies. Allocation of half of the $40 billion was included in P.L.107-117 / H.R. 3338 , the FY2002 DOD appropriations act, which was signed by thePresident on January 10, 2002. Although there had been broad bipartisan support for adding funds for recovery and response to the September 11 terrorism attacks, sharp differences emerged about whether the total amountwas sufficient and whether the allocations matched the most critical priorities, particularly for NewYork and other homeland security needs. The President, however, threatened to veto any spendingmeasure this year that went beyond the $40 billion. Faced with this threat, both the House and theSenate rejected proposals to add more emergency funding to H.R. 3338 when theypassed the bill. Instead, within the $20 billion total that was acceptable to the President, theconference bill shifts $3.4 billion of the $7.3 billion funds allocated to Defense by the Administrationto homeland security and recovery of New York. The conference version of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2002 was passed by the House and the Senate on December 13, 2001, and signed by the President on December 28, 2001( P.L. 107-107 / S. 1438 , H.Rept. 107-333 ). The Act provides $343.3 billion as requestedby the Administration and authorizes another round of base closures but delays the date to 2005,settling the chief issue in contention.
