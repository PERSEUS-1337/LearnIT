    "content": "Deep neural networks, in particular convolutional neural networks, have become highly effective tools for compressing images and solving inverse problems including denoising, inpainting, and reconstruction from few and noisy measurements. This success can be attributed in part to their ability to represent and generate natural images well. Contrary to classical tools such as wavelets, image-generating deep neural networks have a large number of parameters---typically a multiple of their output dimension---and need to be trained on large datasets. \n In this paper, we propose an untrained simple image model, called the deep decoder, which is a deep neural network that can generate natural images from very few weight parameters.\n The deep decoder has a simple architecture with no convolutions and fewer weight parameters than the output dimensionality. This underparameterization enables the deep decoder to compress images into a concise set of network weights, which we show is on par with wavelet-based thresholding. Further, underparameterization provides a barrier to overfitting, allowing the deep decoder to have state-of-the-art performance for denoising. The deep decoder is simple in the sense that each layer has an identical structure that consists of only one upsampling unit, pixel-wise linear combination of channels, ReLU activation, and channelwise normalization. This simplicity makes the network amenable to theoretical analysis, and it sheds light on the aspects of neural networks that enable them to form effective signal representations. Data models are central for signal and image processing and play a key role in compression and inverse problems such as denoising, super-resolution, and compressive sensing. These data models impose structural assumptions on the signal or image, which are traditionally based on expert knowledge. For example, imposing the assumption that an image can be represented with few non-zero wavelet coefficients enables modern (lossy) image compression BID1 and efficient denoising BID6 .In recent years, it has been demonstrated that for a wide range of imaging problems, from compression to denoising, deep neural networks trained on large datasets can often outperform methods based on traditional image models BID19 BID0 BID18 BID4 BID22 . This success can largely be attributed to the ability of deep networks to represent realistic images when trained on large datasets. Examples include learned representations via autoencoders BID12 and generative adversarial models BID8 . Almost exclusively , three common features of the recent success stories of using deep neural network for imaging related tasks are i) that the corresponding networks are over-parameterized (i.e., they have much more parameters than the dimension of the image that they represent or generate), ii) that the networks have a convolutional structure, and perhaps most importantly, iii) that the networks are trained on large datasets.An important exception that breaks with the latter feature is a recent work by Ulyanov et al. BID20 , which provides an algorithm, called the deep image prior (DIP), based on deep neural networks, that can solve inverse problems well without any training. Specifically, Ulyanov et al. demonstrated that fitting the weights of an over-parameterized deep convolutional network to a single image, together with strong regularization by early stopping of the optimization, performs competitively on a variety of image restoration problems. This result is surprising because it does not involve a training dataset, which means that the notion of what makes an image 'natural' is contained in a combination of the network structure and the regularization. However, without regularization the proposed network has sufficient capacity to overfit to noise, preventing meaningful image denoising.These prior works demonstrating the effectiveness of deep neural networks for image generation beg the question whether there may be a deep neural network model of natural images that is underparameterized and whose architecture alone, without algorithmic assistance, forms an efficient model for natural images.In this paper, we propose a simple image model in the form of a deep neural network that can represent natural images well while using very few parameters. This model thus enables image compression , denoising, and solving a variety of inverse problems with close to or state of the art performance. We call the network the deep decoder, due to its resemblance to the decoder part of an autoencoder. The network does not require training, and contrary to previous approaches, the network itself incorporates all assumptions on the data, is under-parameterized, does not involve convolutions, and has a simplicity that makes it amenable to theoretical analysis. The key contributions of this paper are as follows:\u2022 The network is under-parameterized. Thus, the network maps a lower-dimensional space to a higher-dimensional space, similar to classical image representations such as sparse wavelet representations. This feature enables image compression by storing the coefficients of the network after its weights are optimized to fit a single image. In Section 2, we demonstrate that the compression is on-par with wavelet thresholding BID1 , a strong baseline that underlies JPEG-2000. An additional benefit of underparameterization is that it provides a barrier to overfitting, which enables regularization of inverse problems.\u2022 The network itself acts as a natural data model. Not only does the network require no training (just as the DIP BID20 ); it also does not critically rely on regularization, for example by early stopping (in contrast to the DIP). The property of not involving learning has at least two benefits: The same network and code is usable for a number of applications, and the method is not sensitive to a potential misfit of training and test data.\u2022 The network does not use convolutions. Instead, the network does have pixelwise linear combinations of channels, and, just like in a convolutional neural network, the weights are shared among spatial positions. Nonetheless, these are not convolutions because they provide no spatial coupling between pixels, despite how pixelwise linear combinations are sometimes called '1x1 convolutions.' In contrast, the majority of the networks for image compression , restoration, and recovery have convolutional layers with filters of nontrivial spatial extent BID19 ; BID0 ; BID18 ; BID4 BID22 . This work shows that relationships characteristic of nearby pixels of natural images can be imposed directly by upsampling layers.\u2022 The network only consists of a simple combination of few building blocks, which makes it amenable to analysis and theory. For example, we prove that the deep decoder can only fit a small proportion of noise, which, combined with the empirical observation that it can represent natural images well, explains its denoising performance.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we first demonstrate that the deep decoder enables concise image representations. We formally introduce the deep decoder in Section 3. In Section 4, we show the performance of the deep decoder on a number of inverse problems such as denoising. In Section 5 we discuss related work, and finally, in Section 6 we provide theory and explanations on what makes the deep decoder work. In the previous sections we empirically showed that the deep decoder can represent images well and at the same time cannot fit noise well. In this section, we formally show that the deep decoder can only fit a small proportion of the noise, relative to the degree of underparameterization. In addition, we provide insights into how the components of the deep decoder contribute to representing natural images well, and we provide empirical observations on the sensitivity of the parameters and their distribution."
