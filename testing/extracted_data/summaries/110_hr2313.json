    "content": "Marine Renewable Energy Research and Development Act of 2007 - Instructs the Secretary of Energy to support research and demonstration programs to expand marine renewable energy production, including: (1) study and comparison of existing marine renewable energy extraction technologies, (2) investigation of utility grid and intermittency issues. (3) increased survivability of marine renewable energy extraction technologies, including development of corrosive-resistant materials. (4) a study of environmental impacts of such technologies and ways to address adverse impacts. And (5) establishment of protocols, in conjunction with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), for how the ocean community may best interact with marine renewable energy devices. Directs the Secretary to develop siting criteria for marine renewable energy generation projects prior to installation of such technologies. Directs the Secretary to award grants to institutions of higher education to establish National Marine Renewable Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Centers to serve as information clearinghouses for the marine renewable energy industry, collecting and disseminating information on best practices related to developing and managing enhanced marine renewable energy systems resources. Authorizes the Secretary to give special consideration to historically black colleges and universities and land grant universities that meet prescribed criteria. Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2012, excluding certain ocean energy programs already receiving funds under the Energy Policy Act of 2005."
