    "title": "An act to amend Section 1374.73 of the Health and Safety Code, and to amend Section 10144.51 of the Insurance Code, relating to health care coverage.",
    "content": "Existing law, the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act, requires the State Department of Developmental Services to contract with regional centers to provide services and supports to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. Existing law defines developmental disability for these purposes, to include, among other things, autism. Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care. A violation of those provisions is a crime. Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires every health care service plan contract and health insurance policy to provide coverage for behavioral health treatment for pervasive developmental disorder or autism until January 1, 2017, and defines \u201cbehavioral health treatment\u201d to mean specified services provided by, among others, a qualified autism service professional supervised and employed by a qualified autism service provider. For purposes of this provision, existing law defines a \u201cqualified autism service professional\u201d to mean a person who, among other requirements, is a behavioral service provider approved as a vendor by a California regional center to provide services as an associate behavior analyst, behavior analyst, behavior management assistant, behavior management consultant, or behavior management program pursuant to specified regulations adopted under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act. This bill would delete the sunset date, thereby extending the operation of these provisions indefinitely. By extending the operation of these provisions, the violation of which by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
