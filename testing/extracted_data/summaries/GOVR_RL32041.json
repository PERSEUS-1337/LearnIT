    "content": "Electric utility provisions are included in comprehensive energy legislation that has passedboth the House and Senate. The House passed H.R. 6 on April 11, 2003. On July 31,2003, the Senate suspended debate on S. 14 , the comprehensive energy bill that hadbeen reported by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. It then passed H.R. 6 withthe text of the Senate-passed version of H.R. 4 from the 107th Congress. For acomparison of the House- and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 6, see CRS Report RL32033, Omnibus Energy Legislation (H.R. 6): Side-by-Side Comparison of Non-TaxProvisions . Before debate on S. 14 was suspended, Senator Domenici proposed S.Amdt. 1412 on July 29, 2003, to completely replace the electricity title of S.14 as introduced in the Senate. The proposed amendment was withdrawn on July 31,2003. Although S.Amdt. 1412 is not included in the Senate-passed bill that will beconsidered in conference, there are indications that provisions of the amendment might be broughtup. Both the House-passed electricity provisions in H.R. 6 and those in S.Amdt. 1412 would give limited rate authority to the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission (FERC) over municipal and cooperative transmission systems; create an electricreliability organization; repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) and give FERCand state public utility commissions access to books and records; prospectively repeal the mandatorypurchase requirement of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA); explicitly prohibitround-trip trading; establish market transparency rules; protect native load consumers (existingcustomers); and increase criminal penalties under the Federal Power Act. Title VI of the House-passed H.R. 6 would, in part, provide for incentive-basedtransmission rates, allow transmission owners in certain instances to exercise the right of eminentdomain to site new transmission lines, create an electric reliability organization, and clarify the rightof transmission owners to serve existing customers (native load). Unlike the House-passed H.R.6, S.Amdt. 1412 does not contain provisions that would allow transmissionowners to exercise the right of eminent domain to site new transmission lines. S.Amdt. 1412 contains provisions that are not included in the House-passed H.R. 6 . These include provisions that prohibit FERC from requiring utilities to transferoperational control of transmission facilities to a regional transmission organization (RTO), giveauthority to power marketing administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to joinRTOs, remand the FERC Standard Market Design (SMD) notice of proposed rulemaking, andstrengthen FERC's merger review authority. This report will not be updated."
