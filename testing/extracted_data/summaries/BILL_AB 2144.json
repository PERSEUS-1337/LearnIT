    "content": "The Pharmacy Law provides for the licensure and regulation of pharmacists by the California State Board of Pharmacy. That law establishes requirements for the substitution of an alternative biological product when a pharmacist is filling a prescription order for a prescribed biological product. That law requires a pharmacist to inform the patient orally or in writing of harmful effects of a drug dispensed by prescription, if the drug poses substantial risk to the person consuming the drug when taken in combination with alcohol, or if the drug may impair a person\u2019s ability to drive a motor vehicle, whichever is applicable, and the board requires by regulation that warning is to be given. A knowing violation of the Pharmacy Law is a crime. The Pharmacy Law requires a health facility to establish and implement a written policy to ensure that each patient receives information regarding drugs given to the patient at the time of discharge or under certain other circumstances, including the use and storage of each drug, the precautions and relevant warnings, and the importance of compliance with directions. This bill would revise that patient information provision to require that a health facility require each patient to acknowledge in writing that the patient has received this information. Because a violation of this requirement would be a crime under certain circumstances, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The Pharmacy Law establishes requirements for the substitution of an alternative biological product when a pharmacist is filling a prescription order for a prescribed biological product. This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to those that substitution and warning provisions. provision. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
