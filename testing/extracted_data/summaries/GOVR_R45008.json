    "content": "In February 2014, protests over the Ukrainian government's decision to postpone concluding an association agreement that would lead to closer relations with the European Union (EU) culminated in violence and the collapse of then-President Viktor Yanukovych's government. The government that followed pledged to embrace pro-Western reforms, and an energized civil society supported its efforts. Within weeks, the new government was forced to confront Russian armed interventions in southern and eastern Ukraine. These culminated in Russia's occupation of Ukraine's Crimea region in March 2014 and a protracted conflict in eastern Ukraine, where observers consider that the Russian government has fostered and supported pro-Russian separatists. Even while waging a defensive conflict, Ukraine's government under President Petro Poroshenko has professed a commitment to economic reform, Western integration, and democratic norms. Many observers believe the Poroshenko government has made impressive strides in its reform agenda. Others consider that Ukraine's reforms remain fragile and that the government has progressed slowly in certain areas. International donors and domestic civil society organizations continue to encourage the Ukrainian government to implement necessary measures, including with regard to fighting corruption. After an economic decline in 2014-2015, some signs of financial and economic stabilization have emerged, due in part to international assistance including a multibillion dollar International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan package. Observers caution, however, that economic growth depends on continuation of critical reforms. The United States has long supported Ukraine's pro-Western orientation and reform efforts. It supports the restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity, including with respect to Crimea, as well as implementation of the Minsk agreements that would establish a cease-fire and conflict settlement in eastern Ukraine. In 2014, the United States, in coordination with the European Union and others, imposed sanctions on Russia for its actions in Ukraine. The United States is a leading contributor of foreign assistance to Ukraine, including over $300 million a year since FY2015 in nonmilitary, nonhumanitarian assistance. The United States also provides substantial military assistance to Ukraine, including via a newly established Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative that provides \"appropriate security assistance and intelligence support\" to help Ukraine defend against aggression and support its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Trump Administration has continued a policy of support to Ukraine. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Poroshenko have met twice, in June and September 2017. The Administration requested relatively substantial economic and military assistance to Ukraine for FY2018. In July 2017, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced the appointment of a new U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations, elevating the U.S. role in the conflict settlement process. Secretary Tillerson has stated repeatedly that Ukraine-related sanctions on Russia will remain in place \"until Moscow reverses the actions that triggered\" them. The U.S. Congress has actively participated in efforts to address the Ukraine conflict since its onset. Many Members have condemned Russia's annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine and pushed to impose and retain sanctions against Russia for its actions. Congress has also supported substantial economic and security assistance for Ukraine. Key legislation includes the Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-95), the Ukraine Freedom Support Act (P.L. 113-272), and the Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-44, Title II)."
