    "content": "Small Business Contract Equity Act of 2001 - Sets forth procedures for the bundling of procurement contracts that the Administrator of the Small Business Administration determines would result in the displacement of small business concerns. Permits waivers for unusual or unexpected exigencies. Amends the Small Business Act to prohibit agencies that fail to attain small business procurement participation goals from awarding or soliciting offers for bundled contracts. Requires such agencies to meet such goals relating to small businesses generally, those owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and those owned and controlled by women."
