    "content": "Clean Low-Emission Authorization Nationwide (CLEAN) Ports Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to award competitive grants to seaport governing bodies for the acquisition of fuel efficient and low-emission equipment and systems at port facilities, with a preference to seaport governing bodies that can demonstrate a pattern of successful implementation of energy use and pollution reduction activities. Sets aside up to 10 of federal funding to carry out this Act for research and development of fuel efficient port vehicle or vessel technologies that reduce carbon dioxide emissions, increase fuel efficiency in local port fleets, and lead to increased domestic production of fuel efficient or clean vehicles. Sets the federal share of costs for such activities at no more than 90."
