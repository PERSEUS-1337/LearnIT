Defines quot, spoofing servicequot. As a service that substitutes, or permits a user to substitute, another name or any number for display as the caller identification information for a call or text message. Requires the FCC to impose recordkeeping and reporting obligations on spoofing service providers. Authorizes the FCC to subpoena caller identification information transmitted by a subscriber to or customer of the spoofing service. Expands the definition quot, caller identification informationquot. To include text messages.
