    "content": "This report provides a summary of how Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits are funded through the Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF). The UTF in the U.S. Treasury is designated as a trust fund for federal accounting purposes. Although the UTF is a single trust fund, it has 59 accounts: the Employment Security Administration Account (ESAA), the Extended Unemployment Compensation Account (EUCA), the Federal Unemployment Account (FUA), 53 state accounts (including District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands), the Federal Employees Compensation Account (FECA), and two accounts related to the Railroad Retirement Board. Federal unemployment taxes are credited to the ESAA; each state's unemployment taxes are credited to the state's unemployment account. Federal taxes pay for administration grants to the states. State unemployment taxes are dedicated to pay for regular UC benefits. The extended benefits (EB) program is funded 50% by the federal government and 50% by the states."
