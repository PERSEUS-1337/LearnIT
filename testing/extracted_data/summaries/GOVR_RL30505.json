    "content": "House and the Senate action on annual FY2001 defense funding was completed in December when Congress approved the FY2001 omnibus appropriations bill. In all, Congress provided about$310.0 billion for national defense, including $287.8 billion in the Department of DefenseAppropriations bill. The national defense total is about $4.7 billion above the Administration'srequest. The conference agreement on the FY2001 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations/Omnibus appropriations bill, H.R. 4577 , approved in the House and Senate on December 15,provides some additional FY2001 funds for the Department of Defense, including $150 million torepair the USS Cole, $100 million for classified programs related to operations overseas, and $43.5million for military construction. Section 1403 of the bill also makes an across-the-board cut of0.22% in all FY2001 discretionary funds, including defense, though military personnel funding isexempted from the reduction. In all, this will reduce FY2001 defense funding by $520 million. On October 11, the House approved an a conference agreement on the FY2001 defense authorization bill, H.R. 4205 , by a vote of 382-31. The Senate approved the agreementon October 12 by a vote of 90-3. The President signed the bill into law on October 30 ( P.L.106-398 ). A conference agreement on the defense appropriations bill, H.R. 4576 , wasapproved in the House on July 19 and in the Senate on July 27, and the President signed the bill onAugust 9 ( P.L. 106-259 ). Earlier the House and the Senate approved a conference agreement on theFY2001 military construction appropriations bill, H.R. 4425 , and the President signedthe measure into law on July 13 ( P.L. 106-246 ). This bill includes supplemental appropriations forFY2000 military operations in Kosovo and Colombia, for increased fuel and medical care costs, andfor some other defense programs. In action on key issues, authorization conferees agreed to (1) provide a permanent guarantee of health care for Medicare-eligible military retirees that was included in the Senate bill, but thatexpired after two years; (2) provide compensation for workers made ill by exposure to toxicmaterials in the nation's nuclear weapons program; (3) drop a House-passed provision mandatingtroop withdrawals from Kosovo if allies do not meet burdensharing commitments (though the billincludes extensive reporting requirements); and (4) drop anti-hate crimes legislation that wasattached to the Senate-passed bill. The retiree health care measure will make all military retireeseligible for health care through the military health care system. Conferees also agreed to acomprehensive retail and mail-order pharmacy benefit. According to preliminary CBO estimates,the bill's retiree health care provisions will cost $40 billion more over the next 10-years than benefitsDOD currently provides. Several major weapons programs also received attention in this year's defense debate. The authorization and appropriations conference agreements reduced funding for the Joint Strike Fighterbecause of program delays. The authorization and appropriations bills also approved additionalfunding for the Army's \"transformation\" plan, including funds to equip a second medium-weightbrigade in FY2001. The authorization conference, however, included a requirement that the Armycarry out additional comparative testing of armored vehicles before outfitting a third brigade.
