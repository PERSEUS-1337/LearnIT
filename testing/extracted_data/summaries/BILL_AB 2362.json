    "title": "AB 2362",
    "content": "Existing law, the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act, regulates the creation and governance of common interest developments, which are managed by associations. Existing law generally provides that an association is responsible for maintaining common areas in the development and owners of separate interests are responsible for their interests. Existing law permits an association to require the removal of an occupant of a separate interest for those times and periods as may be necessary for the effective treatment of wood-destroying pests. Existing law generally requires a landlord or his or her authorized agent to provide notice to tenants, and under certain circumstances tenants of adjacent units, of the use of pesticides at the tenant\u2019s dwelling unit or in common areas if the landlord or authorized agent applies any pesticide without a licensed pest control operator. This bill would require a common interest development association or its authorized agent to provide notice to an owner and, if applicable, a tenant of a separate interest, and under certain circumstances to owners and, if applicable, tenants of adjacent separate interests, if pesticide is to be applied without a licensed pest control operator to a separate interest or to a common area. The bill would prescribe the contents of the notice and how it is to be provided. The bill would authorize an owner or tenant to agree to immediate pesticide application and would prescribe a revised notification procedure in this instance. The bill would also permit the notice to be posted, as specified, after the pesticide application if the pest poses an imminent threat to health and safety."
