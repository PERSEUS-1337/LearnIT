    "content": "Simon Wiesenthal Holocaust Education Assistance Act This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Department of Education (ED) to award competitive grants to educational organizations to carry out proposed or existing Holocaust education programs. ED may contract with a nonprofit organization to encourage, accept, and administer private donations and gifts for funding the education programs. Grants may not be used to supplant nonfederal funds the grantees would otherwise have used for Holocaust education programs."
