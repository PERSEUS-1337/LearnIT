    "title": "An act to amend Sections 25185.6, 25358.1, 25358.2, and 25390.5 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to hazardous materials.",
    "content": "The Hazardous Waste Control Law authorizes the Department of Toxic Substances Control and authorized local enforcement officers and agencies to require specified persons to furnish and transmit certain information relating to the person\u2019s ability to pay for or perform a response action, and further authorizes those entities to require any person who has information regarding another person\u2019s activities that relate to the ability of the person to pay for or perform a response action to also furnish and transmit the information. Existing law makes those provisions applicable only if there is a reasonable basis to believe that there has been or may be a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance and only for the purpose of determining how to finance a response action or otherwise for the purpose of enforcing the Hazardous Waste Control Law. A violation of the Hazardous Waste Control Law is a crime. This bill would make those provisions applicable also if there is a reasonable basis to believe that there has been or may be a release or threatened release of hazardous wastes or hazardous material and also for the purpose of determining how to finance a corrective action. Existing law authorizes an officer or employee of the department and specified other persons to require any person who has or may have information relevant to specified matters relating to the release of hazardous substances to furnish and transmit that information. Existing law authorizes the department to disclose trade secrets received by the department pursuant to the Hazardous Waste Control Law only under specified circumstances. This bill would require the person required to furnish and transmit the information to pay for any costs of photocopying and transmitting the information. The bill would limit the disclosure by the department of information, including trade secrets, received by the department pursuant to these provisions of the Hazardous Waste Control Law, specifying the parties to whom that disclosure is proper and requiring the disclosures be in connection with the department\u2019s responsibilities under that law. The bill would require this information to be made available to governmental agencies for use in making studies and for use in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the information. The bill would make conforming and other nonsubstantive changes. Because the bill\u2019s provisions would expand the scope of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
