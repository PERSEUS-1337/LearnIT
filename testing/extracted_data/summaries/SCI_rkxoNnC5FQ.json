    "content": "Deep Learning for Computer Vision depends mainly on the source of supervision. Photo-realistic simulators can generate large-scale automatically labeled synthetic data, but introduce a domain gap negatively impacting performance. We propose a new unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm, called SPIGAN, relying on Simulator Privileged Information (PI) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). We use internal data from the simulator as PI during the training of a target task network. We experimentally evaluate our approach on semantic segmentation. We train the networks on real-world Cityscapes and Vistas datasets, using only unlabeled real-world images and synthetic labeled data with z-buffer (depth) PI from the SYNTHIA dataset. Our method improves over no adaptation and state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation techniques. Learning from as little human supervision as possible is a major challenge in Machine Learning. In Computer Vision, labeling images and videos is the main bottleneck towards achieving large scale learning and generalization. Recently, training in simulation has shown continuous improvements in several tasks, such as optical flow BID32 , object detection BID31 BID52 BID47 BID36 , tracking BID10 , pose and viewpoint estimation BID44 BID34 BID46 , action recognition BID9 , and semantic segmentation BID15 BID39 BID38 . However, large domain gaps between synthetic and real domains remain as the main handicap of this type of strategies. This is often addressed by manually labeling some amount of real-world target data to train the model on mixed synthetic and real-world labeled data (supervised domain adaptation). In contrast, several recent unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms have leveraged the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) BID14 for pixel-level adaptation in this context BID1 BID45 . These methods often use simulators as black-box generators of (x, y) input / output training samples for the desired task.Our main observation is that simulators internally know a lot more about the world and how the scene is formed, which we call Privileged Information (PI). This Privileged Information includes physical properties that might be useful for learning. This additional information z is not available in the real-world and is, therefore, generally ignored during learning. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial learning algorithm, called SPIGAN, to leverage Simulator PI for GAN-based unsupervised learning of a target task network from unpaired unlabeled real-world data.We jointly learn four different networks: (i) a generator G (to adapt the pixel-level distribution of synthetic images to be more like real ones), (ii) a discriminator D (to distinguish adapted and real images), (iii) a task network T (to predict the desired label y from image x), and (iv) a privileged network P trained on both synthetic images x and adapted ones G(x) to predict their associated privileged information z. Our main contribution is a new method to leverage PI from a simulator via the privileged network P , which acts as an auxiliary task and regularizer to the task network T , the main output of our SPIGAN learning algorithm.We evaluate our approach on semantic segmentation in urban scenes, a challenging real-world task. We use the standard Cityscapes BID6 and Vistas BID33 datasets as target real-world data (without using any of the training labels) and SYNTHIA BID39 as simulator output. Although our method applies to any kind of PI that can be predicted via a deep network (optical flow, instance segmentation, object detection, material properties, forces, ...), we consider one of the most common and simple forms of PI available in any simulator: depth from its z-buffer. We show that SPIGAN can successfully learn a semantic segmentation network T using no real-world labels, partially bridging the sim-to-real gap (see Figure 1 ). SPIGAN also outperforms related state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a brief review of related works. Section 3 presents our SPIGAN unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm using simulator privileged information. We report our quantitative experiments on semantic segmentation in Section 4, and conclude in Section 5. In this section we present our evaluation of the SPIGAN algorithm in the context of adapting a semantic segmentation network from SYNTHIA to Cityscapes. Depth maps from SYNTHIA are used as PI in the proposed algorithm.We compare our results to several state-of-art domain adaptation algorithms, including FCNs in the wild (FCNs wild) BID21 , Curriculum DA (CDA) , Learning from synthetic data (LSD) BID42 , and Class-balanced Self-Training (CBST) BID59 .Quantitative results for these methods are shown in Table 1 for the semantic segmentation task on the target domain of Cityscapes (validation set). As reference baselines, we include results training only on source images and non-adapted labels. We also provide our algorithm performance without the PI for comparison (i.e., \u03b3 = 0 in Eq. 1, named \"SPIGAN-no-PI\").Results show that on Cityscapes SPIGAN achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation adaptation in terms of mean IoU. A finer analysis of the results attending to individual classes suggests that the use of PI helps to estimate layout-related classes such as road and sidewalk and object-related classes such as person, rider, car, bus and motorcycle. SPIGAN achieves an improvement of 3% in 320 \u00d7 640, 1.0% in 512 \u00d7 1024, in mean IoU with respect to the non-PI method. This improvement is thanks to the regularization provided by P (x; \u03b8 P ) during training, which decreases the number of artifacts as shown in Figure 5 . This comparison, therefore, confirms our main contribution: a general approach to leveraging synthetic data and PI from the simulator to improve generalization performance across the sim-to-real domain gap. We present SPIGAN, a novel method for leveraging synthetic data and Privileged Information (PI) available in simulated environments to perform unsupervised domain adaptation of deep networks. Our approach jointly learns a generative pixel-level adaptation network together with a target task network and privileged information models. We showed that our approach is able to address large domain gaps between synthetic data and target real-world domains, including for challenging realworld tasks like semantic segmentation of urban scenes. For future work, we plan to investigate SPIGAN applied to additional tasks, with different types of PI that can be obtained from simulation."
