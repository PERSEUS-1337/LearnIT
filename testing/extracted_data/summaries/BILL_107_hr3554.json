Conditions the transfer on California: (1) submitting and complying with a management plan that has been developed with the input of an advisory board and that provides that the primary purpose of the wildlife area is flood control. And (2) agreeing not to acquire for the wildlife area any right to water within the Sacramento River Watershed until after it has completed the appropriate environmental documentation and such acquisition is approved by the board of supervisors for each originating source county and destination county. Permits the State Board of Reclamation to increase the flood conveyance capacity of the Yolo Bypass if it determines that such an increase is necessary to protect land, property, or people in the State that are within or outside of the boundaries of the wildlife area. Requires the advisory board to: (1) develop, submit, and provide local oversight of the management plan, and (2) advise California regarding management of the wildlife area."
