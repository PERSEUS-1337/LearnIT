    "content": "Medicare Consumer Bill of Rights Conforming Act of 1998 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require a MedicareChoice organization that requires or provides for an enrollee to designate a participating primary care provider to permit such an individual to designate a participating physician who specializes in obstetrics and gynecology as the individual's primary care provider. Declares that, if such an individual has not designated such a provider as a primary care provider, the organization: (1) may not require authorization or referral by the individual's primary care provider, or otherwise, for coverage of routine gynecological care and pregnancy-related services provided by a participating health care professional who specializes in obstetrics and gynecology to the extent such care is otherwise covered. Authorizes the organization to treat the ordering of other gynecological care by such a participating physician as the authorization of the primary care provider with respect to such care under the MedicareChoice plan. Requires a MedicareChoice organization to permit an enrollee undergoing a course of treatment from a health care provider when the contract between organization and provider is terminated to continue or be covered with respect to the course of treatment with the provider during a specified transitional period."
