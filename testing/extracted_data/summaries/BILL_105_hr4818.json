    "content": "Asset-Building for Working Americans Act - Amends part A (TANF) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA), as well as SSA titles XVI (SSI) and XIX (Medicaid), to require States to disregard for the following 12-month period any refunds or advance payments of the earned income tax credit (EITC) in determining eligibility for benefits under TANF, SSI, and Medicaid. Establishes up to a two percent reduction in the next fiscal year's grant to any State as a penalty for failure to disregard such payments. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to require a similar disregard for EITC payments under public housing and rental assistance programs."
