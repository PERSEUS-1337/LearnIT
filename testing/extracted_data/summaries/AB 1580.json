    "title": "An act to add Sections 1785.11.9, 1785.11.10, and 1785.11.11 to the Civil Code, relating to consumer credit reports.",
    "content": "Existing state law defines and regulates consumer credit reports and authorizes a consumer to place a security freeze on his or her credit report by making a request in writing by mail to a consumer credit reporting agency. Existing state law requires a consumer credit reporting agency to place the security freeze on the consumer\u2019s credit report no later than 3 business days after receiving the consumer\u2019s request. This bill would require a consumer credit reporting agency to place a security freeze for a protected consumer, defined as an individual who is under 16 years of age at the time a request for the placement of a security freeze is made, an incapacitated person or a protected individual for whom a guardian or conservator has been appointed, or a person under the jurisdiction of a county welfare department or county probation department who has been placed in a foster care setting and is under 16 years of age at the time a request for a security freeze is made, upon that consumer\u2019s representative\u2019s request and compliance with certain requirements. The bill would require a consumer credit reporting agency to send written confirmation of the security freeze to the address on file within 10 days of the placement of the security freeze."
