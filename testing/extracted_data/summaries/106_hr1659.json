    "content": "Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (VCCLEA) to authorize appropriations for training, recruitment, hiring, and oversight assistance to New York, New York, Chicago, Illinois, Los Angeles, California, Washington, D. C. Charlotte, North Carolina, and to one police department from each of the four geographical regions of the country, two of which have less than 100 police officers and two of which have less than 300 police officers. Authorizes the assistance to include funding for equipment, not to exceed ten percent of the amount of the grant made to each city. Directs that money appropriated for such assistance be distributed to those cities in proportion to the size of their police departments and upon receipt of written assurances from the police department that the department will provide access to its operations to the Commission. Amends VCCLEA to require a State or States organized as multi-State compacts, to be eligible to receive a Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing Incentive Grant, to include in the application assurances that the State will follow the guidelines established by the Attorney General in reporting, on a quarterly basis, specified data on deaths of persons in custody."
