    "content": "Targeting Child Predators Act of 2017 This bill amends the federal criminal code to modify the process for issuing a nondisclosure requirement in connection with administrative subpoenas in four categories of investigations: health care offenses, child sexual exploitation or abuse, unregistered sex offenders, and imminent threats to an individual protected by the US Secret Service. It lengthens the period of time during which a recipient of an administrative subpoena is prohibited from disclosure. The bill subjects a nondisclosure requirement to judicial review, requires the administrative subpoena to include notice of the availability of judicial review, and establishes a process for judicial review."
