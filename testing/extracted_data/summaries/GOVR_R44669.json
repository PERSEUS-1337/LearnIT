    "content": "Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Congress increased focus on state and local homeland security assistance by, among other things, establishing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and authorizing DHS to administer federal homeland security grant programs. These homeland security grants have been administered by numerous DHS entities, and these grants have focused on such preparedness activities as assistance to states and localities to prepare and respond to terrorist attacks, securing critical infrastructure such as rail and ports, securing nonprofit (nongovernmental) organizations, and securing high-threat and high-risk urban areas. If homeland security continues to be of national interest, how homeland security assistance is funded, administered, and allocated will be of importance to Congress. Since Congress would continue to conduct oversight and legislate on homeland security assistance to states and localities, Members may elect to consider policy options that anticipate, as well as react to, future catastrophes. Throughout the past 15 years, there has been a continued discussion on the number and purpose of the grant programs, state and locality use of grant program funding, and the funding amounts annually appropriated to the grant programs. All of these issues identify a potential need for Congress to continue its debate and consider legislation related to federal homeland security assistance for states and localities and the nation's overall emergency preparedness. One major issue remains, and is comprised of these other issues, and that is whether or not these grants are effective in assisting states and localities in meeting the national preparedness goals."
