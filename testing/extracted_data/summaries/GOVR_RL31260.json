    "content": "Digital television (DTV) is a new television service representing the most significant development in television technology since the advent of color television. DTV can provide movie theater quality pictures and sound, a wider screen, better color rendition, multiple video programming or a single program of high definition television (HDTV), and other new services currently being developed. The nationwide deployment of digital television is a complex and multifaceted enterprise. A successful deployment requires the development by content providers of compelling digital programming; the delivery of digital signals to consumers by broadcast television stations, as well as cable and satellite television systems; and the widespread purchase and adoption by consumers of digital television equipment. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-104) provided that initial eligibility for any DTV licenses issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should be limited to existing broadcasters. Because DTV signals cannot be received through the existing analog television broadcasting system, the FCC decided to phase in DTV over a period of years, so that consumers would not have to immediately purchase new digital television sets or converters. Thus, broadcasters were given new spectrum for digital signals, while retaining their existing spectrum for analog transmission so that they can simultaneously transmit analog and digital signals to their broadcasting market areas. Congress and the FCC set a target date of December 31, 2006, for broadcasters to cease broadcasting their analog signals and return their existing analog television spectrum to be auctioned for commercial services (such as broadband) or used for public safety communications. However, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) allowed a station to delay the return of its analog spectrum if 15% or more of the television households in its market did not subscribe to a multi-channel digital service and did not have digital television sets or converters. Given the slower-than-expected pace at which digital televisions have been introduced into American homes, and given the impetus to reclaim analog spectrum for commercial uses and public safety, the 109th Congress enacted the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-171), which established a \"date certain\" digital transition deadline of February 17, 2009. A key issue in the Congressional debate over the digital transition continues to be addressing the millions of American over-the-air households whose existing analog televisions will require converter boxes in order to receive digital signals when the analog signal is turned off. P.L. 109-171 established a digital-to-analog converter box program\u2014administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the Department of Commerce\u2014that will partially subsidize consumer purchases of converter boxes. Specifically, Congress is actively overseeing the activities of federal agencies responsible for the digital transition\u2014the FCC and the NTIA\u2014while assessing whether additional federal efforts are necessary, particularly with respect to public education and outreach. This report will be updated as events warrant."
