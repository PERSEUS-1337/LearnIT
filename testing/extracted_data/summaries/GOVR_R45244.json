    "content": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148) was signed into law on March 23, 2010. The law comprises numerous provisions in 10 titles. The provisions in Titles I-VIII largely relate to how health care in the United States is financed, organized, and delivered. Title IX contains revenue provisions. Title X reauthorizes the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, establishes some new programs and requirements, and amends provisions included in the other nine titles of the ACA. On March 30, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (HCERA; P.L. 111-152) was signed into law, which included new provisions and amended several ACA provisions. Since enactment of the ACA and HCERA, lawmakers have repeatedly debated the laws' implementation and considered bills to repeal, defund, or otherwise amend them. This report summarizes legislative actions taken during the 111th-115th Congresses to modify the health care-related provisions of the ACA and HCERA. The first part of the report provides a brief overview of the laws' core provisions and their impact on federal spending and health insurance coverage as context for the other material presented in the report. The second part of the report includes Table 2, which summarizes laws enacted during the 111th-115th Congresses that modified ACA or HCERA provisions. The third part of the report lists bills passed in the House or the Senate during the 111th-115th Congresses that would have modified ACA or HCERA provisions, had they been enacted. Identifying legislation that modifies the ACA and HCERA has become increasingly difficult over the years. This is because of the vast number of ACA and HCERA provisions, their complexity, and the fact that these provisions are codified in many different parts of the U.S. Code. As a result, the legislation presented in this report's tables may not include all enacted legislation that modifies the ACA or HCERA, or all House- or Senate-passed legislation that would have modified the ACA or HCERA, had it been enacted. Due to the increasing complexity of tracking such legislation and concerns about the ability to do so authoritatively, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) does not intend to update this report."
