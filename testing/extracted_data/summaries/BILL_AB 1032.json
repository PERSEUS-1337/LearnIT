    "title": "AB 1032",
    "content": "The Diesel Fuel Tax Law imposes a tax upon the removal, entry, sale, delivery, or specified use of diesel fuel, at a specified rate per gallon. That law provides for a reimbursement of the amount of that tax to persons who have used that tax-paid fuel in specified nontaxable uses, which is allowed through a claim for refund. This bill would allow a claim for refund for amounts of tax paid on the biodiesel fuel portion of dyed blended biodiesel fuel removed from an approved terminal at the terminal rack, as provided, to the extent a supplier can show that the tax on that biodiesel fuel has been paid by the same supplier."
