    "content": "The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation was created pursuant to language contained in the National Defense Authorization Act for 2001 ( H.R. 5408 ), which was incorporated into the H.R. 4205 conference report ( H.Rept. 106-945 ), enacted into law on October 30, 2000 ( P.L. 106-398 ). The Institute was created by Congress in response to a legislative initiative sponsored by the Clinton Administration. When the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation was formally established in Section 2166 of Title 10 U.S.C., the authorities of its controversial predecessor, the U.S. Army School of the Americas, were repealed. This report provides background on the purpose, structure, and other aspects of the new Institute. It will be revised as events warrant."
