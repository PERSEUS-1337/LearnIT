    "title": "AB 1333",
    "content": "Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission, in consultation with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, to identify all potential cost-effective energy efficiency savings and establish efficiency targets for an electrical or gas corporation. Existing law requires a local publicly owned electric utility, in procuring energy, to acquire all cost-effective energy efficiency and demand response resources that are cost-effective, reliable, and feasible. This bill would require electric and gas corporations and local publicly owned electric and gas utilities to require recipients of rebates or incentives from their residential or commercial energy efficiency or weatherization programs to install demand response infrastructure on the property for which the rebates or incentives are provided. Under the Public Utilities Act, electrical corporations are required to file with the Public Utilities Commission a standard tariff for electricity purchased from certain electric generation facilities. The act declares it is the policy of this state and the intent of the Legislature to encourage electrical generation from eligible renewable energy resources. This bill would specifically include in those eligible renewable energy resources those that can be used to meet peak demand. The bill also would make nonsubstantive changes and would correct erroneous cross-references."
