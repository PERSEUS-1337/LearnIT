    "content": "Sewage Sludge in Food Production Consumer Notification Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Egg Products Inspection Act, the Federal Meat Inspection Act, and the Poultry Products Inspection Act to deem as adulterated food that is: (1) produced on land on which sewage sludge was applied. (2) derived from poultry that were raised, or that consumed animal feed produced, on such land. And (3) derived from livestock that grazed, or consumed animal feed produced, on such land. Permits exceptions if: (1) the application of sewage sludge ended more than one year before producing food, raising poultry, producing animal feed, or grazing livestock. (2) the food labeling includes notice that the product was produced on such land. Or (3) a sign providing such notice is posted in close proximity to the product for those foods generally offered for sale without labeling. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to modify the prohibition on the use of sewage sludge in organic food production under the National Organic Program of the Department of Agriculture (USDA)."
