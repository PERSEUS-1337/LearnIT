    "content": "Saving Lives, Saving Costs Act - Establishes a framework for health care liability lawsuits to undergo review by independent medical review panels if health care professionals allege adherence to applicable clinical practice guidelines in the provision of health care goods or services. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to publish clinical practice guidelines that have been provided and maintained by national or state medical societies or medical specialty societies designated by the Secretary. Sets forth standards for the development of guidelines, including related to transparency, the composition of the panel, and the review of existing evidence. Declares that this Act does not preempt or supersede any state or federal law that imposes greater procedural or substantive protections for health care providers and health care organizations from liability, loss, or damages than those provided under this Act nor does it create a cause of action or preempt any defenses otherwise available. Allows a defendant to remove any health care liability action brought in a state court to a district court. Requires an independent medical review in health care liability actions if the eligible professionals allege that they adhered to applicable clinical practice guideline. Sets forth procedures for the use of the panel's findings at trial. Enables defendants to recover costs and attorneys' fees from plaintiffs if the defendants prevail subsequent to preliminary findings in their favor."
