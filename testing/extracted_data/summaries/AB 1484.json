    "title": "An act to add Sections 35035.5 and 35037 to the Education Code, relating to teachers.\nAn act to add Section 8209.5 to the Education Code, relating to early childhood education.",
    "content": "The Child Care and Development Services Act has a purpose of providing a comprehensive, coordinated, and cost-effective system of child care and development services for children from infancy to 13 years of age and their parents, including a full range of supervision, health, and support services through full- and part-time programs. This bill would exclude from income the amount of the basic allowance for housing provided to an individual who is on federal active duty, state active duty, active duty for special work, or Active Guard and Reserve duty in the military that is equal to the lowest rate of the allowance for the military housing area in which the individual resides for purposes of determining eligibility for child care and development services. Existing law requires the superintendent of each school district to assign employees employed in positions requiring certification qualifications to positions in which they are to serve, subject to the approval of the governing board of the school district, and authorizes the superintendent of each school district to transfer teachers consistent with the adopted school district policy concerning transfer of teachers from one school to another school within the school district. Existing law requires each school district to evaluate and assess certificated employee performance as it reasonably relates to pupil academic progress, the instructional techniques and strategies used by the employee, the employee\u2019s adherence to curricular objectives, and the establishment and maintenance of a suitable learning environment, within the scope of the employee\u2019s responsibilities. This bill would prohibit the superintendent of a school district from transferring or assigning a certificated employee with the primary responsibility of being the classroom teacher of record to a schoolsite if the transfer or assignment would result in the reduction of the average effective teacher experience factor at the schoolsite to less than 90 of the average effective teaching experience factor in the school district for schools of the same type, as specified. Notwithstanding that provision, the bill would require the State Board of Education to waive the prohibition upon the request of the governing board of a school district if the governing board of the school district meets certain conditions, including, among others, demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the state board, that the certificated employee subject to transfer or assignment has the appropriate credential necessary to teach a specific course, grade level, or program of study, and there is a critical shortage for certificated employees with such a credential in the local labor market. The bill also would prohibit a pupil from being knowingly assigned to a classroom where the teacher of record received an unsatisfactory performance rating in the most recent evaluation and assessment of the employee\u2019s job performance unless the employee is actively participating in a California Peer Assistance and Review Program or other specified conditions are met. The bill would authorize the governing board of a school district to waive the prohibition on an individual basis, as provided. To the extent this bill would impose additional duties on school districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
