    "content": "Veterans' Job Protection Act - Revises provisions relating to authorized employee actions against a State or private employer for the enforcement of certain veterans' reemployment rights. Authorizes a person who receives from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs a notification that efforts to resolve a complaint were unsuccessful to request that the Secretary refer such complaint to the Attorney General (AG) for commencement of an action for relief in the appropriate US district court. Allows a person, in lieu of proceedings through the AG or after being refused representation by the AG, to commence his or her own action against a State employer, requiring such action to be brought in the name of the United States. Outlines procedures with respect to such an action, allowing the United States to intervene and proceed with the action. Provides that the United States shall not be liable for expenses incurred by an individual in bringing such an action."
