    "content": "Landmine Use Moratorium Act of 1995 - Directs the President to support, at the 1995 United Nations review conference, proposals to modify Protocol II to the 1980 Conventional Weapons Convention to implement the US goal of the elimination of antipersonnel landmines. Declares a US moratorium, for a one year period beginning three years after enactment of this Act, on the use of such landmines except along internationally recognized national borders within a perimeter marked area monitored by military personnel and protected by adequate means to ensure the exclusion of civilians. Urges the President to encourage other nations to join in such moratorium. Prohibits the United States from selling, licensing for export, or transferring any defense article or service to a foreign country that sells, exports, or transfers antipersonnel landmines. Authorizes the President to waive such prohibition, after notice to the Congress, if an emergency exists which makes such waiver vital to the interest of the United States."
