(4) make a further determination at the end of the applicable grace period as to whether the small business would still be subject to the sanction. And (5) upon a negative determination, waive the sanction.

Renders any sanction imposed in violation of the requirements of this Actnbsp. As having no force or effect. Requires: (1) federal agencies to report annually to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman on the implementation of the requirements of this Act, and (2) the Ombudsman to include such information in a currently-required annual report to Congress."
