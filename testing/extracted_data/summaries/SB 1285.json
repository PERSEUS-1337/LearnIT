    "title": "An act to add Section 23826.13 to the Business and Professions Code, relating to alcoholic beverages.",
    "content": "The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, administered by the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, regulates the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages and the granting of licenses for the manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages within the state. The act also provides for a limitation on the amount of on-sale general licenses that may be issued by the department based on the population of the county in which the licensed premises are located, as provided. Existing law also provides for various annual fees for the issuance of alcoholic beverage licenses, depending on the type of license issued. This bill would, beginning January 1, 2017, provide an exception to the license limitation for a county of the 6th class, as specified, for 5 new original neighborhood-restricted special on-sale general licenses for premises located within specified census tracts in that county, subject to specified requirements. This bill would impose an original fee and annual renewal fee for the license, which would be deposited in the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund, and would require an applicant for this license to submit a specified application, submitted under the penalty of perjury, to the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. This bill would also require the applicant to submit a signed verification by the local government in which the licensed premises would be located stating that the applicant has completed certain preapplication requirements. By requiring an applicant to submit an application under penalty of perjury, thereby expanding the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason and that no reimbursement shall be made pursuant to those statutory provisions for costs mandated by the state pursuant to this act, but would recognize that local agencies and school districts may pursue any available remedies to seek reimbursement for these costs. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City and County of San Francisco."
