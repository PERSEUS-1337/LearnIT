    "title": "AB 319",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes a school district or school to provide a comprehensive program in first aid or cardiopulmonary resuscitation training, or both, to pupils and employees in accordance with specified guidelines. This bill would instead require a school district or school to provide a comprehensive program in first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation training to pupils and employees in accordance with specified guidelines, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program. Existing law establishes a list of courses that a pupil in a school district is required to complete in grades 9 to 12, inclusive, in order to receive a diploma of graduation from high school, including 2 courses in physical education unless exempted. This bill would require require, commencing with the 2017\u201318 academic year, the governing board of a school district, and the governing body of a charter school, offering instruction to pupils in grades 9 to 12, inclusive, to provide instruction on performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of an automated external defibrillator as part of a physical education course or another course required for graduation, as provided. The bill would also make conforming changes to a related code section. By imposing additional requirements on school districts and charter schools, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
