    "title": "AB 520",
    "content": "The California Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1973 provides the Division of Occupational Safety and Health within the Department of Industrial Relations with the power, jurisdiction, and supervision over all employment and places of employment necessary to enforce and administer all occupational health and safety laws and to protect employees. The Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board, an independent entity within the department, has the exclusive authority to adopt occupational safety and health standards within the state. This bill would require the board, by June 1, 2017, to adopt a standard that requires an employer performing corrosion prevention work on industrial and infrastructure projects to use trained and certified personnel, as specified. Because certain violations of these new requirements would be a misdemeanor, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing law provides for apprenticeship programs within the Division of Apprenticeship Standards within the Department of Industrial Relations, sponsored by specific entities and employers, and requires the Chief of the Division of Apprenticeship Standards to perform various functions with respect to apprenticeship programs and the welfare of apprentices. Existing law also establishes the California Apprenticeship Council within the Division of Apprenticeship Standards, and requires the council to aid the director in formulating policies with respect to apprentice regulation. Existing law requires the Chief of the Division of Apprenticeship Standards and the California Apprenticeship Council to report annually through the Director of Industrial Relations on the activities of the division and the council, and further requires that the report include specified information with respect to apprenticeship programs in this state. This bill would require the report to include an analysis of any apprenticeship standards or regulations that were proposed or adopted in the previous year. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
