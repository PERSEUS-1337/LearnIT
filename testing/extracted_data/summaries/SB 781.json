    "title": "An act to amend Section 10123.147 of the Insurance Code, relating to insurance.",
    "content": "Exiting law requires insurers issuing group or individual policies of health insurance that covers hospital, medical, or surgical expenses to reimburse each complete claim, as specified, as soon as practical but no later than 30 working days after receipt of the complete claim. Within 30 working days after receipt of the claim, an insurer can contest or deny a claim, as specified. An insurer is required to pay the greater of $15 per year or interest, as specified, on a claim that is not contested or denied and that has not been delivered to the claimant within 30 working days after receipt. Existing law also authorizes the insurer to request reasonable additional information about the claim, and requires the service provider making the claim to submit the relevant information requested to the insurer within 15 working days. Existing law allows the insurer 30 working days after receipt of the additional information to reconsider the claim, and requires the insurer to pay the greater of $15 per year, or interest, as specified, on a claim that is undergoing reconsideration and that has not been delivered to the claimant within 30 working days after receipt of the additional information. Under existing law these requirements are not applicable to claims to which specified exceptions apply, and the insurer is required to give written notice to the provider if any of those exceptions apply within 30 working days of receipt of the claim. This bill would require an insurer, under those circumstances, to instead pay to the claimant the greater of $25 per year or the interest, as specified."
