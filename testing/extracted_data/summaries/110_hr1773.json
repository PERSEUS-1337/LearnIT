    "content": "Safe American Roads Act of 2007 - Prohibits the Secretary of Transportation from granting a motor carrier domiciled in Mexico authority to operate beyond US municipalities and commercial zones on the US-Mexico border, except that the Secretary may carry out, in accordance with certain federal motor carrier safety and inspection laws and regulations and this Act, a pilot program that allows not more than 100 of such carriers, and not more than 1,000 of their vehicles, to operate beyond such municipalities and zones. Prohibits the Secretary from implementing the pilot program until: (1) the Inspector General (IG) of the Department of Transportation (DOT) submits to Congress and the Secretary a report verifying that DOT is in compliance with provisions of the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002 requiring compliance by motor carriers domiciled in Mexico with certain federal motor carrier safety and inspection laws and regulations and that DOT has established sufficient mechanisms to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations by Mexico-domiciled motor carriers who will operate beyond US municipalities and commercial zones on the US-Mexico border. (2) the Secretary takes necessary action to address any issues raised by the IG's report and submits to Congress a report on such actions. (3) there is a program in effect for US-domiciled motor carriers to operate in Mexico beyond commercial zones on the US-Mexico border. And (4) the Secretary publishes in the Federal Register, and provides opportunity for public comment on, certain aspects of the pilot program. Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish an independent review panel to monitor and evaluate the pilot program. And (2) address any determination by the panel that the pilot program has had an adverse effect on motor carrier safety or terminate such program. Requires the IG: (1) to monitor and review the pilot program. And (2) not later than 12 months, and not later than 18 months, after the initiation of the pilot program submit to Congress and the Secretary interim reports that include IG findings and certain safety determinations concerning such program. Requires the Secretary, not later than 60 days after submission of the IG's 18-month interim report, to report to Congress on: (1) any actions the Secretary is taking to address motor carrier safety issues raised in the IG's interim reports. (2) the Secretary's evaluation of whether granting authority to additional motor carriers domiciled in Mexico to operate beyond US municipalities and commercial zones on the United States-Mexico border would have any adverse effects on motor carrier safety. (3) modifications to federal motor carrier safety laws and regulations or special procedures necessary to enhance the safety of operations of motor carriers domiciled in Mexico in the United States. And (4) any recommendations for legislation to make the pilot program permanent or to expand operations of motor carriers domiciled in Mexico in the United States beyond municipalities and commercial zones on the United States-Mexico border. Authorizes the pilot program for three years, except that if the Secretary does not comply with the requirements of this Act, such program terminates. Requires the Secretary, not later than 60 days after the termination of the pilot program, to submit to Congress a final report on such program."
