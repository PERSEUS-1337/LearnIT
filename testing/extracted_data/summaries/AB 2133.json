    "title": "An act to\nadd Section 8221.6 to the Education Code,\namend Section 1596.86 of, and to add Section 1596.864 to, the Health and Safety Code,\nrelating to child\ncare and development.\ncare.",
    "content": "Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to license and regulate family day care home providers and to regulate other nonlicensed persons who provide in-home child care. Violation of these provisions is a crime. This bill, as of July 1, 2017, would require a family child care provider, as defined, to attend a one-time, two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to the child care profession and how to identify and avoid those risks to protect the provider\u2019s own health and safety and the health and safety of the children in his or her care. The bill would require the Department of Industrial Relations to select an entity to provide the training required, based on a competitive process, and would require the State Department of Social Services to administer the contract with that entity. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. Existing law, the Child Care and Development Services Act, requires the State Department of Education to contract with local contracting agencies for alternative payment programs that are intended to allow for maximum parental choice in child care. This bill would provide that a licensed or license-exempt child care provider who receives payment through a designated alternative payment program may file a complaint, alleging that the alternative payment program has not complied with federal or state law or regulation, pursuant to the Uniform Complaint Procedures in the California Code of Regulations, as specified."
