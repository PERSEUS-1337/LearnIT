    "content": "Proposals for the reorganization of the United States Intelligence Community have repeatedly emerged from commissions and committees created by either the executive or legislative branches. The heretofore limited authority of Directors of Central Intelligence and the great influence of theDepartments of State and Defense have inhibited the emergence of major reorganization plans fromwithin the Intelligence Community itself. Proposals to reorganize the Intelligence Community emerged in the period immediately following passage of the National Security Act of 1947 (P.L. 80-253) that established the positionof Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Recommendations have ranged from adjustments in the DCI's budgetary responsibilities to theactual dissolution of the CIA and returning its functions to other departments. The goals underlyingsuch proposals have reflected trends in American foreign policy and the international environmentas well as domestic concerns about governmental accountability. In the face of a hostile Soviet Union, early intelligence reorganization proposals were more concerned with questions of efficiency. In the Cold War context of the 1950s, a number ofrecommendations sought aggressively to enhance U.S. covert action and counterintelligencecapabilities. The chairman of one committee charged with investigating the nation's intelligencecapabilities, Army General James H. Doolittle, argued that sacrificing America's sense of \"fair play\"was wholly justified in the struggle to prevent Soviet world domination. Following the failed invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, the unsuccessful results of intervention in Vietnam, and the Watergate scandal, investigations by congressional committeesfocused on the propriety of a wide range of heretofore accepted intelligence activities that includedassassinations and some domestic surveillance of U.S. citizens. Some forcefully questioned theviability of secret intelligence agencies within a democratic society. These investigations resultedin much closer congressional oversight and a more exacting legal framework for intelligenceactivities. At the same time, the growth in technical intelligence capabilities led to an enhanced --but by no means predominant -- leadership role for the DCI in determining community-widebudgets and priorities. With the end of the Cold War, emerging security concerns, including transnational terrorism, narcotics trafficking, and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, faced the United States. Some statutory changes were made in the mid-1990s, but their results were not far-reaching. In theaftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks and the Iraq War, some observers urge reconsideringthe intelligence organization. The 9/11 Commission has specifically recommended theestablishment of a National Intelligence Director to manage the national intelligence program. Current intelligence organization issues can be usefully addressed with an awareness of argumentspro and con that were raised by earlier investigators; this recommendation has been incorporated ina number of bills, including S. 2845 . This report will be updated as circumstanceswarrant."
