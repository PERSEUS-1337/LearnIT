    "content": "Film Disclosure Act of 1993 - Amends the Lanham Act to require that any distributor or network that proposes to exploit a materially altered motion picture bear a label which conspicuously discloses the fact of: (1) the film's material alteration from the form in which it was first released to the public, (2) the nature of such alteration. And (3) any objections raised by the artistic authors with reference to such alteration. Delineates the compliance procedure for distributors or networks that propose to exploit a materially altered film. Grants an artistic author the right to seek injunctive relief in US district courts to prevent violation of his or her rights under this Act."
