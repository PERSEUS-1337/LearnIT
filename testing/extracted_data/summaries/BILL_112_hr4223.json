(4) buying or otherwise obtaining, or selling or distributing, with intent to defraud, such a product that has expired or been stolen. Or (5) attempting or conspiring to commit such a violation. Makes such a violation an aggravated offense if: (1) the defendant is employed by, or is an agent of, an organization in the supply chain for the product. Or (2) the violation involves the use of violence, force, a threat of violence or force, or the use of a deadly weapon, results in serious bodily injury or death, or is subsequent to a prior conviction for an offense under this Act. Prescribes criminal and civil penalties for violations, including a civil penalty of up to the greater of 3 times the economic loss attributable to the violation or $1 million. Provides for civil forfeiture for any property which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to such a violation.

(2) engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. (3) breaking into or entering carrier facilities with intent to commit larceny. And (4) the transportation, sale, or receipt of stolen property. Directs the Attorney General to give increased priority to efforts to investigate and prosecute offenses involving pre-retail medical products. Extends provisions authorizing wiretapping and requiring victim restitution to offenses relating to theft of a pre-retail medical product. Directs the US Sentencing Commission to review and, if appropriate, amend the sentencing guidelines and policy statements applicable to offenses related to pre-retail medical product theft or robberies and burglaries involving controlled substances to reflect congressional intent that penalties are sufficient to deter and punish such offenses and to appropriately account for actual harm to the public."
