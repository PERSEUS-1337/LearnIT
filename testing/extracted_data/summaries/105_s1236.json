    "content": "National Police Pursuit Policy Act of 1997 - Prohibits the Secretary of Transportation from approving the highway safety program of a State that does not have in effect by January 1, 1999: (1) a law that makes it unlawful for the driver of a motor vehicle to increase speed or to take any other deliberately evasive action if a law enforcement officer clearly signals the driver to stop the motor vehicle and that subjects any driver who violates that law to a minimum penalty of three months' imprisonment and seizure of the motor vehicle. And (2) a requirement that each State and local agency that employs law enforcement officers who may conduct a motor vehicle pursuit have a policy that meets guidelines set by the Secretary, train all law enforcement officers in accordance with that policy, and submit to the chief executive officer of the State a report regarding each motor vehicle pursuit. Requires the US Attorney General, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chief of the Capitol Police, and the Administrator of General Services to report to the Congress on each such entity's motor vehicle pursuit policy and the procedures used to train law enforcement officers to implement that policy. Requires each such policy to meet the policy requirements of State programs under this Act."
