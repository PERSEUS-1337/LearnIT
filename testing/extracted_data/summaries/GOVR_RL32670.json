    "content": "The Bush Administration's 2003 National Strategy for the Physical Protection of CriticalInfrastructures and Key Assets indicates that security guards are \"an important source of protectionfor critical facilities.\" In 2003, approximately one million security guards (including airportscreeners) were employed in the United States. Of these guards, analysis indicates that up to 5%protected what have been defined as \"critical\" infrastructure and assets. The effectiveness of critical infrastructure guards in countering a terrorist attack depends onthe number of guards on duty, their qualifications, pay and training. Security guard employment mayhave increased in certain critical infrastructure sectors since September 11, 2001, although overallemployment of U.S. security guards has declined in the last five years. Contract guard salariesaveraged $19,400 per year in 2003, less than half of the average salary for police and well below theaverage U.S. salary for all occupations. There are no U.S. federal requirements for training ofcritical infrastructure guards other than airport screeners and nuclear guards. Twenty-two states dorequire basic training for licensed security guards, but few specifically require counter-terrorismtraining. State regulations regarding criminal background checks for security guards vary. Sixteenstates have no background check regulations. The federal government's role in protecting U.S. critical infrastructure has been a concern ofCongress since 9/11. Part of this concern involves the possible imposition of federal securityrequirements, including guard requirements, on infrastructure which is largely private. The PrivateSecurity Officer Employment Authorization Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 , Sec. 6402) facilitatesemployer access to FBI criminal records to conduct background checks of security guard employees. Other legislation proposed in the 108th Congress would have required private security guardcompanies to perform criminal background checks, would have prohibited the hiring of guards whofailed background checks, or would have directed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) toconduct security guard emergency training, including training for \"acts of terrorism.\" The DHScurrently does not have counter-terrorism training programs specifically for private security guards. There appears to be no federal or state policy that explicitly addresses critical infrastructureguards as a distinctive group. If homeland security policy evolves towards special treatment ofcritical infrastructure guards, responsible agencies may face a challenge identifying those guardsbecause of uncertainties in identifying critical assets. Federal counter-terrorism funding for criticalinfrastructure guards may also present a policy challenge, since 87% of these guards are in theprivate sector. It is an open question whether private operators of critical infrastructure have hired,trained, and otherwise supported security guards to the degree warranted by the social value of thefacilities they protect. As Congress continues its oversight of homeland security, funding for privateguards may emerge as a security consideration where public benefits and private resources may notalign. This report will not be updated."
