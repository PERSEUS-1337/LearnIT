For this purpose, it builds a model of the world around us and uses this model to infer the external stimulus. Predictive coding has been proposed as a mechanism through which the brain might be able to build such a model of the external environment. However, it is not clear how predictive coding can be used to build deep neural network models of the brain while complying with the architectural constraints imposed by the brain. In this paper, we describe an algorithm to build a deep generative model using predictive coding that can be used to infer latent representations about the stimuli received from external environment. Specifically, we used predictive coding to train a deep neural network on real-world images in a unsupervised learning paradigm. To understand the capacity of the network with regards to modeling the external environment, we studied the latent representations generated by the model on images of objects that are never presented to the model during training. Despite the novel features of these objects the model is able to infer the latent representations for them. Furthermore, the reconstructions of the original images obtained from these latent representations preserve the important details of these objects. The general idea of predictive coding BID8 BID9 BID11 postulates that the brain is continuously trying to predict the information it receives from external environment. An implementation of predictive coding was first proposed as a model of visual information processing in the brain BID12 . Recently, it was described as an implementation of the free-energy principle in the brain BID1 . Predictive coding models the visual information processing pathways as a recurrently connected hierarchical neural network. Feedback connections from higher to lower level areas convey predictions about the activities of the lower level neurons and feedforward connections convey the residual errors in these predictions to higher level areas.Several studies have focused on the biological plausibility of predictive coding and its relation to other learning approaches. In BID14 , the author showed that a model of biased competition BID0 that uses lateral inhibition to suppress the input of other nodes is equivalent to the linear model of predictive coding. An extension to predictive coding has been proposed in BID13 that relaxes the requirement of symmetric weights between two adjacent layers in the network. In a similar study, it was shown that the error-backpropagation and predictive coding use similar forms of weight changes during learning BID16 .From the perspective of training deep neural networks, predictive coding is an approach that is widely supported by neurophysiological data BID3 ) and adheres to the architectural and locality (in terms of learning) constraints imposed by the brain. Existing studies on predictive coding has focused on small neural network models to study the development of orientation selective receptive fields in primary visual cortex BID12 BID13 . It is unclear how predictive coding can be used to build deep neural network models of the brain to study more complicated brain processes like attention, memory, etc. Another important question that arises while building models of the brain is how can we comply with the architectural constraints applicable in the brain like the retinotopic arrangement of receptive fields that is found in the sensory cortical areas. At present, mostly neural networks with fully connected layers are used, which implies that the receptive fields of neurons are as big as the field of view. To overcome this, neural network models are trained on patches from real world images. This approach works well when training small neural network models but it is difficult to extend it for training deep neural networks.In this paper, we present a systematic approach for training deep neural networks using predictive coding in a biologically plausible manner. The network is used to learn hierarchical latent representations for a given input stimulus. The architecture of these neural networks is inspired by convolutional neural networks BID5 . However, to comply with the retinotopic arrangement of receptive fields observed in sensory cortical areas, we employ neural networks in which filters are not applied across the entire layer, similar to locally connected layers used in BID15 . Instead, filters are applied only to a small receptive field which allows us to train the filters associated with different receptive fields independently. This approach can be easily scaled to train deep neural networks for modeling information processing along the sensory processing pathways.In general, the approach proposed in this paper can be used for stimuli in any modality. To illustrate the effectiveness of the approach, we trained a deep neural network using predictive coding on 1000 real-world images of horses and ships from the CIFAR-10 data set. The model is trained in an unsupervised learning paradigm to build a generative model for real-world images and is used to infer latent representations for real-world. To estimate the capacity of the network in modeling real-world images, we used the model to infer latent representations for new images of horses and ships as well as objects that are never presented to the network during training. The model is able to reconstruct the original real-world images from the inferred latent representations while retaining the important features of the objects in these images. This shows that the model can capture the causal regularities in real-world images.The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the architecture and the predictive coding based learning algorithm used for training deep neural network models. Section 3 describes the results of studies conducted using the trained models. Section 4 discusses the computational implications of deep predictive coding and its relationship with other approaches in machine learning. Section 5 summarizes the conclusions from the experiments reported in this paper. In this section, we discuss the computational implications of the algorithm presented in this paper and the similarities it shares with existing approaches in machine learning.Deep neural networks have improved the state-of-the-art performances in many problems related to image processing like classification, semantic segmentation, etc. These improvements have been achieved by exploiting the availability of cheap computational power. However, with increases in the complexity of neural network architectures, the problem of developing efficient learning algorithms has become prominent. A large body of work in machine learning literature has been dedicated to improving the speed of error-backpropagation which is one of the most used learning algorithms for training deep neural networks. However, an inherent property of error-backpropagation is to systematically propagate information through the network in the forward direction and during learning, propagate the error gradients in the backward direction. This imposes restrictions on the extent of parallelization that can be achieved with error back-propagation.In this respect, the proposed learning algorithm can be extensively parallelized. It can be observed from Equations 6 and 7 that the latent representations for the neurons in a given layer depend only on the error in predicting the latent representations at the layer below. This aspect of the learning algorithm can be leveraged to update the latent representations and filters at each layer in the network in parallel. Thus the feedforward and feedback processes can be performed at each layer in parallel. Further, the use of a network architecture with retinotopical arrangement of receptive fields allows us to update the latent representations and filters associated with all positions in a given layer in parallel. Thus, the learning algorithm proposed in this paper is amenable to parallelization and can be useful for speeding up the training of deep neural architectures.Another interesting aspect of the predictive coding is its proximity to the idea of deconvolutional neural networks BID17 . Deconvolutional neural networks have also been used to learn the latent representations for a given input image and have been used for the problem of semantic segmentation BID10 . The problem of learning latent representations is inherently an ill-posed problem as there is no unique solution for a given input stimulus. To overcome this issue deconvolutional neural networks optimize on auxiliary variables and the generated latent representations in alternation. A continuation parameter \u03b2 is continuously increased during the learning process until the latent representations are strongly clamped to the auxiliary variables. This requires carefully controlling the learning process and increases the computational requirements of the learning algorithm due to an extra optimization step on auxiliary variables. Predictive coding provides an alternate solution to this problem. In Equation 6, the update term associated with td constraint the learning algorithm to generate latent representations that can be easily predicted by the successive layers in the network. The effect of this constraint on the learning algorithm is same as that of the auxiliary variables in deconvolutional neural networks and impart numerical stability to the learning process. This approach provides a more simpler solution to the problem of learning latent representations without imposing the additional computational effort of optimizing auxiliary variables. In this paper, we describe a method to train deep neural networks using predictive coding for modeling information processing along cortical sensory hierarchies. The approach uses a neural network in which neurons project only to neurons in their respective receptive fields. This kind of architecture respects the retinotopic arrangement of receptive fields observed in the visual cortical areas.The method can be used to build a deep generative model for data in any modality. For illustration, we trained the model on a set of real-world images and then used the trained model to infer hierarchical latent representations. Even though the model is trained on a small data set of 1000 images of horses and ships, it can infer effective latent representations for images of other objects like sparrow, cats, trucks, cars, etc. This shows that the trained model is able to capture the statistical regularities present in the real-world images. In this regards, the generalization ability of the model is better than most existing algorithms that usually rely on large amount of data to achieve better generalization."
