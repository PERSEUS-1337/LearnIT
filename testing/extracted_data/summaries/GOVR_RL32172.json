    "content": "In early 2001, an eight-month conflict between ethnic Albanian insurgent forces andMacedonian police and security forces threatened to derail the country's fragile stability and lead toanother extended conflict in the Balkans. Later that year, U.S. and European intervention led to thesigning of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, which outlined a package of political reforms to expandthe rights of the ethnic Albanian minority while rebel forces were disarmed and disbanded underNATO supervision. Implementation of the Ohrid agreement proceeded slowly at first but hasprogressed in recent years. Numerous challenges in 2004, including the accidental death of PresidentTrajkovski and violent inter-ethnic incidents in neighboring Kosovo, threatened to increase politicalinstability. However, an opposition-sponsored referendum on November 7, 2004, which sought tohalt plans for decentralization and local governmental reforms called for under the Ohrid accords,failed due to low turnout. Municipal elections under the new redistricting plan took place in March2005. The multi-ethnic coalition government that was elected after the 2001 conflict looks likely tocomplete its term until 2006. The United States continues to support multilateral efforts to stabilize Macedonia, but hasincreasingly looked to the European Union to play a larger international role in the Balkans, startingwith Macedonia. In March 2003, the European Union launched its first military mission inMacedonia, taking over from a small NATO presence. The EU military mission, which has alsoserved as a test case for the EU's ability to carry out its own defense policy, concluded its operationon December 15, 2003. The EU maintains a police training mission in Macedonia. Macedonia's long-term goals, shared by the United States and the international community,include full membership in NATO and the European Union. NATO has pledged to uphold its \"opendoor policy\" for NATO candidate countries such as Macedonia, Albania, and Croatia. Macedoniahas concluded a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU, applied for EU membershipin early 2004, and anticipates formally being named an EU candidate country by the end of 2005.EU and U.S. officials urged Macedonian voters to stay on track with reforms consistent with theOhrid agreement, and praised them for endorsing Euro-Atlantic integration with the widespreadboycott of the November 7 referendum. On the eve of the referendum, the United States announcedits decision to recognize Macedonia by its constitutional name, the Republic of Macedonia, ratherthan its interim name, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as an expression of supportto a multi-ethnic and democratic state. Its name, however, remains in dispute with neighboringGreece, and U.N.-sponsored talks to resolve the dispute are ongoing.
