    "content": "The foreign relations authorization process dovetails with the annual appropriation processfor the Department of State (within the Commerce, Justice, State and Related Agency appropriation)and foreign policy/foreign aid activities (within the foreign operations appropriation). Congress isrequired by law to authorize the spending of appropriations for the State Department and foreignpolicy activities every two years. Foreign assistance authorization measures (such as authorizationfor the U.S. Agency for International Development, economic and military assistance to foreigncountries, and international population programs) have been merged into the State Departmentauthorization legislation since 1985. Since that time, Congress has not passed a stand-alone foreignassistance authorization bill. Congressman Hyde introduced H.R. 1950 on May 5, 2003. The HouseInternational Relations Committee reported the bill May 16 ( H.Rept. 108-105 , Part I). H.R. 1950 , as reported out by the Committee, contained authorization legislation forFY2004 and FY2005 and included a defense trade and security assistance title, as well as a foreignassistance title. As amended (July 15 and 16) and passed (July 16) by the House, H.R. 1950 also includes the Millennium Challenge Account and Peace Corps provisions. The legislationauthorizes about $27 billion for FY2004 and FY2005. The House bill contains the Israeli-Palestinianpeace plan, also known as the \"road map\" which goes beyond the President's plan by includingconditions that must be met before the United States can agree to a Palestinian state. Also includedare terrorist-related enforcement measures, munition and satellite export controls. Eliminated byamendment was a provision providing $50 million in U.S. contributions to the U.N. Population Fundfor each year that the legislation covers. House floor action occurred on July 15th and 16th. TheHouse passed the bill, as amended, by recorded vote (382-42) on July 16th. The Senate originally reported three separate bills providing authority for only FY2004: aforeign relations authorization ( S. 925 ), a foreign assistance authorization bill( S. 1161 ) which includes arms export control and counter terrorism measures, and theMillennium Challenge Account ( S. 1160 ). After political differences with unrelatedfloor amendments in 2003, the Senate gave up trying to vote on S. 925 (within whichthe other two bills had been merged). On February 27, 2004, Senator Lugar introduced the Senate'snew Foreign Relations Authorization Act, FY2005 ( S. 2144 ). The Senate ForeignRelations Committee reported it out on March 18, 2004 ( S.Rept. 108-248 ).
