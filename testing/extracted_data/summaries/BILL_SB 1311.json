    "title": "SB 1311",
    "content": "Existing law makes confidential, upon request, the home addresses of specified governmental officials, peace officers, state employees, and certain other persons that appear in the records of the Department of Motor Vehicles. Existing law also makes confidential, upon request, the home address of the spouse or child of any of those persons, or the surviving spouse or child of a peace officer if the peace officer died in the line of duty, except for a spouse, surviving spouse, or child who was convicted of a crime and is on active parole or probation. Existing law prohibits the disclosure of the confidential home addresses described above, except as specified. Existing law requires a record of the department containing a confidential home address to be open to public inspection, as specified, if the address is completely obliterated or otherwise removed from the record. Existing law also provides that the home address of the surviving spouse or child of a peace officer, as specified, shall be withheld from public inspection for 3 years following the death of the peace officer. This bill would require the department to discontinue holding a home address confidential, pursuant to the above provisions, for a child or spouse of specified persons if the child or spouse is convicted of a felony in this state or is convicted of an offense in another jurisdiction that, if committed in California, would be a felony."
