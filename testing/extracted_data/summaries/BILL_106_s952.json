(2) by which the member clubs of two or more professional football leagues that are exempt from taxation combine their operations in an expanded single league that is exempt from income tax, if that agreement increases the number of professional football clubs operating and contains provisions that are directly relevant to the combination of operations for such league. Or (3) by which any league of clubs participating in such a professional sport denies a member club the right to transfer the location of the franchise of that member club. Conditions the exemption, with respect to a football league or major league baseball league, on the football league or major league baseball clubs involved agreeing to meet specified requirements, including the establishment of a special trust fund into which the league will deposit ten percent of the amounts received under the joint agreement for the sale or transfer of the rights in sponsored telecasting of games to finance the construction or renovation of playing facilities, upon request of a local governmental entity."
