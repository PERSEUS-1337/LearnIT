    "content": "In February 2005, a House Appropriations Committee reorganization plan abolished theVeterans Affairs, Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and IndependentAgencies Subcommittee, sending HUD to a new Treasury, Transportation, Judiciary, Housing andUrban Development, District of Columbia and Related Agencies Subcommittee. A similar but notidentical change was made in the Senate, creating the Transportation, Treasury, HUD Subcommittee. On February 7, 2005, the Administration submitted a $29.1 billion FY2006 budget requestfor HUD, which is 9% less than was provided in FY2005. The most controversial part of the budgetproposal would have eliminated the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program inHUD and transferred its purposes to the Department of Commerce, combining it with 17 otherprograms (that had approximately $5.6 billion of appropriations in FY2005) into a new $3.7 billionStrengthening America's Communities Initiative (SACI) grant program. The President's budgetproposal also included increased funding for Section 8 tenant-based rental vouchers, HomelessAssistance Grants, and the HOME program; decreased funding for Housing for the Disabled (Section811), Housing for Persons with AIDS, and Fair Housing programs; and elimination of funding forthe HOPE VI program. On June 30, 2005, the House approved an FY2006 HUD appropriations bill, H.R. 3058 , funding HUD at more than $4 billion above the President's requested level. The bill, which rejected the President's SACI initiative, would fund CDBG at HUD and increasefunding above the President's request for several HUD programs. On October 20, 2005, the Senate passed its version of H.R. 3058 , providing forHUD more than $5 billion above what the President requested and more than $1 billion above whatthe House version allocated. Like the House bill, the Senate version rejected the President's SACIinitiative and proposed to fund CDBG and related programs within the HUD budget, and increasefunding above the President's request and the House-approved level for several HUD programs,including HOPE VI and Section 811. On October 28, 2005, the President submitted to Congress a rescission and reallocationpackage that would rescind $124 million in HUD funding and transfer $2.2 billion to HUD fromFEMA's disaster relief fund. A modified version was attached to the FY2006 DefenseAppropriations law ( P.L. 109-148 ), providing $11.9 billion for HUD. That bill also contained a 1%across-the-board rescission that applies to all of HUD's discretionary programs. On November 18, 2005, the House and Senate approved a final version of the FY2006 HUDappropriations bill. It does not adopt the CDBG transfer, and funds most programs between theHouse- and Senate-approved levels.
