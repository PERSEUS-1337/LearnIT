    "title": "An act to amend Section 2290.5 of the Business and Professions Code, to amend Section 1374.13 of the Health and Safety Code, and to amend Section 10123.85 of the Insurance Code, relating to telehealth.",
    "content": "Existing law defines \u201ctelehealth\u201d as the mode of delivering health care services and public health via information and communication technologies to facilitate the diagnosis, consultation, treatment, education, care management, and self-management of a patient\u2019s health care while the patient is at the originating site and the health care provider is at a distant site, and that facilitates patient self-management and caregiver support for patients and includes synchronous interactions and asynchronous store and forward transfers. Existing law requires that prior to the delivery of health care via telehealth, the health care provider initiating the use of telehealth inform the patient about the use of telehealth and obtain documented verbal or written consent from the patient for the use of telehealth. This bill would add video communications, telephone communications, email communications, and synchronous text or chat conferencing communications and telephone communications to the definition of telehealth. The bill would also provide that the required prior consent for telehealth services may be digital as well as oral or written. Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law also provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law prohibits health care service plans and health insurers from limiting the type of setting where services are provided for the patient or by the health care provider before payment is made for the covered services appropriately provided through telehealth, subject to the terms and conditions of the contract entered into between the enrollee, insured, subscriber, or policyholder and the plan or insurer, and between the plan or insurer and its participating providers or provider groups. This bill would also prohibit a health care provider from requiring the use of telehealth when a patient prefers to receive health care services in person it is not appropriate and would require health care service plans and health insurers to include coverage and reimbursement for services provided to a patient through telehealth to the same extent as though provided in person or by some other means, as specified. The bill would prohibit a health care service plan or health insurer from limiting coverage or reimbursement based on a contract entered into between the plan or insurer and an independent telehealth provider. The bill would prohibit a health care service plan or a health insurer from interfering with the physician-patient altering the provider-patient relationship based on the modality utilized for services appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill would provide that all laws regarding the confidentiality of health care information and a patient\u2019s right to his or her medical information shall apply to telehealth services. Because a willful violation of the bill\u2019s provisions by a health care service plan would be a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
