And (2) Department of Defense Directive Number 5210.56, entitled Use of Deadly Force and the Carrying of Firearms by DOD Personnel Engaged in Law Enforcement and Security Duties. Any provision in any other law, rule, regulation, or executive order that prohibits military personnel trained in firearms use from carrying a firearm on a military installation or Department of Defense (DOD) site within the United States shall have no further force or effect and may not be enforced. Military personnel shall not be prohibited from carrying firearms on military installations or DOD sites.

The President shall not take any executive action or promulgate any rule, or issue any executive order or regulation, to prohibit military personnel from carrying firearms."
