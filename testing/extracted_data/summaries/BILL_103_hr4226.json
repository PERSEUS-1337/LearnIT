Exempts demonstration program participants from fees for the development of revised effluent guidelines. Grants participants an additional year to comply with new or revised effluent standards as necessary and appropriate. Directs the Administrator to establish: (1) a pollution prevention extension service to provide an outreach effort to encourage pollution prevention by industrial discharges to estuaries with approved conservation and management plans. And (2) a national estuary pollution prevention clearinghouse. Permits municipalities located within the watershed of an estuary with an approved plan to apply for technical and financial assistance for: (1) implementing source reduction of toxic pollutants in urban runoff, wastewater, and stormwater and to address problems resulting from failures of underground septic systems.
