    "title": "AB 2551",
    "content": "The Local Agency Public Construction Act establishes procedures and requirements for contracting by local agencies for the construction of public works, including the requirement to award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder. Existing law governing specified water districts requires those districts to use competitive bidding and to award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder. This bill would allow a local agency to use the construction manager at-risk, design-build, or design-build-operate method of delivery on a surface storage project, as described. The bill would require these contracts to be awarded on a best value basis or to the lowest responsible bidder, and establish a procurement process for these contracts. The bill would require the bidder to certify specified information under penalty of perjury. By expanding the crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would also prohibit a contracting entity from being prequalified or short-listed unless it provides an enforceable commitment to the local agency that the entity and its subcontractors will use a skilled and trained workforce to perform all work on the project or contract that falls within an apprenticeable occupation in the building and construction trades, as specified. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
