    "content": "Forward Looking Investment in General Aviation, Hangars, and Tarmacs Act of 2017 or the FLIGHT Act of 2017 This bill revises general aviation apportionments by: (1) providing at least 4 of entitlement funding to airports designated as disaster relief airports, (2) increasing the period of availability of apportioned funds, (3) increasing the federal government's share of project costs for certain airports to 95, and (4) allowing the use of non apportioned funds for general aviation airport grants. DOT shall: (1) implement an expedited and coordinated environmental review process for general aviation airport construction or improvement projects. And (2) establish a public-private partnership program for building or improving hangars, businesses, or other facilities at general aviation airports and privately owned airports for public use that do not have scheduled air service. The bill requires DOT to designate certain airports as disaster relief airports, including regional reliever airports, airports within a reasonable distance of a hospital or transplant or trauma center, or airports in a region prone to natural disasters. The bill treats the construction of certain aircraft used exclusively for recreational purposes as an quot, aeronautical activityquot, for purposes of airport improvement grants."
