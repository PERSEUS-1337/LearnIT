    "title": "An act to add and repeal Part 6 (commencing with Section 5950) of Division 5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to mental health, and making an appropriation therefor.",
    "content": "Existing law, the Bronzan-McCorquodale Act, sets out a system of community mental health care services provided by counties and administered by the State Department of Health Care Services. This bill would establish the Early Diagnosis and Preventive Treatment (EDAPT) Program Fund in the State Treasury to provide funding to the Regents of the University of California for the purpose of providing reimbursement to an EDAPT program that would utilize integrated systems of care to provide early intervention, assessment, diagnosis, a treatment plan, and necessary services for individuals with severe mental illness and children with severe emotional disturbance, as specified. The bill would authorize moneys from private or other sources to be deposited into the fund and used for purposes of the bill. The bill would require, when the Department of Finance has determined that the total amount of the moneys in the fund has reached or exceeded $1,200,000, the Controller to distribute all of the moneys in the fund to the Regents of the University of California for the purpose of providing reimbursement to an EDAPT program for services provided to persons who are referred to that program, but whose private health benefit plan, as defined, does not cover the full range of required services, thereby making an appropriation. The bill would require the Regents of the University of California, if the regents accept the money, or if the regents accept federal funding distributed by the State Department of Health Care Services for the purpose of supporting an EDAPT program, as specified, to report, on or after January 1, 2022, but prior to January 1, 2023, specified information to the health committees of both houses of the Legislature. The bill would repeal the program as of January 1, 2023."
