    "content": "Each year, Congress and the Administration provide funding for a variety of grant programs through the Department of Justice (DOJ). These programs are used to fund state, local, and tribal governments and nonprofit organizations for a variety of criminal justice-related purposes, such as efforts to combat violence against women, reduce backlogs of DNA evidence, support community policing, assist crime victims, promote prisoner reentry, and improve the functioning of the juvenile justice system. These programs are funded through five accounts in the annual Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) appropriations act: Violence Against Women Programs; Research, Evaluation, and Statistics; State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance; Juvenile Justice Programs; and Community Oriented Policing Services. For FY2018, the Trump Administration requested a total of $1.979 billion for the five DOJ grant accounts, which included $480.0 million for the Violence Against Women Programs account; $111.0 million for the Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account; $940.5 million for the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account; $229.5 million for the Juvenile Justice Programs account; and $218.0 million for the Community Oriented Policing Services account. To achieve these funding levels the Administration proposed transferring a total of $610.0 million from the Crime Victims Fund to three accounts: $445.0 million to Violence Against Women Programs, $73.0 million to State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance, and $92.0 million to Juvenile Justice Programs. The transfers would have supplemented appropriations from the General Fund of the Treasury for the three accounts. In H.R. 3354, the House recommended a total of $2.215 billion for DOJ's grant accounts, which included $527.5 million for the Violence Against Women Programs account; $83.0 million for the Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account; $1.189 billion for the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account; $175.5 million for the Juvenile Justice Programs account; and $240.5 million for the Community Oriented Policing Services account. The House bill would not have transferred funding from the Crime Victims Fund to the Violence Against Women Programs, State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance, and Juvenile Justice Programs accounts. In S. 1662, the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a total of $2.226 billion for DOJ's grant accounts. This amount included a $379.0 million transfer from the Crime Victims Fund to the Violence Against Women Programs account. Within the amount that would have been provided, $483.5 million was for the Violence Against Women Programs account; $85.0 million was for the Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account; $1.171 billion was for the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account; $260.0 million was for the Juvenile Justice Programs account; and $226.5 million was for the Community Oriented Policing Services account. Congress and the Administration funded DOJ's five grant accounts at $2.820 billion for FY2018. This amount includes $492.0 million for the Violence Against Women Programs account; $90.0 million for the Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account; $1.680 billion for the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account; $282.5 million for the Juvenile Justice Programs account; and $275.5 million for the Community Oriented Policing Services account. Total funding includes $492.0 million that is to be transferred from the Crime Victims Fund to the Office on Violence Against Women. In general, most DOJ grant programs were funded at or above the FY2017 level. Many of the programs that received the largest increases in funding are related to combatting opioid abuse. Congress also largely declined to accept the Administration's proposals to eliminate funding for several grant programs, such as the State Criminal Alien Assistance program, and to decrease funding for other programs."
