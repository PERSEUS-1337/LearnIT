    "content": "Territorial Delegates have served in the House since the late 1700s, representing territoriesthat had not yet achieved statehood. In the 20th Century, the concept of Delegate grew to includerepresentation of territories where the United States exercises some degree of control but which werenot expected to become states. Currently, the U.S. insular areas of American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and thefederal municipality of the District of Columbia are each represented in Congress by a Delegate tothe House of Representatives. The individual elected to represent Puerto Rico is called the ResidentCommissioner instead of delegate. The Delegates and Resident Commissioner are the successorsof Delegates from statehood-bound territories, who first took seats in the House in the late 1700s. Proposals offered in recent Congresses have sought to grant the Delegate from the Districtof Columbia voting rights on the floor of the House. Another proposal would expand territorialrepresentation to include the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Floor action in theHouse and Senate on these bills could occur before the end of the 109th Congress. Early laws providing for territorial Delegates to Congress did not specify the duties,privileges, and obligations of these representatives. It was left to the House and the Delegatesthemselves to define their role. On January 13, 1795, the House took an important step towardestablishing the functions of Delegates when it appointed James White, the first territorialrepresentative, to membership on a select committee. In subsequent years, Delegates continued toserve on select committees as well as on conference committees. The first fixed assignment of aDelegate to standing committee occurred under a House rule of 1871, which gave Delegates placesas additional members on two standing committees. In these committees, the Delegates exercisedthe same powers and privileges as in the House; that is, they could debate but not vote. In the 1970s, Delegates gained the right to be elected to standing committees and to exercisein those committees the same powers and privileges as Members of the House, including the rightto vote. Today, Delegates enjoy powers, rights, and responsibilities identical, in most respects, tothose of House Members from the states. Like these Members, Delegates can speak and introducebills and resolutions on the House floor; and they can speak and vote in House committees. Delegates are not, however, full-fledged Members of Congress. Most significantly, they cannot voteon the House floor. This report builds on earlier reports on territorial delegates prepared by former colleagues,[author name scrubbed] and the late William H. Tansill, and also benefitted from the production assistanceof Daphne Bigger. Paul Rundquist was a major contributor to this report. This report will be updatedas events warrant."
