    "content": "On November 13, 2001, President Bush signed a Military Order pertaining to the detention,treatment, and trial of certain non-citizens as part of the war against terrorism. The order makesclear that the President views the crisis that began on the morning of September 11 as an attack \"ona scale that has created a state of armed conflict that requires the use of the United States ArmedForces.\" The order finds that the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of militaryattacks make it necessary to detain certain non-citizens and if necessary, to try them \"for violationsof the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.\" The unprecedented nature of the September attacks and the magnitude of damage and lossof life they caused have led a number of officials and commentators to assert that the acts are not justcriminal acts, they are \"acts of war.\" The President's Military Order makes it apparent that he plansto treat the attacks as acts of war rather than criminal acts. The distinction may have more thanrhetorical significance. Treating the attacks as violations of the international law of war could allowthe United States to prosecute those responsible as war criminals, trying them by special militarycommission rather than in federal court. The purpose of this report is to identify some of the legal and practical implications oftreating the terrorist acts as war crimes and of applying the law of war rather than criminal statutesto prosecute the alleged perpetrators. The report will first present an outline of the sources andprinciples of the law of war, including a discussion of whether and how it might apply to the currentterrorist crisis. A brief explanation of the background issues and arguments surrounding the use ofmilitary commissions will follow. The report will then explore the legal bases and implications ofapplying the law of war under United States law, summarize precedent for its application by militarycommissions, and provide an analysis of the President's Military Order of November 13, 2001. Finally, the report discusses considerations for establishing rules of procedure and evidence thatcomport with international standards."
