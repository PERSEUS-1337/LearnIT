Includes spices, flavorings, colorings, or incidental additives that are or contain a known food allergen. Sets forth special requirements for raw agricultural commodities which are or contain a known food allergen. Sets forth criteria for labels, requiring a format comparable to that required for the disclosure of nutrition information. Requires certain manufacturers, packers, or distributors to include a toll-free telephone number on such label. Establishes civil penalties for violations of this Act.
