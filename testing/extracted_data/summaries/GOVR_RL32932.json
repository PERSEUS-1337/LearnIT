    "content": "This report provides a chronology of selected events leading up to and following thediscoveries of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or \"mad cow disease\") in North America. These are primarily regulatory, legal, and congressional developments that are frequently referencedin the ongoing policy debate. The chronology generally does not contain entries for the introductionof the many BSE-related bills introduced into this or previous Congresses, except for those in recentyears where committee or floor action has occurred. This report, which will be updated if significantdevelopments ensue, is intended to be used alongside other CRS reports that provide morebackground and context for the BSE policy debate, and that cover many specific legislativeproposals. The chronology begins in 1986, when BSE was first identified by a British laboratory. Asthe United Kingdom and others attempted to understand and contain BSE, the U.S. and Canadiangovernments were establishing panels to study the disease and began instituting a series ofsafeguards aimed at keeping it out of North America or stopping any spread if it should occur here. The chronology proceeds into May 2003, when Canada reported the first native case in NorthAmerica; December 2003, when the United States reported finding a case in a U.S. herd; and mostof 2004, when both countries worked to reassure consumers of the safety of North American cattleand beef and to reopen foreign markets blocking these exports. U.S. and Canadian officials since2003 also have been strengthening various regulatory safeguards aimed at protecting the cattle herdand the food supply from BSE. The chronology continues with major events of 2004, 2005, and the first half of 2006, whichhave revolved around efforts to re-establish more open cattle and beef trade within North America,even while a handful of new cases of BSE have emerged here, and the steps being taken to regainthe Japanese and Korean markets, which were until December 2003 two of the four leading foreignbuyers of U.S. beef. Both were closed as of mid-2006 (although Japan appeared on the verge ofreopening as of this writing). Congress can be expected to continue to play a role, holding oversighthearings, providing funding for BSE-related activities, and possibly considering legislative optionsto address one or more of the outstanding issues."
