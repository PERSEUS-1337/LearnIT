    "content": "Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to require the head of an executive agency: (1) before purchasing a product listed in the latest edition of the Federal Prison Industries (FPI) catalog, to conduct market research to determine whether the Industries' product is comparable to products available from the private sector that best meet the agency's needs in terms of price, quality, and time of delivery. And (2) if an FPI product is not comparable, to use competitive procedures for the procurement of the product or to make an individual purchase under a multiple award contract, considering any timely offer from FPI. And (3) to ensure that FPI performs its contractual obligations to the same extent as any other agency contractor. Prohibits: (1) a contractor or potential contractor of an agency from being required, by any means, to use FPI as a subcontractor or supplier of products or provider of services for the performance of an agency contract. Or (2) an agency head from entering into a contract with FPI under which an inmate worker would have access to specified classified or sensitive information."
