    "content": "The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA) was signed into law in 1974 as Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (P.L. 93-415). RHYA authorizes funding for programs to support runaway and homeless youth, as well as related training, research, and other activities. These programs and activities are administered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) in the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Administration for Children and Families. In the second session of the 110th Congress, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-378) to extend existing programs and establish new activities under RHYA for FY2009 through FY2013. The law represents a compromise between provisions that were included in two bills introduced in the 110th Congress: H.R. 5524 and S. 2982. On March 4, 2008, Representative John Yarmuth introduced H.R. 5524, the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008, which passed the House on June 9, 2008. On May 6, 2008, Senator Patrick Leahy introduced S. 2982, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Protection Act, which passed the Senate on September 25, 2008. The House approved S. 2982 on September 26, and the President signed it into law as P.L. 110-378 on October 8, 2008. This report discusses P.L. 110-378 and includes a table with a side-by-side comparison of its provisions to those in H.R. 5524, as well as to the law and regulations as they existed prior to the enactment of S. 2982. The new law amends and adds provisions related to program funding, requirements, and accountability. It extends the authorization of appropriations for the three programs under RHYA that provide direct services to youth: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). Unlike prior law, P.L. 110-378 enables HHS to reallot any unused BCP funds from one state to other states and permits youth to remain in BCP and TLP shelters for a longer period. Another change made by the law requires HHS to regularly submit a report to Congress that describes the incidence and prevalence of runaway and homeless youth. The law also directs the Government Accountability Office to report to Congress on the process by which HHS awards BCP, TLP, and SOP grants. The provisions of P.L. 110-378 reflect issues raised by policymakers and advocates about RHYA during the reauthorization process. One issue was the amount of funding allocated to grantees under the three direct-service programs. Grantees expressed the concern that although Congress has periodically increased funding authorization for these programs, funding for individual grantees has remained relatively stable over time. A second issue was the lack of outcome data for youth who run away or experience homelessness. Finally, the bill addresses issues related to the educational and workforce needs of runaway and homeless youth. This report will not be updated."
