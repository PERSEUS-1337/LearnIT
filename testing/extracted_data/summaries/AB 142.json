    "title": "An act to amend Section 5093.56 of, and to add Sections 5093.548 and 5093.549 to, the Public Resources Code, relating to wild and scenic rivers.",
    "content": "Existing law, the California Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, provides for a system of classification of those rivers or segments of rivers in the state that are designated as wild, scenic, or recreational rivers, for purposes of preserving the highest and most beneficial use of those rivers. The act requires the Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency to study and submit to the Governor and the Legislature a report that analyzes the suitability or nonsuitability for addition to the system of rivers or segments of rivers that are designated by the Legislature as potential additions to the system, and requires that each report contain specified information and recommendations with respect to the proposed designation. This bill would require the secretary, in a report analyzing the suitability or nonsuitability of a proposed designation of the Mokelumne River, its tributaries, or segments thereof as additions to the system, to consider the potential effects of the proposed designation on future water requirements, as specified, and the effects of climate change on river values and current and projected water supplies, and to consider other factors. The bill would include any segment of the Mokelumne River designated for potential addition within certain protections afforded to wild and scenic rivers until the completion of the study period and the implementation of any recommendation to add the segment of the Mokelumne River to the system, or December 31, 2021, whichever occurs first. The bill would also designate specified segments of the Mokelumne River for potential addition to the system. The bill would require the secretary to submit a report pursuant to the above-described requirements to the Legislature and Governor no later than December 31, 2017, and would require the report to include a clear recommendation on the suitability or nonsuitability for addition to the system of each of the designated segments of the Mokelumne River. The bill would require the secretary to enter into a cost-sharing agreement with the Upper Mokelumne River Watershed Authority that would require the state and the authority to each pay a specified portion of the cost of the report. By imposing new duties on a local government entity, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would declare that due to the unique geographical features of the Mokelumne River and its tributaries, a general statute within the meaning of specified provisions of the California Constitution cannot be made applicable and a special statute is necessary. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
