    "content": "Citrus Investment in Treatment and Research for US Sustainability Act or the CITRUS Act This bill amends several agricultural laws to authorize various Department of Agriculture (USDA) citrus programs. The bill reauthorizes through FY2023: (1) the Emergency Citrus Disease Research and Extension Program, (2) the Citrus Health Response Program, and (3) the Huanglongbing Multi-Agency Coordination Group. The bill extends the termination date for USDA's Citrus Disease Subcommittee from September 30, 2018, until the subcommittee determines that Huanglongbing and the Asian citrus psyllid no longer pose a threat to US citrus production. The bill modifies the Tree Assistance Program to allow citrus producers to: (1) receive additional assistance under the program, and (2) have higher adjusted gross incomes while receiving benefits under the program."
