    "content": "Regulatory Fair Warning Act of 1998 - Prohibits a Federal agency or court from imposing a sanction for a violation of a rule if the agency or court finds that: (1) the rule was not printed in the Code of Federal Regulations or in the Federal Register, was not known to the person, or was not knowable to a person who has engaged in a reasonable, good faith investigation of the rules applicable to the conduct that allegedly violated the rule. (2) the rule failed to give the person fair warning of the conduct that it prohibits or requires. Or (3) with respect only to a retrospective sanction, official representations to the person about what the rule prohibits or requires were misleading and were reasonably relied upon by the person."
