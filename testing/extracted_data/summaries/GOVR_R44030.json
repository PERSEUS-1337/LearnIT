The Administration's proposed budget included $474 million in special federal payments to the District of Columbia government. An additional $286 million was requested for the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) and the Public Defender Service, two federally chartered, independent agencies that work exclusively on behalf of the District criminal justice system. The combined budget requests totaled $760 million in special federal payments. On April 2, 2015, the mayor of the District of Columbia, Muriel Bowser, submitted her proposed budget request for FY2016 to the District of Columbia Council for approval. The budget request included $474 million in special federal payments, $12.9 billion in total operating expenditures and $1.2 billion in capital outlays. The mayor's budget request did not include funding for Court Services and Offender Supervision and the Public Defender Service, which are submitted under a different account. The Council, pursuant to the requirements of the Home Rule Act, had 56 days to review, amend, and approve the District's budget. The approved budget, comprising special federal payments, local sourced operating expenses, and general provisions, was submitted to the President by the mayor on July 8, 2015, for transmittal to Congress for its review and approval. The mayor's budget request also included provisions that would have granted the District significant autonomy over its budgetary and legislative affairs. Specifically, the act called for the repeal of portions of the District's code governing congressional review of all acts passed by the District of Columbia Council, including referendum and initiatives. The inclusion of budget autonomy provisions in the mayor's request was part of an ongoing campaign by District officials to assert the principle of home rule. The issue of budget autonomy is currently being reviewed by the D.C. Court of Appeals based on a challenge to a 2012 voter-approved referendum amending the city's home rule charter. On July 9, 2015, the House Appropriations Committee approved the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act of 2016, H.R. 2995. The bill recommended $678.0 million in special federal payments to the District. On July 30, 2015, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 1910, its version of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act for FY2016. As reported, the bill recommended $688.7 million in special federal payments to the District. On September 30, 2015, unable to reach agreement on FY2016 appropriations for the District of Columbia before the beginning of 2016 fiscal year, Congress passed and the President signed P.L. 114-53, an act providing for continuing appropriations from October 1, 2015, to December 11, 2015. The act included a provision that allowed the District to expend local funds for activities and programs included in the District's FY2015 appropriations act at a rate as outlined in the District of Columbia Fiscal Year 2016 Budget Request Act of 2015 (D.C. Act 21\u201399). Congress passed two additional continuing resolutions (CRs) that extended the period covered to December 22, 2015. On December 18, 2015, Congress approved and the President signed into law P.L. 114-113, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, providing appropriations for the District of Columbia and other programs and activities for the remainder of FY2016. The act included $729.8 million in special federal payments for the District of Columbia. It also included provisions that restrict the use of both District and federal funds for abortion service, except in cases of rape or incest, and where the life of the pregnant woman would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term. The act also continued to prohibit the use of federal funds for a needle exchange program. This report will not be updated."
