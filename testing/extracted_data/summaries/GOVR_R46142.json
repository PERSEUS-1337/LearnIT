    "content": "Supreme Court precedent establishes that inherent principles of sovereignty give Congress \"plenary power\" to regulate immigration. The core of this power\u00e2\u0080\u0094the part that has proven most impervious to judicial review\u00e2\u0080\u0094is the authority to determine which non-U.S. nationals (aliens) may enter the United States and under what conditions. The Court has also established that the executive branch, when enforcing the laws concerning alien entry, has broad authority to do so mostly free from judicial oversight. Two principles frame the scope of the political branches' power to exclude aliens. First, nonresident aliens abroad generally cannot challenge exclusion decisions because they do not have constitutional rights with respect to entry and cannot obtain judicial review of the statutory basis for their exclusion unless Congress provides otherwise. Second, even when the exclusion of a nonresident alien burdens the constitutional rights of a U.S. citizen, the government need only satisfy a \"highly constrained\" judicial inquiry to prevail against the citizen's constitutional challenge. The Supreme Court developed the first principle\u00e2\u0080\u0094that nonresident aliens generally cannot challenge exclusion decisions\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a line of late 19th to mid-20th century exclusion cases. These cases culminated in the 1950 decision United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy , in which the Court declared that \"it is not within the province of any court, unless expressly authorized by law, to review the determination of the political branch of the Government to exclude a given alien.\" This rule forms the basis of the doctrine of consular nonreviewability, which in almost all circumstances bars nonresident aliens abroad from challenging visa denials by U.S. consular officers. But the rule set forth in Knauff applies with less force to decisions to exclude aliens arriving at the border. Aliens at the cusp of entry into the United States may be detained by immigration authorities pending their removal. Their cases can trigger habeas corpus proceedings for that reason and may also implicate complex statutory frameworks on judicial review. The second principle, concerning exclusion decisions that burden the rights of U.S. citizens, has been the primary subject of the Supreme Court's modern exclusion jurisprudence. In four cases since 1972\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Kleindienst v. Mandel , Fiallo v. Bell , the splintered Kerry v. Din , and Trump v. Hawaii \u00e2\u0080\u0094the Court has recognized that U.S. citizens who claim that the exclusion of aliens violated the citizens' constitutional rights may obtain judicial review of the exclusion decisions. Yet the standard of review that the Court applies to such claims is so deferential to the government as to all but foreclose U.S. citizens' constitutional challenges. In the most recent case, Trump v. Hawaii , the Court applied a \"highly constrained\" level of review to uphold a broad executive exclusion policy notwithstanding some evidence that the purpose of the policy was to exclude Muslims. The Mandel line of cases reaffirms the unique scope of Congress's power to legislate for the exclusion of aliens. Exclusion statutes draw minimal judicial scrutiny even when they classify people by disfavored criteria, such as gender or legitimacy. With respect to the executive power, the cases reaffirm generally that, in the absence of statutory provisions to the contrary, courts play almost no role in overseeing the application of admission and exclusion laws to nonresident aliens abroad. However, the cases leave some questions about executive exclusion power unresolved, including whether the Executive has inherent, constitutional power to exclude aliens and whether U.S. citizens may bring statutory challenges against executive decisions to exclude aliens abroad."
