    "title": "A bill to provide for teacher liability protection.",
    "content": "Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to establish a new title XV, Teacher Liability Protection. Preempts State law, except where it provides additional protection of teachers from liability. Makes ESEA title XV inapplicable to any civil action in State court against a teacher in which all parties are citizens of the State if such State enacts a statute electing that ESEA title XV not apply. Provides that no teacher in a school shall be liable for harm caused by an act or omission on behalf of the school if the teacher was acting within the scope of employment or responsibilities relating to providing educational services, subject to specified requirements and exceptions. Limits punitive damages and liability for non-economic loss."
