Makes eligible for such scholarships any teachers who: (1) teach elementary or secondary school special education or teach middle or secondary school mathematics, science, or foreign languages. (2) are employed by a local education agency (LEA) that serves a school qualifying for teacher Perkins loan cancellation, and that is in partnership with the teacher preparation program. And (3) agree to teach, for five years after receiving the degree, at the school they previously taught or one designated by the LEA, and to mentor a novice teacher in the LEA for two years."
