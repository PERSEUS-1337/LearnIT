    "content": "Poland and the United States have enjoyed close relations, particularly since the terroristattacks of September 11, 2001. Warsaw has been a reliable supporter and ally in the global war onterrorism and has contributed troops to the U.S.-led coalitions in Afghanistan and in Iraq -- whereit assumed a leading role. Over the past year, however, many Poles have concluded that theircountry's involvement in Iraq has increasingly become a political liability, particularly on thedomestic front. With elections scheduled for September 2005, the government has announced aphased troop withdrawal. Some Poles have argued that, despite the human casualties and financialcosts their country has borne, their loyalty to the United States has gone unrewarded. Many hopethat the Bush Administration will respond favorably by providing increased military assistance, byawarding Iraq reconstruction contracts to Polish firms, and by changing its visa policy. Poland has had an eventful political scene in recent years. Since 2001, two prime ministershave fallen. Many attribute these turnovers to a series of high-profile scandals. Although the currentgovernment has steered the nation into the EU and nurtured a strong, export-based economy, pollsindicate that it may be replaced in the next elections. However, regardless of which parties form thenext government, Poland's foreign policy will not likely undergo drastic changes. Poland'sexport-dependent economy has performed relatively well in recent years; the agricultural sector inparticular has responded positively to EU membership. A NATO member since 1999, Poland has been restructuring and modernizing its military toenable it to respond to out-of-area missions -- an alliance priority. Poland has sought to nurturedemocracy in Ukraine and Belarus, and to normalize ties with Russia. Poland has been an activemember of NATO and, since May 2004, the European Union. Poland was not reluctant to assertitself in a number of issue areas before joining the EU and will likely be even less hesitant to do sonow that it is a member. Some analysts argue that, if it continues on its current path, Poland maywell emerge as a leading nation in Europe. Although most analysts do not anticipate major changesin Polish foreign policy in the near future, some believe that it is inevitable that Poland will drawcloser to the EU over the long term. This report provides political and economic background on Poland and evaluates currentissues in U.S.-Polish and Polish-European relations. This report will be updated after Poland's 2005elections.
