Requires a state or local election official to provide at least one one early voting location on tribal land when requested by the tribal government. Requires each state to, after reasonable notice and public hearings, adopt and submit to the Commission a plan which provides for the equitable distribution of early voting locations. Requires each state to make early voting available to any eligible voter for at least 10 days before an election for federal office. Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration, the Postmaster General, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of the Interior to permit a state to designate facilities of the respective agencies located in the state as voter registration agencies. Requires each state to permit any eligible individual on the same day as a federal election and on any day when voting, including early voting, is permitted for a federal election to: (1) register to vote in the election, and (2) cast a vote in it. Requires each state to provide a secure online interface available to the public on a public, government website that allows any eligible individual to register electronically to vote or to update their voter registration. Authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action in an appropriate district court for declaratory or injunctive relief as necessary to carry out this Act. Allows any aggrieved person a private right of action, too."
