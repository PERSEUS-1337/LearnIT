    "content": "Consumer Products Safe Testing Act - Requires each Federal department or agency (department) head to: (1) evaluate any regulation, guideline, or recommendation issued by that department which requires, recommends, or encourages the use of the Draize or other animal acute toxicity test to evaluate the safety of a regulated product. (2) evaluate nonanimal alternatives with the potential for partial or full replacement of such test. And (3) promulgate regulations, guidelines, or recommendations that specify a nonanimal acute toxicity test or battery of tests that should be used instead of an animal test unless the nonanimal test is less likely to predict the acute health effects of a product on humans. Directs the appropriate Federal department, if a determination is made that no nonanimal test is as likely to predict the human reaction to the regulated product as the animal test, to publish in the Federal Register an explanation of all options considered and the justification for continuing the animal test, which shall be subject to public comment. Requires each Federal department head, at least every two years , after considering the most recent technological advances available, to determine whether continued use of any animal test is justified . Makes this Act inapplicable to regulations, guidelines, or recommendations related to medical research."
