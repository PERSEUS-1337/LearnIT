Combat corruption, including investigating and prosecuting government officials credibly alleged to be corrupt. And protect the right of political opposition parties, journalists, trade unionists, human rights defenders, and other civil society activists to operate without interference. The Department of the Treasury shall submit to Congress a report assessing: (1) the effectiveness of the international financial institutions in enforcing applicable program safeguards in Nicaragua, and (2) the effects of specified constitutional and election concerns in Nicaragua on long-term prospects for positive development outcomes there. The President may waive such requirements in the US national interest. The bill requires: (1) the President to direct the US Permanent Representative to the Organization of American States to use US influence to advocate for an Electoral Observation Mission to be sent to Nicaragua in 2017, and (2) the State Department to report on the involvement of senior Nicaraguan government officials in acts of public corruption or human rights violations."
