    "title": "SB 377",
    "content": "Existing law establishes a low-income housing tax credit program pursuant to which the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee provides procedures and requirements for the allocation of state insurance, income, and corporation tax credit amounts among low-income housing projects based on federal law. This bill, beginning on or after January 1, 2016, and before January 1, 2026, would allow a taxpayer that is allowed a low-income housing tax credit to elect to sell all or a portion of that credit to one or more unrelated parties, as described, for each taxable year in which the credit is allowed for not less than 80 of the amount of the credit to be sold, and would provide for the one-time resale of that credit, as provided. The bill would require the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee to enter into an agreement with the Franchise Tax Board to pay any costs incurred by the Franchise Tax Board in administering these provisions. The bill would require the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee to report to the Legislature on the total amounts of credits allowed to, and sold by, taxpayers pursuant to these provisions, as specified. Existing law, in the case of a partnership, requires the allocation of the credits, on or after January 1, 2009, and before January 1, 2016, to partners based upon the partnership agreement, regardless of how the federal low-income housing tax credit, as provided, is allocated to the partners, or whether the allocation of the credit under the terms of the agreement has substantial economic effect, as specified. This bill would extend these provisions indefinitely. This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."
