Existing law requires the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to refer a prisoner for evaluation by the State Department of State Hospitals when the secretary determines that the person may be a sexually violent predator, requires the State Department of State Hospitals to evaluate the person in accordance with a standardized assessment protocol, as specified, to determine whether the person is a sexually violent predator, and specifies the judicial processes necessary for civil commitment as a sexually violent predator, including, but not limited to, the right to a jury trial. Existing This bill would require the State Department of State Hospitals to consult, on or before January 30, 2016, with a committee comprised of representatives of specified organizations to make recommendations regarding possible changes to the standardized assessment protocol. The bill would require the State Department of State Hospitals, on or before March 1, 2016, to initiate the regulatory process to update the standardized assessment protocol, as specified. Existing law requires an annual examination of the mental condition of a sexually violent predator to determine whether conditional release to a less restrictive alternative or unconditional release is in the best interest of the person and the conditions imposed would adequately protect the community. Existing law requires that the report be in the form of a declaration and prepared by a professionally qualified person. Proposition 83, enacted by the voters at the November 7, 2006, statewide general election, made various changes to the sexually violent predator civil commitment process. Proposition 83 permits the Legislature to amend its provisions, either by a 2 3 vote of the membership of each house, or by a majority vote of the membership of each house if the amendments expand the scope of the application of the provisions of the proposition or increase the punishments or penalties provided in the proposition. This bill would require the report described above to be signed by the Director of the State Department of State Hospitals. By amending the requirements for the report, this bill would amend Proposition 83. The bill would also create a 7-member oversight board to advise the Governor and the Legislature regarding the civil commitment of sexually violent predators comprised of representatives selected by the State Department of State Hospitals and other organizations, as specified. The bill would require the oversight board to meet at least 6 times per year and, beginning January 1, 2017, to make an annual report to the Governor and the Legislature including the board\u2019s recommendations, as specified."
