    "content": "Lead from various sources poses a key environmental threat to children's health, and the regulation of lead in drinking water has been a key component of federal efforts to reduce exposures to lead. Lead contamination of drinking water became a major issue in Washington, DC, in 2004, when news reports revealed marked increases in the levels of lead in tap water. The local water authority's failure to effectively inform the public about the high lead levels angered citizens and damaged public trust in the local water supply. These events led policy makers to examine the adequacy of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) lead in drinking water rule, including the rule's monitoring and public notification requirements, and EPA and state enforcement of the rule. Oversight hearings were held on these issues during the 108th Congress, and legislation to strengthen lead regulation was offered but not enacted. This report reviews issues surrounding the elevated lead levels in DC drinking water and actions to address this problem. More broadly, it discusses the lead regulatory framework, and EPA's national review of the rule and its implementation to determine whether the situation in Washington, DC, denotes a wider problem in need of a broader response. This report will be updated to reflect developments."
