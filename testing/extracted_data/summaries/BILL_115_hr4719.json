    "content": "This bill requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish requirements to ensure that states conduct commercial driver's license (CDL) skills tests and retests in a timely manner. DOT must require each state to submit quarterly reports that describe the status of skills testing for individuals applying for a CDL at a CDL skills test location in the state, including average wait times and the numbers of examiners and test sites available to applicants. DOT must also submit specified reports to the states and Congress regarding the information received from the states. Beginning in FY2021, the bill authorizes DOT to withhold certain highway funds from states that are not in compliance with specified requirements regarding CDL skills testing and retesting wait times."
