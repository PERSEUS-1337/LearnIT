    "content": "Fair Access to Indemnity and Reimbursement Act - Amends the National Labor Relations Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act to allow the recovery of attorney's fees and costs by certain employers and labor organizations who are prevailing parties in administrative proceedings brought against them by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) or before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC) or in court proceedings brought by or against the NLRB or OSHRC. Requires that such employers or labor organizations have not more than 100 employees and a net worth of not more than $7 million at the time of such proceedings. Provides for such recovery without regard to whether the position of the NLRB, the Secretary of Labor, or a court was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust."
