    "content": "Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) functions are principal elements of U.S.defense capabilities, and include a wide variety of systems for acquiring and processing informationneeded by national security decisionmakers and military commanders. ISR systems range in sizefrom hand-held devices to orbiting satellites. Some collect basic information for a wide range ofanalytical products; others are designed to acquire data for specific weapons systems. Some are\"national\" systems intended primarily to collect information of interest to Washington-area agencies;others are \"tactical\" systems intended to support military commanders on the battlefield. Collectively, they account for a major portion of U.S. intelligence spending that, according to mediaestimates, amounts to some $40 billion annually. For some time Congress has expressed concern about the costs and management of ISRprograms. With minor exceptions, ISR acquisition has been coordinated by the Defense Departmentand the Intelligence Community. Although there are long-existing staff mechanisms for reviewingand coordinating ISR programs in the context of the annual budget submissions, many in Congressbelieve that existing procedures have not avoided duplication of effort, excessive costs, and gaps incoverage. Examples that some observers cite are separate efforts to acquire a new generation ofreconnaissance satellites and a high altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) known as Global Hawk. Both systems acquire some of the same sorts of information and serve similar customers, but theyare acquired in distinctly different ways; moreover, in both cases procurement efforts have beenbeset by increasing costs and schedule delays. Recently enacted statutes mandate better integration of ISR capabilities and require that theDefense Department prepare a roadmap to guide the development and integration of ISR capabilitiesover the next fifteen years. An effective roadmap, if developed, could potentially ensure morecomprehensive coverage of targets and save considerable sums of money. To establish responsibilityfor an Intelligence Community-wide effort, the 9/11 Commission recommended that a new positionof Director of National Intelligence be established to manage the national intelligence program (butnot joint military and tactical intelligence programs, which would continue to be managed by theDefense Department). This position was included, after extended debate, in the Intelligence Reformand Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ) that was approved by the President onDecember 17, 2004. The implications of this legislation for ISR programs are as yet uncertain, butCongress may seek to assess the effectiveness of the statute in addressing long-existing concernswith ISR programs. This report will be updated as circumstances warrant."
