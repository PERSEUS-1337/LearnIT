    "content": "Orphan Highway Restoration Act - Defines orphan highway to mean a highway that: (1) formerly was a US numbered highway. (2) no longer is a principal route for traffic passing through a state. And (3) because of decreased importance to statewide transportation, has received only routine maintenance but needs significant restoration. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) make grants and provide technical assistance to states and local government units to restore orphan highways. And (2) allocate funds to grant recipients for FY2010-FY2015 based on a calculated formula."
