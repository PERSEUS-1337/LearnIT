Requires automobile manufacturers to ensure that at least 50 of 2012 and 2013 model year automobiles and light duty trucks manufactured for sale in the United States are dual fueled. Increases the minimum to 90 for later model years. Requires the Secretary of Energy to make grants to eligible facilities to pay the federal share of: (1) installing blender pump fuel infrastructure, including infrastructure necessary for the direct retail sale of ethanol fuel blends and to directly market such fuels to gas retailers. And (2) providing subgrants to direct retailers of such fuels for the installation of fuel infrastructure for the direct retail sale of such fuels.

And (2) ethanol fuel blend as a blend of gasoline and ethanol, with a minimum of 0 and maximum of 85 derived from denatured ethanol. Requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations to ensure that each major fuel distributor that sells or introduces gasoline into commerce in the United States through majority-owned stations or branded stations installs one or more blender pumps that dispense E-85 fuel and ethanol fuel blends at specified minimum percentages of such stations for specified years in each state. Allows major fuel distributors to earn and sell credits if they exceed such percentages."
