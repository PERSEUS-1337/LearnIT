    "content": "Transportation Low Emissions Energy Plan 2020 Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT), in coordination with the Secretary of Energy (DOE) and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to establish a stakeholder-driven process to develop a national transportation low emissions energy plan. Requires such plan to: (1) project the near- and long-term need for and location of electric drive vehicle refueling infrastructure at strategic locations across all major national highways, roads, and corridors. (2) identify infrastructure and standardization needs for electricity providers, infrastructure providers, vehicle manufacturers, and electricity purchasers. (3) establish a goal of achieving strategic deployment of electric vehicle infrastructure by 2020. (4) prioritize the development of standardized public charge access ports with wireless or smart card billing capability and level I and level II charge port systems that will meet the energy requirements of the majority of plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles. (5) examine the feasibility of level III charge port systems that can charge over a period of 10 to 20 minutes. And (6) focus on infrastructure that provides consumers with the lowest cost while providing convenient charge system access. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) designate within DOT a LEEP coordinator to oversee Plan development and the implementation of regional pilot projects. And (2) establish four pilot projects to demonstrate electric drive vehicles and infrastructure in rural locations and in commercial use."
