In private sector organizations, a CIO is often a seniordecisionmaker providing leadership anddirection for information resource development, procurement, and management, with a focus on improvingefficiency and the quality of services delivered. Originally considered in an early draft of the Clinger-Cohen Act in 1995 ( P.L. 104-106 ), the idea of a single federalCIO was dropped in favor of creating CIOpositions within the executive agencies. The mixed results of agency-level CIOs, combined with a growing interestin better managing government IT resources,has renewed attention in this issue. Efforts to coordinate electronic government (e-government) initiatives has alsoled some observers to call for an\"e-government czar\" or a federal CIO. During the 106th Congress a number of lawmakers made proposals to establish a federal CIO. In the House of Representatives one bill ( H.R. 4670 ,Turner) would have established a federal CIO in an office outside of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). A second bill ( H.R. 5024 ,Davis) had similar provisions but also provided a federal CIO with a broad mandate and budget authority tocarry out federal IT projects, and thepower to coordinate and execute government-wide information security efforts. Neither bill was passed in the lastCongress. In May 2001 a Senate bill wasintroduced ( S. 803 , Lieberman), which included many of the House bills' provisions as well as new ones suchthe creation of a Federal IT TrainingCenter. A companion House bill ( H.R. 2458 , Turner) was introduced in July 2001. On March 21, 2002, theGovernmental Affairs Committeereported S. 803 (now renamed the E-Government Act of 2002) with an amendment. The Senate passed thebill unanimously on June 27, 2002. Although the Bush Administration has opposed creating a separate federal CIO, in June 2001 OMB announced the creation of a new position, the AssociateDirector of Information Technology and E-Government, who will report to the Deputy Director of Management(DDM) at OMB. The DDM, will be the federalCIO. Despite the OMB announcement, some policymakers suggest that many issues remain unresolved. One issue is the organizational placement of the position.There is disagreement over whether the federal CIO should be placed in OMB or if a new office should beestablished within the White House. A second issue is the scope of responsibility of the position. Some proponents suggest that the federal CIO should coordinate information security issues. Criticsargue that individual agencies may believe they have a reduced obligation or will devote fewer resources toinformation security at a time when threats toinformation resources are climbing. Another area of concern is budgetary authority. Many observers consider somecontrol over funding of IT projects critical tothe success of a federal CIO, either by controlling a portion of the various agencies' budgets for IT projects orproviding the federal CIO with a fund to supportinteragency projects."
