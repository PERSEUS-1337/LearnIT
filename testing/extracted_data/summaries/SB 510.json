    "title": "An act to amend Sections 23103, 23109, and 23109.2 of the Vehicle Code, relating to vehicles.",
    "content": "Existing law makes it a crime to engage in a motor vehicle speed contest on a highway. Existing law prohibits an individual from driving a vehicle upon a highway or in an offstreet parking facility in a reckless manner. Existing law authorizes a peace officer, upon determining that a person was engaged in any of these crimes, to impound the vehicle used for the offense for no more than 30 days. Existing law provides that if a person is convicted of engaging in a motor vehicle speed contest on a highway and the vehicle used in the violation is registered to that person, the vehicle may be impounded at the registered owner\u2019s expense for not less than one day nor more than 30 days. This bill would require the vehicle used in the violation of the crimes above, if it is registered to the person convicted of engaging in a motor vehicle speed contest or reckless driving, to be impounded for 30 days, subject to specified exceptions. By imposing new requirements on local agencies, the bill would create a state-mandated local program. The bill would clarify that, upon finding a violation of any mechanical requirements, an officer to issue a notice to correct, and require the correction to be made within 30 days of release of the vehicle from impoundment. The bill would also require the vehicle to be released before the 30th day if the legal owner who is not the registered owner, holds a security interest in the vehicle, presents foreclosure documents or an affidavit of repossession, and meets other specified conditions. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
