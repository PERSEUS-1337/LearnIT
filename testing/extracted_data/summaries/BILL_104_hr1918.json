Removes provisions listing the excluded amounts as items of tax preference for purposes of alternative minimum tax. Changes the requirements for a business to qualify as a small business for these purposes. Removes provisions relating to a per-issuer limitation on a taxpayer's eligible gain. Modifies the working capital requirements of the active business requirement. Applies the amendments made by this Act to any qualified stock issued after August 10, 1993, if the taxpayer so elects."
