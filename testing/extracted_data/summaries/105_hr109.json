    "content": "Family and Medical Leave Improvements Act of 1997 - Amends the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to extend coverage to employees at worksites where the employer employs at least 25 employees at the worksite and within 75 miles of that worksite. Allows employees covered by such Act to take up to four hours during any 30-day period, and up to 24 hours during any 12-month period, of parental involvement and elder care leave to: (1) participate in or attend their children's educational and extracurricular activities, (2) accompany the child to routine medical or dental appointments. And (3) accompany an elderly relative to routine medical or dental appointments or appointments for other professional services related to the elder's care, such as interviewing at nursing or group homes. Amends Federal civil service law to apply the same parental involvement and elder care leave allowance to Federal employees."
