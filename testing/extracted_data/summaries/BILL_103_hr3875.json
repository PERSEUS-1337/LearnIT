    "content": "Private Property Owners Bill of Rights - Requires Federal agency heads to: (1) comply with applicable State and tribal government laws in implementing and enforcing the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) and the permitting program for dredged or filled material under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA). (2) administer and implement the Acts in a manner that least affects the private property owners' constitutional and other legal rights. (3) develop and implement rules and regulations for ensuring that such rights are protected when making any final decision that restricts the use of private property. (4) obtain the consent of the property owner and provide appropriate notice before entering privately-owned property in order to collect information on it. And (5) give the property owner an opportunity to review and dispute the data collected before using it to implement or enforce any of the Acts. Amends ESA and FWPCA to provide for administrative appeals of certain actions, including those related to the denial of permits and the imposition of administrative penalties. Entitles a private property owner deprived of 50 percent or more of the fair market value or the economically viable use of a portion of property as a consequence of a final qualified agency action to receive compensation upon request in accordance with specified guidelines. Amends ESA to require the Secretary of the Interior to notify all private property owners or lessees of property subject to a management agreement and provide an appropriate opportunity for their participation in such an agreement when the Secretary enters into it with any non-Federal person establishing restrictions on property use."
