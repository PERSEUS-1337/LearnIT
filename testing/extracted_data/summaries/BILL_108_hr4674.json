    "content": "Directs the Secretary of State to submit to the appropriate congressional committees, every six months, a list of each country where torture or degrading treatment is commonly used in interrogation and detention. Prohibits, with specified waiver authority, the transfer of a person in US custody to such a country. States that such prohibition shall not be construed to apply to the legal extradition of a person under a bilateral or multilateral extradition treaty if, prior to extradition, that person has recourse to a US court to challenge the extradition on the basis that there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture or degrading treatment in the requesting country."
