    "content": "Earth penetrator weapons, often called \"bunker busters,\" burrow into the ground some tensof feet before detonating, greatly increasing their ability to destroy buried targets. The United Stateshas several types of conventional earth penetrators. The current U.S. nuclear earth penetrator, theB61-11 bomb, cannot penetrate certain types of terrain in which hardened underground facilities maybe located, so the Air Force and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) are studyinga more effective penetrator, the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP). While Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld said in 2003 that RNEP was a study, NNSA's FY2005budget document showed a five-year total of $484.7 million if RNEP were to proceed beyond thestudy phase. NNSA said no decision had been made to proceed, and out-year figures were shownto meet congressionally-mandated budgeting requirements and were not a request. RNEP requestsare, of course, subject to congressional approval, rejection, or modification. The five-year figuresparked congressional debate. The FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act contained the fullRNEP request, $27.6 million. The House and Senate both rejected amendments to that bill thatwould have eliminated RNEP funds. However, P.L. 108-447 , the FY2005 ConsolidatedAppropriations Act, appropriated no funds for RNEP. As a result, NNSA could not work on RNEPin FY2005. The FY2006 RNEP request was $4.0 million for NNSA for studies, and $4.5 million for theDepartment of Defense (DOD) to study integrating RNEP onto the B-2 bomber. The House passedthe FY2006 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill, H.R. 2419 , with noNNSA RNEP funds. The House passed the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Bill, H.R. 1815 , providing the requested DOD funds and transferring the NNSA funds toDOD. The House Appropriations Committee's mark of H.R. 2863 , the FY2006 DODAppropriations Bill, provided $4.0 million for a conventional (nonnuclear) penetrator study. Committee staff indicated that the bill included the $4.5 million for DOD, and that the committee'sintent was that DOD use the money to study integration of a conventional penetrator onto the B-2. The bill as passed by the House retained these provisions. The Senate Armed Services Committee'smark of S. 1042 , the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Bill, recommendedproviding the NNSA funds as requested but denying the DOD funds on grounds that the DODprogram should await completion of NNSA's feasibility study. The Senate provided $4.0 millionfor NNSA for RNEP in H.R. 2419, rejecting an amendment by Senator Feinstein to deletethe funds. The Senate Appropriations Committee's mark of H.R. 2863 recommendedeliminating DOD funds requested for RNEP. On October 25, Senator Domenici said that NNSA haddropped its RNEP request and planned to focus earth penetration on conventional weaponstechnology, so, he said, energy and water conferees agreed to drop funding for RNEP. H.R.1815 as signed into law ( P.L. 109-360 ) provided no funds for RNEP, but $4.0 million forDOD for a conventional penetrator study. For FY2007, NNSA requested no funds for RNEP, and has closed out the project. Accordingly, this report will not be updated further."
