    "content": "The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) was established in the Emergency Health Personnel Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-623) to improve the distribution of health workers in underserved rural areas by providing scholarship support to students in qualified medical professions in exchange for a period of service in a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA). The NHSC is authorized in the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, Sections 331, 338A, 338B, and 338I and codified in 42 USC \u00a7234. Over the years, Congress has amended and reauthorized these authorities. In 2008, Congress reauthorized the NHSC in the Health Care Safety Net (HCSN) Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-355). Funding for the NHSC is provided in the annual appropriation bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies. For the FY2009 annual appropriation, Congress appropriated $134.9 million for NHSC programs. Also, Congress appropriated a total of $300 million for the NHSC in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5). The Health Resources and Services Administration, which is in the Department of Health and Human Services, oversees NHSC programs. Now in its 38th year, the NHSC consists of a Recruitment Program, which supports scholarships and loan repayments for NHSC recruits, and a Field Program, which oversees recruitment efforts and field placement. In 2008, the NHSC placed nearly 4,000 physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, mental and behavioral health professionals, and others into underserved areas. Public and private health providers describe the NHSC as a significant force in bolstering the supply of primary health care workers. As well, they identify the role of the NHSC as a significant health safety net provider for underserved populations. Some suggest a significant role for the NHSC in plans for health care reform. This report provides (1) a descriptive summary of the NHSC; (2) appropriation trends; (3) a profile of NHSC programs; (4) a review of selected program goals and outcomes; (5) a survey of the NHSC's workforce capacity; (6) a description of the NHSC National Advisory Committee; and (7) an analysis of policy issues that may be of interest to Congress. It will be updated to report changes in the appropriation and legislation."
