    "content": "The Canc\u00fan Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization(WTO)broke up without reaching agreementon the course of future multilateral trade negotiations. Negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda haveproceeded at a slow pace since the launch of thenew round in November 2001. The immediate cause of the collapse of talks was disagreement over launchingnegotiations on the Singapore issues, butagriculture and industrial market access issues were also sources of contention. Reaction from the United States hasbeen to focus on regional and bilateraltalks, while the European Union has undertaken a policy review of its position towards the WTO. The talks werecharacterized by the emergence of the G-20+group of developing nations that sought deep cuts in developed country agricultural subsidies. This report will notbe updated."
