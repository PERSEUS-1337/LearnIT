    "content": "Vietnam Human Rights Sanctions Act This bill requires the President to: (1) impose financial and immigrationentry sanctions on listed nationals of Vietnam who are complicit in human rights abuses committed against nationals of Vietnam or their family members, regardless of whether such abuses occurred in Vietnam. And (2) submit to Congress a publicly available list of individuals determined to be complicit in such human rights abuses. The President may waive sanctions to comply with international agreements or if in the US national interest. Sanctions shall be terminated if the President certifies to Congress that the government of Vietnam has: (1) released all political prisoners. (2) ceased its practices of violence, detention, and abuse of citizens of Vietnam engaging in peaceful political activity. And (3) conducted a transparent investigation into the killings, arrest, and abuse of such political activists and prosecuted those responsible. It is the sense of Congress that: (1) the US-Vietnam relationship cannot progress while the government of Vietnam's human rights record continues to deteriorate, and (2) the Secretary of State should designate Vietnam as a country of particular concern with respect to religious freedom."
