    "content": "Infant Protection and Baby Switching Prevention Act of 2011 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require certain hospitals reimbursed under Medicare, which also provide neonatal and infant care, to have in effect security procedures to reduce the likelihood of infant patient abduction and baby switching, including procedures for identifying all infant patients in the hospital in a manner that ensures that it will be evident if infants are missing. Establishes civil penalties for failure to have such security procedures in effect. Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit and establish criminal penalties for baby switching in hospitals."
