    "content": "This paper proposes a novel approach to train deep neural networks by unlocking the layer-wise dependency of backpropagation training. The approach employs additional modules called local critic networks besides the main network model to be trained, which are used to obtain error gradients without complete feedforward and backward propagation processes. We propose a cascaded learning strategy for these local networks. In addition, the approach is also useful from multi-model perspectives, including structural optimization of neural networks, computationally efficient progressive inference, and ensemble classification for performance improvement. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and suggest guidelines for determining appropriate algorithm parameters. In recent days, deep learning has been remarkably advanced and successfully applied in numerous fields BID14 . A key mechanism behind the success of deep neural networks is that they are capable of extracting useful information progressively through their layered structures. It is an increasing trend that more and more complex deep neural network structures are developed in order to solve challenging real-world problems, e.g., BID7 . Training of deep neural networks is based on backpropagation in most cases, which basically works in a sequential and synchronous manner. During the feedforward pass, the input data is processed through the hidden layers to produce the network output; during the feedback pass, the error gradient is propagated back through the layers to update each layer's weight parameters. Therefore, training of each layer has dependency on all the other layers, which causes the issue of locking BID9 . This is undesirable in some cases, e.g., a system consisting of several interacting models, a model distributed across multiple computing nodes, etc.There have been attempts to remove the locking constraint. In BID0 , the method of auxiliary coordinates (MAC) is proposed. It replaces the original loss minimization problem with an equality-constrained optimization problem by introducing an auxiliary variable for each data and each hidden unit. Then, solving the problem is formulated as iteratively solving several sub-problems independently. A similar approach using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed in BID17 . It also employs an equality-constrained optimization but with different auxiliary variables, so that resulting sub-problems have closed form solutions. However, these methods are not scalable to deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).The method proposed in BID9 , called decoupled neural interface (DNI), directly synthesizes estimated error gradients, called synthetic gradients, using an additional small neural network for training a layer's weight parameters. As long as the synthetic gradients are close to the actual backpropagated gradients, each layer does not need to wait until the error at the output layer is backpropagated through the preceding layers, which allows independent training of each layer. However , this method suffers from performance degradation when compared to regular backpropagation BID2 . The idea of having additional modules supporting the layers of the main model is also adopted in BID2 , where the additional modules are trained to approximate the main model's outputs instead of error gradients. Due to this , however, the method does not resolve the issue of update locking, and in fact, the work does not intend to design a non-sequential learning algorithm. BID9 and the proposed local critic training. The black, green , and blue arrows indicate feedforward passes, an error gradient flow, and loss comparison, respectively.In this paper, we propose a novel approach for non-sequential learning, called local critic training. The key idea is that additional modules besides the main neural network model are employed, which we call local critics, in order to indirectly deliver error gradients to the main model for training without backpropagation. In other words, a local critic located at a certain layer group is trained in such a way that the derivative of its output serves as the error gradient for training of the corresponding layers' weight parameters. Thus, the error gradient does not need to be backpropagated, and the feedforward operations and gradient-descent learning can be performed independently. Through extensive experiments, we examine the influences of the network structure, update frequency, and total number of local critics, which provide not only insight into operation characteristics but also guidelines for performance optimization of the proposed method.In addition to the capability of implementing training without locking, the proposed approach can be exploited for additional important applications. First, we show that applying the proposed method automatically performs structural optimization of neural networks for a given problem, which has been a challenging issue in the machine learning field. Second, a progressive inference algorithm using the network trained with the proposed method is presented, which can adaptively reduce the computational complexity during the inference process (i.e., test phase) depending on the given data. Third, the network trained by the proposed method naturally enables ensemble inference that can improve the classification performance. In this paper, we proposed the local critic training approach for removing the inter-layer locking constraint in training of deep neural networks. In addition, we proposed three applications of the local critic training method: structural optimization of neural networks, progressive inference, and ensemble classification. It was demonstrated that the proposed method can successfully train CNNs with local critic networks having extremely simple structures. The performance of the method was also evaluated in various aspects, including effects of structures and update intervals of local critic networks and influences of the sizes of layer groups. Finally, it was shown that structural optimization, progressive inference, and ensemble classification can be performed directly using the models trained with the proposed approach without additional procedures.
