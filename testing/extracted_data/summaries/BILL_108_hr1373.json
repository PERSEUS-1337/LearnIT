    "content": "IDEA Parental Choice Act of 2003 - Amends the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to authorize use of funds for parental school choice programs which may involve vouchers for private or public education for students with disabilities. Allows the use of certain research and innovation grant and contract funds to support planning, design, and implementation of State programs that allow parents of children with disabilities a choice of an appropriate public or private school . Allows any State with a statewide or local area parental option program that allows use of public funds to pay some or all costs of attendance at a public or private school to supplement those public funds from its IDEA allocation, if the Federal funds are distributed to parents who make a genuine independent choice as to the appropriate school for their child. Provides that a State's allowing a parent to exercise this option fulfills the State's obligation to provide a free appropriate public education with respect to the child with disabilities during the period in which the child is enrolled in the selected school. Authorizes use of IDEA funds for local educational agencies to support reasonable additional expenses for the accommodation of students with disabilities who are eligible to receive supplemental education services, including services from private or faith-based providers, because they attend underachieving schools designated for improvement. Allows, at a State's discretion, students with disabilities up to age six, who meet certain criteria, to be included in IDEA early intervention services programs ."
