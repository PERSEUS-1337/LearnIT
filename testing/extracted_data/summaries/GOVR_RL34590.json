    "content": "Military personnel issues typically generate significant interest from many Members of Congress and their staffs. Ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in support of what the Bush Administration terms the Global War on Terror, along with the emerging operational role of the Reserve Components, further heighten interest and support for a wide range of military personnel policies and issues. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) selected a number of the military personnel issues that Congress considered as it deliberated the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009. In each case, this report provides a brief synopsis of sections that pertain to personnel policy. It includes background information and a discussion of the issue, along with a table that contains a comparison of the bill (H.R. 5658) passed by the House on May 22, 2008, the bill (S. 3001) passed by the Senate on September 17, 2008, and the final version (S. 3001) passed by the House on September 24, 2008 and by the Senate on September 27, 2008. Where appropriate, other CRS products are identified to provide more detailed background information and analysis of the issue. For each issue, a CRS analyst is identified and contact information is provided. Note: some issues were addressed in the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act and discussed in CRS Report RL34169 concerning that legislation. Those issues that were previously considered in CRS Report RL34169 are designated with a \"*\" in the relevant section titles of this report. This report focuses exclusively on the annual defense authorization process. It does not include appropriations, veterans' affairs, tax implications of policy choices or any discussion of separately introduced legislation. This report will be updated as needed."
