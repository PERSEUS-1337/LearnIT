    "content": "The price of oil began rising in October 2003 and reached record levels in 2004 and againin 2005. As a result of these price increases, consumers' budgets have been under pressure, businesscosts have risen, and oil producers' profits have increased. The 109th Congress is considering broadenergy legislation ( H.R. 6 ), that addresses conditions in the oil and petroleum productsmarkets. A long term explanatory factor for increasing oil prices could be the decline of the worldreserve base. The reserves to production ratio is the measure which indicates the world's ability tomaintain current production, based on proved reserves. Over the past decade there has been littlechange in the reserve to production ratio, suggesting that, at least for now, long term forces are notdriving up the price of oil. A wide variety of cyclic and short term factors have converged in such a way that the growthof demand has been unexpectedly high causing upward pressure on oil prices. Those factors whichhave been identified as contributing to the high price of oil include the resumption of relatively rapidgrowth rates of gross domestic product in many countries around the world, a declining value of theU.S. dollar, gasoline prices, the changing structure of the oil industry, OPEC policies, and thepersistently low levels of U.S. crude oil and gasoline inventories. Expectations concerning future market conditions are quickly embodied in oil prices formedin futures markets like the New York Mercantile Exchange. The fear of terrorism and war,uncertainty concerning the relationship between the Russian government and the oil company Yukos,and other political factors are quickly reflected in price along with real political unrest like thatexperienced by oil producing Venezuela and Nigeria. Speculative buying and selling might alsoaffect prices as financial traders adjust their investment portfolios to reflect expected marketconditions. Demand patterns for world oil and oil products show significant diversity by country, region,and product groupings. As a result of this diversity it is not possible to attach blame for the currentlevel of price to any one nation, region, or product segment. The view that the oil market isinternational in scope and tightly interrelated is enhanced by the demand data. As a result of the integrated nature of the world oil market it is unlikely that any one nationacting on its own can implement policies that isolate its market from broader price behavior. As newmajor oil importers, notably China, and potentially India, expand their demand, the oil market likelywill have to expand production capacity. This promises to increase the world's dependence on thePersian Gulf members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, especially SaudiArabia, and maintain upward pressure on price. This report will be updated."
