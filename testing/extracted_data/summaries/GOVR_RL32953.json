    "content": "Climate change is generally viewed as a global issue, but proposed responses generallyrequire action at the national level. In 1992, the United States ratified the United Nations'Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which called on industrialized countries totake the lead in reducing greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Over the past decade,a variety of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in the United States,but carbon dioxide emissions have continued to increase. Several proposals designed to address greenhouse gases have been introduced in the 109thCongress. Two proposals, S. 1151 , introduced by Senators McCain and Lieberman, anda draft alternative, announced by Senator Bingaman, received increased scrutiny in preparation forthe Senate's debate on comprehensive energy legislation. During that debate, S. 1151,introduced as S.Amdt. 826 , was defeated on a 38-60 vote. In contrast, the draftalternative remains a work-in-progress and has yet to be introduced. This report compares these twoproposals. Both proposals would establish market-based systems to limit emissions of greenhouse gases. However, the proposals differ in how those systems would work. S. 1151 wouldestablish an absolute cap on emissions from covered entities, and would allow entities to tradeemissions under that cap. The draft amendment would limit emissions intensity (greenhouse gasemissions per unit of GDP), and establish a cost-limiting safety valve to protect against highcompliance costs. Each would set up a tradeable permit program to begin addressing emissions bythe year 2010. In 2004, the Energy Information Administration analyzed an earlier version of S. 1151 . Under EIA's analysis, S. 1151 would achieve a 6.7% reduction in overallgreenhouse gas emissions in 2010 compared with its projected business-as-usual scenario, but wouldnot return emissions to their 2000 or 1990 levels. This contrasts with the CRS estimate that thedraft amendment would reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions 2.5% in 2010 compared with EIA'sbusiness-as-usual scenario. The two proposals represent different answers to the price-versus-quantity issue in reducinggreenhouse gases. In general, market-based mechanisms to reduce CO 2 emissions focus onspecifying either the acceptable emissions level (quantity) or compliance costs (price) and allowingthe marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution for the other variable. If one is moreconcerned about the possible economic cost (price) of the program, then use of a safety valve to limitcosts could appear to some more appropriate, even through it introduces some uncertainty about theamount of reduction achieved (quantity). In contrast, if one is more concerned about achieving aspecific emission reduction level (quantity), with costs handled efficiently, but not capped, atradeable permit program without a safety valve may be viewed as more appropriate. In the case ofthese alternatives, S. 1151 leans toward the quantity (total emissions) side of theequation; the draft amendment leans more toward the price side. This report will be updated asevents warrant."
