    "title": "SB 921",
    "content": "The Political Reform Act of 1974 generally requires elected officials, candidates for elective office, and committees formed primarily to support or oppose a candidate for public office or a ballot measure, along with other entities, to file periodic campaign statements. The act requires that these campaign statements contain prescribed information related to campaign contributions and expenditures of the filing entities. This bill would correct an erroneous cross-reference in these provisions and would make other technical, nonsubstantive changes."
