    "content": "This report tracks recent appropriations and related legislation for Title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) (P.L. 105-220). Following a brief summary of each WIA program, the report presents information on WIA funding for FY2008 and FY2009 and the provisions for WIA Title I programs in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), which was signed into law on February 17, 2009 (P.L. 111-5). WIA provides, in general, job training and related services to unemployed and underemployed individuals. WIA programs are administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), primarily through DOL's Employment and Training Administration (ETA). State and local WIA training and employment activities are provided through a system of One-Stop Career Centers. Authorization of appropriations under WIA expired in FY2003 but is annually extended through appropriations acts. Reauthorization legislation was considered in the 108th and 109th Congresses. WIA authorizes several job training programs: state formula grants for Adult, Youth, and Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities; Job Corps; and other national programs, including the Native American Program, the Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Program, the Veterans' Workforce Investment Program, Responsible Reintegration for Young Offenders, the Prisoner Reentry Program, and Community-Based Job Training Grants (also known as the Community College Initiative). An additional national program, YouthBuild, formerly in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), was made a part of WIA on September 22, 2006, by the YouthBuild Transfer Act (P.L. 109-281). Appropriations for WIA are made through the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (Labor-HHS-ED). In FY2009, aggregate funding for WIA Title I programs is $5.31 billion, an increase of 2.5% compared to the FY2008 funding level of $5.19 billion. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-161), Congress rescinded $250 million from the unexpended balances for FY2005 and FY2006 that had been appropriated for state formula grants for the Youth, Adult, and Dislocated Worker programs authorized under Title I of WIA. Funding of $4.2 billion for WIA Title I programs was provided through the ARRA and is in addition to the FY2009 appropriations. This report will be updated as major legislative developments occur."
