    "content": "This report describes key sources of information on government and private funding, and outlines eligibility for federal grants. Federal grants are intended for projects benefiting states and communities. Individuals may be eligible for other kinds of benefits or assistance, or small businesses and students may be eligible for loans. Free information is readily available to grantseekers, who generally know best the details of their projects. The Assistance Listings database at beta.SAM.gov describes more than 2,200 federal programs, more than half of them grants, and can be searched by keyword, department or agency, program title, beneficiary, and applicant eligibility. Federal department and agency websites provide additional information and guidance, and they provide state agency contacts. Once a program has been identified, eligible grantseekers may apply electronically for grants at the website Grants.gov through a uniform process for all agencies. Through Grants.gov, grantseekers may identify when federal funding notices and deadlines for a program become available, sign up for email notification of funding opportunities, and track the progress of submitted applications. Because government funds may be limited, the report also discusses sources of private and corporate foundation funding. The Foundation Center is a clearinghouse for information about private, corporate, and community foundations, with collections of resources in every state. This report includes sources of information on writing grant proposals. See also CRS Report RL32159, How to Develop and Write a Grant Proposal, by Maria Kreiser and Julie Jennings. Additional sources are also included in the CRS web page, \"Grants and Federal Assistance.\" See also CRS Report RL34035, Grants Work in a Congressional Office, by Maria Kreiser and Julie Jennings. This report will be updated at the beginning of every Congress and as needed."
