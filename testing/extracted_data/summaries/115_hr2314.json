    "content": "Security Clearance Family Review Act This bill prohibits specified federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, from granting access to classified information to a relative of the President for purposes of federal employment unless the Office of Government Ethics makes a favorable determination during a review process regarding the relative's suitability for such access. In conducting a review, the Office of Government Ethics must determine whether the relative of the President has any ongoing and substantial commercial relationships with state-owned or privately owned foreign enterprises or financial institutions, and, if so, whether the relative is ineligible for access to classified information because of such relationships."
