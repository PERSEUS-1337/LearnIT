    "content": "Digital Consumer Right to Know Act - Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue rules to implement requirements that a producer or distributor of copyrighted digital content disclose the nature of restrictions that limit the practical ability of the content purchaser to play, copy, transmit, or transfer such content on, to, or between devices commonly used with respect to that type of content. Requires such disclosure in the case of limitations on: (1) the recording for later viewing or listening of certain audio or video programming. (2) the reasonable and noncommercial use of legally acquired audio or video content. (3) making backup copies of legally acquired content subject to accidental damage, erasure, or destruction, (4) using limited excerpts of legally acquired content. And (5) engaging in the secondhand transfer or sale of legally acquired content. Provides disclosure exceptions. Requires the FTC to annually review the effectiveness of such rules. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) competition among distribution outlets and methods generally benefits consumers. And (2) copyright holders selling digital content in electronic form for distribution over the Internet should offer to license such content to multiple unaffiliated distributors."
