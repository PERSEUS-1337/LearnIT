    "content": "Fairness in the Workplace Commission Act - Establishes the National Commission on Fairness in the Workplace, which shall examine and report to the Congress on: (1) the growing corporate practice of providing wages and benefit levels for part-time and temporary employees which are lower than the wage and benefit levels provided to full-time employees who perform essentially identical work. (2) how the use of part-time and temporary employees has affected wage and benefit levels, employee job insecurity, and employee productivity. (3) the reasons that workers' wages have not kept pace with corporate profits and economic growth. (4) the reasons for the widening median wage gap between working men and working women. And (5) the reasons for the consistent discrepancy in the average wage of minority populations in comparison to the average wage of white Americans. Requires the Commission to develop policy options for the Congress to address the problems identified in the examination."
