Since the initial deployment of high-speed internet in the late 1990s, broadband technologies have been deployed throughout the United States primarily by the private sector. These providers include telephone, cable, wireless, and satellite companies as well as other entities that provide commercial telecommunications services to residential, business, and institutional customers. How broadband is defined and characterized in statute and in regulation can have a significant impact on federal broadband policies and how federal resources are allocated to promote broadband deployment in unserved and underserved areas. One way broadband can be defined is by setting a minimum threshold speed for what constitutes \"broadband service.\" Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to regularly initiate an inquiry concerning the availability of broadband to all Americans and to determine whether broadband is \"being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion.\" If the determination is negative, the act directs the FCC to \"take immediate action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition in the telecommunications market.\" Starting in 1999, there have been 11 Section 706 reports, each providing a snapshot and assessment of broadband deployment. As part of this assessment, and to help determine whether broadband is being deployed in \"a reasonable and timely fashion,\" the FCC has set a minimum broadband speed that essentially serves as the benchmark the FCC uses to determine what it considers broadband service for the purposes of its Section 706 determination. In 2015 the FCC, citing changing broadband usage patterns and multiple devices using broadband within single households, raised its minimum fixed broadband benchmark speed from 4 Mbps (download)/1 Mbps (upload) to 25 Mbps/3 Mbps. On August 8, 2017, the FCC adopted and released its Thirteenth Section 706 Notice of Inquiry (NOI). One proposal under consideration was establishing a lower benchmark speed specifically for mobile broadband. Stakeholders who supported an FCC determination that broadband is not being deployed in a reasonable and timely fashion generally opposed lowering the broadband benchmark by considering the presence of either fixed (at 25 Mbps/3 Mbps) or mobile (at 10 Mbps/1 Mbps) broadband as an indication that an area has adequate broadband service. On the other hand, stakeholders who supported an FCC determination that broadband is being deployed in a reasonable and timely fashion generally supported changing the FCC's broadband benchmark methodology to include the presence of either fixed or mobile broadband as an indication that an area is receiving adequate broadband service. On February 2, 2018, the FCC adopted and released its latest 706 report, the 2018 Broadband Deployment Report. While the FCC concluded that advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion, it concluded that adoption of a single mobile benchmark is currently unworkable and that mobile broadband service is not a full substitute for fixed service at this time. As broadband technology advances, commercially available download and upload speeds will likely increase, and the level at which broadband benchmark threshold speeds should be set is likely to remain controversial. Accordingly, the FCC's annual Section 706 determination is likely to be an issue in Congress as long as it is seen by stakeholders as providing a justification for current or future FCC regulatory or deregulatory policies."
