    "content": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) restore the unified credit against the estate and gift tax after 2009. (2) establish the amount of such credit at $3.5 million adjusted for inflation in calendar years after 2010. And (3) reduce the maximum estate and gift tax rate to 45. Expresses the sense of the Senate that any reduction in federal revenues resulting from this Act should be fully offset."
