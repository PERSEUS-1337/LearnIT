    "content": "Equal Employment for All Act of 2013 - Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to prohibit a current or prospective employer from using a consumer report or an investigative consumer report, or from causing one to be procured, for either employment purposes or for making an adverse action, if the report contains information that bears upon the consumer's creditworthiness, credit standing, or credit capacity. Makes exceptions to such prohibition when: (1) the consumer applies for, or currently holds, employment that requires a national security clearance, or (2) a consumer report is otherwise required by law."
