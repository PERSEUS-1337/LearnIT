    "content": "On December 18, 2001, the President Bush signed the FY2002 Department of Transportation (DOT) and Related Agencies conference agreement ( H.Rept. 107-308 ), appropriating a total of$59.588 billion for DOT, a 2.5% increase over the FY2001 enacted level. The enacted bill provides$507 million more than the House-passed version and $391 million less than the Senate-passed bill. At $32.895 billion, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) will receive slightly less than inFY2001. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) will receive $734 million, $21 million lessthan in FY2001. The other major agencies all get increases. The Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) budget will increase roughly 6% to $13.295 billion; the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)budget will increase 8% to $6.747 billion; and the Coast Guard will receive an increase of 12% to$5.031 billion. The Act also includes $1.25 billion (to be offset by user fee collections) for the newTransportation Security Administration (TSA). The enacted conference agreement mandates significant safety and inspection requirements be met by Mexico-domiciled trucks before DOT begins processing Mexican applications for operating authorityin the U.S. beyond the commercial zones along the border. It does, however, include a number ofmodifications in response to Administration concerns that the original Senate bill (as well as the Housebill) violated provisions of the North American Free Trade Association agreement (NAFTA). The conference agreement created a controversy when the conferees redirected and earmarked $997.6 million of Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) funds. The RABA mechanismadjusts DOT program authorization and obligation levels to reflect recent fuel tax revenues (byincreasing or decreasing both the authorization and the obligation limitation). For FY2002, thisadded $4.5 billion to DOT programs. This redirection of RABA funds reduces the RABA portionof the states' formula funding by 10.7% from what they otherwise would have received. Authorizerssee this action as a usurpation of their authority, and some vowed to oppose this sort of action in thefuture. Congress responded to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, by passing the 2001 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attackson the United States ( P.L.107-38 ). That Act provides $40 billion, government-wide, to pay the costsof a variety of responses, including \"providing increased transportation security.\" As of this writing,roughly $1.9 billion of these emergency supplemental funds have been approved for transfer to DOT.
