    "content": "Original Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle Ultra-High Relief Bullion Coin Act - Permits the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue a $20 coin that bears, on the obverse and reverse, the designs of the famous 27-millimeter version of the 1907 Augustus Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle ultra-high relief gold piece. Authorizes the Secretary to commence minting and issuing such coins for sale, beginning January 1, 2009. Prohibits the coins, regardless of the composition, from being made available as so-called fractional coins. States that no more than 25,000 shall be available for sale in a special Golden Age of American Coinage set. Requires the Secretary to take specified protective and anti-counterfeiting measures. Instructs the Treasury Inspector General to report to certain congressional committees on the extent of counterfeiting of rare, collectible, or numismatic coins for sale in the United States, regardless of the country where the original of such coin was produced or of the country in which the counterfeiting takes place, or sales overseas if such counterfeit coins are unauthorized copies of coins originally produced by the United States Mint."
