    "title": "An act to amend Section 4011.10 of the Penal Code, relating to health care.",
    "content": "Existing federal law provides for the federal Medicare Program, which is a public health insurance program for persons 65 years of age and older and specified persons with disabilities who are under 65 years of age. Existing law authorizes a county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency that contracts for health care services, to contract with providers of health care services for care to local law enforcement patients. Existing law requires hospitals that do not contract with the county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency that contracts for health care services to provide health care services to local law enforcement patients at a rate equal to 110 of the hospital\u2019s actual costs according to the most recent Hospital Annual Financial Data report issued by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, as calculated using a cost-to-charge ratio. This bill would authorize, for claims that have not previously been paid or otherwise determined by local law enforcement, those costs to be calculated according to the most recent approved cost-to-charge ratio from the Medicare Program. The bill would authorize the hospital, with the approval of the county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency responsible for providing health care services to local law enforcement patients, to choose which cost-to-charge ratio is most appropriate, and would require the hospital to give notice of any change. If the hospital chooses to use the cost-to-charge ratio from the Medicare Program, the bill would require the hospital to attach supporting Medicare documentation and an expected payment calculation to the claim. If a claim does not contain that documentation and payment calculation, or if, within 60 days of the hospital\u2019s request for approval to use the cost-to-charge ratio from the Medicare Program, approval is not granted by the county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency responsible for providing health care services to local law enforcement patients, the bill would require the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development cost-to-charge ratio to be used to calculate the payment. The bill would also make technical, nonsubstantive changes."
