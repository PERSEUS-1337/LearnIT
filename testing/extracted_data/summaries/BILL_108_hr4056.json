(2) the export of a MANPADS, including any component, part, accessory, or attachment thereof, without an individual validated license, except pursuant to transfers between governments. And (3) the re-export or retransfer of a MANPADS to a third person, organization, or government unless the written consent of the government that approved the original export or transfer is first obtained. Directs the President to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the status of such diplomatic efforts and of efforts by the appropriate US agencies to comply with the recommendations of the General Accounting Office report GAO-04-519, entitled Non-proliferation: Further Improvements Needed in US Efforts to Counter Threats from MANPADS.
