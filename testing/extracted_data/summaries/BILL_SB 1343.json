Existing law establishes school districts throughout the state and authorizes these school districts to provide instruction at the elementary and secondary schools they operate and maintain. Existing law provides for the governance of these school districts through elected school district governing boards. This bill would authorize school district governing boards to transfer to another school in that school district pupils enrolled in that school district who have been convicted of violent felonies, as defined, or designated misdemeanors if the pupil to be transferred and the victim of the crime for which the pupil was convicted are enrolled at the same school, if certain requirements are satisfied, including, but not limited to, that the governing board of the school district adopts a policy and notifies parents or guardians of the policy as part of its annual notification to parents and guardians, as specified."
