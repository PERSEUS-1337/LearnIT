Some examples include data simulators that are widely used in engineering and scientific research, generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image synthesis, and hot-off-the-press approximate inference techniques relying on implicit distributions. The majority of existing approaches to learning implicit models rely on approximating the intractable distribution or optimisation objective for gradient-based optimisation, which is liable to produce inaccurate updates and thus poor models. This paper alleviates the need for such approximations by proposing the \\emph{Stein gradient estimator}, which directly estimates the score function of the implicitly defined distribution. The efficacy of the proposed estimator is empirically demonstrated by examples that include meta-learning for approximate inference and entropy regularised GANs that provide improved sample diversity. Modelling is fundamental to the success of technological innovations for artificial intelligence. A powerful model learns a useful representation of the observations for a specified prediction task, and generalises to unknown instances that follow similar generative mechanics. A well established area of machine learning research focuses on developing prescribed probabilistic models BID8 , where learning is based on evaluating the probability of observations under the model. Implicit probabilistic models, on the other hand, are defined by a stochastic procedure that allows for direct generation of samples, but not for the evaluation of model probabilities. These are omnipresent in scientific and engineering research involving data analysis, for instance ecology, climate science and geography, where simulators are used to fit real-world observations to produce forecasting results. Within the machine learning community there is a recent interest in a specific type of implicit models, generative adversarial networks (GANs) BID10 , which has been shown to be one of the most successful approaches to image and text generation BID56 BID2 BID5 . Very recently, implicit distributions have also been considered as approximate posterior distributions for Bayesian inference, e.g. see BID25 ; BID53 ; BID22 ; BID19 ; BID29 ; BID15 ; BID23 ; BID48 . These examples demonstrate the superior flexibility of implicit models, which provide highly expressive means of modelling complex data structures.Whilst prescribed probabilistic models can be learned by standard (approximate) maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference, implicit probabilistic models require substantially more severe approximations due to the intractability of the model distribution. Many existing approaches first approximate the model distribution or optimisation objective function and then use those approximations to learn the associated parameters. However, for any finite number of data points there exists an infinite number of functions, with arbitrarily diverse gradients, that can approximate perfectly the objective function at the training datapoints, and optimising such approximations can lead to unstable training and poor results. Recent research on GANs, where the issue is highly prevalent, suggest that restricting the representational power of the discriminator is effective in stabilising training (e.g. see BID2 BID21 . However, such restrictions often intro- A comparison between the two approximation schemes. Since in practice the optimiser only visits finite number of locations in the parameter space, it can lead to over-fitting if the neural network based functional approximator is not carefully regularised, and therefore the curvature information of the approximated loss can be very different from that of the original loss (shown in (a)). On the other hand, the gradient approximation scheme (b) can be more accurate since it only involves estimating the sensitivity of the loss function to the parameters in a local region.duce undesirable biases, responsible for problems such as mode collapse in the context of GANs, and the underestimation of uncertainty in variational inference methods BID49 .In this paper we explore approximating the derivative of the log density, known as the score function, as an alternative method for training implicit models. An accurate approximation of the score function then allows the application of many well-studied algorithms, such as maximum likelihood, maximum entropy estimation, variational inference and gradient-based MCMC, to implicit models. Concretely , our contributions include:\u2022 the Stein gradient estimator, a novel generalisation of the score matching gradient estimator BID16 , that includes both parametric and non-parametric forms; \u2022 a comparison of the proposed estimator with the score matching and the KDE plug-in estimators on performing gradient-free MCMC, meta-learning of approximate posterior samplers for Bayesian neural networks, and entropy based regularisation of GANs. We have presented the Stein gradient estimator as a novel generalisation to the score matching gradient estimator. With a focus on learning implicit models, we have empirically demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed estimator by showing how it opens the door to a range of novel learning tasks: approximating gradient-free MCMC, meta-learning for approximate inference, and unsupervised learning for image generation. Future work will expand the understanding of gradient estimators in both theoretical and practical aspects. Theoretical development will compare both the V-statistic and U-statistic Stein gradient estimators and formalise consistency proofs. Practical work will improve the sample efficiency of kernel estimators in high dimensions and develop fast yet accurate approximations to matrix inversion. It is also interesting to investigate applications of gradient approximation methods to training implicit generative models without the help of discriminators. Finally it remains an open question that how to generalise the Stein gradient estimator to non-kernel settings and discrete distributions."
