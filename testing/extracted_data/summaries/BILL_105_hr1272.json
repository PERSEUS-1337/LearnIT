    "content": "Fire Administration Authorization Act of 1997 - Amends the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 to authorize appropriations for FY 1998 and 1999. Permits successor fire safety standards to be used as guidelines in addition to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 74, NFPA Standard 13 or 13-R, or NFPA Standard 101 for installation of hard-wired, single-station smoke detectors or automatic sprinkler systems in: (1) places of public accommodation affecting commerce. And (2) federally-assisted buildings. Requires the Administrator of the US Fire Administration to report to the Congress at least 60 days in advance on the termination or transfer to a private sector entity of any significant function of the Administration. Prohibits funds authorized by this Act from being made available for any activity to influence legislation before the Congress, except that Federal officers or employees may communicate to Members of Congress on requests for legislation or appropriations which they deem necessary for the efficient conduct of the public business. Requires the Administrator to exclude from consideration for grant agreements made by the Administration after FY 1997 any person who received funds appropriated for a fiscal year after FY 1997 under a grant agreement from any Federal funding source for a project that was not subjected to a competitive merit-based award process. Limits such exclusion to a five-year period after the person receives such Federal funds. Makes an exception for persons who received Federal funds due to membership in a class the members of which are awarded assistance according to a formula provided by law. Requires: (1) the House Committee on Science and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation to be notified if funds authorized by this Act are subject to a reprogramming action that requires notice to be provided to the Appropriations Committees. And (2) the Administrator to notify all such committees not later than 15 days before any major reorganization of any Administration program, project, or activity. Urges the Administration to give high priority to correcting, assess the risk to operations posed by, plan and budget for, and develop contingency plans for date-related year 2000 problems in its computer systems. Prohibits funds appropriated under this Act from being expended by an entity unless such entity complies with the Buy American Act. Expresses the sense of the Congress that entities receiving financial assistance under this Act should, in expending such assistance, purchase only American-made equipment and products. Requires the Administrator, in providing such assistance, to so notify each recipient."
