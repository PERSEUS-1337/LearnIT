    "content": "Declares that a child expelled or suspended shall not be entitled to continued educational services, including a free appropriate public education, during the term of such expulsion or suspension, if the State does not require a child without a disability to receive educational services after being expelled or suspended. Authorizes the LEA, even if State law does not require it to do so, to choose to continue to provide educational services, at any level of services and at a site it chooses. Amends the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 to subject certain provisions to IDEA requirements added by this Act for school expulsion or suspension, because of a weapons violation, of a child with a disability."
