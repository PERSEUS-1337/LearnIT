    "content": "Constituent service encompasses a wide array of non-legislative activities undertaken by Members of Congress or congressional staff, and it is commonly considered a representational responsibility. Member offices vary in their priorities, activities, and scope of constituent service, but most offices try to assist with certain requests when possible. Member offices have engaged in constituent service activities since the earliest Congresses. Depending on what the constituent is seeking, requests may be addressed by a Member's Washington, DC, office, or by a Member's district or state office. Many constituents contact congressional offices to initiate their own requests, but Members of Congress may also engage in outreach to let constituents know of the ways in which a Member office might be able to assist them. Members of Congress often post constituent service links on their official websites and may mention constituent services in newsletters, in other communications, or at events. These activities can help facilitate a lasting connection between Member offices and constituents, and they may also provide feedback for Members of Congress about how government programs or legislation are affecting a district or state. A congressional office is sometimes one of several places a constituent can turn to. Other programs, opportunities, or services may require a Member office to serve as an intermediary. Constituent service activities can be simple, like relaying contact information for a local federal office, or more complex, like providing internships or casework assistance. Limited office resources, along with House and Senate rules, may affect what level of assistance a congressional office is able to provide. This report provides an overview of common constituent services provided by Member offices, along with references to additional CRS products or other relevant resources. The activities discussed in this report are divided into the following four categories: Help with Government Opportunities for Students Assisting with Washington, DC, Visits Commemorations and Recognitions The report is intended to provide guidance for Member offices regarding constituent service, but it is not intended to be an exhaustive nor a prescriptive list of activities. Within the parameters set by the House and Senate rules, Member offices may largely shape their own constituent service operations to suit their own representational priorities and the needs of their constituents."
