    "title": "SB 340",
    "content": "Existing law requires each party to a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation to serve on the other party a preliminary declaration of disclosure of assets, as specified, and a final declaration of disclosure, as specified. Existing law requires each party to serve a preliminary declaration of disclosure either concurrently with the petition for dissolution, or within 60 days of filing the petition for dissolution of marriage. Existing law specifies, in the case of a default judgment, that a petitioner shall not be required to serve or receive a final declaration of disclosure, but a preliminary declaration of disclosure by the petitioner is still required. This bill would provide that a preliminary declaration of disclosure is not required by a petitioner if the petitioner served the summons and petition by publication or posting pursuant to court order and the respondent has defaulted. The bill would require, when a petitioner has served the summons and petition by publication or posting pursuant to court order and the respondent files a response prior to default judgment being entered, the petitioner to serve the respondent with a preliminary declaration of disclosure within 30 days of the response being filed. The bill would make other related, conforming changes."
