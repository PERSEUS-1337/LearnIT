    "content": "Sentencing Improvement Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide for the application of the sentencing guidelines for certain nonviolent drug offenses in which a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment would otherwise be required . Directs the Sentencing Commission to review the consideration of defendants' criminal histories under the guidelines and amend the guidelines and policy statements to ensure that: (1) defendants with significant criminal histories resulting from foreign convictions are sentenced commensurate with the seriousness of their prior criminal records to the extent that consideration of such foreign convictions is constitutional and practical. (2) defendants with juvenile adjudications involving significant acts of misconduct are sentenced commensurate with the seriousness of such misconduct to the extent that consideration of such misconduct is practical and relevant to the purposes of sentencing. And (3) the assignment to a defendant of a single criminal history point adequately reflects the seriousness of such a defendant's prior criminal conduct. Authorizes the Sentencing Commission to: (1) make such amendments as it deems necessary and appropriate to harmonize the sentencing guidelines and policy statements with the nonviolent drug offense provision. (2) promulgate policy statements to assist the courts in interpreting that provision. And (3) promulgate any such amendments that came to light under the criminal histories review under the procedures set forth under the Sentencing Act of 1987 as if the authority to do so under such Act had not expired. Requires the Sentencing Commission to monitor the operation of this Act and report to the Congress describing: (1) sentences imposed under the Act, (2) the findings pursuant to the criminal histories review, and (3) any recommendations for changes in the Act."
