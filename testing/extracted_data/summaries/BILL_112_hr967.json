Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to include bed bugs in the definition of vector. Requires the submission and evaluation of efficacy data if a pesticide is labeled for or proposed to be labeled for the control of a public health pest. Prohibits the sale or distribution of any product that is marketed, distributed, or sold with a claim that such product will control a public health pest if the submitted data does not support such claim. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to award grants through September 30, 2017, to three state agencies for a pilot program under which state subdivisions and housing authorities use such funds to supplement ongoing bed bug prevention and mitigation activities."
