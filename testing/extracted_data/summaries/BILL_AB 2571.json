    "title": "AB 2571",
    "content": "Existing law requires, if the owner of a total loss salvage vehicle retains possession of the vehicle, the insurance company to notify the Department of Motor Vehicles of the retention, as specified. Existing law requires the owner, within 10 days from the settlement of loss, to forward to the department the properly endorsed certificate of ownership or other evidence of ownership acceptable to the department, the license plates, and a specified fee. Upon receipt of these items, existing law requires the department to issue a salvage certificate for the vehicle. Prior to the sale or disposal of a total loss salvage vehicle, existing law requires the owner, the owner\u2019s agent, or salvage pool to obtain a properly endorsed salvage certificate and deliver the certificate to the purchaser within 10 days after payment in full for the salvage vehicle, as specified. A violation of these provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor. This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to this provision."
