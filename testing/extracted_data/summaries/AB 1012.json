    "title": "An act to add Sections 51228.1, 51228.2, and 51228.3 to the Education Code, relating to pupil instruction.",
    "content": "Existing law establishes a system of public elementary and secondary education in this state, and requires and authorizes local educational agencies to provide specified instruction at elementary and secondary schools. Existing law prescribes various requirements with respect to a course of study for grades 7 to 12, inclusive, at these schools. This bill, commencing with the 2016\u201317 school year, would prohibit school districts that maintain any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, from assigning a pupil enrolled in any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, in a school, as defined to exclude alternative schools, community day schools, continuation schools, and opportunity schools, in the school district to any course period without educational content, as defined, for more than one week in any semester, except under prescribed conditions. The bill would specifically prohibit school districts from assigning a pupil enrolled in any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, in a school in the school district to a course period without educational content because there are not sufficient curricular course offerings for the pupil to take during the relevant period of the designated schoolday. The bill would, commencing with the 2016\u201317 school year, also prohibit school districts that maintain any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, from assigning a pupil enrolled in any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, in a school, as defined to exclude alternative schools, community day schools, continuation schools, and opportunity schools, in the school district, to a course that the pupil has previously completed and received a grade determined by the school district to be sufficient to satisfy the requirements and prerequisites for admission to the California public institutions of postsecondary education and the minimum requirements for receiving a diploma of graduation from high school, except under specified conditions. The bill would specify that it is not to be interpreted to limit or otherwise affect the authority of a school district to authorize dual enrollment in community college or to provide evening high school programs, independent study programs, or work-based learning or work experience education. The bill would specify procedures to be followed if a complaint of noncompliance with the requirements of the bill is filed with a local educational agency or if an appeal of the local educational agency\u2019s decision on the complaint is made to the State Department of Education. The bill would require the Superintendent of Public Instruction to prepare an annual report detailing actions taken pursuant to these procedures. The bill would require the Superintendent to develop regulations for adoption by the State Board of Education governing these provisions. To the extent that this bill would create new duties for local educational agencies, it would constitute a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
