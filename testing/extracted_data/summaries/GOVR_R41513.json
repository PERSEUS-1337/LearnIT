    "content": "The Presidential Libraries Act (P.L. 84-373; 69 Stat. 695), as originally enacted in 1955, sought to create a system of government \"preservation and administration \u2026 of papers and other historical materials of any President or former President of the United States.\" Pursuant to the law, the General Services Administration's (GSA's) Administrator could, among other actions, accept \u2026 the papers and other historical materials of any President or former President of the United States, or of any other official or former official of the Government, and other papers relating to and contemporary with any President or former President of the United States. (P.L. 84-373) Amid concerns about growing costs of the libraries, the act was substantially amended in 1986 (P.L. 99-323; 100 Stat. 495) to \"shift the burden of on-going building operations costs of future libraries from the taxpayer to endowment funds.\" Through the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the federal government currently operates and maintains 13 presidential libraries, and is currently engaging with representatives seeking to construct a presidential library for President Barack Obama. The libraries, which primarily serve as archival repositories and museums in which the records and memorabilia of the former Presidents are held and made available to researchers and the public, are privately constructed on behalf of former Presidents. Before construction on a presidential archival facility can begin, the Archivist must approve a plan, and Congress must be provided 60 days of continuous session during which it can disapprove of the plan. If Congress chooses not to act, the land, buildings, and sometimes other amenities for the library may be deeded to or otherwise placed under the control of the federal government. Among some concerns associated with the construction and maintenance of presidential libraries is the role of the private organizations that build and, sometimes, continue to inhabit the buildings. The private organizations, commonly referred to as presidential library foundations, support the construction of the libraries and sometimes provide funding for the exhibitions displayed within the library or its museum. Each library and foundation has a unique partnership. Such a relationship, however, may also lead to difficulties in determining which exhibits are displayed, ensuring a balanced portrayal of the President's legacy, and differentiating between public and private space at the facilities. This report details the legislative history of the Presidential Libraries Act. The report then examines information on existing library facilities and their locations, organizational characteristics, and outreach efforts. It also analyzes legislative options for the act, including increasing endowment requirements for the library foundations and clearly delineating the relationship between NARA and the libraries' supporting organizations. Congress, for example, might consider consolidating the libraries into one centralized location or could attempt to create standards for the historical exhibits at the libraries. The Barack Obama Foundation, the private organization that will be managing and partially financing the official library of President Obama, is currently reviewing proposals for a library facility. This library is expected to become the 14th library facility under NARA management. Three cities\u2014Chicago, Honolulu, and New York City\u2014have submitted proposals, and a decision on where to locate the library is expected in March 2015. Congress has the authority to deny any presidential library proposal."
