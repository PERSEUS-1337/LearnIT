    "content": "The 113th Congress is actively considering reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA). The MSFCMA governs the management and conservation of commercial and recreational fisheries in U.S. federal waters (3-200 nautical miles from shore). The MSFCMA was last reauthorized and extensively amended in 2006 (P.L. 109-479). Although the authorization of appropriations under the MSFCMA expired at the end of FY2013, the act's requirements continue in effect and Congress has continued to appropriate funds to administer the act. Historically, reauthorization has also provided the opportunity to introduce significant amendments to the act. During the first decade after the act was passed in 1976, fishery policy focused on controlling and replacing foreign fishing and developing U.S. fisheries in the newly declared 200-mile Fishery Conservation Zone. After that time, new issues emerged, including recognition of the need to sustain fish populations and respond to overfishing while attempting to satisfy the economic and social needs of recreational and commercial fishermen and fishing communities. Achieving this balance is closely related to allocating federal fishery resources among different users, developing and supporting existing management institutions, and investing in management and research. This report covers issues that have been identified during congressional hearings and in legislation introduced during the last three Congresses. Although most issues are not new, they have evolved with changes to the statute, regulations, and fishery management plans. Major issues include (1) flexibility in rebuilding overfished fisheries, (2) annual catch limits, (3) uncertainty and data needs; (4) catch shares (limited access privilege programs), (5) management process and decision making, (6) bycatch, and (7) environmental quality. A variety of other issues are also covered in this report. Most of these issues are part of a system of linked elements including ecosystems (fish populations and biophysical elements of the environment), fishing (commercial and recreational fishermen, processors, and other related fishing businesses), management (managers, scientists, and the regulatory system), fishing communities (other related businesses and coastal residents), and markets (wholesale, retail, restaurants, and consumers). Often a change in one element affects other elements. For example, requirements to stop overfishing that use restrictive catch limits may rebuild fish populations, but may also result in short-run harm to fishing businesses and coastal communities. During the last three Congresses, over 30 different bills have been introduced to amend portions of the MSFCMA. These bills have covered a wide variety of topics, ranging from proposals to change management for specific fisheries or regions, to general changes to the management process such as requirements of fishery management plans. Oversight hearings concerning MSFCMA reauthorization have been held by the House Committee on Natural Resources and by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. On December 18, 2013, the chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources released a draft that included many elements of previously introduced bills. In early April 2014, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation also released a reauthorization draft."
