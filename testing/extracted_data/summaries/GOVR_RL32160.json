    "content": "With some 34 million people and 16 independent nations sharing an African ethnic heritage, the Caribbean is a diverse region that includes some of the hemisphere's richest and poorest nations. The region consists of 13 island nations, from the Bahamas in the north to Trinidad and Tobago in the south; Belize, which is geographically located in Central America; and the two nations of Guyana and Suriname, located on the north central coast of South America. With the exception of Cuba and Haiti, regular elections in the region are the norm, and for the most part have been free and fair. Nevertheless, while many Caribbean nations have long democratic traditions, they are not immune to threats to their political stability, including terrorism. Many nations in the region experienced economic decline in 2001-2002 due to downturns in the tourism and agriculture sectors. Most Caribbean economies have rebounded since 2003, although the extensive damage resulting from several storms in 2004 caused economic difficulties for several countries. U.S. interests in the Caribbean are diverse, and include economic, political, and security concerns. The Bush Administration describes the Caribbean as America's \"third border,\" with events in the region having a direct impact on the homeland security of the United States. It maintains that Caribbean nations are \"vital partners on security, trade, health, the environment, education, regional democracy, and other hemispheric issues.\" The U.S.-Caribbean relationship is characterized by extensive economic linkages, cooperation on counter-narcotics efforts and security, and a sizeable U.S. foreign assistance program. U.S. aid supports a variety of projects to strengthen democracy, promote economic growth and development, alleviate poverty, and combat the AIDS epidemic in the region. In the aftermath of several devastating storms in 2004, Congress approved $100 million in emergency supplemental funding (P.L. 108-324) to support humanitarian efforts and reconstruction in Haiti, Grenada, and Jamaica. Despite close U.S. relations with most Caribbean nations, there has been tension at times in the relationship. For example, relations with Caribbean nations became strained in the aftermath of the departure of Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide from power in February 2004. More recently, Caribbean nations that depend on tourism are concerned about the potential negative economic effects of a new U.S. requirement, as of January 8, 2007, for U.S. citizens traveling by air to the Caribbean (as well as to Canada and Mexico) to hold a passport. This report deals with broader issues in U.S. relations with the Caribbean, including foreign assistance, anti-drug trafficking and anti-money laundering cooperation, support to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the region, and security concerns such as port security and border security efforts. It does not include an extensive discussion of Haiti and Cuba. U.S. policy toward these Caribbean nations is covered in the following products: CRS Report RL32294, Haiti: Developments and U.S. Policy Since 1991 and Current Congressional Concerns, by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]; and CRS Report RL32730, Cuba: Issues for the 109th Congress, by [author name scrubbed]."
