    "content": "This bill requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to assess the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) study of the options for the disposition of Plum Island, New York. The GAO must determine whether DHS's methodologies adequately support its findings with respect to: the possible alternative uses for Plum Island, including the transfer to another federal agency, a state or local government, a nonprofit organization, or a combination of the entities for the purpose of education, research, or conservation, the issues and implications of the alternative uses. And the cost for the transition, cleanup, and hazard mitigation by a recipient of the property. If the DHS methodologies do not adequately support its findings related to an issue, the GAO must report to Congress on the issue. The bill suspends until at least 180 days after the GAO submits its reports to Congress the requirement under current law for the General Services Administration to sell the property and assets which support Plum Island operations."
