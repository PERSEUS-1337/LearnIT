Means a provider of public transportation services, whether public or private, including commuter bus services and services provided by a private provider of public transportation by vanpool that the Department of Transportation determines: (1) is able to recover, through fare revenue or payments made directly by the provider, all operating costs associated with the services. (2) meets Federal Transit Administration requirements with respect to the provision of services. And (3) does not negatively impact other publicly subsidized or privately provided public transportation services. The data submitted by the owner or operator of a leveraged system to the National Transit Database shall be used by DOT in calculating apportionments for capital payments. A public transportation service meets the requirements of this bill unless the service: (1) overlaps or directly competes with a service provided by the designated recipient concerned and has a direct effect on such service, including a projected ridership reduction of more than 3 along a corridor served by the designated recipient. Or (2) is provided by a service provider that has fewer than 10 vehicles serving the recipient's designated area."
