    "content": "Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to exclude from the definition of owner or operator, for purposes of limiting liability for releases of hazardous substances, a person who, without participating in the management of a vessel or facility, holds indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest in such vessel or facility. Defines indicia of ownership as an interest in property acquired: (1) for securing payment of a loan or indebtedness or the performance of an obligation. (2) evidencing ownership under a lease financing transaction where the lessor does not initially select or ordinarily control the daily operation or maintenance of the property. Or (3) in the course of protecting a security interest or right of reimbursement or subrogation under a guaranty. Makes liable for any release or threatened release of a hazardous substance attributable to their activities: (1) a holder of a security interest who takes certain actions concerning transfer, protection, or abandonment of property. And (2) a fiduciary or trustee who acquires ownership or control of a property. Makes conforming amendments to the Solid Waste Disposal Act."
