Concerns about the U.S. highway system's seismic vulnerability stem from interest in protecting public safety, facilitating response and recovery efforts, and minimizing economic loss and social disruption. This report addresses a number of frequently asked questions about earthquake risk and highway system components, especially bridges. The three components of seismic risk to the highway system are the likelihood of an earthquake of varying magnitudes, the vulnerability of highway structures to damage, and the potential consequences of that vulnerability. Seismic hazards are greatest in the West Coast states, California, Washington, and Oregon, as well as Alaska and Hawaii. Although disputed by some geologists, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) identifies high hazard in portions of several southern and midwestern states associated with the seismic zone near New Madrid, MO. There is also growing concern about earthquakes induced by activities associated with oil and natural gas production. Existing highway structures vulnerable to earthquake hazards can be replaced, retrofitted, abandoned, or simply left alone. The decision of how to manage each structure's seismic risk generally is up to state governments and other infrastructure owners. There is no national database of seismic design and retrofit status of highways. Many states at greatest risk have assessed their highway infrastructure's seismic risk and directed funding to mitigate these risks. Bridges are a major determinant of the seismic performance of a highway system. National seismic bridge design standards have been in place since 1992. Many of the most vulnerable older bridges, particularly in West Coast states, have been retrofitted to improve seismic resilience. In contrast, many older bridges in the New Madrid seismic zone have not been retrofitted. Because no national database exists on the status of retrofitting existing highway bridges or other infrastructure, no national estimates are available for what it might cost to retrofit the most vulnerable structures. Seismic retrofitting of highway infrastructure is an eligible expense for federal highway funds distributed by formula to states. However, when states choose to invest their federal funds in seismic risk reduction, less is available for other purposes. State and local governments and other highway and bridge owners also may use their own funds for seismic retrofitting. In addition to its role in administering federal-aid highway funds that may be used for seismic retrofitting, the Department of Transportation (DOT) supports seismic hazard research and training and coordinates with other federal agencies working on enhancing resilience. Other federal agencies that contribute to improving the highway system's seismic resiliency include the USGS, the National Science Foundation (NFS), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)."
