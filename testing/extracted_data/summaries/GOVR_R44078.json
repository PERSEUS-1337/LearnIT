    "content": "Funds for the judicial branch are included annually in the Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) Appropriations bill. The bill provides funding for the Supreme Court; the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit; the U.S. Court of International Trade; the U.S. Courts of Appeals and District Courts; Defender Services; Court Security; Fees of Jurors and Commissioners; the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts; the Federal Judicial Center; the U.S. Sentencing Commission; and Judicial Retirement Funds. The judiciary's FY2016 budget request of $7.533 billion was submitted on February 2, 2015. By law, the President includes the requests submitted by the judiciary in the annual budget submission without change. The FY2016 budget request represents a 3.7% increase over the FY2015 enacted level of $7.261 billion provided in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235, Division E, Title III, enacted December 16, 2014). The House and Senate Appropriations Committees' Financial Services and General Government Subcommittees held hearings in February and March to consider the FY2016 judiciary request. Markups were held in the House (H.R. 2995) in June and in the Senate (S. 1910) in July. No further action was taken on either bill, and judicial branch activities were funded through continuing appropriations resolutions (P.L. 114-53, P.L. 114-96, and P.L. 114-100) until the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113, enacted December 18, 2015). Division E of this act provides $7.3 billion for the judiciary, an increase of $73.9 million (1.0%) from FY2015 and $184.1 million (-2.5%) less than the request. Appropriations for the judiciary comprise approximately 0.2% of total budget authority."
