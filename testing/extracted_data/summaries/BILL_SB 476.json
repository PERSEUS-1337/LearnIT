    "title": "SB 476",
    "content": "Existing law requires the State Public Health Officer to establish rules and regulations establishing minimum standards for organized camps, and regulations governing the operation of organized camps that he or she determines are necessary to protect the health and safety of the campers. Existing law establishes minimum standards for the operation, regulation, and enforcement of organized camps, as defined. This bill would recast those provisions and instead define an \u201corganized camp\u201d to include an \u201corganized resident camp\u201d and an \u201corganized day camp,\u201d as specified, that provides activities that promote environmental awareness and education. This bill would exclude from \u201corganized camps\u201d physical education-based organizations, gymnastics studios, sports training organizations, and theatre programs, among others. The bill would require the included camps to issue a written notice of intent to operate and to operate, develop a written operating plan plan, and submit the plan, or written verification that the camp is accredited by the American Camp Association, to the local public health officer at least 45 days prior to commencing operation of the camp. The bill would also require those camps to comply with applicable safety and supervision requirements relating to camp directors and counselors, install a carbon monoxide detector in specified buildings, and store firearms in a locked storage cabinet when not in use, as specified. The bill would also require those camps to obtain a permit to operate, or, for an organized day camp that does not have a fixed location, to register with the local public health officer and receive authorization to operate, from the local public health officer, and to post the permit or authorization, as specified. The bill would authorize the local public health officer to inspect the camp and charge fees for camp oversight activities. The bill would also authorize a person alleging health and sanitation violations to file a complaint with the local public health officer, and to require the local public health officer to investigate. The bill would also require the State Department of Public Health, in adopting or amending the rules and regulations pertaining to organized camps, to make reasonable efforts to obtain the input and advice of prescribed organizations. Because this bill would impose additional duties upon local public health officers in cities and counties, it would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."
