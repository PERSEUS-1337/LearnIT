    "content": "The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) is the primary federal legislation that supports basic education for out-of-school adults. Commonly called \"adult education,\" the programs and activities funded by AEFLA typically support educational services at the secondary level and below, as well as English language training. Actual educational services are typically provided by local entities. AEFLA was created by Title II of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA; P.L. 105-220). The authorization of appropriations under WIA lapsed after FY2003, though the program continued to be funded through the appropriations process. In 2014, AEFLA was reauthorized by Title II of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 (WIOA, P.L. 113-128). This report will discuss AEFLA as amended by WIOA. WIOA made a number of changes to the authorizing law but maintained the program's primary function of authorizing federal grants to state agencies for adult education activities. State agencies may use a portion of federal funds for statewide activities, but the bulk of their grants must be subgranted to local providers. Eligible local providers include local educational agencies, institutions of higher education, community-based organizations, and other qualified entities. Under WIOA, federal AEFLA grants are allotted to states via two formula grants: 88% of state grant funds are allotted to the states based on a formula that considers each state's relative share of adults who do not have a high school diploma or equivalent and who are not enrolled in school. These funds may support basic education services, coursework toward a secondary school diploma or equivalent, English language training or other adult education services. 12% of funds are allotted to the states based on a formula that considers each state's relative share of immigrants who were admitted for legal permanent residence in past years. These funds support \"integrated English literacy and civics education\" for English language learners. WIOA requires that state agency grantees submit and have an approved unified state plan that aligns adult education with other core WIOA programs to meet local labor force needs. State grantees must also report on program performance using a set of metrics that applies across core WIOA programs, including adult education. While the large majority of annual appropriations support grants to state agencies, statute reserves 2% of annual AEFLA appropriations for National Leadership Activities. These national activities include technical support for state agencies and assistance in meeting the performance accountability requirements of WIOA. Congress appropriated $578 million for AEFLA-authorized activities in FY2014. WIOA authorizes the same appropriation level for FY2015. Between FY2015 and FY2020, WIOA authorizes annual increases in AEFLA appropriations, with an authorization level of $679 million in FY2020."
