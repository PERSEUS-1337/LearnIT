    "content": "End Unnecessary Mailers Act of 2011 - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to give community water systems for which there were no violations of the maximum contaminant level for any regulated contaminant during the year the option to: (1) mail the annual consumer confidence report on the level of contaminants in the drinking water purveyed by that system to each customer. Or (2) make such report available on the system's website and, upon request, by mail. Requires a system that elects the latter to provide customers notice, in the manner elected by the customers to pay their bill, of such report's availability and that the system has remained in compliance with maximum contaminant levels."
