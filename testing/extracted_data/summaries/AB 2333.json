    "title": "An act to amend Section\n4030\n490.5\nof the Penal Code, relating to\njails.\ntheft.",
    "content": "Existing law makes petty theft involving merchandise taken from a merchant\u2019s premises punishable by a fine of not less than $50 and not more than $1,000, and imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding 6 months. This bill would provide that nothing in that section or any other law precludes a merchant from offering a person suspected of theft an opportunity to complete a precomplaint diversion program in lieu of arrest and criminal prosecution, or informing a person suspected of theft of the criminal civil remedies available to the merchant. Existing law generally prohibits strip searches and body cavity searches of prearraignment detainees arrested for infraction or misdemeanor offenses. Existing law allows a person who has been arrested and taken into custody to be subjected to patdown searches, metal detector searches, and thorough clothing searches in order to discover and retrieve concealed weapons and contraband substances prior to being placed in a booking cell. This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to those provisions."
