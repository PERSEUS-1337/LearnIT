    "content": "Communications Competitiveness and Infrastructure Modernization Act of 1993 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to allow a common carrier to provide video programming directly to subscribers in its telephone service area through its own facilities or an affiliate. Authorizes the common carrier to provide channels of communications, pole line conduit space, or other rental arrangements to any entity which is directly or indirectly owned, operated, or controlled by it if such facilities or arrangements are to be used for, or in connection with, the provision of video programming directly to subscribers in the telephone service area of the common carrier. Prohibits a common carrier from providing video programming directly to subscribers in its telephone service area unless the programming is provided through a separate video programming affiliate. Requires business arrangements and transactions between a common carrier and its video programming affiliate to be pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission and to be without cost to the telephone service ratepayers of the carrier. Requires any common carrier which provides video programming directly to subscribers through an affiliate in its telephone service area to establish a basic video dial tone platform. Requires such common carrier to make a maximum of 75 percent of the equipped capacity of its basic video dial tone platform available to unaffiliated video program providers. States that the carriage of local broadcast signals shall not constitute the provisions of affiliated video programming under this Act. Sets forth prohibitions on: (1) cross-subsidization between telephone service and video programming by common carriers. And (2) common carrier buyouts of cable systems located in the carrier's telephone service area. Requires the Commission to convene a Federal-State Joint Board to establish practices, classifications, and regulations necessary to ensure proper jurisdictional separation and allocation of the costs of providing broadband services, including affiliated video programming. Makes provisions of this Act inapplicable to video programming provided in a rural area by a common carrier that provides telephone exchange service in such area."
