    "content": "The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA), commonly known as the \"ByrdAmendment,\" is a U.S. law providing for the distribution of import duties collected as a result ofantidumping (AD) or countervailing duty (CVD) orders to petitioners and other interested partiesin the investigations that resulted in the orders. CDSOA disbursements amounted to $231 millionin FY2001, $330 million in FY2002, $190 million in FY2003 (with an additional $50 million heldin reserve pending the outcome of a legal challenge), and $284 million in FY2004. The CDSOA wassuccessfully challenged in a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute proceeding brought by 11WTO Members including Canada, the European Union, and Japan. In late 2004, eight of thecomplaining parties were authorized to \"suspend concessions\" (retaliate) until the United Statescomplies, most readily by repealing the law. Canada and the European Union began retaliating onMay 2, 2005, by placing a 15% additional import duty on selected U.S. exports. Mexico imposedhigher tariffs on U.S. milk products, wine, and chewing gum as of August 18, and Japan placed anadditional tariff of 15% on 15 steel and industrial products as of September 1. Canada is particularlyconcerned that more than $4 billion in AD and CV duty deposits on softwood lumber may eventuallybe available for distribution to U.S. lumber producers under the CDSOA. Despite strong congressional support for the CDSOA in both chambers, a provision seekingto repeal the measure (while allowing distributions under the Act to continue on all subjectmerchandise entering the United States through October 1, 2007) was included the conference reportaccompanying S. 1932 , the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The legislation has passedboth Houses, with final House action having taken place on February 1, 2006. Another bill seeking to repeal the statute H.R. 1121 (Ramstad), was suggestedfor possible inclusion in House miscellaneous duty suspension legislation. In addition, two proposalsrelated to the CDSOA were offered by Senator Grassley as amendments to Commerce and JusticeDepartment appropriations legislation. S.Amdt. 1680 would have limitedimplementation of the CDSOA, while S.Amdt 1681 would have struck a provision inthe Senate-reported bill requiring WTO negotiations aimed at preserving the CDSOA. Theseamendments were not considered on the floor. Controversy over the CDSOA is part of a larger ongoing debate in Congress, and in thecountry as a whole, on the future direction of U.S. trade policy. As a result, trade remedy issues areexpected to receive continued attention in second session of the 109th Congress. This report willbe updated as events warrant."
