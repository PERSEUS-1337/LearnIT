    "content": "Building robust online content recommendation systems requires learning com- plex interactions between user preferences and content features. The field has evolved rapidly in recent years from traditional multi-arm bandit and collabora- tive filtering techniques, with new methods integrating Deep Learning models that enable to capture non-linear feature interactions. Despite progress, the dynamic nature of online recommendations still poses great challenges, such as finding the delicate balance between exploration and exploitation. In this paper we provide a novel method, Deep Density Networks (DDN) which deconvolves measurement and data uncertainty and predicts probability densities of CTR, enabling us to perform more efficient exploration of the feature space. We show the usefulness of using DDN online in a real world content recommendation system that serves billions of recommendations per day, and present online and offline results to eval- uate the benefit of using DDN. In order to navigate the vast amounts of content on the internet, users either rely on active search queries, or on passive content recommendations. As the amount of the content on the internet grows, content discovery becomes an increasingly crucial challenge, shaping the way content is consumed by users. Taboola's content discovery platform aims to perform \"reverse search\", using computational models to match content to users who are likely to engage with it. Taboola's content recommendations are shown in widgets that are usually placed at the bottom of articles (see FIG0 ) in various websites across the internet, and serve billions of recommendation per day, with a user base of hundreds of millions of active users.Traditionally recommender systems have been modeled in a multi-arm bandit setting, in which the goal is to a find a strategy that balances exploitation and exploration in order to maximize the long term reward. Exploitation regimes try to maximize the immediate reward given the available information, while exploration seeks to extract new information from the feature space, subsequently increasing the performance of the exploitation module.One of the simplest approaches to deal with multi-arm bandit problems is the -greedy algorithm, in which with probability a random recommendation is chosen, and with probability 1 \u2212 the recommendation with the highest predicted reward is chosen. Upper Confidence Bound -UCB- BID0 ) and Thompson sampling techniques (Thompson (1933) ) use prediction uncertainty estimations in order to perform more efficient exploration of the feature space, either by explicitly adding the uncertainty to the estimation (UCB) or by sampling from the posterior distribution (Thompson sampling). Estimating prediction uncertainty is crucial in order to utilize these methods. Online recommendations are noisy and probabilistic by nature, with measured values being only a proxy to the true underlying distribution, leading to additional interesting challenges when predicting uncertainty estimations.In this paper we present DDN, a unified deep neural network model which incorporates both measurement and data uncertainty, having the ability to be trained end-to-end while facilitating the exploitation/exploration selection strategy. We introduce a mathematical formulation to deconvolve measurement noise, and to provide data uncertainty predictions that can be utilized to improve exploration methods. Finally, we demonstrate the benefit of using DDN in a real world content recommendation system. We have introduced Deep Density Network (DDN), a unified DNN model that is able to predict probability distributions and to deconvolve measurement and data uncertainties. DDN is able to model non-linearities and capture complex target-context relations, incorporating higher level representations of data sources such as contextual and textual input. We have shown the added value of using DNN in a multi-arm bandit setting, yielding an adaptive selection strategy that balances exploitation and exploration and maximizes the long term reward. We presented results validating DDN's improved noise handling capabilities, leading to 5.3% improvement on a noisy dataset.Furthermore, we observed that DDN outperformed both REG and MDN models in online experiments, leading to RPM improvements of 2.9% and 1.7% respectively. Finally, by employing DDN's data uncertainty estimation and UCB strategy, we improved our exploration strategy, depicting 6.5% increase of targets throughput with only 0.05% RPM decrease."
