    "content": "\"Section 32\" is a permanent appropriation that since 1935 has set aside the equivalent of 30% of annual customs receipts to support the farm sector through the purchase of surplus commodities and a variety of other activities. The appropriation has totaled nearly $10 billion annually in recent years. Today, most of the appropriation (about $8.4 billion) is transferred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) child nutrition account, with a separate amount (about $144 million) transferred to the Department of Commerce for fisheries activities. The Secretary of Agriculture, acting through USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has had broad discretion in how to spend the remaining non-transferred (unobligated and carryover) money. The program's name stems from its authorization: Section 32 of the act of August 24, 1935 (P.L.74-320, as amended; 7 U.S.C. 612c). Funds are to be used to (1) encourage the export of farm products through producer payments or other means; (2) encourage the domestic consumption of farm products by diverting surpluses from normal channels or increasing their use by low-income groups; and (3) re-establish farmers' purchasing power. In recent years, USDA has pursued primarily the second and third objectives. The Secretary historically has chosen to use much of the non-transferred money to purchase agricultural commodities like meats, poultry, fruits, vegetables, and fish, which are not typically covered by other mandatory farm support programs. The premise for commodity purchases is that removing products from normal marketing channels helps to limit supply and thereby increase prices and farm income. Purchased commodities are diverted to the National School Lunch Program and other domestic food assistance programs. In FY2015, $465 million was designated for planned AMS commodity purchases to fulfill the commodity assistance entitlement set by the National School Lunch Act. Another $306 million was used for \"emergency removals\" of surplus commodities throughout the fiscal year (primarily fruits, vegetables, and meat products). The surplus commodities are distributed as \"bonuses\" to domestic food assistance programs. Over time, Congress has reduced USDA's discretion to use Section 32 authority via authorizing legislation and through appropriations. Most significantly, the 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246) permanently capped the amount USDA is permitted to spend after transfers for use in the child nutrition programs and to the Department of Commerce for fisheries activities. It also required minimum levels of fruit, vegetable, and nut purchases to support domestic nutrition programs and required USDA to use Section 32 to fund the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, which provides snacks to participating elementary schools. Section 32 is also used less for direct farm disaster assistance than in the past. This policy shift has occurred by the authorization and funding of \"permanent\" disaster programs in the 2008 and 2014 farm bills, enhancements to the federal crop insurance program, and limitations by appropriators on using Section 32 for disaster payments."
