    "content": "The manner in which staff are deployed within an organization may reflect the missions and priorities of that organization. This report provides staffing levels in Senators' Senate committee, leadership, and other offices since 1977. From 1977 to 1986, Senate staff, excluding state-based staff, increased from 3,397 to 4,180, or 23.05%. From 1987 to 2016, all Senate staff grew from 4,916 to 5,749, or 16.94%. The changes in both time periods were characterized in part by increases in the number of staff working in chamber leadership offices, and, prior to 2016, increases in the staffing of chamber officers and officials. Additionally, staff working for Members have shifted from committees to the personal offices of Members. Since 2010, however, staff working for the Senate has decreased 6.79%. Some of these changes may be indicative of the growth of the Senate as an institution, or the value the chamber places on its various activities. This report is one of several CRS products focusing on congressional staff. Others include CRS Report RL34545, Congressional Staff: Duties and Functions of Selected Positions, by R. Eric Petersen; CRS Report R43947, House of Representatives Staff Levels in Member, Committee, Leadership, and Other Offices, 1977-2016, by R.
