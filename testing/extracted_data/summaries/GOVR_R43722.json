    "content": "Federal inspectors general (IGs) have been granted substantial independence and powers to combat waste, fraud, and abuse within designated federal departments and agencies. To execute their missions, offices of inspector general (OIGs) conduct and publish audits and investigations\u2014among other duties. Established by public law as permanent, nonpartisan, and independent offices, OIGs exist in more than 70 federal agencies, including all departments and larger agencies, along with numerous boards and commissions and other entities. Many OIGs have been vested with law enforcement authority to assist their investigations. This report provides background on federal offices of inspectors general and their law enforcement authorities in investigations. In this report, law enforcement authority is generally defined as having the legal authority to carry a firearm while engaged in official duties; make an arrest without a warrant while engaged in official duties; and seek and execute warrants for arrest, search of premises, or seizure of evidence. This report identifies the laws and regulations that vest certain OIGs with law enforcement authority, which permits the use of guns and ammunition. This report also describes some of the requirements and expectations of OIGs that have law enforcement authority, and includes some reasons that OIGs have expressed a need for law enforcement authority."
