    "content": "Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in promulgating any proposed or final major regulation relating to human health or the environment, to publish in the Federal Register, along with the regulation, a statement that: (1) describes and quantifies the risks to human health and the environment to be addressed by the regulation. (2) compares such risks to other risks chosen by the Administrator. (3) estimates the costs to the US Government, State and local governments, and the private sector of implementing and complying with the regulation and the benefits of the regulation. And (4) contains a certification that analyses performed are based on the best obtainable scientific information, the regulation is likely to reduce the risks to be addressed, there is no regulatory alternative that would achieve an equivalent reduction in risk in a more cost-effective manner, and the regulation is likely to produce benefits to human health or the environment that will justify the costs of compliance. Defines a major regulation as one that may have an effect on the economy of $100 million or more in any one year. Authorizes the Administrator, if a final regulation is substantially similar to the proposed version, to publish a reference to the statement of the proposed regulation in lieu of publishing a new statement for the final regulation."
