    "content": "Recent events have focused attention on the threat that terrorists with shoulder firedsurface-to-air missiles (SAMs), referred to as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), pose to commercial airliners. Most believe that no single solution exists to effectively mitigate thisthreat. Instead, a menu of options may be considered, including installing infrared (IR)countermeasures on aircraft; modifying flight operations and air traffic control procedures;improving airport and regional security; and strengthening missile non-proliferation efforts. Equipping aircraft with missile countermeasure systems can protect the aircraft even when operatingin areas where ground-based security measures are unavailable or infeasible to implement. However,this option has a relatively high cost, between $1 million and $3 million per aircraft, and the timeneeded for implementation does not allow for immediate response to the existing terrorist threat.Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training, altering air traffic procedures tominimize exposure to the threat, and improved security near airports may be less costly thancountermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks. However, thesetechniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would notprotect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports. Legislation introduced in the 108th Congress called for the installation of missile defensesystems in all turbojet aircraft used in scheduled air carrier service. Homeland Securityappropriations designated $60 million in FY2004, $61 million in FY2005, and $110 million inFY2006 to fund a program to develop and test prototype missile countermeasure systems forcommercial aircraft based on existing military technology. It is anticipated that at the conclusion ofthis program, the Department of Homeland Security will be able to provide a detailed analysis of thesuitability of such systems for use to protect commercial passenger aircraft. This report will be updated as needed."
