    "content": "The federal government provides grants-in-aid to states and local governments to provide a range of benefits and human services programs to disadvantaged families and persons. Most such human services are administered, and often designed, at the state and local level. Some human services are provided by community or nonprofit organizations. The current recession is straining the budgets of state and local governments, putting pressure on many jurisdictions to cut spending or raise taxes, at the same time that these governments potentially face an increase in demand for benefits and services that address economic need. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5, H.R. 1) provides additional funding to states and localities for human services programs. The ARRA increases funding for certain grants to help finance increased transfer payments to households. It creates a temporary (FY2009 and F2010) emergency fund under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant to help states pay for increased costs of economic aid to families. It increases funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant by $2 billion, with most of those funds slated for increasing the number and/or amount of vouchers to subsidize the costs of child care for low-income working families. The ARRA also provides states with some fiscal relief by temporarily increasing the share of federal funding provided to states for costs in certain entitlement programs. It provides a temporary increase to the federal matching rate for foster care maintenance, adoption assistance, and kinship guardian assistance under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. It also allows states to receive matching funds on Child Support Enforcement (CSE) incentive payments that are reinvested in the CSE program. Some human services programs are operated by localities, community organizations, and non-profits. Head Start, a federal program operated at the local level, will receive an additional $2.1 billion, with at least $1.1 billion directed Early Head Start.\" The ARRA provides an additional $1 billion for the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG). The ARRA also provides $50 million in direct grants to nonprofit organizations for capacity building efforts to expand social services in communities affected by the economic downturn. Proposed funding increases for Low Income Home Energy Assistance ($1 billion in the House version of ARRA) and the Social Services Block Grant ($400 million in the Senate version of ARRA) were not a part of the final bill. This report will not be updated."
