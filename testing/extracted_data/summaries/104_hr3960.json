    "content": "Antiterrorism Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 1996 - Modifies wiretapping provisions under the Federal criminal code to make certain requirements to obtain an order authorizing the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication inapplicable where: (1) the applicant shows that the subject had the intent to thwart interception or that the subject's actions and conduct would have the effect of thwarting interception from a specified facility. And (2) the judge finds that such showing has been adequately made. Grants authority for the use of: (1) emergency wiretaps in cases involving an act of terrorism. And (2) pen registers and trap and trace devices in foreign counterintelligence investigations. Adds specified terrorist offenses as predicates under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Authorizes interceptions with respect to specified terrorism-related offenses, such as violations relating to the murder of foreign officials or providing material support to terrorists. Modifies wiretap provisions to provide that, whenever an order authorizing an interception is entered, the order shall require the attorney for the Government to file a report with the judge who issued the order showing what progress has been made toward achieving the authorized objective and the need for continued interception. Requires such report to be made 15 days after the interception has begun. Revises the Antiterrorism Act of 1996 to make an exception to the sovereign immunity of a foreign state if certain conditions are met or if neither the claimant nor the victims were US nationals when the act upon which the claim is based occurred. Makes technical corrections to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996."
