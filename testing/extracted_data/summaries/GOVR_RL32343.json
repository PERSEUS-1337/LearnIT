    "content": "Since late 2002, gasoline prices have been extremely volatile, with the national averagespiking above $1.70 three times. Most recently, the nationwide pump price for regular fuel set a newrecord as momentum carried it over $2.00 per gallon. Prices in some states -- reaching a high of$2.45 per gallon in California -- are much above the national average. In addition to the marketforces affecting pump prices in the United States, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries(OPEC) announced a production cut effective in January 2005. At a minimum, this is likely tosupport crude prices; crude prices have significant impact on prices at the pump. Apart from higher crude oil prices, gasoline prices are strongly influenced by the supply anddemand situation at the pump. Since 1999, the only growth in U.S. oil consumption has beenincreased gasoline demand, which has risen by 600,000 barrels per day to a current annual averageof 9.0 million barrels per day. While this might seem to be a relatively small amount, it has directlyincreased demand for imports of foreign gasoline, since U.S. refineries have not added capacity asgasoline demand has grown. Demand for imported gasoline now exceeds one million barrels per day. In addition to the high demand for imported gasoline, the quality of gasoline sought fromforeign refiners has become a factor. As the specifications for environmentally acceptable fuel havebecome more stringent, the complexity of manufacturing \"U.S. spec\" gasoline has increased. Not allrefiners can economically make fuel that meets domestic requirements. U.S. gasoline marketersseeking imports must shop world markets for a scarce commodity; accordingly, prices are high.These high-priced incremental supplies play an important role in determining prices at the pump,because all gasoline tends to be priced by the market at the cost of the last units supplied. Other factors contributing to the pump price situation include the state of gasoline and crudeoil inventories at U.S. refineries. Both are recovering from low levels. Gasoline inventories availablefor consumption amount to less than two days of supply. Crude oil stocks -- from which gasolineconsumed is replaced -- are still at low levels, although rebounding somewhat from last winter'srecord lows. Petroleum inventories are low because global oil supplies are tight, in part due to strongdemand, especially in Asia. OPEC production policy is a consideration as well. As gasoline prices rise, so does interest in finding some sort of public policy remedy thatwould return lower and more stable prices. Among the options generally discussed are a release ofcrude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the relaxation of Environmental Protection Agencyrules regarding gasoline composition. Both are controversial, with the wisdom and effectiveness ofeach challenged by some. This report will be updated to reflect significant changes in the factors impacting gasolinemarkets and prices."
