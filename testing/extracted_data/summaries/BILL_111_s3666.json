    "content": "Passport Identity Verification Act - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to consider as criminal law enforcement activities the powers, duties, and functions conferred upon Department of State personnel relating to the granting, refusal, revocation, or adjudication of passports when such personnel seek to: (1) verify the identity of a passport applicant, (2) detect passport fraud. Or (3) verify such identity or fraud by accessing any governmental or private databases containing criminal history, driver's license information, naturalization and immigration records, marriage, birth, or death information, or other appropriate information. Directs: (1) the Attorney General and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to implement a system to enable Department of State personnel responsible for such passport activities to have real-time access to the criminal history information contained in the National Crime Information Center's Interstate Identification Index (NCIC-III) in order to verify passport applicant identity or to detect passport fraud. And (2) the Secretary of State to designate such Department personnel. Directs the Secretary to conduct an analysis and report to Congress to determine: (1) if US passport applicants or renewals should provide biometric identification information. And (2) if technology should be employed to verify identity documents."
