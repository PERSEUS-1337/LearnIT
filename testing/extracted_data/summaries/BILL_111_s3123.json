    "content": "Growing Farm to School Programs Act of 2010 - Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to replace the farm-to-cafeteria program with a program providing schools, state and local agencies, Indian tribes, agricultural producers, and nonprofits with competitive matching grants and technical assistance to improve access to local foods by schools participating in the school lunch or breakfast programs. Gives priority to projects that: (1) benefit local small- and medium-sized farms. (2) serve a high proportion of children who are eligible for free or reduced price lunches. And (3) incorporate experiential nutrition education by involving school children in farm and garden-based agricultural education activities."
