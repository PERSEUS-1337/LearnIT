    "content": "Let Wall Street Pay for the Restoration of Main Street Act of 2009 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose an excise tax on certain securities transactions, including transactions in stocks, futures, swaps, credit default swaps, and options. Exempts transactions for securities held in tax-exempt retirement accounts, health savings accounts, educational accounts, and regulated investment companies. Allows the purchaser of securities a credit against the excise tax for the lesser of the tax incurred or $250 . Requires withholding of excise tax amounts by the transferor of securities subject to the tax. Requires one-half of the tax revenues raised by this Act to be held in a separate Job Creation Reserve account to offset additional costs from the Surface Transportation Authorization Act of 2009 and subsequent legislation to fund job creation. Expresses the sense of Congress that one-half of the tax revenues raised by this Act shall be used to reduce the federal deficit."
