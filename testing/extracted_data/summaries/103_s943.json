    "content": "Children's Television Violence Protection Act of 1993 - Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to prescribe standards requiring television broadcast licensees and cable operators, including cable programmers, to require a video and audio warning with regard to programming that may contain violence or unsafe gun practices, that may adversely affect the mental or physical health of a child, and that may, if the events portrayed in such programming occur in real life, warrant the imposition of criminal penalties. Exempts any programming broadcast between 11:00 P. M. and 6:00 A. M. Authorizes the FCC to exempt, as public interest requires, certain video programming, including news broadcasts, sporting events, educational programming, and documentaries. Directs the FCC to consider, in its review of an application for renewal of a television broadcast license, whether the licensee has complied with this Act."
