    "content": "This report provides an overview of actions taken by Congress to provide FY2014 appropriations for accounts funded by the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (L-HHS-ED) appropriations bill. The L-HHS-ED bill provides funding for all accounts subject to the annual appropriations process at the Departments of Labor (DOL) and Education (ED). It provides annual appropriations for most agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with certain exceptions (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration is funded via the Agriculture bill). The L-HHS-ED bill also provides funding for more than a dozen related agencies, including the Social Security Administration (SSA). Enacted Appropriations: On January 17, 2014, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76), which provided appropriations for FY2014 (see Division H for L-HHS-ED). This law provided $164 billion in discretionary funding for L-HHS-ED, which is about 4% more than the FY2013 post-sequester funding level ($157 billion) and about 3% less than the FY2014 President's Budget request ($171 billion). In addition, the FY2014 omnibus provided an estimated $612 billion in mandatory L-HHS-ED funding, for a total of $776 billion for L-HHS-ED as a whole. The FY2014 omnibus followed two government-wide continuing resolutions (CRs), which had provided temporary funding earlier in the fiscal year (P.L. 113-46 and P.L. 113-73). However, no government-wide CR was in place at the beginning of the fiscal year (October 1), resulting in a funding gap and government shutdown for affected projects and activities until the first government-wide CR for FY2014 was enacted on October 17, 2013 (P.L. 113-46). Earlier L-HHS-ED Congressional Action: Prior to the start of the fiscal year, the Senate Appropriations Committee initiated action on a full-year FY2014 L-HHS-ED bill. On July 11, 2013, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported this bill (S. 1284, S.Rept. 113-71). As reported, S. 1284 would have provided $171 billion in discretionary L-HHS-ED funding. This amount is about 9% more than the FY2013 post-sequester funding level and about 1% more than the FY2014 President's request. In addition, the Senate committee bill would have provided an estimated $613 billion in mandatory funding, for a combined total of nearly $783 billion for L-HHS-ED as a whole. The House did not take action on a stand-alone L-HHS-ED bill for FY2014. President's Request: On April 10, 2013, the Obama Administration released its FY2014 Budget. The President requested $170 billion in discretionary funding for accounts funded by the L-HHS-ED bill (+8% from FY2013 post-sequester levels). In addition, the President's Budget requested roughly $612 billion in annually appropriated mandatory funding, for a total of roughly $782 billion (+4% from FY2013 post-sequester levels) for the L-HHS-ED bill as a whole. DOL Snapshot: The FY2014 omnibus provided roughly $12.04 billion in discretionary funding for DOL. This is about 2% more than the FY2013 post-sequester funding level of $11.85 billion and 4% less than the FY2014 request of $12.50 billion. HHS Snapshot: The FY2014 omnibus provided roughly $70.44 billion in discretionary funding for HHS. This is about 6% more than the FY2013 post-sequester funding level of $66.41 billion and 3% less than the FY2014 request of $72.50 billion. ED Snapshot: The FY2014 omnibus provided roughly $67.30 billion in discretionary funding for ED. This is about 2% more than the FY2013 post-sequester funding level of $65.70 billion and 5% less than the FY2014 request of $71.21 billion. Related Agencies Snapshot: The FY2014 omnibus provided roughly $14.06 billion in discretionary funding for L-HHS-ED related agencies. This is 5% more than the FY2013 post-sequester funding level of $13.34 billion and 4% more than the FY2014 request of $13.47 billion."
