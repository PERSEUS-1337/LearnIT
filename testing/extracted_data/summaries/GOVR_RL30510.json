    "content": "The military construction (MilCon) appropriations bill finances (1) military construction projects in the United States and overseas; (2) military family housing operations and construction;(3) U.S. contributions to the NATO Security Investment Program; and (4) most base realignment andclosure costs. This report reviews the appropriations and authorization process for military construction. The congressional debate perennially centers on the adequacy of the President's budget for militaryconstruction needs and the necessity for congressional add-ons, especially for Guard and Reserveprojects. In recent years, Congress has frequently complained that the Pentagon has not adequatelyfunded military construction. The Administration's FY2001 budget request for military construction is $8.0 billion, which is 5.5% below the level provided in FY2000. This continues a downward trend from the peakFY1996 level of $11.2 billion, the FY1997 level of $9.8 billion, the FY1998 level of $9.3 billion,the FY1999 level of $9.0 billion and the FY2000 level of $8.4 billion. On May 16, 2000, the House passed the Military Construction Appropriations Act FY2001 ( H.R. 4425 ), by a 386-22 roll call vote. The House followed the House AppropriationsCommittee's lead and passed the $8.634 billion bill with only one amendment. On May 18, 2000, the Senate passed S. 2521 , their version of the FY2001 Military Construction Appropriations bill, on a 95-4 vote. Because emergency supplemental appropriationsfor FY2000 was added onto this bill, the conference debate has focused on domestic and defenseissues outside of military construction. For background and comprehensive information on theFY2000 supplemental funding, see CRS Report RL30457(pdf) , Supplemental Appropriations forFY2000: Plan Colombia, Kosovo, Foreign Debt Relief, Home Energy Assistance and OtherInitiatives , by [author name scrubbed], et al. The Military Construction Appropriations conference report, recommending $8.834 billion, was approved by the House on June 29, 2000, and the Senate on June 30, 2000. It became P.L. 106-246 on July 13, 2000. In authorization action, on May 18, 2000, the House approved its defense authorization bill ( H.R. 4205 , H.Rept. 106-616 ). The Senate substituted their version of the defenseauthorization bill - S. 2549 , S.Rept. 106-292 - in H.R. 4205 and passedthat bill on July 13, 2000. The conference report ( H.Rept. 106-945 ) was passed by the House onOctober 11, 2000 and by the Senate on October 12, 2000. The conference authorized $8.8 billion,$787 million more than the President's request. The FY2001 defense authorization bill became P.L.106-398 on October 30, 2000.
