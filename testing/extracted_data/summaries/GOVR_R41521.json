    "content": "This report tracks FY2011 appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (L-HHS-ED). This legislation provides discretionary funds for three major federal departments and 14 related agencies. The report summarizes L-HHS-ED discretionary funding issues but not authorization or entitlement issues. President Obama requested $172 billion in discretionary L-HHS-ED funds for FY2011, compared to $165 billion provided in the FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-117, Division D). The House L-HHS-ED Appropriations Subcommittee held a markup session in July 2010, but the full committee did not report a bill. In August 2010, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 3686 (S.Rept. 111-243), its FY2011 L-HHS-ED proposal, recommending $171 billion in discretionary funds. A continuing appropriations resolution, P.L. 111-242 as amended, provides temporary funding for the government until April 8, 2011, at the FY2010 rate of operations for most programs. However, P.L. 112-4 and P.L. 112-6 reduced funding for some L-HHS-ED programs by a total of about $2.5 billion. The House passed a full-year government funding bill, H.R. 1, on February 19, 2011, which would have reduced L-HHS-ED funding by about $25 billion and included several controversial policy riders. On March 9, the Senate rejected both H.R. 1 and a substitute amendment that would have cut L-HHS-ED funds by about $0.5 billion. Department of Labor (DOL). The Administration requested $14.0 billion in discretionary funding for DOL for FY2011, compared to $13.5 billion provided for FY2010. The request included increases for Unemployment Compensation, youth training, and adult training. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $13.9 billion. H.R. 1 and the Senate amendment would have provided $8.6 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Administration requested $74.7 billion in discretionary funding for HHS for FY2011, compared to $73.0 billion provided for FY2010. The request included increases for Health Centers, National Institutes of Health, Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control, Child Care and Development Block Grant, and Head Start. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $75.0 billion. H.R. 1 and the Senate amendment would have provided $64.7 billion and $72.9 billion, respectively. Department of Education (ED). The Administration requested $67.8 billion in discretionary funding for ED for FY2011, compared to $64.3 billion provided for FY2010. The request included two programs previously funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5), and would increase funding for several additional programs in FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $67.0 billion. H.R. 1 and the Senate amendment would have provided $59.4 billion and $70.1 billion, respectively. Related Agencies. The Administration requested $15.2 billion in discretionary funding for Related Agencies for FY2011, compared to $14.1 billion provided for FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $15.2 billion. H.R. 1 and the Senate amendment would have provided $12.3 billion and $14.4 billion, respectively. Note that at present, only the Summary and the Most Recent Developments sections of this report have been updated to reflect the 112th Congress's activities on continuing resolutions and full-year appropriations proposals. Links to other recent CRS reports are provided. The balance of this report discusses the President's request and the Senate Appropriations Committee bill."
