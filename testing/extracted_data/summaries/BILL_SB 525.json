    "title": "SB 525",
    "content": "Existing law, the Respiratory Care Practice Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of the practice of respiratory therapy by the Respiratory Care Board of California. A violation of the act is a crime. Existing law declares it is the intent of the Legislature to recognize the existence of overlapping functions between physicians and surgeons, registered nurses, physical therapists, respiratory care practitioners, and other licensed health care personnel, and to permit additional sharing of functions within organized health care systems, as specified. Existing law also states that nothing in the act shall be construed to authorize a respiratory care practitioner to practice medicine, surgery, or any other form of healing, except as authorized by the act. This bill, for intent purposes, would define \u201coverlapping functions\u201d to include providing therapy, management, rehabilitation, diagnostic evaluation, and care for nonrespiratory-related diagnoses or conditions provided certain requirements are met. Under existing law, respiratory care as a practice means a health care profession employed under the supervision of a medical director in the therapy, management, rehabilitation, diagnostic evaluation, and care of patients with deficiencies and abnormalities which affect the pulmonary system and associated aspects of cardiopulmonary and other systems functions, and includes, among other things, direct and indirect pulmonary care services that are safe, aseptic, preventive, and restorative to the patient. Existing law provides for the registration and regulation of certified polysomnographic technologists by the Medical Board of California. Under existing law governing polysomnographic technologists, the practice of polysomnography is defined to include the treatment, management, diagnostic testing, control, education, and care of patients with sleep and wake disorders. Existing law governing polysomnographic technologists exempts from those provisions, among others, respiratory care practitioners working within the scope of practice of their license. This bill would provide that associated aspects of cardiopulmonary and other systems functions includes patients with deficiencies and abnormalities affecting the heart and cardiovascular system. The bill would further define the respiratory care practice to include, among other things, the administration of medical gases and pharmacological agents for the purpose of inducing conscious or deep sedation under specified supervision and direct orders, all forms of specified life support, and the treatment, management, diagnostic testing, control, education, and care of patients with sleep and wake disorders. By changing the definition of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
