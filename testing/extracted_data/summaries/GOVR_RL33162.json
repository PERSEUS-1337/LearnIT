    "content": "Since the 1990s, the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean have been a focus ofUnited States trade policy, as demonstrated by the passage of the North American Free TradeAgreement (NAFTA), the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement, and, more recently, the CentralAmerica-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). The Bush Administration hasmade trade agreements important elements of U.S. trade policy. The United States currently is inthe process of completing trade negotiations with Andean countries for a free trade agreement (FTA)and on reactivating talks for a U.S.-Panama FTA and a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). The FTAA is an on-going regional trade initiative that was first discussed in 1994 and formallystarted in 1998. The last FTAA trade ministerial meeting was held in Miami in November 2003, butthe talks are currently stalled. The efforts of the United States in regional trade integration in the Americas are significantfor Congress because U.S. entry into any free trade agreement may only be done with the legislativeapproval of the Congress. U.S. supporters of trade integration in the Americas believe it helps U.S.economic and political interests in several ways. Proponents believe that the movement towardstrade integration of the Americas is beneficial for U.S. prosperity, and also serves to strengthendemocratic regimes and support U.S. values and security. Forming closer economic relations withcountries in the region is seen by some as a means to improve cooperation on other issues such asthe environment and anti-drug efforts. U.S. opponents of trade integration proposals are mainlyconcerned that hemispheric free trade would lead to a loss of jobs in the United States throughincreased import competition or as a result of U.S. companies shifting production to lower-wagecountries with weak labor standards. The number of regional trade agreements in the Americas has been increasing since the1990s. Major trade arrangements include NAFTA, CAFTA-DR, the Southern Common Market(Mercosur) in South America , the Andean Community (CAN), the Caribbean Community andCommon Market (CARICOM), the Central American Common Market (CACM), and the LatinAmerican Integration Association (ALADI). With a total of 12 trade agreements involving over 40countries, Mexico is one of the countries with the highest number of agreements. Supporters notethat if countries in the Western Hemisphere ultimately establish an FTAA, it could have as many as34 members and nearly 800 million people, nearly twice the population of the European Union. Trade integration in the Americas is of interest to policymakers because of the implicationsfor the United States. Issues under debate include the pros and cons of deepened trade relations withLatin America and the Caribbean, and whether the current focus on bilateral and regional FTAs isthe most appropriate trade policy. Some analysts do not believe that such a policy is a good ideabecause it is creating a complicated network of trade agreements throughout the region could slowdown the FTAA process. Others believe that regional trade agreements lead to the consolidation ofregional trade areas into larger free trade areas, and although a slow process, may eventually lead toa hemispheric free trade area."
