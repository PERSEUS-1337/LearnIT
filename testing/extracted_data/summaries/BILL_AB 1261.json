    "title": "AB 1261",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the Medi-Cal program, administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which health care services are provided to qualified, low-income persons. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions. Existing law provides, to the extent permitted by federal law, that adult day health care (ADHC) be excluded from coverage under the Medi-Cal program. This bill would establish the Community-Based Adult Services (CBAS) program as a Medi-Cal benefit and would require CBAS to be available as a covered service in contracts with managed health care plans, as specified. The bill would specify eligibility requirements for participation in the CBAS program. The bill would require that CBAS providers be licensed as ADHC centers and certified by the California Department of Aging as CBAS providers. The bill would require CBAS providers to meet specified licensing requirements and to provide care in accordance with specified regulations. The bill would require that these provisions be implemented only if federal financial participation is available."
