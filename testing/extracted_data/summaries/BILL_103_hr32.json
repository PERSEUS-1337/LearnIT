Directs the Secretary to review compliance with the locally adopted river management plans biennially and to report to appropriate congressional committees on any deviation which may diminish the values for which the river was designated. Encourages the Secretary to work with municipalities to negotiate agreement for designating additional segments of the Maurice River and its tributaries and report to the Congress thereon.
