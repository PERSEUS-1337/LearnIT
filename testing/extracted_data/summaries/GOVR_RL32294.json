    "content": "Following the first free and fair elections in Haiti's history, Jean-Bertrand Aristide first became Haitian President in February 1991. He was overthrown by a military coup in September 1991. For over three years, the military regime resisted international demands that Aristide be restored to office. In September 1994, after a U.S. military intervention had been launched, the military regime agreed to Aristide's return, the immediate, unopposed entry of U.S. troops, and the resignation of its leadership. President Aristide returned to Haiti in October 1994 under the protection of some 20,000 U.S. troops, and disbanded the Haitian army. U.S. aid helped train a civilian police force. Subsequently, critics charged Aristide with politicizing that force and engaging in corrupt practices. Elections held under Aristide and his successor, Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val (1996-2000), including the one in which Aristide was reelected in 2000, were marred by alleged irregularities, low voter turnout, and opposition boycotts. Efforts to negotiate a resolution to the electoral dispute frustrated the international community for years. Tension and violence continued throughout Aristide's second term, culminating in his departure from office in February 2004, after the opposition repeatedly refused to negotiate a political solution and armed groups took control of half the country. An interim government, backed by the Bush Administration, was established with G\u00e9rard LaTortue as Prime Minister. The U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) has tried to improve security conditions, but Haiti remains unstable. Natural disasters have contributed to instability. After several postponements, presidential elections were held on February 7, 2006, and runoff legislative elections were held on April 21. The electoral council declared Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val winner after a controversial calculation process. He was inaugurated to a five-year presidential term on May 14, 2006. President Pr\u00e9val has sought to restore stability, build democratic institutions, and establish conditions for private investment in order to create jobs. He enjoys broad support from the international donor community, the Bush Administration, and Congress. On December 9, 2006, the 109th Congress passed a special trade preferences bill for Haiti (the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement/HOPE Act of 2006, Title V, P.L. 109-432). Congressional concerns regarding Haiti include fostering democratic development, stability, and security; the cost and effectiveness of U.S. aid; protecting human rights; combating narcotics, arms, and human trafficking; addressing Haitian migration; and alleviating poverty. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 2764/P.L. 110-161) includes a number of provisions on U.S. aid to Haiti that are described in this report. During its second session, the 110th Congress may consider a variety of legislation that has provisions on Haiti: H.Res. 234, H.Res. 241, H.Res. 909, H.R. 351, H.R. 454, H.R. 522, H.R. 750, H.R. 1001, H.R. 1645, H.R. 2830, H.R. 4986, S. 222, S. 821, and S. 1348. An expansion or extension of current trade benefits provided through the HOPE Act may also be considered. This report will be not be updated."
