    "content": "Title III of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (Titles I-IX of P.L. 93-344, 2 U.S.C. 601-688) (\"the Budget Act\"), as amended, provides for the adoption of an annual concurrent resolution on the budget (\"budget resolution\") by Congress. The Budget Act includes provisions governing the consideration and amending process of the budget resolution, such as establishing points of order, setting time limits on certain motions, amendments, and the budget resolution itself, and restricting the content of amendments. This report highlights some of the Budget Act's budget resolution provisions, and how they play out on the Senate floor during consideration and amending. One notable subject that this report addresses is the \"vote-arama,\" or the period when the Senate disposes of amendments after the time for debate on the resolution has expired. In addition to Budget Act provisions, this report also includes examples of when the Senate has utilized unanimous consent agreements to further structure floor procedure."
