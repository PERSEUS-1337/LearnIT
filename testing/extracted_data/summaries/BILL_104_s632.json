    "content": "Child Custody Reform Act of 1995 - Revises provisions of the Federal judicial code to provide that the jurisdiction of a court of a State that has made a child custody determination continues as long as such State remains the residence of the child or of any contestant. Specifies that such continuing jurisdiction shall be subject to any applicable provision of law of the State that issued the initial custody determination when such State law establishes limitations on continuing jurisdiction when a child is absent from such State. Amends the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to expand the Federal Parent Locator Service to establish a national network to allow State courts to identify every proceeding relating to child custody jurisdiction filed before any court of the United States or of any State. Specifies that information identifying custody determinations from other countries will also be accepted for filing in the registry. Authorizes appropriations. Expresses the sense of the Senate that local governments should take full advantage of the Local Crime Prevention Block Grant Program to establish supervised visitation centers for children who have been removed from their parents and placed outside the home as a result of abuse or neglect or other risk of harm to them, and for children whose parents are separated or divorced and the children are at risk because of physical or mental abuse or domestic violence."
