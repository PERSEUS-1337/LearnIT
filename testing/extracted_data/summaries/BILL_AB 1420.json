    "title": "AB 1420",
    "content": "Existing law requires the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources to prescribe minimum facility maintenance standards for oil and gas production facilities, including pipelines that are not under the jurisdiction of the State Fire Marshal. Under the division\u2019s regulations, an owner or operator of an active environmentally sensitive gas pipeline that is a gathering line or an urban pipeline over 4 inches in diameter is required to perform a mechanical integrity test on the pipeline every 2 years, unless it is less than 10 years old. This bill would require the division, by January 1, 2018, to review and evaluate, and update as appropriate, its existing regulations regarding all active gas pipelines that are 4 inches or less in diameter, in sensitive areas, and 10 years old or older, as specified. The bill would define active gas pipelines as inservice gas pipelines of any diameter within the division\u2019s jurisdiction. The bill would require operators of active gas pipelines in sensitive areas, by January 1, 2018, to submit to the division maps identifying the location of those pipelines and other locational information, as provided. The bill would require the division to perform random periodic spot check inspections to ensure that the submitted maps are accurately reported. The bill would require the division to maintain a list of active gas pipelines in sensitive areas. Existing law establishes local health departments, under the purview of the local health officer. Existing law prescribes various duties for those local health departments, including supervising remediation when hazardous waste is released and enforcing statutes relating to public health. This bill would require a local health officer or his or her designee, if he or she is notified of a leak in an active gas pipeline within a sensitive area and makes certain determinations, to take certain actions related to the leak, working collaboratively with the division and the owner or operator of that pipeline. The bill would require the local public health officer or his or her designee to direct the responsible party to notify residents affected by the leak if he or she determines that the leak poses a serious threat to public health and safety. Because the bill would require a local health officer or his or her designee to provide a higher level of service to the public, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. This bill would require an owner or operator of an active gas pipeline in a sensitive area, upon discovery of a leak from the pipeline, to notify the division and the appropriate local health officer or his or her designee of the leak. Because a violation of this requirement would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."
