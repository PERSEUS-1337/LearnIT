    "content": "Prohibits the award of a Federal contract for the procurement of property or services to any individual or entity against whom three or more convictions or civil judgments have been entered after this Act's enactment for: (1) fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining or performing a Federal, State, or local government contract or subcontract. (2) violation of a Federal or State antitrust statute relating to the submission of contract offers. Or (3) embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen property in connection with obtaining such a contract or subcontract. Terminates such prohibition three years after the most recent conviction or civil judgment, subject to specified requirements. Authorizes the President to waive such prohibition: (1) in the interests of national security. Or (2) if the need for the property or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Federal Government would be seriously injured in the absence of a waiver."
