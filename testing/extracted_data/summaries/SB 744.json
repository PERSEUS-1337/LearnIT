    "title": "An act to amend Section 49414 of the Education Code, relating to pupil health.",
    "content": "Existing law requires school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools to provide emergency epinephrine auto-injectors to school nurses and trained personnel who have volunteered, as specified, and would authorize school nurses and trained personnel to use epinephrine auto-injectors to provide emergency medical aid to persons suffering, or reasonably believed to be suffering, from an anaphylactic reaction. Existing law defines terms to be used for purposes of these provisions. This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to these provisions."
