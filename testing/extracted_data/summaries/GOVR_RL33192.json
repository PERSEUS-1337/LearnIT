    "content": "Negotiated by the Reagan Administration nearly 30 years ago, the current U.S. peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement with the People's Republic of China (PRC) is set to expire on December 30, 2015. President Obama submitted a new 30-year U.S.-China nuclear cooperation agreement for congressional review on April 21, 2015. Among other provisions, the agreement would allow for uranium enrichment up to a level less than 20% U-235 and Chinese reprocessing of U.S.-obligated material at safeguarded facilities. The required congressional review period ended on July 31. Such agreements are often called \"123 agreements\" because they are required by Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (P.L. 95-242). They are a prerequisite for any significant nuclear cooperation with another country, such as exports of nuclear power plants and components and the transfer of nuclear material. Since the original agreement was concluded before China was a member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), some changes to the text were required. The recently submitted renewal agreement complies with the relevant provisions of the Atomic Energy Act and therefore was subject to a review period totaling 90 days of continuous session. If no resolution of disapproval is passed into law before that deadline, then the agreement may enter into force. No resolution of disapproval was passed. Almost 13 years passed between the time President Reagan submitted the current 123 agreement to Congress in July 1985 and its implementation in March 1998 under President Clinton. While Congress did not reject the agreement outright, it passed a Joint Resolution, P.L. 99-183, which required that certain nonproliferation-related certifications be made by the President before the agreement could be implemented. P.L. 99-183 required a presidential certification and a report followed by a period of 30 days of continuous session of Congress. After the 1989 Tiananmen Crackdown, Congress enacted sanctions in P.L. 101-246, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, suspending nuclear cooperation with China and requiring an additional presidential certification on the PRC's nuclear nonproliferation assurances. Ahead of a summit with the PRC, President Clinton, on January 12, 1998, signed certifications (as required by P.L. 99-183) on China's nuclear nonproliferation policy and practices. Clinton also issued a certification and waived a sanction imposed under P.L. 101-246. Congressional review ended on March 18, 1998, allowing the agreement to be implemented. U.S. nuclear commerce with China has expanded in the past decade. On February 28, 2005, Westinghouse submitted an initial bid to sell four nuclear power reactors to China, as supported by the Bush Administration. In Beijing in December 2006, Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman signed a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding that granted the deal to Westinghouse. The first four Westinghouse reactors under the deal are now being constructed, with six more planned and as many as 30 more proposed. At the same time, some Members of Congress continue to question whether China is fulfilling its nonproliferation commitments, particularly regarding transfers to North Korea by Chinese entities. Proliferation sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals remain in place, and the United States cooperates with China in improving export control and detection systems. In addition, China continues to develop its own nuclear arsenal. Along with the text of the agreement, the President submitted a Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement that evaluates these issues. As Congress reviewed the terms of this agreement, it also examined the PRC's record on nuclear proliferation. A key issue for the U.S. nuclear industry is its continued participation in the construction of new Chinese nuclear power plants."
