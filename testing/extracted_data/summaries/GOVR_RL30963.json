    "content": "President Bush's tax proposal and H.R. 6 (passed by the House) have different approaches to the marriage penalty. The Administration proposal, inaddition to rate changes, has a second-earner deduction for 10% of income (up to $30,000) earned by the lowerearning spouse. H.R. 6 wouldincrease the standard deduction and width of the 15% rate bracket for joint returns to twice the size of singles,eliminating the penalties for taxpayers in the 15%and 28% brackets but adding to any marriage bonuses. This report compares these alternative proposals. ( H.R. 1836 , signed by the President on June7, includes these latter proposals along with rate cuts). Taxes can go up or down as a result of marriage, depending on the income of the two spouses. These penalties and bonuses arise from the progressive taxstructure and the decision to impose taxes on a household basis. For much of the middle class, marriage penalties are low. For couples without children, the maximum marriage penalty at 2001 income levels for the 60% oftaxable returns subject to the 15% marginal rate in 1997 is $225; most couples that itemize have no penalty at all. The second-earner deduction in theadministration proposal virtually eliminates the marriage penalty for these couples. Even in the 28% rate, whichcovers another 26% of taxable returns, the secondearner deduction along with the flatter rates results in no or negligible penalties. Overall, these taxpayers accountfor the middle 75% of joint returns. Taxpayerswith children could have small remaining penalties, depending on how penalties are defined. Most of those in the15% bracket who might have still havepenalties that are significant relative to income are removed from the tax roles entirely through the additional childcredits. Lower income couples may incur penalties through the Earned Income Credit (EIC) under either proposal, although it is difficult to address EIC marriage penaltiesand bonuses. The 12% of taxpayers in higher brackets may have remaining penalties. A large fraction of thesereturns do not have large penalties because theirmarginal tax rate is the flat capital gains tax rate. Any penalties are substantially reduced or eliminated, however,due to the lower rate structure in theAdministration proposal. The important difference between H.R. 6 and the Administration proposal is that H.R. 6 expandsmarriage bonuses in most cases whilethe Administration proposal generally reduces them due to flatter tax rates. H.R. 6 combined with rate cutswould increase bonuses in comparison tothe Administration proposal and, in many cases, in comparison to current law. Measurement of the marriage penalty for couples depends on the allocation of children for tax purposes. When married couples are compared with cohabitatingsingles, where issues of incentives and fairness suggest attention be focused, cohabitating singles are less likely tohave children and when they do, have lowincomes unlikely to be subject to regular income tax. Thus, the issues of measuring the marriage penalty forfamilies may be relatively unimportant. This reportwill be updated to reflect legislative developments. ."
