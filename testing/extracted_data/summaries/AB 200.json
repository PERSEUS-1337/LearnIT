    "title": "An act to amend Sections 69437 and 69437.6 of the Education Code, relating to student financial aid.",
    "content": "Existing law, the Ortiz-Pacheco-Poochigian-Vasconcellos Cal Grant Program, establishes the Cal Grant A and B Entitlement awards, the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement awards, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B awards, the Cal Grant C awards, and the Cal Grant T awards under the administration of the Student Aid Commission, and establishes eligibility requirements for awards under these programs for participating students attending qualifying institutions. Among other things, the program requires that a total of 22,500 Competitive Cal Grant A and B awards be granted annually. This bill would instead require that a total of 45,000 50,000 Competitive Cal Grant A and B awards be granted for each of the 2015\u201316 and 2016\u201317 academic year, years and that 80,000 60,000 be granted for the 2017\u201318 academic year, and that 100,000 be granted for the 2018\u201319 academic year and each academic year thereafter. The bill would also make conforming changes and delete an obsolete provision."
