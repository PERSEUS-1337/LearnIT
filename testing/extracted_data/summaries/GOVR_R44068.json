    "content": "Corinthian Colleges, Inc. (CCI) was the parent company of several private, for-profit institutions of higher education, including the Everest Institute, Everest Colleges, Heald Colleges, and Wyotech Technical Schools. CCI operated more than 100 of these institutions across the nation, with total enrollments of approximately 72,000 students who annually received roughly $1.4 billion in federal financial aid. In summer 2014, the Department of Education (ED) limited CCI's access to federal student aid in response to CCI's failure to address concerns relating to a variety of practices, including failing to provide ED with requested data related to CCI's Title IV federal student aid participation. To avoid abrupt closure of its schools due to the financial stresses that the limited access to federal student aid put on CCI, the company and ED reached an agreement under which CCI agreed to sell or \"teach-out\" its educational programs. Subsequently, the Zenith Education Group (Zenith) was formed by the Education Credit Management Corporation (ECMC) as a nonprofit entity for the purpose of buying a large portion of CCI's schools. Those CCI schools not purchased by Zenith closed. This report answers several frequently asked questions regarding the effect of the sale and closure of CCI's schools as they relate to former CCI students' student aid, including the following: Are former CCI students eligible to have their student loans discharged? How many former CCI students are eligible for or have received federal student loan discharge as a result of CCI's actions? How will the discharge of federal student loans affect former CCI students' future eligibility for loans? Will the discharge of student loans create an income tax liability for former CCI students? Is there any relief for former CCI students who received Pell Grants? Is there any relief for former CCI students who received GI Bill benefits?
