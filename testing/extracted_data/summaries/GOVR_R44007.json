    "content": "Existing federal law outlaws sex trafficking and provides a variety of mechanisms to prevent it and to assist its victims. Members have offered a number of proposals during the 114th Congress to bolster those efforts. Several clarify, expand, or supplement existing federal criminal law. For instance, Senator Cornyn's S. 178, which was packaged with Representative Poe's H.R. 181 and several proposals and enacted as the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-22), confirms that federal commercial sex trafficking prohibitions apply to the customers of such enterprises. P.L. 114-22 also constricts the defense of those who engage in illicit sexual activities with children. In addition, it affords state and federal law enforcement officials greater access to court-supervised electronic surveillance in trafficking cases. It expands victims' statutory rights and removes stringent limits on appellate enforcement of those rights. As suggested in S. 178, Senator Kirk's S. 572, and Representative Wagner's H.R. 285, P.L. 114-22 brings culpable advertisers within the reach of the federal law which proscribes commercial sex trafficking. P.L. 114-22 lengthens the permissible term of supervised release for those convicted of plotting to engage in commercial sex trafficking, language reminiscent of Senator Feinstein's S. 140, Representative Poe's H.R. 296, and Representative Granger's H.R. 1201. S. 178 and Senator Burr's S. 409 proposed requiring Department of Defense (DOD) officials to provide the Attorney General with information relating to military sex offenders required to register under the federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA). P.L. 114-22 requires them to do so. Representative Speier's H.R. 956 would establish a separate DOD sex offender registry. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney's H.R. 1311 would increase the penalties for tax evasion by sex traffickers and call for the establishment of a dedicated office within the Internal Revenue Service to investigate and prosecute tax-avoiding sex traffickers.
