Requires a preferential leaseholder to have an option to purchase from the Commission the preferential lease parcel that is the subject of the lease. Permits a preferential leaseholder to elect to purchase a parcel on one of the following terms: (1) cash purchase for the amount that is equal to the value of the parcel minus ten percent of that value. Or (2) installment purchase, with 20 percent of the value of the parcel to be paid on the purchase date and the remainder to be paid over no more than 30 years at three percent annual interest.

Sets forth the uses of proceeds from such land sales.
