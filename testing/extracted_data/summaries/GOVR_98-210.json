    "content": "The military construction (MilCon) appropriations bill finances (1) military construction projects in the United States and overseas; (2) military family housing operations and construction;(3) U.S. contributions to the NATO Security Investment Program; and (4) most base realignment andclosure costs. This report reviews the appropriations and authorization process for military construction. The congressional debate perennially centers on the adequacy of the President's budget for militaryconstruction needs and the cases for and against congressional additions, especially for Guard andReserve projects. This year, key Members of Congress have argued that the Pentagon has neitherfunded nor planned adequately for military construction. For FY1999, the Administration has requested budget authority of $7.8 billion. This is down from the FY1996 level of $11.1 billion, the FY1997 level of $9.8 billion and the FY1998 level of$8.9 billion. On May 21, the House passed their version of the FY1998 defense authorization bill, H.R. 3616 ( H.Rept. 105-532 ). On May 7, the Senate Armed Services Committeefinished marking up its version, S. 2057 ( S.Rept. 105-189 ). The Senate passed thedefense authorization bill on June 25. The conference report ( H.Rept. 105-736 ) passed the Houseon September 24, and the Senate on October 1. The FY1999 authorization bill became P.L. 105-261 on October 17, 1998. The military construction appropriations subcommittees have finished their work. Theconference committee submitted their report ( H.Rept. 105-647 ) for H.R. 4059 on July24. The House agreed to the conference report (417-1), on July 29, with the Senate agreeing (87-3)on September 1. It became P.L. 105-237 on September 20, 1998. The conference recommended $8.450B. The conference committee added $666M to the President's request. Even with the additional funds, the FY1999 total is $759M less than what wasenacted for FY1998. This is an additional $216M to the House bill and a reduction of $31M fromthe Senate bill. Military construction accounts received emergency supplemental appropriations money for FY1999 in the Omnibus Consolidation bill ( H.R. 4328 , H.Rept. 105-825 ) in October1998. Due to monsoons in Korea and Hurricanes Georges & Bonnie, military construction projectssecured an additional $209 million in funding. Appropriations and authorization hearings on the FY1999 military construction budget have highlighted the following issues: importance of housing to the quality of life forservicemembers; privatization of military family housing and barracksimprovements; Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) concerns; environmental issues; and advanced procurement for Army military construction.
