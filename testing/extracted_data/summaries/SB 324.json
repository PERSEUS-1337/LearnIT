    "content": "The Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law, in specified conformity with federal income tax laws regarding qualified tuition programs, provide that distributions from a qualified tuition program are generally not included in the income of the donor or the beneficiary, as specified. Existing federal law, the Stephen Beck, Jr. Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014 , for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, encourages and assists individuals and families to save private funds for the purpose of supporting persons with disabilities to maintain their health, independence, and quality of life by excluding from gross income distributions used for qualified disability expenses by a beneficiary of a Qualified ABLE Program established and maintained by a state, as specified. This bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, would conform to these federal income tax law provisions relating to the ABLE Act under the Personal Income Tax Law, as provided. The bill would create the ABLE Act Board and would require the board provide an annual listing of distributions to individuals that have an interest in an ABLE account to the Franchise Tax Board, as provided. This bill would provide that it will only become effective if AB 449 is enacted and becomes effective."
