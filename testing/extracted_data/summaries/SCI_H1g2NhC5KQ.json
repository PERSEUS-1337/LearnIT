    "content": "The dominant approach to unsupervised \"style transfer'' in text is based on the idea of learning a latent representation, which is independent of the attributes specifying its \"style''. In this paper, we show that this condition is not necessary and is not always met in practice, even with domain adversarial training that explicitly aims at learning such disentangled representations. We thus propose a new model that controls several factors of variation in textual data where this condition on disentanglement is replaced with a simpler mechanism based on back-translation. Our method allows control over multiple attributes, like gender, sentiment, product type, etc., and a more fine-grained control on the trade-off between content preservation and change of style with a pooling operator in the latent space. Our experiments demonstrate that the fully entangled model produces better generations, even when tested on new and more challenging benchmarks comprising reviews with multiple sentences and multiple attributes. One of the objectives of unsupervised learning is to learn representations of data that enable fine control over the underlying latent factors of variation, e.g., pose and viewpoint of objects in images, or writer style and sentiment of a product review. In conditional generative modeling, these latent factors are given BID38 BID31 BID9 , or automatically inferred via observation of samples from the data distribution BID4 BID15 ).More recently, several studies have focused on learning unsupervised mappings between two data domains such as images BID39 , words or sentences from different languages BID6 BID26 .In this problem setting, the generative model is conditioned not only on the desired attribute values, but also on a initial input, which it must transform. Generations should retain as many of the original input characteristics as possible, provided the attribute constraint is not violated. This learning task is typically unsupervised because no example of an input and its corresponding output with the specified attribute is available during training. The model only sees random examples and their attribute values.The dominant approach to learn such a mapping in text is via an explicit constraint on disentanglement BID17 BID10 BID37 : the learned representation should be invariant to the specified attribute, and retain only attribute-agnostic information about the \"content\". Changing the style of an input at test time then amounts to generating an output based on the disentangled latent representation computed from the input and the desired attributes. Disentanglement is often achieved through an adversarial term in the training objective that aims at making the attribute value unrecoverable from the latent representation. This paper aims to extend previous studies on \"style transfer\" along three axes. (i) First, we seek to gain a better understanding of what is necessary to make things work, and in particular, whether Table 1 : Our approach can be applied to many different domains beyond sentiment flipping, as illustrated here with example re-writes by our model on public social media content. The first line in each box is an input provided to the model with the original attribute, followed by its rewrite when given a different attribute value. disentanglement is key, or even actually achieved by an adversarial loss in practice. In Sec. 3.1 we provide strong empirical evidence that disentanglement is not necessary to enable control over the factors of variation, and that even a method using adversarial loss to disentangle BID10 does not actually learn representations that are disentangled. (ii) Second, we introduce a model which replaces the adversarial term with a back-translation BID35 objective which exposes the model to a pseudo-supervised setting, where the model's outputs act as supervised training data for the ultimate task at hand. The resulting model is similar to recently proposed methods for unsupervised machine translation BID24 BID0 BID44 ), but with two major differences: (a) we use a pooling operator which is used to control the trade-off between style transfer and content preservation; and (b) we extend this model to support multiple attribute control. (iii) Finally, in Sec. 4.1 we point out that current style transfer benchmarks based on collections of user reviews have severe limitations, as they only consider a single attribute control (sentiment), and very small sentences in isolation with noisy labels. To address this issue, we propose a new set of benchmarks based on existing review datasets, which comprise full reviews, where multiple attributes are extracted from each review.The contributions of this paper are thus: (1) a deeper understanding of the necessary components of style transfer through extensive experiments, resulting in (2) a generic and simple learning framework based on mixing a denoising auto-encoding loss with an online back-translation technique and a novel neural architecture combining a pooling operator and support for multiple attributes, and (3) a new, more challenging and realistic version of existing benchmarks which uses full reviews and multiple attributes per review, as well as a comparison of our approach w.r.t. baselines using both new metrics and human evaluations. We will open-source our code and release the new benchmark datasets used in this work, as well as our pre-trained classifiers and language models for reproducibility. This will also enable fair empirical comparisons on automatic evaluation metrics in future work on this problem. We present a model that is capable of re-writing sentences conditioned on given attributes, that is not based on a disentanglement criterion as often used in the literature. We demonstrate our model's ability to generalize to a realistic setting of restaurant/product reviews consisting of several sentences per review. We also present model components that allow fine-grained control over the trade-off between attribute control versus preserving the content in the input. Experiments with automatic and human-based metrics show that our model significantly outperforms the current state of the art not only on existing datasets, but also on the large-scale datasets we created. The source code and benchmarks will be made available to the research community after the reviewing process.A SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL"
