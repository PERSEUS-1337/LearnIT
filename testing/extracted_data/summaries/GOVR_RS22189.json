    "content": "In Kelo v. City of New London , decided June 23, 2005, the Supreme Court held 5-4 that the city's condemnation of private property, to implement its area redevelopment plan aimed at invigorating a depressed economy, was a \"public use\" satisfying the U.S. Constitution\u00e2\u0080\u0094even though the property might be turned over to private developers. The majority opinion was grounded on a century of Supreme Court decisions holding that \"public use\" must be read broadly to mean \"for a public purpose.\" The dissenters, however, argued that even a broad reading of \"public use\" does not extend to private-to-private transfers solely to improve the tax base and create jobs. Congress is now considering several options for responding to the Kelo decision."
