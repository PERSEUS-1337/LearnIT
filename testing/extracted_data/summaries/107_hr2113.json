    "title": "To amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to ensure that no permanent resident alien or alien in the United States with an unexpired visa is removed or otherwise deprived of liberty, based on evidence that is kept secret from the alien.",
    "content": "Secret Evidence Against Lawful Aliens Repeal Act of 2001 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to require the Attorney General to provide advance notice to an alien who is a lawful permanent resident or is otherwise in the United States with an unexpired visa and the presiding officer in any immigration proceeding in which classified information is intended to be used. Limits such information's use to: (1) terrorist activity deportation. Or (2) opposition to an alien's admission or relief from removal upon certification that such information could not be developed from open sources and that an agency declassification request has been made. Provides: (1) for Federal district court review of classified material upon Attorney General or alien request. And (2) that the court will issue an order indicating any unclassified summary of such material that may be used in the immigration proceeding. Applies the provisions of the Classified Information Procedures Act to an immigration proceeding under district court review in the same manner as a criminal proceeding subject to such Act. Amends the Act to entitle an alien, subject to the classified information provisions of this Act, who is subject to arrest and detention for removal or deportation to: (1) non-federally provided counsel, (2) examine all evidence, present evidence, and question witnesses, (3) have a complete record of the proceeding kept. And (4) judicial review. Exempts an alien who is a lawful permanent resident or has an unexpired visa from related removal provisions. Provides for transitional application of information access provisions to such aliens."
