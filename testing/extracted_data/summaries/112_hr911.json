    "title": "To require the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Federal Communications Commission to conduct an inventory of broadband spectrum, to authorize the Commission, contingent on the completion of such inventory, to conduct auctions of voluntarily relinquished spectrum usage rights and to share the revenues with the licensees who relinquished such rights, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "Spectrum Inventory and Auction Act of 2011 - Amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to require the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information at the Department of Commerce and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to: (1) inventory, at least semiannually, each broadband radio spectrum band of frequencies listed in the US Table of Frequency Allocations, including the identity of each federal or non-federal user within each radio service authorized to operate in each band of frequencies, the activities and capabilities supported by transmitters and other radio frequency devices, the total amount of spectrum and geographic coverage areas assigned or licensed to each user, and other specified information. And (2) make the inventory available to the public on an Internet website. Directs the Assistant Secretary and the FCC to submit to Congress a biennial report containing a recommendation of which bands of inventoried frequencies, if any, should be reallocated or made available for shared access. Sets forth exceptions for federal agencies to withhold certain national security information. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to provide that, if the FCC determines that it is consistent with the public interest in spectrum utilization for a licensee to voluntarily relinquish licensed spectrum usage rights to permit the assignment of new initial licenses or the allocation of spectrum for unlicensed use subject to new service rules, the proceeds from granting such rights to another licensee under an appropriate competitive bidding system must be shared, in a more than de minimis amount that the FCC considers appropriate, with the licensee who voluntarily relinquished such rights. Directs the FCC to establish rules for such voluntary incentive auction revenue sharing. Prohibits the FCC from reclaiming frequencies of any licensees on an involuntary basis for certain licensing purposes. Extends the FCC's authority to grant a license or permit under the applicable competitive bidding provisions to September 30, 2020."
