    "content": "Flexibility for Displaced Workers Act - Allows national emergency grant funds to states under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) for addressing the effects of Hurricane Katrina (Katrina) to be used to provide disaster relief employment on projects that provide assistance in areas outside of the Katrina-disaster area. Allows such funds to be used to provide disaster relief employment and other WIA assistance, or temporary general public sector employment, to Katrina-affected individuals, including those who have relocated from states in the disaster area, who were unemployed at the time of the disaster, or who are without employment history, in addition those who meet WIA eligibility requirements. Limits such general public sector employment to not more than six months in addition to such disaster relief employment. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor, however, to extend the duration of employment under this Act and WIA for up to an additional six months due to extraordinary circumstances. Directs the Secretary, in awarding WIA national emergency grants for disaster relief employment, to give priority: (1) first, to states with major disaster areas. And (2) second, to the remaining states that have been most heavily impacted by the demand for services by Katrina-affected workers. Allows any state, with the Secretary's approval, to use available WIA national emergency grant funds to assist Katrina-affected workers, including those who have relocated from states in the Katrina-disaster area. Authorizes the Secretary to award a WIA national emergency grant for employment and training assistance (ETA) for dislocated workers to an eligible entity to provide ETA to Katrina-affected workers, including workers who have relocated from Katrina-disaster areas. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) states operating one-stop centers should make them available for use in Katrina-affected areas and areas where large numbers of Katrina's victims have been relocated. And (2) one-stop operators should increase access for Katrina-affected individuals, including through expanded operational hours and on-site services for those in temporary housing."
