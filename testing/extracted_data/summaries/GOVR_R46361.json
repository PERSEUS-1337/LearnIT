    "content": "The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act, enacted as Division A of H.R. 1158 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2020, provides a total of $687.8 billion in discretionary budget authority, all to fund activities of the Department of Defense (DOD), except for $1.1 billion for certain activities of the intelligence community. As enacted, the bill provides 99.6% of the funding requested by President Trump requested for programs falling within the scope of this bill. To comply with the FY2020 cap on DOD base budget funding that was in effect at the time the FY2020 budget request was submitted, the Administration included in its request $97.9 billion intended for DOD base budget activities, but which was designated as part of the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) request and thus was exempt from the cap for all practical purposes. The Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate treated these funds as part of the base budget request. Activities funded by the annual defense appropriations act accounted for more than 90% of the budget authority included in the Trump Administration's $761.8 billion budget request for national defense-related activities in FY2020. The balance of the request consisted of activities funded by other appropriations bills (e.g., DOD's military construction program and defense-related nuclear energy work of the Energy Department) and certain amounts appropriated automatically as a result of permanent law."
