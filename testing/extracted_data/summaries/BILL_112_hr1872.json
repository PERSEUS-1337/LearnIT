Requires such analysis to include estimated job losses and decreased economic activity due to the denial or issuance of permits, including permits issued under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act . Requires the Administrator to: (1) post such analysis on EPA's website and request governors of states experiencing more than a de minimis negative impact to post such analysis in their capitols. (2) hold public hearings in each state in which a requirement, program, or permit will have more than a de minimis negative impact. And (3) give notice of such impact in a state to such state's congressional delegation, governor, and legislature at least 45 days prior to the effective date of such requirement or program or the denial or issuance of a permit. Defines de minimis negative impact to mean: (1) with respect to employment levels, a loss of more than 100 jobs. And (2) with respect to economic activity, a decrease in economic activity of more than $1,000,000 over any calendar year."
