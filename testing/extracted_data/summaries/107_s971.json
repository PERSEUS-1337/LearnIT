    "content": "Dental Health Improvement Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to States to help them develop innovative programs to address the dental workforce needs of designated dental health professional shortage areas in a manner appropriate to the State's individual needs. Defines designated dental health professional shortage area to mean an area, population group, or facility designated by the Secretary as a dental health professional shortage area or by a State as having a dental health manpower shortage. Directs the Secretary to develop a plan for increasing participation of dentists and dental hygienists in the National Health Service Corps' scholarship and loan repayment programs. Revises scholarship and loan repayment program requirements to allow periods of obligated service to be served and fulfilled on a part time basis if certain conditions are met. Sets forth requirements with respect to the dental health professional shortage area designation process. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from the gross income of an individual certain amounts received under the National Health Service Corps Scholarship program, the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment program, or any similar State program."
