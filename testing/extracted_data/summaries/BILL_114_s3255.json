    "content": "Blocking Deadly Fentanyl Imports Act This bill amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to include in the definition of quot, major illicit drug producing countryquot. A country that is a significant source of illicit fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, or fentanyl precursor chemicals. The bill requires the international narcotics control strategy report to: identify countries that are the most significant exporters of illicit fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, and fentanyl precursor chemicals. Identify countries that are the most significant sources of the diversion of such chemical for illicit uses. And describe the extent to which an identified country has cooperated with the United States to prevent the export of such chemical to the United States. The bill requires the withholding of bilateral and multilateral assistance from an identified country. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 is amended to require the President, as part of the report identifying major drug transit countries, to designate each country that: does not utilize specified emergency scheduling procedures for new illicit drugs and other synthetics that are comparable to the procedures used for controlled substances schedules, is incapable of prosecuting criminals for the manufacture or distribution of controlled substance analogues in the same manner that applies to controlled substances, and does not require specified registration of tableting or encapsulating machines."
