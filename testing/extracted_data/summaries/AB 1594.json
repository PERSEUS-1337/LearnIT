    "title": "An act to repeal and add Section 7597.1 of the Government Code, relating to public postsecondary education.",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the University of California, under the administration of the Regents of the University of California. The California State University, under the administration of the Trustees of the California State University. And the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law prohibits public employees or members of the public from smoking any tobacco product inside a public building or in a nearby outdoor area, as specified. Existing law also provides that the governing bodies of the California State University and each community college district have the authority to set enforcement standards relating to smoking on their campuses and to enforce these requirements by citation and fine, as specified. Existing law also authorizes the Trustees of the California State University to establish rules and regulations for the government and maintenance of the buildings and grounds of the university, and provides that a violation or attempted violation of these rules and regulations is a misdemeanor. This bill would, beginning January 1, 2018, prohibit smoking, including the use of an electronic smoking device, and the use of a tobacco product on a campus of the California State University or the California Community Colleges. The bill would authorize the governing bodies of the California State University and each community college district to set standards for the enforcement of that prohibition and to conduct a positive educational campaign to increase the awareness of a tobacco- and smoke-free policy. The bill would authorize the enforcement of this prohibition by a fine, not to exceed $25 for the first offense, $50 for the 2nd offense, and $100 for the 3rd and subsequent offenses, as specified. The bill would require the proceeds of the fine to be allocated for purposes including support of the educational operations of the campus on which the violation occurs, education about and promotion of the policy implemented by the bill, and tobacco use cessation treatment options for students of that campus. To the extent that these provisions would impose new duties on community college districts, and extend the scope of activities on the buildings and grounds of the California State University that could be charged as misdemeanors, they would constitute a state-mandated local program. This bill would encourage the Regents of the University of California to adopt and enforce new, or continue to enforce existing, policies substantially similar to those described above. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."
