    "content": "Reading Readiness Act of 2001 - Amends the Head Start Act to require Head Start programs to include a strong focus on reading readiness. Requires research, demonstration, and evaluation activities to: (1) determine whether every Head Start program is providing participating children the tools necessary to succeed in school, including reading readiness. And (2) review current best practices of Head Start programs with respect to reading readiness. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award competitive grants to selected Head Start applicants to carry out current best practices in reading readiness activities. Allows Head Start programs that demonstrate by community assessment that all reasonable attempt has been made to enroll children whose families' incomes are below the poverty line to make eligible for program participation children whose families' incomes are no greater than 150 percent of the poverty line. Directs the Secretary to implement an outreach campaign to promote enrollment in Head Start programs and Early Head Start programs. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the Secretary should allow Head Start grantees that find evidence of community need to modify the use of their current grants so as to enroll infants and toddlers without obtaining a separate Early Head Start grant. And (2) Congress should appropriate sufficient funds to carry out the Head Start Act so that all eligible children may participate."
