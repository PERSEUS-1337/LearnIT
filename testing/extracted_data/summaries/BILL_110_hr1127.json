    "content": "American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to allow US manufacturers that use products subject to countervailing or antidumping duty proceedings or use domestic like products to participate in such proceedings. Requires the US International Trade Commission, when deciding whether an antidumping or countervailing duty should be imposed or continued, to weigh harm to industrial users from such imposition or continuation, as well as the potential benefits to the industry in the United States materially injured or threatened with material injury by a foreign countervailing subsidy."
