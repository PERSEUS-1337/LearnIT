    "content": "Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act of 2016 This bill amends the federal criminal code to prohibit and punish the straw purchasing of firearms. A straw purchase occurs when: (1) a person buys a firearm from an unlicensed seller on behalf of a person prohibited by law from possessing one, or (2) a person buys a firearm from a licensed dealer on behalf of another person. Any person that commits, attempts, or conspires to commit a straw purchasing offense is subject to a fine andor prison term of up to 15 years . The bill expands the penalty for committing a firearms trafficking offense. Individuals who commit such an offense are subject to a fine andor prison term of up to 15 years. Under current law, the penalty is a fine andor prison term of up to 10 years. The US Sentencing Commission shall amend the sentencing guidelines and policy statements to reflect increased penalties for persons convicted of straw purchasing firearms or firearms trafficking offenses. Under current law, it is unlawful to import firearms into the United States with the intent to engage in illegal activity. This bill extends the prohibition to the exportation of firearms. The bill makes it unlawful for any person to sell or otherwise dispose of any firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such person intends to transfer the firearm or ammunition in furtherance of a federal crime of terrorism, a crime of violence, or a drug trafficking offense. Neither the Department of Justice (DOJ) nor its law enforcement coordinate agencies shall facilitate the transfer of an operable firearm to an individual if any DOJ law enforcement officer involved knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the recipient is an agent of a drug cartel, unless US law enforcement personnel continuously monitor or control the firearm at all times."
