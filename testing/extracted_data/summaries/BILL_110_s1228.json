Requires such an IHE to: (1) test annually its law enforcement emergency response program. And (2) inform those on campus of any school law enforcement emergency within 30 minutes of discovering it. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make competitive grants to IHEs or consortia of IHEs, or enter into competitive contracts with IHEs, consortia, and other organizations, to develop, implement, operate, improve, test, or disseminate campus law enforcement emergency response programs. Defines campus for purposes of this Act to include property controlled by recognized student organizations, off-campus school-related property, and certain public property used by and adjacent to the school."
