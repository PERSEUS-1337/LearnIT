    "content": "Department of Veterans Affairs Nurses Appreciation Act of 1999 - Amends Federal provisions relating to the pay of health care personnel within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the Department of Veterans Affairs to require the rates of pay for registered nurses and certain other health-care positions within the VHA to be adjusted annually by the same percentage as those generally applicable to Federal employees. Provides that whenever after October 1, 2002, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines that such rates of pay are inadequate to recruit or retain high-quality health personnel at such a facility, the Secretary shall adjust such pay to achieve consistency with the rates of compensation for corresponding non-Department health-care positions in the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor market area of that facility. Provides for the automatic statutory adjustment to such rates of pay whenever an annual Federal pay adjustment becomes effective."
