    "content": "As a means tested program, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) places a limit on the assets or resources of its beneficiaries. However, there are four types of accounts that can be used by SSI beneficiaries for specific purposes without affecting their SSI eligibility. Money placed into burial accounts, money used as part of a Plan for Achieving Self-Support (PASS), money placed in Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), and money placed in dedicated accounts for children are not counted as resources for the purposes of determining SSI eligibility. These accounts can be used by SSI beneficiaries to build assets or plan for the future and represent an important part of the overall SSI program. This report provides an overview of these four types of accounts and outlines the cases when money placed into these accounts is exempt from the SSI resource limitations. This report will be updated to reflect any changes in this legislation or other relevant legislative activity."
