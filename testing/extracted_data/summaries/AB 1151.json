    "title": "An act to amend Sections 40204 and 40215 of the Vehicle Code, relating to parking violations.",
    "content": "Existing law establishes a process by which a person who has received a notice of a parking violation or a notice of a delinquent parking violation may contest the notice. Existing law provides for an administrative hearing, conducted by an examiner, as specified, as part of that process. If after the hearing the examiner determines that the person committed the violation, existing law authorizes the examiner to allow the person to pay the penalty for the violation in installments, and authorizes the agency that issued the notice to allow deferred payment of the penalty or payment of the penalty in installments if the person provides satisfactory evidence of an inability to pay the penalty in full. This bill would authorize the examiner or the issuing agency to allow payment of the penalty in installments, or allow the issuing agency to allow deferred payment of the penalty, at any stage of the process described above. This bill would also authorize the issuing agency to allow payment of the penalty in installments if the person does not contest the violation."
