The average length of stay, opioid prescription rate, and suicide rate for patients discharged from the facility. And the average number of days a patient waited for an appointment or procedure at such facility. Includes in such information for each VA nursing home any quality measures the Secretary of HHS makes publicly available regarding Medicare nursing homes.
