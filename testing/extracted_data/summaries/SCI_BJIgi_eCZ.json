    "content": "This paper introduces a new neural structure called FusionNet, which extends existing attention approaches from three perspectives. First, it puts forward a novel concept of \"History of Word\" to characterize attention information from the lowest word-level embedding up to the highest semantic-level representation. Second, it identifies an attention scoring function that better utilizes the \"history of word\" concept. Third, it proposes a fully-aware multi-level attention mechanism to capture the complete information in one text (such as a question) and exploit it in its counterpart (such as context or passage) layer by layer. We apply FusionNet to the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and it achieves the first position for both single and ensemble model on the official SQuAD leaderboard at the time of writing (Oct. 4th, 2017). Meanwhile, we verify the generalization of FusionNet with two adversarial SQuAD datasets and it sets up the new state-of-the-art on both datasets: on AddSent, FusionNet increases the best F1 metric from 46.6% to 51.4%; on AddOneSent, FusionNet boosts the best F1 metric from 56.0% to 60.7%. Context: The Alpine Rhine is part of the Rhine, a famous European river. The Alpine Rhine begins in the most western part of the Swiss canton of Graub\u00fcnden, and later forms the border between Switzerland to the West and Liechtenstein and later Austria to the East. On the other hand, the Danube separates Romania and Bulgaria. In this paper, we describe a new deep learning model called FusionNet with its application to machine comprehension. FusionNet proposes a novel attention mechanism with following three contributions: 1. the concept of history-of-word to build the attention using complete information from the lowest word-level embedding up to the highest semantic-level representation; 2. an attention scoring function to effectively and efficiently utilize history-of-word; 3. a fully-aware multi-level fusion to exploit information layer by layer discriminatingly. We applied FusionNet to MRC task and experimental results show that FusionNet outperforms existing machine reading models on both the SQuAD dataset and the adversarial SQuAD dataset. We believe FusionNet is a general and improved attention mechanism and can be applied to many tasks. Our future work is to study its capability in other NLP problems."
