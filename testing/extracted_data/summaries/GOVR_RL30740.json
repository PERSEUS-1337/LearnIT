    "content": "The National Security Agency (NSA), one of the largest components of the U.S. Intelligence Community, has reached a major watershed in its history. Responsible for obtaining intelligence from international communications, NSA's efforts are being challenged bythe multiplicity of new types of communicationslinks, by the widespread availability of low-cost encryption systems, and by changes in the internationalenvironment in which dangerous security threats cancome from small, but well organized, terrorist groups as well as hostile nation states. NSA's efforts to adjust to the changing geopolitical and technological environment have been strongly encouraged by Congress and reflect a major shift incongressional oversight of the Agency. Although Congress has always approved funding for NSA, for decadesroutine oversight was limited to a few Membersand staff. In the 1970s, congressional investigations of intelligence agencies resulted in greater public attention toNSA and criticism of activities that infringed onthe civil liberties of U.S. persons. Subsequently, both the Senate and the House of Representatives establishedintelligence oversight committees that have closelymonitored NSA's operations. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) was enacted in 1978 to regulatecollection by foreign intelligence agencies of thecommunications of U.S. persons. The end of the Cold War, the expansion of low-cost encryption and the explosionof communications systems led Congress totake a more public profile in overseeing the large and secretive Agency. Reacting in large measure to congressional concerns, NSA launched two separate management reviews, one by outside experts, the other by longtime Agencyofficials. Both made strong criticisms of Agency personnel policies, an outmoded organizational structure, and anunwillingness to utilize civilian practices thatmore effective than those available in-house. The current NSA Director, Lt. General Michael V. Hayden, USAF,has used these analyses to launch a series ofmajor initiatives designed to improve NSA's operations, to attract and reward more qualified people from outsideindustry, and is developing a major contract foroutside support of its non-sensitive Information Technology (IT) functions. A major renewal effort is underway, but observers believe many challenges lie ahead that will require congressional oversight. Many of the reforms in personnelpolicies recommended are difficult to implement in a government organization, especially in an extremely tightmarket for technical specialists. The technicalcomplexities of dealing with widespread and sophisticated encryption as well as the proliferation of communicationsdevices remain to be resolved. NSA is,along with other intelligence agencies, not well-positioned to analyze developments among the assortment ofterrorist groups and narcotics smugglers around theworld that can seriously affect U.S. interests. NSA has also come under heated criticism in the European Parliamentfor allegedly collecting, in cooperation withthe British, commercial intelligence to benefit U.S. corporations."
