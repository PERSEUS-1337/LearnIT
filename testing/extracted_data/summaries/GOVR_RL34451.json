    "content": "On June 30, 2008, President Bush signed into law a bill, H.R. 2642 (P.L. 110-252), that makes supplemental appropriations for FY2008 and FY2009, extends unemployment payments, and expands veterans' educational benefits. The House approved the measure on June 19 and the Senate on June 26. As enacted, the bill reflects compromises with the White House on several key issues. It extends unemployment benefits for 13 weeks but not 26, allows veterans' educational benefits to be transferred to dependents, does not include an offsetting tax increase, limits other domestic spending, and delays implementation of six, rather than seven, new Medicaid rules. The amended bill also drops most Iraq-related policy provisions that had been in earlier versions. In all, the bill provides $183.5 billion in supplemental appropriations, including $2.65 billion of newly added funds to respond to Midwest floods. Extended unemployment benefits are estimated to cost a net of $10 billion over ten years and enhanced veterans educational benefits $63 billion. Earlier, the House approved an initial version of the bill on May 15, 2008. Procedurally, the House took up H.R. 2642, a bill on a different topic, and considered three amendments. By a vote of 141-149, with 132 Republicans voting \"present,\" the House rejected an amendment providing $162.5 billion in FY2008 and FY2009 for military operations. It adopted a second amendment setting out Iraq-related policies, including a requirement that combat forces be withdrawn from Iraq within 18 months. And it approved a third amendment to expand veterans' educational benefits offset by a tax surcharge; extend unemployment compensation; delay new Medicaid regulations; and provide $21 billion in supplemental appropriations. On May 22, 2008, the Senate approved an amended version of the bill providing $194 billion in supplemental funding. The Senate-passed bill included $162.5 billion for defense and about $8 billion more than the House bill for domestic programs. The bill expanded veterans' educational benefits without an offset and limited Medicare payments to new specialty hospitals. On key roll calls, the Senate rejected by 34-63 an amendment to provide defense funding and to establish Iraq-related policies; approved by 75-22 an amendment to provide defense funding without policy restrictions; and approved by 70-26 an amendment to fund domestic, international affairs, and military construction programs. During its first session, the 110th Congress approved FY2008 emergency supplemental appropriations of $86.8 billion for the Department of Defense and $2.4 billion for international affairs. This left unresolved Administration requests for $102.5 billion for defense and $5.4 billion for international affairs. For congressional action on FY2008 supplemental funding through December 2007, see CRS Report RL34278, FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations for Global War on Terror Military Operations, International Affairs, and Other Purposes, which will not be updated further. This CRS report, RL34451, reviews congressional action on remaining FY2008 and additional FY2009 supplemental funding."
