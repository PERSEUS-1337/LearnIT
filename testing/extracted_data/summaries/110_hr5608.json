Or (2) the entities consulted with tribal officials early in the process of developing the proposed policy and provided a tribal summary impact statement to specified congressional committees and affected tribes. Requires such entities to have accountable consultation processes and to explore and use consensual mechanisms for developing policies on issues relating to tribal self-government, tribal trust resources, or Indian tribal treaty and other rights. Prohibits such entities from implementing policies that have tribal implications and that preempt tribal law unless the entities: (1) consulted with tribal officials in the policy's development. And (2) provided to specified congressional committees and affected Indian tribes a tribal summary impact statement.
