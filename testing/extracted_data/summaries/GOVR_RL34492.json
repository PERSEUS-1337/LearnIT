    "content": "December 2007 marked the fifth anniversary of the passage of the E-Government Act of 2002. Shortly before this anniversary, authorization of appropriations for several key provisions expired on September 30, 2007. Some of the activities and offices affected by the expiring authorizations include, but are not limited to, the Office of Electronic Government (OEG) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the General Services Administration (GSA) E-Government Fund; the GSA program to operate a federal Internet portal; and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) responsibility to develop standards, guidelines, and associated methods and techniques for protecting federal information systems. Building upon the Clinger-Cohen Act, the E-Government Act serves as the primary legislative vehicle to guide evolving federal IT management practices and to promote initiatives to make government information and services available online. In doing so, it also represents a continuation of efforts to realize greater efficiencies and reduce redundancies through improved intergovernmental coordination, and by aligning IT investments. The law contains a variety of provisions related to federal government IT management, information security, and the provision of services and information electronically. One of the most recognized provisions involves the creation of an Office of Electronic Government (OEG) within the OMB. The OEG is headed by an Administrator, who is responsible for carrying out a variety of information resources management (IRM) functions, as well as administering the interagency E-Government Fund authorized by the law. Although the E-Government Act authorized a cumulative minimum of $345 million from FY2003-FY2007 for the E-Government Fund, concerns regarding oversight have prompted Congress to appropriate no more than $5 million in any given fiscal year since the passage of the act. The occasion to consider reauthorization of the E-Government Act provides Congress the opportunity to assess the results of federal e-government initiatives since 2002, consider how they have affected the administration of government, and decide what changes, if any, are necessary. In considering whether to reauthorize any, some, or all of these provisions, Congress may also wish to consider a number of other issues related to the implementation and oversight. These issues include, but are not limited to: what actions may be needed to reconcile the fundamental disparity between the horizontal nature of government-wide e-government initiatives, and the vertical organization of government oversight and funding mechanisms; how e-government initiatives should be funded and the role of the E-Government Fund; and the continuity and future direction of e-government efforts with the upcoming transition of presidential administrations. On November 7, 2007, S. 2321, the E-Government Reauthorization Act of 2007 was introduced. The bill would amend and reauthorize appropriations for the E-Government Act. A comparable bill has not been introduced in the House."
