    "content": "Action for Dental Health Act 2015 This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize oral health promotion and disease prevention programs through FY2020. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may award grants or enter into contracts to obtain portable or mobile dental equipment and pay operational costs for the provision of free dental services to underserved populations. The CDC may also award grants or enter into contracts to collaborate with state, county, or local public officials and other stakeholders to develop and implement initiatives to: (1) improve oral health education and dental disease prevention. (2) make the health care delivery system providing dental services more accessible and efficient through the development and expansion of outreach programs that facilitate the establishment of dental homes. (3) reduce geographic, language, cultural, and similar barriers in the provision of dental services. (4) reduce the use of emergency departments by those who seek dental services more appropriately delivered in a dental primary care setting. Or (5) facilitate the provision of dental care to nursing home residents who are disproportionately affected by lack of care."
