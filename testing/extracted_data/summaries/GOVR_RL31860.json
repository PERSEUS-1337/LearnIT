    "content": "U.S.-EU relations have been affected by a number of trade disputes in recent years. While the majority of trade disputes do get resolved, attempts to settle some of the disputes have been met withrefusal or inability by one or another of the parties to comply in a timely manner with the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) panel rulings. The 108th Congress inherits several of these disputeswhere the WTO has ruled that U.S. laws violate trade obligations. Absent U.S. compliance throughlegislative action, the EU could in some cases decide to retaliate against U.S. exports this year ornext. In the meantime, the EU remains in non-compliance with its WTO obligations to allowimports of beef treated with hormones. Beyond raising U.S.-EU trade tensions, non-compliance bya key WTO member arguably weakens the credibility and authority of the WTO and its disputesettlement process. The initiation and resolution of disputes under WTO agreements is carried out under the Uruguay Round Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU), considered a cornerstone of the WTOsystem. The WTO dispute settlement process has a more quasi-judicial orientation than thequasi-diplomatic orientation of the prior GATT system, in which negotiation and conciliationgenerally prevailed over multilateral enforcement of rules. The DSU provides for virtually automaticestablishment of panels, adoption of panel and appellate reports and, where requested, authorizationto impose retaliatory measures; deadlines are set out for various stages of the process. These featuresensure that complaints are heard and promote implementation of WTO rulings, thus makingavailable to all WTO Members the means to clarify trade rules and redress trade injury. At the sametime, the process continues to retain certain diplomatic elements in that its primary aim is to \"securea positive solution to a dispute,\" with the preferred outcome being a \"solution mutually acceptableto the parties to the dispute and consistent with the covered agreements.\" Opportunities forsettlement are provided at a number of points in a procedure. U.S. and EU instances of longstanding non-compliance have for the most part not involved routine commercial disputes over trade or customs regulations, but rather tax policy and internalnational regulation, particularly of social and health matters. While ambiguity in WTO agreementsmay give rise to disputes in these difficult areas, the automatic features of the DSU also allow partiesto pursue such cases through the full dispute process, even though it may be evident from the outsetthat implementation of an adverse WTO ruling may be subject to overwhelming domestic oppositionin the defending country. To deal with the problem of non-compliance in difficult cases, bothWashington and Brussels may need to give greater attention to a number of concerns and policyconsiderations, including choice of cases initiated, limitations on panel decisions, role of mediationand conciliation, and adoption of remedies that are trade liberalizing. Assuming that some disputesare not well-suited for the DSU process, greater efforts may be needed to settle differences throughbilateral negotiations and political compromises, through mediation, or by agreeing to arbitrationfrom an outside ( i.e. , non-WTO) party. This report will be updated periodically. For more on theWTO dispute settlement process and U.S.-EU Trade Relations, see CRS Report RS20088 and CRS Issue Brief IB10087."
