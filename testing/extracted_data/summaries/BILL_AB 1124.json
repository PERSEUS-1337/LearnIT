    "title": "AB 1124",
    "content": "Existing law establishes a workers\u2019 compensation system, administered by the Administrative Director of the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation, to compensate an employee for injuries sustained in the course of employment. The administrative director is authorized to adopt, amend, or repeal, after public hearings, any rules and regulations that are reasonably necessary to enforce the state workers\u2019 compensation provisions, except when that power is specifically reserved to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board. Existing law requires the administrative director to adopt a medical treatment utilization schedule that addresses the frequency, duration, intensity, and appropriateness of all common treatments performed in workers\u2019 compensation cases. This bill would require the administrative director to establish a drug formulary, on or before July 1, 2017, as part of the medical treatment utilization schedule, for medications prescribed in the workers\u2019 compensation system. The bill would require the administrative director to meet and consult with stakeholders, as specified, prior to the adoption of the formulary. The bill would require the administrative director to publish at least 2 interim reports on the Internet Web site of the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation describing the status of the creation of the formulary, commencing July 1, 2016, until the formulary is implemented. The bill would require the administrative director to update the formulary at least on a quarterly basis to allow for the provision of all appropriate medications, including medications new to the market. The bill would exempt an order updating the formulary from the Administrative Procedure Act and other provisions, as specified. The bill would require the administrative director to establish an independent pharmacy and therapeutics committee to review and consult with the administrative director in connection with updating the formulary, as specified. The bill would also make conforming changes to related code sections."
