    "content": "Voting Restoration Act - Prohibits the denial or abridgement of the right of any individual to vote or to register to vote in an election for Federal office on the grounds of a felony conviction. Permits a State, however, to restrict such an individual's right to vote or register to vote during any period in which the individual remains under the custody or supervision of the State or local jurisdiction . Establishes an enforcement mechanism, which includes authorizing: (1) a person aggrieved by a violation of this Act to bring a civil action in an appropriate district court for declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to the violation which may include a request for compensatory damages under specified conditions. And (2) the Attorney General to bring a civil action in an appropriate district court for such declaratory or injunctive relief as necessary to remedy a violation of this Act. Directs the Attorney General to award grants to eligible States to carry out a program to protect the right to vote and to register to vote in Federal elections of individuals who have been convicted of felonies. Requires each State receiving a grant to: (1) provide information to individuals convicted of felonies by the State regarding their eligibility to register to vote and to vote in the State through a described program. And (2) carry out a program to increase voter registration rates among such individuals. Encourages States receiving program grants to reduce the number of felonies which may result in the temporary or permanent disenfranchisement of convicted felons. Outlines the responsibilities of the Department of Justice regarding individuals convicted of Federal felonies, including requiring the Attorney General to establish and to maintain an index of individuals convicted of felonies by the Federal Government who are under its custody or supervision , or who were released from its custody or supervision during the previous ten years."
