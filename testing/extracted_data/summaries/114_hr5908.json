    "content": "Federal Employee Accountability Act of 2016 or FEAA This bill allows federal agencies, under Office of Personnel Management regulations, to remove certain employees from civil service or to reduce their grade or pay. An employee may appeal within 7 days to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), which must refer the case to an administrative judge to expedite a final decision within 45 days after the MSPB receives the appeal. If the administrative judge cannot reach a decision within 45 days, the removal or reduction becomes final. But the MSPB must explain to Congress why a decision was not issued."
