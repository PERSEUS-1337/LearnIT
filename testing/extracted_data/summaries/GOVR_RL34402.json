    "content": "The New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) is a non-refundable tax credit intended to encourage private capital investment in eligible, impoverished, low-income communities. NMTCs are allocated by the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI), a bureau within the United States Department of the Treasury, under a competitive application process. Investors who make qualified equity investments reduce their federal income tax liability by claiming the credit. The NMTC program, enacted in 2000, is currently authorized to allocate $61 billion through the end of 2019. To date, the CDFI has made 912 awards totaling $43.5 billion in NMTC allocation authority. Demand for NMTC allocations has exceeded total allocations each award round\u2014with the 2014 allocation round awarding $3.5 billion in allocation authority from applications requesting approximately $19.9 billion in NMTCs. The most recent program extension was made in the 114th Congress. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act (Division Q of P.L. 114-113) extended the NMTC authorization through 2019 at $3.5 billion per year. This report will be updated as warranted by legislative changes."
