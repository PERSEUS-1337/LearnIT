    "content": "This report provides an overview of the process for filling positions to which the President makes appointments with the advice and consent of the Senate. It also discusses nominations to full-time positions in 38 executive branch organizations (25 independent agencies, six agencies in the Executive Office of the President (EOP), and seven multilateral banking organizations) and four legislative branch agencies. It excludes appointments to executive departments and to regulatory and other boards and commissions, which are covered in other reports. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, formerly an independent agency covered by earlier versions of this report, became part of the Department of Homeland Security when that department was established during the period covered by this report. Another government organization, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, came into existence early in the 108th Congress after it was established by the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003. During the 108th Congress, President George W. Bush submitted to the Senate 40 nominations to full-time positions in independent and other agencies. Of these, 31 were confirmed and nine were returned to the President; none were withdrawn. The President made four recess appointments during this period to positions in organizations covered in this report (the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Agency for International Development). Two of these occurred during the 2004 Memorial Day recess and two during the 2004 August recess. All four of these recess appointments would have expired at the end of the first session of the 109th Congress. Before this time, the Senate confirmed nominations of each of these four appointees to their respective positions. Information for this report was compiled from data from the Senate nominations database of the Legislative Information System at http://www.congress.gov/nomis/, the Congressional Record (daily edition), the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents, and telephone discussions with agency officials. The report will not be updated."
