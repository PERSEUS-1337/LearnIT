(2) promote more consistent and timely sharing of threat information among jurisdictions. And (3) enhance DHS's situational awareness of such terrorist and other threats. The TSA shall: (1) make available to public and private sector stakeholders a framework for establishing an integrated and unified operations center responsible for overseeing daily operations of a transportation facility that promotes coordination for responses to terrorism, serious incidents, and other purposes.
