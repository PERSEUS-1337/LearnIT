    "content": "Yemen Security and Humanity Act This bill expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) addressing the famine conditions in Yemen is in US national security interests, (2) US-supported interventions to advance national security should consider the impact of military engagement on humanitarian operations, and (3) bureaucratic procedures with respect to humanitarian aid must be improved. The Global Food Security Act of 2016 is amended to include in the US global comprehensive food security strategy, with respect to famine-risk areas, coordination among the US Agency for International Development, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and the US military. The Department of State and the Department of Defense shall jointly report to Congress regarding US security and humanitarian interests in Yemen, including: (1) US strategic objectives, including humanitarian support to famine-threatened civilian populations, (2) efforts to coordinate civilian and military efforts. And (3) the diplomatic strategy with respect to regional partners seeking to end Yemen's civil war."
