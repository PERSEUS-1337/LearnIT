    "content": "Affordable Drugs Access Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require a waiver of prohibitions which would then permit an individual to import a prescription drug from Canada. Stipulates that the drug be: (1) imported in final form in limited quantities for personal use from a registered Canadian pharmacy, (2) approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. And (3) accompanied by a valid prescription. Requires the Secretary to study the authenticity and quality of drugs imported into the United States from other countries for personal use. Authorizes the Secretary, based on whether study results indicate the presence or absence of a significant threat to public health, to: (1) condition the entry of drugs, (2) terminate the waiver. Andor (3) extend the waiver to other countries. Amends the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act to reduce the aggregate number of dosage units of a controlled substance a US resident may import into the United States without a prescription. Regulates the Internet sale of prescription drugs. Requires Internet sites used for purposes of sales of a prescription drug to include a page providing the identities of the seller and the persons serving as pharmacists or medical consultants and the States in which the seller and such persons are authorized to dispense drugs or provide consultations. Permits State enforcement of Internet prescription drug sale requirements, but retains the right of the Secretary to intervene."
