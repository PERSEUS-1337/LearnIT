    "content": "In the fall of 1998, financial crises in Asia, Russia, and Brazil were unfolding, though in different stages, as the 105thCongress was in the process of passing the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental AppropriationsAct forFY1999 ( H.R. 4328 , P.L. 105-277 ). This legislation increased the U.S. quota of the International MonetaryFund (IMF), but attached a number of conditions to dispersal of the funds. Among them was creation of theInternationalFinancial Institutions Advisory Commission (the Meltzer Commission), which Congress chartered to evaluate andrecommend future U.S. policy toward the global financial institutions, particularly the IMF. The Commission released its report on March 8, 2000, calling for changes in the mission and operations of the IMF and thedevelopment banks. The 11 commissioners were unanimous only in generally recommending that: 1)the IMF restrict itslending to short-term liquidity needs, and 2) that it forgive debt to the poorest developing countries. The reportmakes thecase for restructuring the IMF to reduce and define clearly its mission, and clarify obligations for members of theFund, aswell. At the heart of the proposal is a strong conviction that deep structural reforms, particularly of developingcountryfinancial systems, would go a long way toward reducing the potential for currency crises and the related need forlarge,costly IMF bailouts. It also focuses heavily on the role of moral hazard. These concerns led to specific policyprescriptions, not unanimously embraced, including requiring financial sector reforms as a precondition for IMFassistance,lending for no longer than 120 days (with one rollover period) and at \"penalty\" rates, and eliminating any long-termlendingfor structural adjustment or poverty reduction. Four members of the Meltzer Commission dissented from the report. They supported the call to differentiate clearly theresponsibilities of the IMF and development banks, the need for stricter banking systems in developing countries,greatertransparency to mitigate abuse by all parties, and debt forgiveness for the poorest countries. They disagreed withthe detailslisted above, arguing that they would conceivably worsen rather than improve the prospect for global financialstability andthereby undermine the fight against poverty and slow development. A number of respondents to the Commission report also disagreed with what some consider its \"narrow\" prescriptions,including the U.S. Treasury and the Council on Foreign Relations, which offer alternative reform programs. Inaddition,financial crises have been a part of the international economic landscape long before the IMF was established,suggestingthat too much emphasis on this one institution may not bring the desired stability to the international financialsystem. Still, the IMF is responsible for addressing the concerns raised by Congress and other government institutionsaround theworld, which have served as a critical impetus for change. Continued oversight will be necessary to keep the reformprocess moving and more time may be needed to sort out precisely which policy options will suit the collective, butcompeting, needs of IMF member countries and the broader participants of the global economy."
