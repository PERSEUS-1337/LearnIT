    "content": "Teaching plays a very important role in our society, by spreading human knowledge and educating our next generations. A good teacher will select appropriate teaching materials, impact suitable methodologies, and set up targeted examinations, according to the learning behaviors of the students. In the field of artificial intelligence, however, one has not fully explored the role of teaching, and pays most attention to machine \\emph{learning}. In this paper, we argue that equal attention, if not more, should be paid to teaching, and furthermore, an optimization framework (instead of heuristics) should be used to obtain good teaching strategies. We call this approach ``learning to teach''. In the approach, two intelligent agents interact with each other: a student model (which corresponds to the learner in traditional machine learning algorithms), and a teacher model (which determines the appropriate data, loss function, and hypothesis space to facilitate the training of the student model). The teacher model leverages the feedback from the student model to optimize its own teaching strategies by means of reinforcement learning, so as to achieve teacher-student co-evolution. To demonstrate the practical value of our proposed approach, we take the training of deep neural networks (DNN) as an example, and show that by using the learning to teach techniques, we are able to use much less training data and fewer iterations to achieve almost the same accuracy for different kinds of DNN models (e.g., multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks) under various machine learning tasks (e.g., image classification and text understanding). The evolution of modern human society heavily depends on its advanced education system. The goal of education is to equip the students with necessary knowledge and skills, so as to empower them to further deepen the understanding of the world, and push the frontier of our humanity. In general, the growth of a student will be influenced by two factors: his/her own learning ability and the teaching ability of his/her teacher. Among these two, the teacher plays a critical role: an experienced teacher enables faster learning of a student through elaborated strategies such as selecting appropriate teaching materials, imparting suitable methodologies, and setting up targeted examinations.The training of an agent in artificial intelligence (e.g., an image classification model) is very similar to the growth of a student in human society. However, after carefully revisiting the literature of artificial intelligence (AI), we find that the importance role of the teacher has not been fully realized. Researchers put most of their efforts on the student, e.g., designing various optimization algorithms to enhance the learning ability of intelligent agents. In contrast, there are very limited attempts on building good teaching strategies, as briefly summarized below. Machine teaching BID41 BID42 BID21 BID22 studies the problem of how to identify the smallest training set to push the machine learning model towards a pre-defined oracle model. Curriculum learning (CL) BID2 BID31 BID8 and self-paced learning (SPL) BID18 BID19 BID15 heuristically define the scheduling of training data in a from-easy-to-hard order. Graduated optimization BID9 heuristically refines the non-convex loss function in a from-smooth-to-sharp manner, in order to make the machine learning process more robust. These attempts are either based on task-specific heuristic rules, or the strong assumption of a pre-known oracle model. In this regard, these works have not reflected the nature of education and the best practices in human society, where a good teacher is able to adaptively adopt different teaching strategies for different students under different circumstances, and is good at constantly improving his/her own teaching skills based on the feedback from the students.In this paper, we argue that a formal study on the role of 'teaching' in artificial intelligence is sorely needed. Actually, there could be a natural analogy between teaching in artificial intelligence and teaching in human society. For example, selecting training data corresponds to choosing right teaching materials (e.g. textbooks); designing the loss functions corresponds to setting up targeted examinations; defining the hypothesis space corresponds to imparting the proper methodologies. Furthermore, an optimization framework (instead of heuristics) should be used to update the teaching skills based on the feedback from the students, so as to achieve teacher-student co-evolution. Just as French essayist Joseph Joubert said -\"To teach is to learn twice\", we call this new approach \"learning to teach\" (L2T).In the L2T framework, there are two intelligent agents: a student model/agent, corresponding to the learner in traditional machine learning algorithms, and a teacher model/agent, determining the appropriate data, loss function, and hypothesis space to facilitate the learning of the student model. The training phase of L2T contains several episodes of sequential interactions between the teacher model and the student model. Based on the state information in each step, the teacher model updates the teaching actions so as to refine the machine learning problem of the student model. The student model then performs its learning process based on the inputs from the teacher model, and provides reward signals (e.g., the accuracy on the held-out development set) back to the teacher afterwards. The teacher model then utilizes such rewards to update its parameters via policy gradient methods (e.g., REINFORCE BID39 ). This interactive process is end-to-end trainable, exempt from the limitations of human-defined heuristics. Once converged, the teacher model could be applied to new learning scenarios and even new students, without extra efforts on re-training.To demonstrate the practical value of our proposed approach, we take a specific problem, training data scheduling, as an example. We show that by using our method to adaptively select the most suitable training data, we can significantly improve the accuracy and convergence speed of various neural networks including multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), for different applications including image classification and text understanding. Furthermore, the teacher model obtained by our method from one task can be smoothly transferred to other tasks. For example, with the teacher model trained on MNIST with the MLP learner, one can achieve a satisfactory performance on CIFAR-10 only using roughly half of the training data to train a ResNet model as the student. Inspired by the education systems in human society, we have proposed the framework of learning to teach, an end-to-end trainable method to automate the teaching process. Comprehensive experiments on several real-world tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework.There are many directions to explore for learning to teach in future. First, we have studied the application of L2T to image classification and sentiment analysis. We will study more applications such as machine translation and speech recognition. Second, we have focused on data teaching in this work. As stated in Subsection 3.1, we plan to investigate other teaching problems such as loss function teaching and hypothesis space teaching. Third, we have empirically verified the L2T framework through experiments. It is interesting to build theoretical foundations for learning to teach, such as the consistence and generalization of the teacher model."
