    "title": "An act to amend Section 1091 of the Government Code, relating to public officers and employees.",
    "content": "Existing law prohibits Members of the Legislature, state, county, district, judicial district, and city officers or employees from being financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity, or by any body or board of which they are members. Existing law identifies certain remote interests in contracts that are not subject to this prohibition and other situations in which an official is not deemed to be financially interested in a contract. Existing law makes a willful violation of this prohibition a crime. This bill would include in the definition of \u201cremote interest\u201d the interest of a person who is an owner or partner of a firm serving as an appointed member of an unelected board or commission of the contracting agency, if the owner or partner recuses himself or herself from providing any advice to the contracting agency regarding the contract between the firm and the contracting agency, and from all participation in reviewing a project that results from that contract. The bill would also include in the definition of \u201cremote interest\u201d the interest of a planner employed by a consulting engineering, architectural, or planning firm."
