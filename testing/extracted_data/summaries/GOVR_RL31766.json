    "content": "Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) overthrew Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003 and a permanent (four-year) Iraqi government is now running the day-to-day operations of the country. However, coalition forces continue to combat insurgents and are attempting to improve the security situation in Iraq. According to the Department of Defense, since early 2007 overall violence is down as much as 80%, as a result of the Administration's \"troop surge\" strategy. Elections were held in Iraq for a transitional National Assembly on January 30, 2005, and a permanent constitution was adopted on October 15, 2005. On December 15, 2005, elections were held for a permanent (four-year) national assembly, and Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was named and won approval of a 37-member cabinet on May 20, 2006. According to U.S. officials, the Iraqi government needs to increasingly focus on provision of public services, which is a growing source of public complaint, and on achieving political reconciliation among the relevant parties involved. This report provides an annotated list of U.N. agencies, key U.S. government agencies, and a sample list of major international and U.S.-based aid organizations that are providing humanitarian assistance to Iraq.
