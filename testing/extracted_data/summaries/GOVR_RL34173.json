    "content": "In June of 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision that has important implications for the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to review wholesale electricity and natural gas contracts under what is known as the \"Mobile-Sierra Doctrine.\" The Doctrine mandates that FERC will not abrogate contracts (including wholesale natural gas and power contracts as well as transmission agreements) between private parties absent a showing that a change is necessary in the public interest. This report reviews the Mobile-Sierra Doctrine and discusses a recent Supreme Court decision that evaluated the Doctrine and FERC's review role as set forth in the Federal Power Act in the context of market-based rates."
