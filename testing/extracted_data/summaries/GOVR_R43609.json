    "content": "In an increasingly interconnected world, public health concerns and crises have domestic and international implications. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (FD&C Act or the Act) promotes public health by preventing fraudulent activity with respect to food, drugs, and an array of other public health products that enter interstate commerce. Indeed, the Act's primary purpose is to \"safeguard\" and \"protect\" consumers from exposure to dangerous products affecting public health and safety. The FD&C Act does this by regulating covered articles from their introduction into interstate commerce to their delivery to the ultimate consumer. This report provides an overview of the FD&C Act, answers frequently asked questions about the Act's enforcement, and discusses the Act's various civil and criminal enforcement provisions. The FD&C Act is the main federal law regulating the safety of most foods, food additives, color additives, dietary supplements, prescription and non-prescription drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and tobacco products. While the Act regulates a host of disparate products, it generally prohibits two basic acts: \"adulteration\" and \"misbranding.\" Specifically, FD&C Act Section 301 makes it illegal to distribute directly or indirectly a covered product in interstate commerce that is adulterated or misbranded. The Act defines the terms \"adulteration\" and \"misbranding\" with respect to specific products. The FD&C Act is chiefly enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an agency whose general mission is to promote and protect the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and truthful labeling of the products it regulates. FDA enforces the Act through administrative mechanisms, such as pre-market reviews of certain products, examinations and investigations, and dissemination of information to the public. While primarily focused on interstate commerce, FDA's authority extends to intrastate activities that have a nexus with interstate commerce and concern a product that the Act covers. Supreme Court precedent recognizes that FDA enjoys significant discretion over enforcement of most FD&C Act provisions. Because FDA, like most executive agencies, does not have independent litigating authority, it must coordinate with the Department of Justice (DOJ) to pursue criminal or civil remedies. In addition to DOJ, other federal agencies play a role in enforcing discrete parts of the Act; private parties, however, do not have rights to enforce the FD&C Act through lawsuits. For serious FD&C Act violations, the FDA, in coordination with DOJ, has a wide range of civil and criminal remedies. For example, the FD&C Act authorizes the government to sue violators of the Act in court in order to punish or prevent future violations. Such civil actions include imposing money penalties, injunctions, and seizures. Other enforcement actions include warning letters, import alerts, recalls, and debarments. For extremely serious violations, FDA and DOJ may collaborate to bring criminal charges. A criminal violation of the FD&C Act does not require that the perpetrator have a \"guilty mind.\" Intentional or repeated violations of the Act may result in multiple years of imprisonment and significant criminal fines.
