    "content": "The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) does not include pregnancy status among its eligibility criteria and does not cover individuals over age 18. Under SCHIP, states can cover pregnant women aged 19 and older in one of three ways: (1) states may apply for waivers of program rules to extend coverage to adults such as pregnant women (\u00a71115 waiver authority); (2) states may provide health benefits coverage, including prenatal care and delivery services, to unborn children through an SCHIP state plan amendment (SPA) as permitted through regulation (Federal Register, vol. 67, no. 191, Wednesday, October 2, 2002, Rules and Regulations); or (3) states may offer a \"family coverage option\" that allows them to provide coverage under a group health plan that may include maternity care to adult females in eligible families. Section 2105(c)(3) of the Social Security Act allows states to cover entire families including parents if the purchase of family coverage is cost-effective when compared with the cost of covering only the targeted low-income children in the families involved, and would not substitute for other health insurance coverage. E-mail correspondence (from June 7, 2007) with Kathleen Farrell, the CMS Director of the SCHIP program, indicates that New Jersey and Massachusetts are the only states with operational family coverage variance programs. As of October 2007, 17 states offered pregnancy-related services using SCHIP funds. Of those, 6 states used the \u00a71115 waiver authority and 12 states extended coverage through unborn child SPAs (Rhode Island extends coverage to pregnant women through both authorities). This report summarizes the variation in pregnancy coverage and the financing streams associated with such coverage among these states. This report will be updated as state activity warrants."
