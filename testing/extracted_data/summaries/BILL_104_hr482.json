    "content": "Federal Benefit Integrity Act - Amends part A (AFDC) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to: (1) reduce the amount of AFDC currently being paid to families which do not include a US citizen or national. And (2) prohibit AFDC from being paid to any family applying for AFDC which does not include such an individual. Amends SSA title XVI (SSI), the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980, and the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to make similar amendments with respect to the receipt of Federal SSI, assisted housing, and food stamp benefits by aliens and, in certain cases, phase-out such benefits entirely."
