    "content": "Establishes the National Commission on Fairness in Military Compensation to: (1) determine the extent to which military personnel or their dependents rely on food stamps, the special supplemental food program under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, and other Federal or local assistance programs as a necessary supplement to their regular military compensation, and the circumstances that lead to such dependence. And (2) submit to the President and the Congress a report on its findings and its recommendations on possible changes in the military pay structure so that military personnel will receive adequate compensation and no longer rely on such other forms of assistance. Limits to $750,000 the total authorized expenses of the Commission. Requires the Comptroller General to audit Commission books and records in order to ensure compliance with such expense limit. Terminates the Commission 30 days after submission of its report."
