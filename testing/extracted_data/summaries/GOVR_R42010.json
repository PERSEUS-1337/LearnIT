    "content": "This report provides an overview of actions taken by Congress to provide FY2012 appropriations for the accounts funded by the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (L-HHS-ED) appropriations bill. The L-HHS-ED bill provides funding for all accounts subject to the annual appropriations process at the Departments of Labor and Education. It provides annual appropriations for most agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services, with certain exceptions (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration is funded via the Agriculture appropriations bill). The L-HHS-ED bill also provides funding for more than a dozen related agencies, including the Social Security Administration. The bill includes discretionary and mandatory funding, but this report focuses primarily on discretionary funding. On December 23, 2011, following several short-term continuing resolutions for FY2012, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-74) and the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-77). Combined, these two appropriations laws provide $164 billion in discretionary funding for L-HHS-ED, which is 0.6% less than the comparable FY2011 funding level of $165 billion and 8.6% less than the FY2012 President's Budget request of $179 billion. In addition, the FY2012 annual appropriations law (P.L. 112-74) provides an estimated $577 billion in mandatory L-HHS-ED funding, for a total of $741 billion for L-HHS-ED as a whole. Note that the FY2012 amounts discussed here and throughout the report have not been adjusted to reflect the 0.189% across-the-board rescission required by P.L. 112-74, Division F, for most discretionary L-HHS-ED appropriations. Prior to the enactment of P.L. 112-74, both the House and Senate had initiated action on full-year FY2012 L-HHS-ED appropriations. On September 29, the House introduced a bill (H.R. 3070) that would have provided nearly $160 billion in discretionary funding for L-HHS-ED accounts. On September 22, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported a bill (S. 1599, S.Rept. 112-84) that would have provided $165 billion in discretionary funding for L-HHS-ED accounts. Department of Labor (DOL): The FY2012 annual appropriations law provides $12.6 billion in discretionary funding for DOL. This amount is 0.7% less than the comparable FY2011 funding level of $12.7 billion and 2% less than the FY2012 President's request of $12.8 billion. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS): The FY2012 annual appropriations law provides $69.8 billion in discretionary funding for HHS. This amount is 1% less than the comparable FY2011 funding level of $70.4 billion and 5% less than the FY2012 President's request of $73.1 billion. Department of Education (ED): The FY2012 annual appropriations law provides $68.2 billion in discretionary funding for ED. This amount is 0.3% less than the comparable FY2011 funding level of $68.4 billion and 12% less than the FY2012 President's request of $77.4 billion. Related Agencies: The FY2012 annual appropriations law provides $13.4 billion in discretionary funding for related agencies included in L-HHS-ED appropriations. In addition, the FY2012 disaster relief appropriations law (P.L. 112-77) provides $493 million in discretionary funding for the Social Security Administration (one of the L-HHS-ED related agencies), for a combined total of $13.9 billion. This amount is 0.1% more than the comparable FY2011 funding level of $13.8 billion and 9% less than the FY2012 President's request of $15.2 billion."
