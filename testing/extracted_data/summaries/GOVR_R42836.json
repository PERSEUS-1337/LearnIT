    "content": "Various water supply shortages and greater demand for water supply related to energy development projects have brought increased attention to disputes over the control of water resources across the country. In particular, domestic on-shore unconventional oil and gas development, such as hydraulic fracturing, has caused rapid growth in freshwater demand. To accommodate water supply requests in the Missouri River Basin, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) has proposed the use of surplus water from its Garrison Dam/Lake Sakakawea Project in North Dakota. The Corps' proposal would allow it to enter into five-year contracts to supply surplus water for a fee, which will be set through administrative rulemaking. North Dakota and other states have objected to the Corps' proposal as a violation of their constitutional right to water flowing within their borders, arguing that the Corps cannot require payment for water that the state owns. Although the legality of the Corps' charging for surplus water storage at its facilities has not been litigated specifically, the Corps' constitutional authority over operations at its reservoirs is generally very broad. Additionally, Congress has authorized the Corps to charge for surplus storage at federal projects such as the Garrison Dam/Lake Sakakawea Project. Of course, statutory approval of an action that may interfere with state sovereignty does not connote constitutionality. Other provisions within the Corps' statutory authorities arguably may indicate that Congress did not intend to infringe upon state sovereignty over water rights within its boundaries. While it appears that the Corps has broad authority to impound waters owned by the state for the purposes of a particular project without necessarily acquiring water rights under state law, it may be argued that surplus water, which is not used for any of the authorized purposes, is beyond the control of the Corps. However, the viability of such an argument is unclear, given the lack of legal precedent on the issue. This report addresses the legal authority of the Corps to charge for surplus water stored at its facilities. It analyzes the constitutional and statutory authority of the federal government to operate federal water projects, specifically Lake Sakakawea, along the Missouri River. It also examines the nature of states' claims of ownership of waters within state boundaries. Finally, the report discusses the relationship between federal and state authority, including examples in which Congress addressed competing federal and state roles."
