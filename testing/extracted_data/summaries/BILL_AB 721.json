    "title": "AB 721",
    "content": "Existing law requires a public, private, or independent postsecondary educational institution, except the California Community Colleges, to make specified disclosures related to private student loans in financial aid material and private loan applications provided or made available by the institution, to distinguish private loans from federal loans in individual financial aid awards, and, if the institution provides a private loan lender list, to provide general information about the loans available through the lender and disclose the basis for each lender\u2019s inclusion on the list. This bill would require the public, private, or independent institution, except the California Community Colleges, to make available to the public upon request and in a prominent location on its Internet Web site within 12 months of a completed academic year, as defined, specified student loan debt statistics on graduates. The bill would require all public, private, and independent postsecondary institutions to provide students information concerning unused state and federal financial assistance including unused federal student loan moneys available to them before certifying their eligibility for private student loans and, if the institution does not participate in federal student loan programs, to inform students that they may be eligible for federal student loans at participating institutions and provide them information regarding Cal Grants and federal student aid. The bill would make nonsubstantive and conforming changes."
