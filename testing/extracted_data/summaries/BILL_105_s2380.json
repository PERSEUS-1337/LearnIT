Or (2) a court order waiving the need for the parent's or guardian's consent pursuant to a judicial bypass procedure under this title. Requires a court to issue such an order if it finds by clear and convincing evidence on an individual basis that: (1) the process of obtaining such consent is not in the best interests of the minor petitioner. Or (2) the minor petitioner is an emancipated minor. Sets forth procedures regarding confidentiality, filing of the petition, preference over other proceedings, findings, and expedited appellate review. Specifies that the provisions of this title shall not be construed to preempt State law provisions that provide greater protections to parents of minors seeking abortions. Title II: Parental Involvement in Decisions Concerning Contraceptives and Abortion Referrals - Requires all federally funded programs that provide for the distribution of contraceptive drugs or devices to minors or that provide abortion referrals to minors to obtain informed written consent of a custodial parent or custodial legal guardian prior to the provision of such drugs or devices or referral information to the minor, with an exception. Requires a court to issue an order waiving such requirement if it finds by clear and convincing evidence on an individual basis that: (1) the process of obtaining such consent is not in the best interests of the minor petitioner. Or (2) the minor petitioner is an emancipated minor. Sets forth procedures regarding confidentiality, filing of the petition, preference over other proceedings, findings, and expedited appellate review. Specifies that nothing in this title shall be construed as prohibiting the distribution of contraceptive drugs or devices, or the provision of abortion referral information, to unemancipated minors without obtaining prior written parental consent if: (1) the distribution is paid for through the expenditure by a State of State funds, regardless of whether such State funds are provided as part of the State's contribution to a Federal program. And (2) the State takes affirmative action to allow the provision of such drugs, devices, or information through the use of State funds without requiring such parental consent."
