    "content": "The FY2009 appropriations process began with President Bush's FY2009 budget request. It included $39 billion for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), an increase of 4% in net budget authority from the FY2008 non-emergency level. That requested increase in net budget authority was largely attributable to a decline in the amount available to offset the HUD budget. The President's budget request would have resulted in an overall decline in appropriations for HUD's programs and activities of just over 1% from the FY2008 level. Despite the request for an overall decline in appropriations for HUD's programs and activities, the President's FY2009 budget did request increased appropriations in several areas, including project-based Section 8 rental assistance, the HOME Investment Partnerships block grant program, and Homeless Assistance grants. The President's FY2009 budget requested reductions in funding for several programs, including the Section 202 Housing for the Elderly program and the Section 811 Housing for Persons with Disabilities program. It proposed eliminating funding for several programs that were funded in FY2008, including the HOPE VI public housing revitalization program, the Brownfields Redevelopment program, Section 108 loan guarantees, and the Rural Housing and Economic Development block grant program. President Bush had also requested no new funding for each of these programs in his FY2004-FY2008 budget requests, although Congress continued to fund them in each of those years. On June 20, 2008, the Transportation-HUD Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations approved a draft FY2009 Transportation-HUD appropriations bill. The text of that bill was never released. On July 9, 2008, the Transportation-HUD Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Appropriations approved its version of the FY2009 Transportation-HUD appropriations bill; the bill was approved the following day (July 10, 2008) by the Senate Committee on Appropriations (S. 3261). On September 30, 2009, President Bush signed a continuing resolution funding most government agencies, including HUD, at their FY2008 levels through March 6, 2009 (P.L. 110-329). The CR also provided $150 million in emergency supplemental assisted housing funds for use in areas affected by the 2005 hurricanes and $6.5 billion in emergency supplemental CDBG funding to be used to respond to presidentially declared disasters that took place in 2008. The final FY2009 appropriations legislation was not enacted before the close of the 110th Congress and the end of the Bush Administration. The 111th Congress enacted a second continuing resolution before the expiration of the first, providing funding through March 11, 2009. On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5). Among other provisions, the bill contained emergency supplemental FY2009 funding for several HUD accounts. On March 11, 2009, the regular FY2009 appropriations process was completed when an omnibus appropriations bill was signed into law (P.L. 111-8). It provided $41.5 billion for HUD, an increase of 10% in net budget authority from the FY2008 non-emergency level."
