    "title": "An act to amend Sections 48205, 48206.3, and 48208 of, and to add Sections 222.5 and 46015 to, the Education Code, relating to pupil rights.",
    "content": "Existing law requires a pupil to be excused from school for specified types of absences and prohibits those excused absences from generating state apportionment payments by deeming them as absences in computing average daily attendance. This bill would include as another type of excused absence, 4 absences per school year to care for a sick child, for which the school is prohibited from requiring a note from a doctor. The bill would authorize the governing board of a school district to allow adopt a policy that allows a parenting pupil who gives or expects to give birth up to 6 weeks of parental leave and to allow a parenting pupil not giving birth up to 3 weeks of parental leave. The bill would specify that parental leave absences shall not be deemed absences in computing average daily attendance if the governing board of the school district of attendance files with the State Department of Education an expectant and parenting pupil policy that includes procedures for ensuring pupils are provided with schoolwork while on parental leave, and would specify the method for crediting average daily attendance for these pupils. Existing state regulations require an educational institution to treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery from those conditions in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability. Existing law requires a school district that receives notification of a pupil\u2019s temporary disability to determine whether the pupil will be able to receive individualized instruction, and, if the determination is positive, to provide the individualized instruction, as specified. This bill would require a school district to provide a pupil with a temporary disability as a result of pregnancy with guidelines for makeup work plan development if the option for individualized instruction is not available at the pupil\u2019s school or school district. Existing law prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability, gender, or other specified characteristics in any program or activity conducted by an educational institution that receives, or benefits from, state financial assistance or enrolls pupils who receive state financial aid. This bill would require a school district to notify pregnant and parenting pupils of specified rights and options available to those pupils, as specified. To the extent that this bill would impose additional duties on school districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
