    "title": "SB 509",
    "content": "Existing law prohibits the sale of a plastic product labeled as \u201ccompostable,\u201d \u201chome compostable,\u201d or \u201cmarine degradable\u201d unless it meets a certain specification, certification, or standard and prohibits the sale of a plastic product that is labeled as \u201cbiodegradable,\u201d \u201cdegradable,\u201d \u201cdecomposable,\u201d or as otherwise specified. The term \u201cplastic product\u201d is defined for purposes of these prohibitions. This bill would authorize the labeling of commercial agricultural mulch film, as defined, sold in the state as \u201csoil biodegradable\u201d if it meets a specified standard for biodegradability of plastics adopted by ASTM International and that standard is also adopted by the Director of Resources Recycling and Recovery. The bill also would make nonsubstantive changes relating to the definition of ASTM International."
