    "content": "Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as one of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. The board appoints a chief executive officer known as the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges. Under existing law, community college districts are authorized, among other things, to maintain and operate campuses, employ faculty and other employees, and provide instruction to students. This bill would establish the California College Promise Innovation Grant Program, under the administration of the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, which would require the chancellor\u2019s office to distribute grants, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the governing boards of community college districts, who meet certain requirements, to support the establishment of regional programs with the goals of increasing college preparation, college access, and college success. These provisions would be repealed on January 1, 2021."
