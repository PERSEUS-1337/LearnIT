And (3) assistance and services with respect to asthma, cancer, HIV disease and AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, mental health, diabetes, and heart disease. Requires the Secretary to reserve a portion of grants and assistance awarded under the PHSA for entities that represent medically underserved areas or populations with a large number of uninsured low-income individuals. Directs the Secretary to award grants to research institutions to: (1) conduct research on the health status of populations for which there is an absence of health data, such as the Latina population. And (2) work with organizations that focus on such populations on developing participatory community-based research methods.
