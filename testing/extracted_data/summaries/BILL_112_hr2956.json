    "content": "Fair and Equitable Postal Service Access Act - Expands the criteria that the US Postal Service (USPS) must consider in determining whether to close or consolidate a post office to include: (1) whether such closing or consolidation will decrease access to postal or nonpostal services by individuals who are elderly, economically disadvantaged, limited in mobility, or without reliable and affordable Internet access. And (2) during the previous five years, the number of, and revenue derived from, money-order transactions, the volume of processed international mail, and the number of customers served at such post office. Prohibits the USPS from closing or consolidating a post office if it would result in a disproportionate, unreasonable, or undue burden on a class of individuals who are elderly, economically disadvantaged, limited in mobility, or without reliable and affordable Internet access. Applies this Act to any post office: (1) determined necessary for closing or consolidation under existing criteria, or (2) included in a proposal to change the nature of postal services on a nationwide or substantially nationwide basis and for which the USPS has requested a related advisory opinion from the Postal Regulatory Commission."
