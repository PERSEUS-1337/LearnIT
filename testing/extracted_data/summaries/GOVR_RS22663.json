    "content": "This report examines U.S. foreign assistance activities in the People's Republic of China (PRC), undertaken by the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The report also discusses related foreign operations appropriations, policy history, and legislative background. International programs supported by U.S. departments and agencies other than the Department of State and USAID, as well as Department of State public diplomacy programs, are not covered in this report. U.S. foreign assistance efforts in the PRC aim to promote democracy, human rights, and the rule of law; support sustainable livelihoods, cultural preservation, and environmental protection in Tibetan areas; and further U.S. interests through programs that address environmental pollution and pandemic diseases in China. The U.S. Congress has played a leading role in determining program priorities and funding levels for these objectives. These programs constitute an important component of U.S. human rights policy toward China. Although the United States is not the largest bilateral aid donor to China, it is the largest provider of government and civil society programming, according to data compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In 2000, the act granting permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) treatment to China (P.L. 106-286) authorized programs to promote democracy in the PRC. Between 2001 and 2015, the United States government allocated over $417 million for Department of State and USAID foreign assistance efforts in the PRC, including Peace Corps programs. Of this total, $342 million was devoted to democracy, human rights, and related activities; Tibetan communities; and the environment. The direct recipients of State Department and USAID grants have been predominantly U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and universities. Chinese NGOs, universities, and some government entities have participated in or indirectly benefited from U.S. programs, or have collaborated with U.S. foreign aid grantees. Appropriations for Department of State and USAID programs in China reached a peak in FY2010, totaling $46.9 million. Funding decreased by nearly 40% between 2010 and 2012 and has since remained at lower levels. Reduced appropriations have resulted in the discontinuation of a number of rule of law and environmental programs. Some policymakers argue that the United States government should not fund foreign assistance programs in the PRC because Beijing has significant financial resources and can manage China's own development needs. Other critics say that U.S. democracy, human rights, rule of law, environmental, and related programs have had little effect in China. Some observers fear that growing PRC restrictions on civil society could further undermine U.S. aid efforts. Some experts counter that U.S. programs in China aim to promote U.S. interests in areas where the PRC government has lacked the expertise or will to make greater progress. They argue that U.S. assistance activities in China have helped to develop protections of some rights, build foundations for the rule of law and civil society, and bolster reform-minded officials in the PRC government. Some proponents suggest that U.S. programs have nurtured relationships among governmental and nongovernmental actors and educational institutions in the United States and the PRC, which have helped to develop common understandings about human rights, the rule of law, and related principles and norms. Other programs are said to have reduced environmental and health threats coming from China."
