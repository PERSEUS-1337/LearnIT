    "content": "Salmon Solutions and Planning Act - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences for scientific analysis of federal salmon recovery actions, including the impact that removal of the four lower Snake River dams would have on recovery of salmon and steelhead populations and any additional actions that may be necessary to achieve recovery of salmon and steelhead populations. Directs: (1) the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to conduct a peer-reviewed study of the rail, highway, and Columbia River barge infrastructure improvements that would be necessary to ensure a cost-effective and efficient transportation system for shippers who currently use barge transportation between Lewiston, Idaho, and the confluence of the Snake and Columbia Rivers and who would be unable to do so if the four lower Snake River dams were removed. (2) the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to conduct a peer-reviewed study of the options to replace the power currently generated by such dams if they were removed. (3) the Army Corps of Engineers to analyze riverfront revitalization and restoration opportunities and costs in the event of such removal. And (4) the Bureau of Reclamation to conduct a peer-reviewed analysis of the options and costs regarding any needed modifications to affected irrigation systems, cooling systems, and private wells if the dams were removed. Sets forth the congressional determination that the Secretary of the Army may remove the four lower Snake River dams.
