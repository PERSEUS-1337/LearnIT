    "content": "In November 2003, the U.S. attorney's office in Miami dropped a criminal case againstaformer federal baggage screener charged with stealing from a passenger's luggage. The case was dropped becauseprosecutors fearedthat sensitive security information (SSI) would have to be disclosed. At issue is the ability of the TransportationSecurityAdministration (TSA) to prosecute other dishonest agency employees in the future. Will the same dilemma that ledto the dismissalof this particular case occur again? In recent months, this and other important issues relating to SSI have beenraised. This reportprovides a brief background on SSI regulation, an overview of the current policy issues, and a description of thecriticism of, andsupport for, SSI policy.
