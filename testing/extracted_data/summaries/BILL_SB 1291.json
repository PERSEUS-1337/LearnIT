    "title": "SB 1291",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services, including specialty mental health services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. Under existing law, specialty mental health services are provided by mental health plans and the department is responsible for conducting investigations and audits of claims and reimbursements for expenditures for specialty mental health services provided by mental health plans to Medi-Cal eligible individuals. This bill would require annual mental health plan reviews to be conducted by an external quality review organization (EQRO) and, commencing July 1, 2018, would require those reviews to include specific data for Medi-Cal eligible minor and nonminor dependents in foster care, including the number of Medi-Cal eligible minor and nonminor dependents in foster care served each year. The bill would require the department to share data with county boards of supervisors, including data that will assist in the development of mental health service plans and performance outcome system data and metrics, as specified. This bill would require the department to post any corrective action plan prepared by the mental health plan to address deficiencies identified by the EQRO review and the EQRO data on its Internet Web site, as specified. The bill would also require the department to notify the mental health plan of any deficiencies and would require the mental health plan to provide a written corrective action plan to the department."
