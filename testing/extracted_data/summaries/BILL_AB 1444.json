    "title": "AB 1444",
    "content": "Existing law, except as specified, prohibits any state agency from expending funds appropriated for design-build projects until the Department of Finance and the State Public Works Board have approved performance criteria for the project. This bill would include among the exceptions to those provisions amounts appropriated for projects at the Salton Sea. Existing law requires either the Director of General Services or the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to notify the State Public Works Board regarding the method to be used for selecting a design-build entity, prior to advertising the design-build project. This bill would, for purposes of projects at the Salton Sea, instead require the Director of the Department of Water Resources to notify the California Water Commission regarding the method to be used for selecting a design-build entry, prior to advertising a design-build project. The bill would make other conforming changes. Existing law authorizes any public corporation, as defined, and specified private corporations to apply for the privilege of establishing, operating, and maintaining a foreign-trade zone in accordance with federal law, and provides that any public or private corporation whose application is granted pursuant to federal law is authorized to establish, operate, and maintain a foreign-trade zone, subject to specified conditions. Existing law also authorizes a public corporation, if authorized to establish, operate, and maintain a foreign trade zone, to provide the United States with indemnity or assurance and to deposit sums of money with the United States as requested. This bill would combine and reorganize these provisions and would repeal that indemnity and assurance provision."
