    "content": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148, as amended) requires all non-grandfathered health plans in the non-group and small-group private health insurance markets to offer a core package of health care services, known as the essential health benefits (EHB). The ACA does not specifically define this core package but rather lists 10 benefit categories from which benefits and services must be included. The 10 benefit categories are as follows: ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness and chronic disease management; and pediatric services, including oral and vision care. For the 2014-2017 coverage years, each state was required to select an EHB-benchmark plan. The benchmark plan serves as a reference plan on which non-group and small-group market plans must substantially base their benefits packages. Because states select their own EHB-benchmark plans, there is considerable variation in EHB coverage from state to state. This variation occurs in terms of specific covered services as well as in terms of amount, duration, and scope. For example, some state EHB-benchmark plans may include bariatric surgery as a covered service whereas other state EHB-benchmark plans may not cover bariatric surgery. State benefit mandates also may be considered to be part of that state's EHB and thus add to state-level coverage differences. Furthermore, because states can allow non-group and small-group plans to substitute certain services within the categories, coverage in plans within a state also may vary by benefit amount, duration, and scope. For example, a state's EHB-benchmark plan could offer up to 20 physical therapy visits and 10 occupational therapy visits. Another plan in the state could offer coverage consistent with the EHB-benchmark plan by covering up to 10 physical therapy visits and 20 occupational therapy visits. In addition to covering the EHB, the ACA imposes a limit on cost sharing (which includes co-payments, coinsurance, and deductibles) for the EHB. The ACA also prohibits plans from applying lifetime and annual dollar limits on the EHB."
