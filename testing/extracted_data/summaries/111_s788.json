    "title": "A bill to prohibit unsolicited mobile text message spam.",
    "content": "M-SPAM Act of 2009 - Amends the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 to exclude a message from the definition of mobile service commercial message (MSCM) if the message's purpose is to: (1) facilitate or confirm a commercial transaction. (2) provide warranty, recall, safety, or security information about a product or service used by the recipient. (3) provide certain information to message recipients who have an ongoing commercial relationship with the sender. (4) provide information relating to the recipient's benefit plan or employment. Or (5) deliver goods or services to which the recipient is entitled. Amends that Act and the Communications Act of 1934 to exempt from a prohibition on sending unwanted MSCMs: (1) the sending of short messaging service (SMS) messages from one wireless device to another or from a mobile service provider to its subscribers at no charge. And (2) the sending of MSCMs by a mobile service provider to its subscribers at no charge . Requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to revise the do-not-call registry provisions of the Telemarketing Sales Rule to: (1) consider commercial mobile service messaging practices that are costly or a nuisance to consumers. And (2) explicitly prohibit, as an abusive telemarketing act or practice, the sending of any MSCM to a telephone number that is both assigned to a commercial mobile service and listed on the do-not-call registry. Exempts such messages sent by a commercial mobile service provider to its subscribers at no charge."
