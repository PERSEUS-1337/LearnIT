    "content": "The Central African Republic (CAR) is emerging from a crisis that began when rebels overthrew the national government in 2013, ushering in a chaotic and violent period. A new president, Faustin Archange Touad\u00e9ra, was elected in 2016, but gains remain fragile. Militias that have targeted civilians on the basis of religious and ethnic identity continue to operate in much of the country, posing challenges to governance, reconciliation, and accountability. Violence has caused large population displacements, weakening an already tiny economy and placing strains on finite international aid and peacekeeping resources. U.S. responses to the crisis in CAR have included: humanitarian assistance; aid funding for conflict mitigation, peacebuilding, and rule-of-law programs; diplomatic and financial support for a U.N. peacekeeping operation, MINUSCA; additional support for African and French troops that have deployed to CAR; public diplomacy initiatives; and targeted financial and travel sanctions against actors viewed as fueling conflict. Key issues for the 115th Congress include the authorization, appropriation, and oversight of U.S. aid and peacekeeping funding and of U.S. policy toward CAR. The context for these considerations will depend to some extent on the approach of the incoming Donald Trump Administration to CAR and regional issues. The situation in CAR also has implications for several broad policy challenges in which Congress has displayed interest: political stability in the wider central Africa region; U.S. efforts to counter the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a small but brutal militia active in eastern CAR and neighboring countries; the U.S. role in preventing and addressing \"mass atrocities\" in foreign countries; trends in wildlife poaching and other cross-border criminal activity in the region; religious freedom in Africa; and the effectiveness of U.N. peacekeeping and responses to peacekeeper abuses. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 114-113) provided that funding appropriated for aid to CAR \"shall be made available for reconciliation and peacebuilding programs, including activities to promote inter-faith dialogue at the national and local levels, and for programs to prevent crimes against humanity.\" A similar provision is included in H.R. 5912 (Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2017), and similar provisions were enacted in prior foreign aid appropriations measures. The FY2016 Act also provided funding for assisting civilians in LRA-affected areas, such as southeastern CAR, as did prior aid appropriations measures. Other relevant legislation enacted in the 114th Congress includes the Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-231). The 113th Congress held several hearings on CAR in the House and Senate. The Obama Administration allocated an estimated $14 million in bilateral aid for CAR in FY2016 and requested $18 million for FY2017\u2014not including emergency humanitarian aid and other regionally- and centrally-managed funds, such as conflict-mitigation and LRA-related assistance. The Administration also allocated an estimated $287 million from FY2016 appropriations for U.S. assessed contributions to MINUSCA's budget. The United States is by far the largest bilateral humanitarian donor in CAR, with over $99 million in funding provided in FY2016."
