    "content": "Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 1995 - Amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to grant the President legislative line item veto rescission authority. Authorizes the President to rescind all or part of any budget authority, if the President determines that such rescission: (1) would help balance the Federal budget, reduce the Federal budget deficit, or reduce the public debt, (2) will not impair any essential Government functions. And (3) will not harm the national interest. Makes such a rescission effective unless the Congress, during a review period, enacts a rescission disapproval bill."
