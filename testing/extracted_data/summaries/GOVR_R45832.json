Energy management is integral to DOD operations. From running bases and training facilities to powering jets and ships, DOD relies on energy to maintain readiness and resiliency for mission operations. Energy efficiency\u00e2\u0080\u0094providing the same or an improved level of service with less energy\u00e2\u0080\u0094over time can reduce agency expenses, particularly at an agency like DOD, where energy represents roughly 2% of the department's annual budget. Since the 1970s, Congress mandated energy requirements for federal agencies. Legislation required reductions in fossil fuel consumption and increases in renewable energy use and efficiency targets for government fleets and buildings. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA, P.L. 95-619 ) requires federal agencies to report annually on energy management activities. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct05, P.L. 109-58 ) and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140 ) amended and addressed additional energy management targets for the federal government. As the largest energy consumer in the federal government, DOD drives total federal energy management goal achievements. The annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has included provisions related to DOD energy management and authorities. With one exception, the NDAA for FY2018 ( P.L. 115-91 ), each NDAA since 1993 contains a section on \"authorized energy conservation projects.\" Further, NDAAs have contributed to internal DOD energy management protocol. Throughout several administrations, Presidents have issued executive orders to establish energy management guidelines and targets for the federal government. The Trump Administration's Executive Order 13834, \"Efficient Federal Operations\" (E.O. 13834), directs the heads of agencies to maintain annual energy reductions and efficiency measures that reduce costs and meet statutory requirements for renewables, among other things, but does not set specific targets. DOD categorizes energy into two types\u00e2\u0080\u0094 installation energy and operational energy . DOD's installation energy (i.e., energy for fixed installations and non-tactical vehicles) is subject to federal energy management requirements. Although DOD energy use has trended downward since the 1970s, DOD has not met all federally mandated targets and reporting on progress has been challenging. DOD's operational energy (e.g., energy required for sustaining military forces and weapons platforms for military operations) is not subject to federal energy management requirements. This represents around 70% of total DOD energy use. Operational energy consists largely of petroleum products purchased on the open market by the Defense Logistics Agency. This leaves DOD and its spending susceptible to oil price volatility. Reviewing how these federal energy management goals impact DOD's mission could be an overarching consideration for Congress. Making operational equipment more fuel efficient could increase range and decrease refueling convoys; however, the challenge is maintaining combat readiness and mission operations. Congress may consider legislation addressing operational energy, such as setting a standard fuel efficiency target or a requirement for alternative fuel use. Congress may also consider continuing to leave operational energy efficiency goals to be determined by DOD or each military branch. In many cases, federal energy management goals in statute or executive order established targets for FY2015 (e.g., EISA petroleum and alternative fuel consumption targets were due no later than October 1, 2015). Several agencies, including DOD, did not reach the targeted goals. Congress may assess how and whether setting specific targets enhances the agency's mission and reduces costs for DOD. This approach may include addressing target dates or baselines. Congress may consider removing statutory targets altogether, and direct heads of federal agencies to establish protocols that foster efficiency and cost reductions that serve the mission of the agency. Managing an organization as large and complex as DOD presents certain challenges. One of the challenges DOD faces in meeting these targets is implementing appropriate financing mechanisms. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct92, P.L. 102-486 ) amended NECPA and authorized alternative financing methods for federal energy projects, including energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs) and utility energy service contracts (UESCs). ESPCs have become a preferred means of making energy efficiency improvements because, in part, funds do not have to be directly appropriated (or programmed). With $2.9 billion awarded in FY2017, these contracts can assist with increasing efficiency and meeting renewable energy management goals. Training and guidance for utilizing ESPCs and UESCs is provided to all federal agencies through the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP). However, challenges remain, particularly in data collection and consistent measurements. One option may be to increase training and awareness of UESCs and ESPCs."
