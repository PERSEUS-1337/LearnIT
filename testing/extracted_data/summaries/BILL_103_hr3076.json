    "content": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that the start-up or continued operation of any plutonium separation plant presents serious environmental hazards and increases the risk of nuclear proliferation and should be suspended until specified proliferation and environmental concerns have been resolved. Urges the President to: (1) convey such opinion to the Governments of the United Kingdom, France, Japan, and Russia. And (2) address the proliferation and environmental implications of the new Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (THORP) in the United Kingdom in high-level discussions with the Government of the United Kingdom before the conclusion of such Government's internal review of whether THORP will be allowed to start up."
