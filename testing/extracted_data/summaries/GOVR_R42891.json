    "content": "On January 20, 2013, President Barack Obama is to be sworn in for his second term. Because January 20 is on a Sunday, however, the ceremonial swearing-in and public inaugural ceremonies will take place on Monday, January 21, 2013. This report responds to a variety of questions relating to the presidential inauguration: legislation concerning the inauguration; inauguration day as a federal holiday; the major costs of the 2009 inauguration; the expenditures of recent inaugural festivities (private funding only provided); historical facts on past presidential inaugurations; the various inaugural committees supporting the inauguration; and historical information on the parade, the swearing-in, and other events."
