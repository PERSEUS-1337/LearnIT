And (2) expanding the work opportunity tax credit to include certain individuals who, on the day before before attaining age 18, received foster care maintenance payments under an approved State part E plan or were in foster care under the responsibility of the State. Provides for an increase in the amount of assets allowable for children in foster care under SSA title IV part E.
