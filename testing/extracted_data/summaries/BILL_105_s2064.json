And (2) the Secretary of Labor certifies to the Congress and such Secretaries that such country recognizes internationally recognized worker rights. Directs the Secretary of the Navy, after assessing the feasibility and advisability of breaking up naval vessels and Maritime Administration vessels in US shipyards, to carry out a demonstration program by competitively awarding a cost contract to each of two qualified US shipyards to break up a group of vessels consisting of any stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and any under the jurisdiction of the Maritime Administration."
