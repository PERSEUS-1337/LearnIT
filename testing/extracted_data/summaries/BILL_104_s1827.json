    "content": "Prohibits Federal payment for travel by a political appointee outside of the United States during a post presidential election period after which the incumbent President shall not return for another term of office as President. Provides that such prohibition shall not apply to travel by the Secretaries of State and Defense, the US Trade Representative, or political appointees who are accompanying these individuals on affected travel. Allows the President to waive such prohibition with regard to any travel that: (1) cannot reasonably be postponed until after the post presidential election period. And (2) is essential to protect or promote vital national interests. Establishes a similar prohibition against travel by a Member of Congress after 180 days before the end of the term of service or date of retirement of such Member. Authorizes the Speaker of the House or the President pro tempore of the Senate to waive such prohibition if such travel is determined to be in the interest of the House or Senate and the United States. Requires publication of a statement of the waiver in the Congressional Record, including a detailed description of the travel, its purpose, and estimated costs, unless the Speaker of the House or the President pro tempore of the Senate determines that publication would jeopardize national security or otherwise compromise vital national interests."
