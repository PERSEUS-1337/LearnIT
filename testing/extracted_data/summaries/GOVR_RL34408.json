    "content": "This report compares selected recommendations of the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors (PCCWW), often called the Dole-Shalala Commission in reference to its co-chairs, and the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission (VDBC). The VDBC was established in 2004 to study veterans' benefits in a broad context. The PCCWW was established in 2007 following reports of problems among injured servicemembers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with medical rehabilitation and access to benefits. The PCCWW was charged to focus specifically on the needs of these individuals. The recommendations presented in this report are those that relate to the transition of injured servicemembers from military service to civilian life and/or veteran status. This report does not examine certain other recommendations, such as those in the VDBC report regarding benefits for survivors of deceased servicemembers, or regarding evaluation of presumptive disability, i.e., establishing service connection for certain long-term health effects of hazardous exposures. As this report is limited to a comparison of the final recommendations of the PCCWW and the VDBC, it will not be updated."
