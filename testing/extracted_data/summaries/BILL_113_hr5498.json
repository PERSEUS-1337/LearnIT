    "content": "Primary Care Physician Reentry Act - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a demonstration program to facilitate physician reentry into primary care clinical practice in exchange for the physician providing primary care at an eligible health center for at least two years. Requires the Secretary to award one grant to an entity in each of the 10 administrative regions of HHS to carry out physician reentry projects. Directs grantees to assist reentering physicians by providing training, paying credentialing and other necessary fees, paying salaries, and providing loan repayment and other financial assistance. Requires the Secretary to: (1) assess the need for additional primary care physicians, (2) develop a directory of programs that help physicians reenter clinical practice, (3) disseminate evaluation tools to measure the core competencies of physicians reentering clinical practice, and (4) assist regulatory and credentialing authorities to structure requirements for reentering physicians that ensure patient safety while addressing the burdens on those physicians. Limits civil liability for physicians participating in a reentry project."
