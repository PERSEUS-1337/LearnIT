    "content": "Since its inception, Congress has used commemorative legislation to express public gratitude for distinguished contributions; dramatize the virtues of individuals, groups, and causes; and perpetuate the remembrance of significant events. During the past two centuries, commemoratives have become an integral part of the American political tradition. They have been used to authorize the minting of commemorative coins and Congressional Gold Medals; fund monuments and memorials; create federal holidays; establish commissions to celebrate important anniversaries; and name public works, scholarships, endowments, fellowships, and historic sites. Current congressional practice for commemoratives includes a House Rule (Rule XII, clause 5, initially adopted during the 104th Congress [1995-1996]) that precludes the introduction or consideration of legislation that commemorates a \"remembrance, celebration, or recognition for any purpose through the designation of a specified period of time.\" Such a rule does not exist in the Senate. This House Rule, together with the passage of more restrictive laws, rules, and procedures governing the enactment of several other types of commemoratives, has substantially reduced the time Congress spends considering and adopting such measures. This report summarizes the evolution of commemorative legislation as well as the laws, rules, and procedures that have been adopted to control the types of commemoratives considered and enacted. Included in the discussion of commemorative options for Congress are those that require legislation, such as naming federal buildings, including post offices and other federal structures; postage stamps; commemorative coins; Congressional Gold Medals; monuments and memorials, both in the District of Columbia and elsewhere; commemorative commissions; commemorative observances; federal holidays; and requesting presidential proclamations. Also included are commemorative options that do not require legislation. These include certificates of recognition; floor speeches; and flags flown over the U.S. Capitol."
