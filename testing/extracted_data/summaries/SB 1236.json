    "title": "An act to\namend Section 34450 of\nadd and repeal Sections 34096 and 36516.7 of\nthe Government Code,\nand to add and repeal Section 1100.8 of the Public Contract Code,\nrelating to local government.",
    "content": "Existing law The California Constitution authorizes any city or city and county to enact, amend, or repeal a charter for its own government, as specified. A charter adopted pursuant to these provisions supersedes general laws of the state in regard to a municipal affair, and a city charter may specify various matters including, but not limited to, compensation of city employees. This bill would, until January 1, 2028, require a city that is incorporated to promote commerce and industry, is located wholly within the County of Los Angeles, and had no residentially zoned land within its boundaries as of January 1, 1992, to conduct audits pursuant to a specified procedure and provide annual disclosures of property owned by the city, as specified. By increasing the duties of local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would, until January 1, 2028, additionally prohibit a city meeting this description from permitting more than 5 of any cityowned housing to be occupied by a city employee or officer, or person who contracts with the city, or their family. The bill would provide that until January 1, 2028, the compensation for service on the city council of a city meeting this description may not exceed $1,000 per month. Existing law states that the Public Contract Code is the basis of all contracts between most public entities and their contractors and subcontractors. Existing law further states that, with regard to charter cities, the code applies unless there is an express exemption or a charter city ordinance or regulation that is in direct conflict with the code. This bill would provide that until January 1, 2028, the Public Contract Code applies to a city that is incorporated to promote commerce and industry, is located wholly within the County of Los Angeles, and had no residentially zoned land within its boundaries as of January 1, 1992, as specified. This bill would declare that its provisions are a matter of statewide concern, and not a municipal affair. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for a city that is incorporated to promote commerce and industry, is located wholly within the County of Los Angeles, and had no residentially zoned land within its boundaries as of January 1, 1992. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions. This bill would make a nonsubstantive change to this provision."
