    "content": "Section 102(b) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) requires the President to impose sanctions on any country that he has determined is a \"non-nuclear-weapon state\" andhas received or detonated a \"nuclear explosive device.\" Sanctions include prohibitions onforeign assistance; munitions sales and licenses; foreign military financing; governmentcredits, guarantees, and financial assistance; U.S. support for multilateral financialassistance; private bank lending to the affected government; and exports of certain specificcontrolled goods and technology. Specific exceptions exist for humanitarian aid; food andagricultural exports; food assistance; private bank loans and credits for purchases of food andagricultural commodities; and certain transactions involving intelligence activities. Thestatute does not provide for terminating or suspending sanctions once imposed. ThePresident placed \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 102(b) sanctions on India and Pakistan in May 1998 following nucleartests by those countries earlier that month. The statute had never before been invoked andits full implementation give rise to various legal and policy issues. After an inter-agencyreview, the Administration announced its overall implementation plan for both countriesJune 18, 1998. Concerns over the lack of an exemption for agricultural goods in \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd102(b)(2)'s prohibition on government credits and guarantees led to enactment of theAgriculture Export Relief Act ( P.L. 105-194 ), which exempted Department of Agricultureprograms through FY99; it also permanently exempted government financing for medicineand medical goods and allowed private loans for fertilizer exports. In October 1998,Congress authorized the President to waive for one year certain \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 102(b)(2) prohibitionsapplicable to the two countries, as well as other related statutory restrictions (India-PakistanRelief Act, P.L. 105-277 ). The President exercised this authority December 1, 1998. Congress has since authorized the President to waive indefinitely, as they apply to India and Pakistan, all sanctions imposed under \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 101 or 102 of the AECA; a nuclear-relatedrestriction in the Export-Import Bank Act; and \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 620E(e) of the Foreign Assistance Act(FAA)(Pressler Amendment), which restricts military aid and exports to Pakistan (DODAppropriations Act, 2000, P.L. 106-79 , \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 9001). The President may waive military andexport control sanctions only if he certifies to Congress that applying a restriction would notbe in U.S. national security interests; any licenses for defense exports must be notified toCongress and are subject to congressional review. In October 1999, President Clintonwaived sanctions with regard to certain programs and commercial transactions specific toeach country. In August and early September 2001, both the Bush Administration andMembers of Congress began to call for removal of the sanctions, mainly as applicable toIndia; legislation to lift the measures has also been introduced. Following the September 11attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the President waived for both India andPakistan prohibitions on exports of defense items and sensitive technology and militaryfinancing, citing U.S. national security interests; also waived were any remaining sanctionsin \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 101 or 102 of the AECA, the Export-Import Bank Act, and the Pressler Amendment. Foreign assistance to Pakistan continues to be restricted because of an anti-coup provisionin appropriations legislation and other debt-related restrictions; also, three Pakistani entitiesare subject to two-year AECA missile proliferation sanctions. Legislation allowing removalof restrictions on Pakistan ( S. 1465 ) was reported by the Senate ForeignRelations Committee October 4. This report will be updated."
