    "content": "Trade Enforcement and Trade Deficit Reduction Act This bill requires the Office of the US Trade Representative to withdraw tariff concessions granted to a foreign country if the Department of Commerce determines that such country has not reduced or eliminated a tariff or nontariff barrier on US exports in accordance with a trade agreement. Commerce must: (1) initiate an investigation if it receives a petition alleging that a foreign country has not complied with the tariff provisions of a trade agreement, and (2) identify each country whose imports of goods and services to the United States exceed twice the value of US exports to that country over a six month period. The US Customs and Border Protection must bar the importation of products from such a country unless a waiver is granted for such products to a US manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler."
