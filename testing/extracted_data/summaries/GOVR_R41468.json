    "content": "The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has as its purpose providing \"a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\" In order to effectuate this purpose, the ADA and its regulations require reasonable accommodation or modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when such modifications are necessary to render the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations accessible to individuals with disabilities. The reasonable accommodation or modification requirement has been interpreted to allow the use of service animals, even in places where animals are generally not permitted. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has promulgated regulations containing specific details about service animals, and this report focuses on these regulatory requirements. Generally, a public entity (ADA title II) or a place of public accommodation (ADA title III) must modify its policies, practices, and procedures to allow an individual with a disability to use a service animal. The regulations also define service animals. A service animal is \"any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability.\" (emphasis added). However, despite the regulatory limitation of the definition to dogs, miniature horses may be allowed in certain circumstances. A service animal does not need to be allowed when the animal is out of control or the animal is not housebroken. In addition, a public entity or place of public accommodation may not ask about the nature or extent of an individual's disability but may ask two questions to determine if the animal is a service animal when it is not readily apparent. These questions are, if the animal is required because of a disability, and what work or task the animal is trained to do. Several issues remain unresolved by the DOJ regulations. For example, the relationship between the ADA and Fair Housing Act in some situations is unclear. In addition, there is considerable ambiguity concerning how potentially conflicting claims for accommodations relating to service animals should be addressed."
