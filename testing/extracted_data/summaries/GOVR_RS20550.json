    "content": "Military uniforms are procured through the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), an agency of the Department of Defense (DOD). DLA is DOD's largest combat support agency, providing worldwide logistics support for the United States military services, civilian agencies, and foreign countries. With headquarters in Fort Belvoir, VA, DLA operates three supply centers: DLA Aviation, DLA Land and Maritime, and DLA Troop Support. Military uniforms are procured through DLA Troop Support in Philadelphia, PA. DLA Troop Support is responsible for procuring nearly all of the food, clothing, and medical supplies used by the military, including about 90% of the construction material used by troops in the field, and repair parts for aircraft, combat vehicles, and other weapons system platforms. According to DLA Troop Support's website, \"Each year, DLA Troop Support supplies and manages over $13.4 billion worth of food, clothing and textiles, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and construction and equipment supplies in support of America's warfighters worldwide and their eligible dependents.\" Within DLA Troop Support, the Clothing and Textile (C&T) Directorate supplies more than 8,000 different items ranging from uniforms to footwear and equipment. According to DLA Troop Support, in FY2012, C&T sales of clothing, textiles, and equipment to military personnel worldwide surpassed $1.9 billion. Legislative initiatives that affect the procurement of military uniforms were enacted in several bills, among them: Section 822 of P.L. 112-81, the NDAA for FY2012; Section 821 of P.L. 111-383, the Ike Skelton NDAA for FY2011; and Section 352 of P.L. 111-84, the NDAA for FY2010. Section 352 of P.L. 113-66 requires all military services to use a joint combat camouflage uniform, while Section 839 of H.R. 1960, the proposed House-version of the NDAA for FY2014, would have, if enacted, required that the initial military footwear issued to enlisted military personnel conform to the provisions of the Berry Amendment, 10 U.S.C. 2533a."
