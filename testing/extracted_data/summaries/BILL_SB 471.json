    "title": "SB 471",
    "content": "The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases. Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the State Air Resources Board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of a market-based compliance mechanism relative to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, commonly known as cap and trade revenues, to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for specified purposes, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions associated with water use and supply. This bill would include reduction of greenhouse gas emissions associated with water treatment among the investments that are eligible for funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The bill would also make legislative findings and declarations, and a statement of legislative intent, with regard to the nexus between water and energy and water and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This bill would require the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, in cooperation with the State Water Resources Control Board, the State Air Resources Board, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Department of Water Resources Resources, to conduct a study of water-related energy use in California. This bill would require the State Water Resources Control Board, upon an appropriation from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and in cooperation with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, the State Air Resources Board, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Department of Water Resources Resources, to establish a grant and loan program for water projects that result in the net reduction of water-related greenhouse gas emissions."
