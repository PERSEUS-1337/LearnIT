    "content": "Since FY2006, the United States government has provided more than $200 billion for programs providing security assistance and security cooperation to foreign countries. The Departments of State (DOS) and Defense (DOD) are the primary U.S. government agencies involved in providing security sector assistance and related support to foreign governments, militaries, and international organizations and groups. Congress has authorized security assistance programs through the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA, P.L. 87-195) and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (AECA, P.L. 90-629), as amended. Assistance provisions, including those for security assistance, in the FAA and the AECA have since been codified in Title 22 of the U.S. Code, and funds for security assistance are regularly appropriated through DOS accounts. Beginning in the 1980s, Congress also provided DOD with authority to conduct security cooperation programs under Title 10 of the U.S. Code and annual National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAAs), as well as funding through defense appropriations. Cooperation between the two agencies to provide security sector assistance depends on statutory authority, applicable executive directives, and other established policy arrangements. With the 115th Congress considering legislation designed to fund and improve U.S. security assistance and security cooperation programs, this report provides funding data, top country recipients, and major funding accounts for Title 22 security assistance programs and major Title 10 and NDAA security cooperation authorities and programs. It may be updated as information and funding data are available. For further background on U.S. security assistance and cooperation policies, see CRS Report R44444, Security Assistance and Cooperation: Shared Responsibility of the Departments of State and Defense; CRS Report R44602, DOD Security Cooperation: An Overview of Authorities and Issues; CRS Report R44313, What Is \"Building Partner Capacity?\" Issues for Congress; and CRS In Focus IF10582, Security Cooperation Issues: FY2017 NDAA Outcomes."
