Denies such a credit for any expense for which a deduction or credit is allowable under another Code provision. Defines qualified adoption expenses as reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney's fees, and other lawful expenses directly related to legal adoption of a child, but not any expenses paid from any funds received under a Federal, State, or local program.
