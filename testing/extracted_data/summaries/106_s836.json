And (2) may treat the ordering by such specialist of additional obstetrical and gynecological care as authorization by the primary care provider. Prohibits a plan or issuer from taking specified actions to limit membership or reduce access to or use of obstetrics and gynecological services. Amends the Public Service Act, as amended by the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999 , the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code to require compliance with such obstetrics and gynecological access provisions."
