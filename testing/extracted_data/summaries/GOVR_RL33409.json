    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides benefits to veterans who meet certain eligibility rules. Benefits to veterans range from disability compensation and pensions to hospital and medical care. VA provides these benefits to veterans through three major operating units: the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA). VHA is primarily a direct service provider of primary care, specialized care, and related medical and social support services to veterans through an integrated health care system. The President's FY2007 budget proposal to Congress requested $32.7 billion for VHA, an 11.3% increase over the FY2006 enacted amount of $29.3 billion, and a 10% increase over the FY2005 enacted amount of $29.7 billion. As in previous budget proposals, the President's FY2007 budget request also includes a set of legislative proposals. The Administration is requesting authorization from Congress to assess an annual enrollment fee of $250 for all Priority 7 and 8 veterans, increase veterans' share of pharmaceutical copayments from $8 to $15 (for each 30-day prescription) for all enrolled veterans in Priority Groups 7 and 8, and bill veterans receiving treatment for nonservice-connected conditions for the entire copayment amount. On May 19, 2006, the House passed the Military Construction, Military Quality of Life, and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for FY2007 (H.R. 5385, H.Rept. 109-464). H.R. 5385 provides $32.7 billion for VHA for FY2007, an 11.4% increase over the FY2006 enacted amount. On November 14, the Senate passed its version of H.R. 5385 (S.Rept. 109-286). H.R. 5385, as amended by the Senate, provided $32.7 billion for VHA, about the same as the House-passed amount and the President's request. Neither version of H.R. 5385 included any provisions that would have given VA the authority to implement fee increases as requested by the President's FY2007 budget proposal. The 109th Congress did not enact H.R. 5385 and funded most federal government agencies through a series of Continuing Resolutions. The 110th Congress passed the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007 (H.J.Res. 20, P.L. 110-5) providing funding for the VHA for the rest of FY2007. P.L. 110-5 provides $32.7 billion for the VHA for FY2007, a $14.7 million increase over the President's request and $3.3 billion above the FY2006 enacted amount. This report will not be updated."
