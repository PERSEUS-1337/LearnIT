(2) informing of individuals who may have been exposed to HIV by the public health officer of the State. (3) mandatory HIV testing of alleged rapists for which victims and their attorneys are notified of the results, with appropriate follow up tests upon the request of the victim. (4) subjection to mandatory HIV testing of prospective patients who are to undergo a medical procedure that would place the health professionals involved at risk of becoming infected with HIV, with the health professionals notified of the results. (5) affording applicants for health insurance who are required by the health insurance issuer to undergo HIV testing as a condition of issuance the opportunity to be informed by the issuer, upon request, of the applicant's HIV status. And (6) affording prospective adoptive parents the opportunity to be informed by the adoption agency, upon request, of the HIV status of the child which they wish to adopt. Expresses the sense of the Congress that with respect to health professionals with HIV disease: (1) the health professionals should notify their patients that they have the disease in medical circumstances that place the patients at risk of being infected with HIV by the health professionals. And (2) the States should encourage the medical profession to develop guidelines to assist the health professionals in so notifying patients. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) States should have in effect laws providing that, in the case of an individual who knows that he or she has HIV disease, it is a felony for the individual to infect another with HIV if the individual engages in the behaviors involved with the intent of so infecting the other individual. And (2) strict confidentiality should be maintained in carrying out the requirements of this Act."
