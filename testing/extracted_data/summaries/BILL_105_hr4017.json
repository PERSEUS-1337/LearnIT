Requires the Secretary, upon the request of a fleet or covered person receiving a credit allocation, to treat that purchase as the acquisition of one alternative fueled vehicle which the fleet or covered person is required to acquire by such Act. Requires the head of each Federal agency to report annually to the Congress on compliance with the alternative fuel purchasing requirements for Federal fleets, including a plan with specific dates for achieving compliance. Requires public dissemination of such reports in the Federal Register and on the Internet."
