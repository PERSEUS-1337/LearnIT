Requires such coins to be considered legal tender and numismatic items. Permits Treasury to issue such coins only during the one-year period beginning January 1 of the issuance year, except that sales may be initiated, without issuance, before such date. Requires specified surcharges that Treasury receives from the sale of such coins to be paid to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. Directs Treasury to ensure that: (1) the minting and issuing of such coins will not result in any net cost to the US government. And (2) no funds, including applicable surcharges, are disbursed to the Museum until the total cost of designing and issuing all such coins is recovered by the Treasury."
