    "content": "Early Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Act of 2001 - Amends the Head Start Act (HSA) and the Child Nutrition Act (CNA) to require lead poisoning screening for infants and children under Early Head Start programs of HSA and under the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (WIC) of CNA. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to reimburse State agencies for the costs of such blood lead screening tests performed by them or by contractors for infants or children who are eligible under Medicaid or the State children's health insurance program (SCHIP) of the Social Security Act. Authorizes State agencies or contractors administering WIC programs, and entities operating Early Head Start programs, to be awarded waivers of requirements under this Act if: (1) they establish plans to increase the number of blood lead screening tests of infants and children enrolled in such programs. And (2) such plans meet requirements set by the Secretary and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
