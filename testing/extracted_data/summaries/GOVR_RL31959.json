    "content": "Congress last enacted a broad foreign assistance authorization act in 1985. In the absence of omnibus foreign aid measures, the majority of foreign assistance legislation has been enacted as partof annual Foreign Operations appropriation measures. Division B of S. 2144 --Foreign Assistance Authorization for FY2005 -- is an effort to \"reinforce\" the Senate ForeignRelations Committee's role in foreign aid policy making. It is not an attempt to comprehensivelyreview and re-write existing foreign aid legislation, but rather it is a first step in providing necessaryauthorization for program appropriations in FY2005 and updating selected legislative provisions toreflect current policy. Committee Chairman Lugar said that it was his intent to launch a moreambitious effort later that would revamp the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and other long-standingforeign aid laws. The Committee reported and the Senate debated similar legislation last year -- S. 1161 , later merged into S. 925 -- authorizing foreign aid programs forFY2004. The bill remains pending in the Senate, but is unlikely to receive further consideration. Division B of S. 2144 is divided into five titles. Title XXI includes FY2005 authorizations of appropriations. Title XXII updates and amends several existing foreign aidauthorities, some of which have been annually extended in appropriation acts. Title XXIII is theRadiological Terrorism Security Act of 2004. Title XXIV is the Global Pathogen Surveillance Actof 2004. Title XXV consists of several provisions, some of which address Africa and Latin Americaissues, including additional aid for Haiti. The legislation authorizes the appropriation of about $16.9 billion for 22 foreign assistance programs, closely matching the account structure of the annual Foreign Operations appropriationsfor bilateral economic and military aid. The amounts authorized are nearly identical to levelsrequested by the Administration for FY2005, although the bill would increase spending forHIV/AIDS, development aid, assistance to the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, andnonproliferation programs, while reducing amounts for the Millennium Challenge Account. S. 2144 addresses the threat posed by terrorist use of radiological dispersal devices, or RDDs. The bill requires the Secretary of State to prepare and submit to Congress reportsassessing the threat of a radiological attack on U.S. missions. The bill further authorizes theSecretary to aid foreign countries, or propose that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)develop programs, helping foreign first responders identify and address threats posed by radioactivematerials. The legislation also includes the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act, authorizing $35 million for FY2005 to enhance the capability of developing nations to detect, identify, and contain infectiousdisease outbreaks, whether naturally occurring or the result of a bioterrorist attack. The measureincludes several provisions that are intended to support and strengthen the disease surveillancecapabilities of developing nations. Additionally, it would permit the expansion of Centers forDisease Control and Prevention facilities overseas to further the goals of global disease monitoring.This report will be updated as Congress considers the legislation.
