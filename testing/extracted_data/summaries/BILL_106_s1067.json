    "content": "Adoption Equality Act of 1999 - Amends title IV part E of the Social Security Act (SSA) to revise adoption assistance eligibility guidelines for children with special needs. Makes eligible for such assistance only children with special needs who before termination of parental rights and the initiation of adoption proceedings were: (1) in the care of a public or licensed private child care agency or Indian tribal organization, either pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement or as a result of a judicial determination to the effect that continuation in the home would be contrary to the child's safety and welfare. Or (2) residing in a foster family home or child care institution with the child's minor parent. Requires a State to consider such special needs, together with the circumstances of the adopting parents, in determining the amount of Federal adoption subsidies paid to them. Prohibits assistance with respect to any child who is not a US citizen or resident and who was adopted outside the United States or was brought into it for adoption purposes. Revises the criteria for determining a child with special needs to: (1) specify that State criteria for determining that a child cannot or should not be returned to the home of his parents need not include a judicial determination. And (2) allow, in the alternative, that the child meets all medical or disability requirements for benefits under SSA title XVI ."
