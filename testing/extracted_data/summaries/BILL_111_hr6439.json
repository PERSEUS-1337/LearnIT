    "content": "Targeted Tax Lien Act of 2010 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to require the Secretary of the Treasury to determine, prior to filing a notice of tax lien for unpaid taxes, that: (1) the lien attaches to distrainable property. (2) the benefit to the government of filing such lien outweighs the harm to the taxpayer. And (3) the filing of such lien will not jeopardize the taxpayer's prospective ability to comply with tax laws or an otherwise viable business taxpayer's prospective ability to secure funding to maintain business operations. Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to limit the period in which certain released or erroneously filed federal tax liens may be reported on a consumer 's credit report."
