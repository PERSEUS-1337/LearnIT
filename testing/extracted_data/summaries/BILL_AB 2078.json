    "title": "AB 2078",
    "content": "Existing law generally punishes the willful disobedience of the terms of a court order as contempt of court by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding 6 months, a fine not exceeding $1,000, or both that imprisonment and fine. Existing law makes the willful and knowing violation of specified protective orders or stay-away court orders punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by both that imprisonment and fine for a first offense, and makes a 2nd or subsequent conviction for a violation of these specified protective orders or stay-away court orders occurring within 7 years of a prior conviction and involving an act of violence or credible threat of violence punishable as either a misdemeanor or a felony. If probation is granted upon conviction of a willful and knowing violation of these specified protective orders or stay-away court orders, existing law requires the court to impose a minimum period of probation of 36 months, a criminal protective order protecting the victim from further acts of violence, threats, stalking, sexual abuse, and harassment, a minimum fine of $500, successful completion of a batterer\u2019s program, and a specified amount of appropriate community service, among other requirements. Under existing law, any person who willfully inflicts corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition upon a spouse or former spouse, cohabitant or former cohabitant, fianc\u00e9 or fianc\u00e9e, or someone with whom the offender has, or previously had, an engagement or dating relationship, or the mother or father of the offender\u2019s child, is guilty of a felony or a misdemeanor. Upon a conviction, existing law allows the sentencing court to issue an order restraining the defendant from any contact with the victim for up to 10 years. This bill would make a violation of the above protective order issued for the conviction of inflicting a corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by a fine not exceeding $1,000, or by both that imprisonment and fine. The bill would make a 2nd or subsequent violation occurring within 7 years involving an act of violence or a credible threat of violence punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor. If probation is granted for a violation of these protective orders, this bill would require the court to impose a minimum period of probation of 36 months, a criminal protective order protecting the victim from further acts of violence, threats, stalking, sexual abuse, and harassment, a minimum fine of $500, successful completion of a batterer\u2019s program, and a specified amount of appropriate community service, among other requirements. By increasing the punishment for a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
