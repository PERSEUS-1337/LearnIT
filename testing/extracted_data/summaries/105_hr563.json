    "title": "To establish a toll free number in the Department of Commerce to assist consumers in determining if products are American-made.",
    "content": "Directs the Secretary of Commerce, if the Secretary determines that there is sufficient manufacturer interest and that manufacturers will provide fees so the program will operate without Federal Government cost, to establish a toll-free number pilot program solely to help inform consumers whether a product with a retail value of at least $250 is made in America. Requires the Secretary to contract for the establishment and operation of such pilot program. Requires consumers to be informed that registration does not mean that: (1) the product is endorsed or approved by the Government. (2) the Secretary has conducted any investigation to confirm that the product meets the definition of this Act of American made. Or (3) the product contains 100 percent US content. Directs the Secretary to propose regulations to: (1) establish a voluntary product registration procedure, (2) establish and collect a fee to cover registration costs, (3) establish the pilot program. And (4) assess manufacturer interest in the program. Imposes civil monetary penalties for knowingly registering a product that is not American made."
