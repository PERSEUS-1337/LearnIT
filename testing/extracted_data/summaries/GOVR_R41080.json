    "content": "The National Commission on Children and Disasters (the Commission) is authorized under the provisions of the Kids in Disasters Well-being, Safety, and Health Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-161) and given federal advisory committee statutory authority under the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act of 2009 (P.L. 110-329). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), provides financial and administrative support to the Commission, whose purpose is to assess the needs of children in the preparation for, response to, and recovery from natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters. Congress authorized appropriations of $1.5 million for each of FY2008 and FY2009 for the Commission to conduct a comprehensive study to examine and assess the needs of children as they relate to preparation for, response to, and recovery from all hazards including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters. After evaluating existing research and recommendations, the Commission is directed to submit a report to the President and Congress on its findings, conclusions, and recommendations to address the identified gaps pertaining to the needs of children in disasters. The Interim Report of the Commission was provided to the President and Congress on October 14, 2009, and the Final Report is projected to be completed by October 2010. The 111th Congress is currently considering amending the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) to enhance disaster response, recovery, preparedness and mitigation capabilities (H.R. 3377). Congress is also considering legislation that would establish provisions for education, child care, emergency planning, and health care guidance to address the safety of children after a disaster (S. 2898). Issues Congress may wish to consider include expanding proposed legislation or introducing new legislation to amend the Stafford Act, or amending the Homeland Security Act, to include recommendations of the Commission. Additional issues Congress may wish to consider include what administrative options are available to implement the Commission recommendations and where there may be a need for congressional action."
