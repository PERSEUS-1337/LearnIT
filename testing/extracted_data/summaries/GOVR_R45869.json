    "content": "This report offers an overview of actions taken by Congress and the President to provide FY2019 appropriations for accounts funded by the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (LHHS) appropriations bill. This bill includes all accounts funded through the annual appropriations process at the Department of Labor (DOL) and Department of Education (ED). It also provides annual appropriations for most agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with certain exceptions (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration is funded via the Agriculture bill). Finally, the LHHS bill provides funds for more than a dozen related agencies, including the Social Security Administration (SSA). FY2019 Supplemental Appropriations for the Southern Border : During the 116 th Congress, on July 1, 2019, the President signed into law P.L. 116-26 , a supplemental appropriations act for FY2019 focusing primarily on the provision of humanitarian assistance and security at the southern border. The bill was passed by the House on June 27 and by the Senate on June 26. (An earlier version of the bill had passed the House on June 25. A related bill, S. 1900 , had passed the Senate on June 19; this bill was substantially similar to the final version of P.L. 116-26 .) As enacted, the bill contained nearly $2.9 billion in emergency-designated LHHS appropriations for the Refugee and Entrant Assistance account at HHS. The FY2019 enacted levels presented throughout this report are based on amounts provided by the FY2019 LHHS omnibus ( P.L. 115-245 , see below) and do not include these supplemental funds, which were provided in addition to the annual appropriations. FY2019 Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief : During the 116 th Congress, on June 6, 2019, the President signed into law P.L. 116-20 , a supplemental appropriations act for FY2019 focusing primarily on certain expenses arising from hurricanes, typhoons, wildfires, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, and other natural disasters or emergencies. The bill was passed by the House on June 3 and by the Senate on May 23. (An earlier version of the bill had passed the House on May 10.) As enacted, the bill included roughly $611 million in emergency-designated LHHS appropriations for accounts at DOL, HHS, and ED. The FY2019 enacted levels presented throughout this report are based on amounts provided by the FY2019 LHHS omnibus ( P.L. 115-245 ) and do not include these supplemental funds, which were provided in addition to the annual appropriations. FY201 9 LHHS Omnibus: During the 115 th Congress, on September 28, 2018, the President signed into law the Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019 and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 ( H.R. 6157 , P.L. 115-245 ). This law contained full-year LHHS appropriations in Division B. This is the first occasion since the FY1997 appropriations cycle that full-year LHHS appropriations were enacted on or before the start of the fiscal year (October 1). The FY2019 LHHS omnibus contained discretionary appropriations totaling $189.4 billion. This amount is 1.5% more than FY2018 enacted levels and 8.9% more than the FY2019 President's budget request. The omnibus also provided $869.8 billion in mandatory funding, for a combined LHHS total of $1.059 trillion. The distribution of discretionary funding was as follows: DOL: $12.1 billion, 0.8% less than FY2018. HHS: $90.5 billion, 2.6% more than FY2018. ED: $71.4 billion, 0.8% more than FY2018. Related Agencies: $15.3 billion, 0.1% more than FY2018. FY2019 LHHS Senate Action: The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of the FY2018 LHHS appropriations bill on June 28, 2018, by a vote of 30-1 ( S. 3158 ). Instead of taking up the committee-reported vehicle, the Senate chose to take up a different appropriations vehicle ( H.R. 6157 ) and amend it to contain FY2019 LHHS appropriations as well. (Those LHHS appropriations, which were added as Division B of H.R. 6157 , were substantially the same as S. 3158 .) During floor consideration of H.R. 6157 , the Senate also adopted 31 amendments to the new LHHS division of the bill (see Appendix B for a summary of these amendments). The Senate passed an amended H.R. 6157 by a vote of 85-7 on August 23, 2018. The Senate-passed bill would have provided $189.4 billion in discretionary LHHS funds. This would have been 1.5% more than FY2018, and 8.9% more than the FY2019 President's request. In addition, the Senate-passed bill would have provided an estimated $869.8 billion in mandatory funding, for a combined total of $1.059 trillion for LHHS as a whole. The distribution of discretionary funding would have been as follows: DOL: $12.1 billion, 0.8% less than FY2018. HHS: $90.5 billion, 2.7% more than FY2018. ED: $71.4 billion, 0.8% more than FY2018. Related Agencies: $15.4 billion, 0.5% more than FY2018. FY2019 LHHS House Action: The House Appropriations Committee's version of the FY2019 LHHS appropriations bill was ordered reported by the full committee on July 11, 2018, by a vote of 30-22, and reported to the House on July 23 ( H.R. 6470 ). This bill would have provided $187.2 billion in discretionary LHHS funds, a 0.3% increase from FY2018 enacted levels. This amount would have been 7.6% more than the FY2019 President's request. In addition, the House committee bill would have provided an estimated $869.8 billion in mandatory funding, for a combined total of $1.057 trillion for LHHS as a whole. The distribution of discretionary funding would have been as follows: DOL: $11.9 billion, 2.4% less than FY2018. HHS: $89.3 billion, 1.3% more than FY2018. ED: $71.0 billion, 0.2% more than FY2018. Related Agencies: $15.0 billion, 2.2% less than FY2018. The House committee-reported version of the LHHS bill did not receive floor consideration. FY2019 President's Budget Request: On February 12, 2018, the Trump Administration released the FY2019 President's budget. The President requested $173.9 billion in discretionary funding for accounts funded by the LHHS bill, which would have been a decrease of 6.8% from FY2018 levels. In addition, the President requested $869.8 billion in annually appropriated mandatory funding, for a total of $1.044 trillion for LHHS as a whole. The distribution of discretionary funding was as follows: DOL: $10.9 billion, 11.1% less than FY2018. HHS: $86.7 billion, 1.6% less than FY2018. ED: $63.2 billion, 10.8% less than FY2018. Related Agencies: $13.2 billion, 14.0% less than FY2018."
