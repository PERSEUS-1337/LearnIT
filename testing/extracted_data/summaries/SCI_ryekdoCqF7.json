    "content": "Generative neural networks map a standard, possibly distribution to a complex high-dimensional distribution, which represents the real world data set. However, a determinate input distribution as well as a specific architecture of neural networks may impose limitations on capturing the diversity in the high dimensional target space. To resolve this difficulty, we propose a training framework that greedily produce a series of generative adversarial networks that incrementally capture the diversity of the target space. We show theoretically and empirically that our training algorithm converges to the theoretically optimal distribution, the projection of the real distribution onto the convex hull of the network's distribution space. Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) BID5 is a framework of estimating generative models. The main idea BID4 is to train two target network models simultaneously, in which one, called the generator, aims to generate samples that resemble those from the data distribution, while the other, called the discriminator, aims to distinguish the samples by the generator from the real data. Naturally, this type of training framework admits a nice interpretation as a twoperson zero-sum game and interesting game theoretical properties, such as uniqueness of the optimal solution, have been derived BID5 . It is further proved that such adversarial process minimizes certain divergences, such as Shannon divergence, between the generated distribution and the data distribution.Simply put, the goal of training a GAN is to search for a distribution in the range of the generator that best approximates the data distribution. The range is often defined by the input latent variable z and its specific architecture, i.e., \u03a0 = {G(z, \u03b8), \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398}. When the range is general enough, one could possibly find the real data distribution. However, in practice, the range is usually insufficient to perfectly describe the real data, which is typically of high dimension. As a result, what we search for is in fact the I-projection BID2 of the real data distribution on \u03a0."
