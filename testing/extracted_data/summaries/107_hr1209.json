    "title": "To amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to determine whether an alien is a child, for purposes of classification as an immediate relative, based on the age of the alien on the date the classification petition with respect to the alien is filed, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "Child Status Protection Act - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide that the determination of whether an unmarried alien son or daughter of a US citizen is considered an immediate relative child shall be made at the time an immigration visa petition is filed for such classification on his or her behalf. Makes similar determinations in the case of: (1) permanent resident parents who subsequently naturalize after having filed family-sponsored immigration petitions for a son or daughter. Or (2) citizen parents who filed family-sponsored immigration petitions for a married son or daughter and such son or daughter later divorces . States that with respect to an unmarried son or daughter seeking status as family-sponsored, employment-based, or diversity child immigrant: (1) such an alien's age will be determined using the age of the alien on the date on which an immigrant visa becomes available reduced by the number of days in which the petition was pending. And (2) if the alien's age is determined to be 21 years or older the original priority date shall be retained. States that a son or daughter who was unmarried and under 21 years old when the parent applied for asylee or refugee status shall retain such child classification during the pendency of the asylee or refugee application. Provides that the family-sponsored petition of an unmarried alien son or daughter whose permanent resident alien parent subsequently becomes a naturalized US citizen shall be converted to a petition for an unmarried son or daughter of a US citizen, unless the son or daughter elects otherwise. States that any petition priority date assigned prior to such naturalization may be maintained regardless of whether or not the petition is converted. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit or deny specified benefits for alien children. States that the amendments made by this Act shall take effect upon enactment of this Act and shall apply to an alien beneficiary of: (1) an immigrant petition approved but not with a final determination prior to such date, (2) a petition pending on or after such date. Or (3) an application pending before the Department of Justice or Department of State on or after such date."
