    "content": "Military personnel issues typically generate significant interest from many Members of Congress and their staffs. Ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with the emerging operational role of the Reserve Components, further heighten interest in a wide range of military personnel policies and issues. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) has selected a number of the military personnel issues considered in deliberations on the House-passed and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2011. This report provides a brief synopsis of sections that pertain to personnel policy. The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011, H.R. 5136, was introduced in the House on April 26, 2010, reported by the House Committee on Armed Services on May 21, 2010 (H.Rept. 111-491), and passed by the House on May 28, 2010. The Senate version of the NDAA, S. 3454, was introduced in the Senate on June 4, 2010 and reported by the Senate Committee on Armed Services on June 4, 2010 (S.Rept. 111-201). However, S. 3454 was never passed by the Senate. Instead of a Conference Committee to resolve differences, a new bill (H.R. 6523) was introduced in the House of Representatives on December 15, 2010. It was passed by the House on December 17, 2010 and passed by the Senate on December 22, 2010. The bill, the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011, was signed by the President on January 7, 2010 and became P.L. 111-383. Where appropriate, related CRS products are identified to provide more detailed background information and analysis of the issue. For each issue, a CRS analyst is identified and contact information is provided. Some issues were addressed in the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act and discussed in CRS Report R40711, FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act: Selected Military Personnel Policy Issues, coordinated by [author name scrubbed]. Those issues that were previously considered in CRS Report R40711, FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act: Selected Military Personnel Policy Issues are designated with a \"*\" in the relevant section titles of this report. This report focuses exclusively on the annual defense authorization process. It does not include appropriations, veterans' affairs, tax implications of policy choices or any discussion of separately introduced legislation."
