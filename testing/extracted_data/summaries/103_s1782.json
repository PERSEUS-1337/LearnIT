(2) include among such required information a list of all statutes authorizing the agency to withhold information under such Act. (3) require reasonable efforts by the agency to provide records in an electronic format even when such records are not usually maintained in such format. (4) credit to agencies which have been found to be responsive to FOIA requests a percentage of the fees collected from such requests to offset compliance costs, at an agency's request. (5) provide for Government payment of the requester's out-of-pocket expenses in any case in which the agency has failed to comply with the FOIA request within prescribed time limits. (6) require an agency which violates such time limits to demonstrate that delay was warranted. (7) preclude treatment of routine agency backlogs as unusual circumstances warranting extension of time limits. (8) require denial notifications to specify the total number of denied records and pages considered in responding to the FOIA request. (9) mandate an agency first-in, first-out (FIFO) processing policy to determine the order in which requests are processed, allowing separate processing tracks for simple and complex requests, (10) mandate agency regulations governing FOIA requests for expedited access. (11) require deletions to be indicated on the released portion of the record where they were made. And (12) define record to include electronic information and search to include an automated examination to locate records."
