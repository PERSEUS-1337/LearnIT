    "content": "On October 21, 2009, the President signed into law, as P.L. 111-80, an Act making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, and for other purposes. This followed House and Senate agreement to the conference report. The law provides the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with a program level of $3.28 billion for FY2010, dividing that total authorized spending into $2.36 billion in direct appropriations (which FDA refers to as budget authority) and $922 million in user fees. The total, which includes $235 million in newly authorized user fees to support a new Center for Tobacco Products (and related activities of the agency-wide Office of Regulatory Affairs), is 22.9% higher than FY2009 appropriations for FDA. Excluding the new tobacco program, to provide a comparison of similar program responsibilities, FY2010 appropriations are 14.1% higher than FY2009 appropriations. Congress intends the increase to go toward enhanced food safety and medical product safety activities as well as cost-of-living personnel expenses. Neither the signed legislation nor any of the House- and Senate-considered bills include $141 million in proposed user fees that the Administration included in its request. The proposed fees were intended for generic drug review, food export certification, reinspection, and food inspection and facility registration. The versions of H.R. 2997 passed by the House and the Senate agreed on the appropriations to FDA. The conference agreement increased the appropriation to the human drugs program by $7 million. In its explanatory statement, the conference report includes directions and requests to FDA for studies and reports."
