Authorizes the US Fire Administrator to make grants to States, local governments, Indian tribal governments, other public entities, and multijurisdictional or regional consortia thereof to increase career firefighter presence and enhance their ability to save lives, property, and effectively respond to all types of emergencies. Limits such grants to three years and their use for programs to hire new, additional career firefighters. Requires grantees to commit to retaining such career firefighters for at least one year beyond the termination of their grants."
