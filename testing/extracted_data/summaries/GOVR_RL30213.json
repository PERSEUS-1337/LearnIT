The Act appropriates funds forthe District of Columbia, Division A of the act, and four other appropriation measures, Division Bof the act, including: Commerce, Justice, State, Judiciary; Foreign Operation Appropriations; InteriorAppropriations; and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations for FY2000.Division B of P.L. 106-113 , also includes a section governing Miscellaneous Appropriations, andprovisions amending the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, State Department authorization, milksupports, and intellectual properties. As originally forwarded to the conference committee, H.R. 3194 provided appropriations for FY2000 solely for the District of Columbia. TheHouse approved the conference measure on November 18, 1999, and the Senate approved themeasure on November 19, 1999. Division A of P.L. 106-113 is the third District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2000 considered by Congress. The Act includes $436 million in special federal payments to the Districtof Columbia. This is slightly higher than the amount included in the vetoed version of H.R. 3064 ($429 million) and H.R. 2587 ($430 million). The differenceis $6.7 million in federal funds for the environmental cleanup of the Lorton Correctional Facility. On November 3, 1999, President Clinton vetoed H.R. 3064 , which included funds for the District of Columbia and the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, andEducation for FY2000. On September 28, 1999, the President vetoed H.R. 2587 ,Congress' first attempt to appropriate funds for the District of Columbia for FY2000. Districtofficials urged the President to veto H.R. 2587 , because of the inclusion of several socalled \"social rider\" provisions. They characterized the provisions as assaults on the city's limitedhome rule. P.L. 106-113 includes many of the social riders contained in H.R. 2587 and H.R. 3064 . The Act includes provisions that prohibit: the use of federal or local funds to establish and maintain a needle exchange program, but would allow the private financing of needle exchange programs; the District from decriminalizing the use of marijuana and implementingInitiative 59 governing medical marijuana; the use of federal or District funds to finance a court challenge aimed atsecuring congressional voting representation in the House and Senate for District residents, but would allow the city's corporation counsel to review and comment on private lawsuits filed onbehalf of citizens of the District of Columbia; the use of federal or District funds for abortions except in cases or rape, incest,or the mother's health is endangered; and the implementation of a domestic partners act passed in 1992 that would extendhealth, employment, and other benefits and protections to unmarried, cohabiting, heterosexual orhomosexual couples.
