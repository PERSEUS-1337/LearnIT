    "content": "Correcting Unfair Benefits for Aliens Act of 2016 or the CUBA Act of 2016 This bill expresses the sense of Congress that Cuban nationals should be treated under the same immigration rules as nationals of other countries with which the United States has diplomatic relations and should not receive preferential treatment. The bill repeals P. L. 89-732, which provides for the adjustment of Cuban citizens or nationals to lawful permanent resident status in the United States. No funds, resources, or fees made available to the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, or to any other federal agency, including deposits into the Immigration Examinations Fee Account, may be used to implement or administer any of the policy changes set forth in the 2007 memorandum from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement entitled quot, Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program. quot. Cuban nationals who enter the United States on or after the date of enactment of this Act shall be ineligible for refugeeparolee assistance under the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980. Conforming amendments are made to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 and the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Inspector General of the Social Security Administration shall report to Congress describing methods for enforcing the loss of Supplemental Security Income eligibility by persons who are absent from the United States for at least one month."
