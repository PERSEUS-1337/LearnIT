    "content": "Many forests, especially the national forests, are widely thought to have unnaturallyhighamounts of dead and dying trees, dense undergrowth, and dense stands of small trees. This biomass can exacerbateinsect and diseaseinfestations and wildfire threats. Because much of this biomass has little or no commercial value, some haveproposed stewardshipcontracting to reduce these threats. Two approaches have been suggested: traditional service procurement contractsand contracts thatinclude exchanging goods (timber) for stewardship services. Congress authorized goods-for-services contractingthrough FY2013 byamending a previous pilot program in the FY2003 Omnibus Appropriations law. This report discusses theadvantages and limitationsof each of these approaches. It provides background on the issue and is unlikely to be updated."
