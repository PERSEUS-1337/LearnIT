Expresses the sense of Congress that, to the greatest extent possible, the coins should be struck at the US Mint at West Point, New York. Limits the period for coin issuance to the calendar year beginning on January 1, 2010. Imposes a $10 surcharge per coin, to be distributed to the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation for the purpose of establishing an endowment to support the construction of American Veterans' Disabled for Life Memorial in Washington, D. C. Prohibits a surcharge with respect to the issuance under this Act of any coin during a calendar year if, at the time of issuance, it would result in more than the statuory maximum of two commemorative coin programs per year."
