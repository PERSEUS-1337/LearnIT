    "content": "Cleaning Product Right to Know Act of 2016 This bill requires cleaning products to bear a label with, and requires manufacturers to include on their websites, a list of all of the product's ingredients in descending order of predominance by weight, except that ingredients that constitute less than 1 of the product can be listed at the end in any order. Product websites must include: (1) the CAS Registry Number of each ingredient, and (2) an explanation of each ingredient's purpose. A product that is not in conformity with the labeling and website listing requirements shall be treated as a misbranded hazardous substance under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. A person may petition the Consumer Product Safety Commission to investigate claims that a product does not satisfy these requirements."
