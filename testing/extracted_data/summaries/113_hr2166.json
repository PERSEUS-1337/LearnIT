    "content": "Good Samaritan Search and Recovery Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to implement a process to provide eligible organizations and individuals expedited access to federal lands to conduct good Samaritan search-and-recovery missions. Requires such process to include provisions that clarify that: (1) an eligible organization or eligible individual granted access shall be acting for private purposes and shall not be considered a federal volunteer, (2) an eligible organization or eligible individual shall not be considered a volunteer under the Volunteers in the Parks Act of 1969, and (3) neither the Federal Torts Claim Act nor the Federal Employee Compensation Act shall apply to an eligible organization or eligible individual. Bars the Secretaries from requiring an eligible organization or eligible individual to have liability insurance as a condition of accessing federal lands under this Act if it: (1) acknowledges and consents, in writing, to these clarifying provisions. And (2) signs a waiver releasing the federal government from all liability related to the access granted. Sets forth procedures for the approval or denial of requests made by eligible organizations or individuals to carry out a good Samaritan search-and-recovery mission. Requires the Secretaries to develop search-and-recovery focused partnerships with search-and-recovery organizations to: (1) coordinate good Samaritan search-and-recovery missions on such lands, and (2) expedite and accelerate mission efforts for missing individuals on such lands. Requires the Secretaries to submit a joint report to Congress that describes: (1) their plans for developing such partnerships, and (2) the efforts being taken to expedite and accelerate such mission efforts."
