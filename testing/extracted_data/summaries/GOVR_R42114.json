    "content": "For more than a decade, various experts have expressed increasing concerns about cybersecurity, in light of the growing frequency, impact, and sophistication of attacks on information systems in the United States and abroad. Consensus has also been building that the current legislative framework for cybersecurity might need to be revised. The complex federal role in cybersecurity involves both securing federal systems and assisting in protecting nonfederal systems. Under current law, all federal agencies have cybersecurity responsibilities relating to their own systems, and many have sector-specific responsibilities for critical infrastructure (CI). More than 50 statutes address various aspects of cybersecurity either directly or indirectly, but there is no overarching framework legislation in place. Revisions to many of those laws have been proposed over the past several years. Recent legislative proposals, including many bills introduced in recent Congresses, have focused largely on issues in several broad areas, including the following: \"Protection of Privately Held Critical Infrastructure (CI)\" \"Sharing of Cybersecurity Information Among Private and Government Entities,\" \"Department of Homeland Security Authorities for Protection of Federal Systems,\" \"Reform of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA),\" \"Cybersecurity Workforce,\" and \"Research and Development.\" \"Other Topics\"\u2014including cybercrime law, data breach notification, and defense-related cybersecurity\u2014have also been addressed in legislative proposals. At least some of the bills addressing those areas have proposed explicit changes to current laws. However, no bills making such revisions were enacted until the end of the 113th Congress. In the 112th and 113th Congresses, several bills that specifically focused on cybersecurity received committee or floor action. Comprehensive legislative proposals in the 112th Congress included the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 (S. 3414), recommendations from a House Republican task force, and a proposal by the Obama Administration. S. 3414 was debated in the Senate but failed two cloture votes. In the absence of enactment of cybersecurity legislation in that Congress, the White House issued Executive Order 13636, with provisions on protection of CI, including information sharing and standards development. In the 113th Congress, several narrower House bills addressed some of the issues raised and recommendations made by the House task force. Four had passed the House in the 112th Congress but were not considered by the Senate. They were reintroduced and passed the House again, with some amendments: The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (H.R. 624) focuses on information sharing and coordination. The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2013 (H.R. 756) and the Advancing America's Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Act of 2013 (H.R. 967) address federal cybersecurity R&D and technical standards. The Federal Information Security Amendments Act of 2013 (H.R. 1163) addresses FISMA reform. Also passing the House were three bills that address the role of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in cybersecurity: The CIRDA Act of 2013 (H.R. 2952), the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Boots-on-the-Ground Act (H.R. 3107), and the National Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2013 (H.R. 3696). They include provisions on workforce, R&D, information sharing, and public/private sector collaboration in protecting CI. Three Senate cybersecurity bills passed in the 113th Congress: The DHS Cybersecurity Workforce Recruitment and Retention Act of 2014 (S. 2354), bill addressing workforce issues, passed the Senate as an amendment to S. 1691. The National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 (S. 2519) provides authorization for a DHS information-sharing center. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (S. 2521), addresses FISMA reform. Four of the bills, as amended, were enacted at the end of the 113th Congress: H.R. 2952, S. 1691, S. 2519, and S. 2521. The bills address FISMA reform and DHS workforce issues and information-sharing activities."
