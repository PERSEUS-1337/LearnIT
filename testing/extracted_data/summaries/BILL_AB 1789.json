    "title": "AB 1789",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes an individual to contribute amounts in excess of his or her personal income tax liability for the support of specified funds, including the School Supplies for Homeless Children Fund. Existing law requires the moneys deposited in the School Supplies for Homeless Children Fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to be allocated to the State Department of Social Services for distribution to a designated nonprofit organization for the sole purpose of assisting pupils in California pursuant to the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, as provided. Existing law provides that this voluntary contribution remain in effect only until January 1 of the 5th taxable year in which the fund appears on the tax return or when the amount of contributions by taxpayers does not meet the minimum contribution amount, whichever occurs first. This bill would authorize the designated nonprofit organization to provide school supplies and health-related products to homeless children and homeless youth residing in or receiving services from specified living centers and would extend the time period for the School Supplies for Homeless Children Fund to appear on the tax return to January 1, 2022, or when the amount of contributions by taxpayers does not meet the minimum contribution amount, whichever occurs first."
