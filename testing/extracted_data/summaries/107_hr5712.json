    "title": "To amend title 23, United States Code, to improve roadway safety for motor vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians and workers in proximity to vehicle traffic.",
    "content": "Amends Federal highway provisions to include within the definition of safety improvement project a project that installs or maintains fluorescent, yellow-green signs at pedestrian or bicycle crossings or school zones. Authorizes the payment from apportioned funds for the entire cost of construction projects involving the maintenance of protective devices at railway-highway crossings. Makes specified sums available for each fiscal year for that purpose. Provides for biennial reports by each State to the Secretary of Transportation on progress being made to implement the railway-highway crossings program. Requires each State to identify roadway safety improvement needs for hazardous locations, sections, and elements which may constitute a danger to motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Authorizes the Secretary to approve as a project under the hazard elimination program any safety improvement project that reduces the likelihood of crashes involving road departures, intersections, pedestrians, bicycles, older drivers, or construction work zones. Makes funds available for: (1) police assistance for traffic and speed management in construction work zones. Or (2) compilation and analysis of data. Directs the Secretary to: (1) transmit to specified congressional committees biennial reports on the results of the hazard elimination program. And (2) issue regulations to decrease the likelihood of worker injury and maintain the free flow of vehicular traffic by requiring workers whose duties place them on or in close proximity to a Federal-aid highway to wear high visibility garments. Authorizes such regulations to require other worker-safety measures."
