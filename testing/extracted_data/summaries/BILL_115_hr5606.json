The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) must establish a Climate Change Education Program to: increase the climate literacy of the United States by broadening the understanding of human-induced climate change, including possible consequences and potential solutions. Apply the latest scientific and technological discoveries to provide learning opportunities to people of all ages. And help people understand and promote implementation of new technologies, programs, and incentives related to climate change, climate adaptation and mitigation, and climate resilience.
