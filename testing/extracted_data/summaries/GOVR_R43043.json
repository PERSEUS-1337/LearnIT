    "content": "On April 10, 2013, the Obama Administration submitted to Congress its budget request for FY2014. The request for State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs totaled $51.84 billion, which was about 2% below the FY2013 post-sequester estimated funding level of $52.88 billion. Within the request, $3.81 billion was designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding, which was 68% below FY2013-estimated OCO funding of $11.92 billion. Of the total request, $16.88 billion was for State Department Operations and related agencies, a 5.8% decline from the FY2013 funding estimate of $17.86 billion. About $34.95 billion was for Foreign Operations, a 0.2% decrease from the FY2013 estimate of $35.02 billion. After enacting appropriations for FY2014 with continuing resolutions in late 2013-early 2014, Congress completed action on, and the President signed, the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 3547/P.L. 113-76) in mid-January 2014. This report provides a brief overview of the FY2014 State Department, Foreign Operations and Related Programs funding request, as well as top-line analysis of House and Senate State-Foreign Operations appropriations proposals, enacted continuing resolutions, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76). It does not provide information or analysis on specific provisions in the House and Senate legislation. Tables in Appendix A and Appendix B provide side-by-side account-level funding data for FY2013, the FY2014 request, House- and Senate-proposed totals, and the enacted FY2014 funding levels in the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 3547/P.L. 113-76). The FY2013 funding data used as a point of comparison throughout this report represent post-sequestration estimates provided by the Department of State and reflect across-the-board rescissions."
