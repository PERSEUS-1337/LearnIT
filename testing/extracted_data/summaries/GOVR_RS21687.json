    "content": "Ecuador, a small, oil-producing country in the Andean region of South America, has experienced ten years of political and economic instability. On January 15, 2007, Rafael Correa, a left-leaning, U.S.-trained economist, was inaugurated to a four-year presidential term, becoming the country's eighth president in ten years. President Correa has fulfilled his campaign pledge to call a Constituent Assembly to reform the country's constitution. The Assembly, which had a majority of delegates elected from Correa's party, drafted a new constitution that was approved by 64% of voters in a referendum held in late September 2008. New presidential, legislative, and municipal elections are scheduled for April 26, 2009. Some observers are concerned that the new constitution concentrates too much power in the Ecuadorian presidency. U.S. officials have expressed concerns about President Correa's populist tendencies, ties with Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela, and trade and energy policies. Despite those concerns, Congress enacted legislation in October 2008 to extend U.S. trade preferences for Ecuador through June 2009.
