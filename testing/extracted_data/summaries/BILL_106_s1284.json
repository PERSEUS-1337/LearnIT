    "content": "Declares that no supplier of electric energy, who would otherwise have a right of access to a transmission or local distribution facility because such facility is essential for the conduct of interstate commerce in electric energy, shall be denied access to transmission or local distribution facilities or precluded from engaging in electric energy retail sales on the grounds that such denial or preclusion is authorized by State action establishing, maintaining, or enforcing an exclusive right to sell, transmit, or locally distribute electric energy. Authorizes a State or State commission to prohibit an electric utility from selling electric energy to an ultimate consumer in such State if the utility owns or controls transmission or local distribution facilities and is not itself providing unbundled local distribution service in a State in which it owns or operates an electricity-generating facility. Repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Declares that no electric utility shall be required to enter into a new contract or obligation to purchase or to sell electricity or capacity under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978."
