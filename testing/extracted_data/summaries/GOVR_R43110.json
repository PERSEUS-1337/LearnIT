    "content": "The annual Agriculture appropriations bill provides funding for all of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) except the Forest Service, plus the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and, in even-numbered fiscal years, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The FY2014 Agriculture and Related Agencies appropriations bill was included as Division A of the FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act, an omnibus appropriation that was enacted on January 17, 2014 (P.L. 113-76). It provides $20.880 billion of discretionary funding for agricultural and related programs. This is $1.165 billion (+5.9%) more than the post-sequestration amount for FY2013 (P.L. 113-6). Post-sequestration amounts for FY2013 programs became known during the development of the FY2014 appropriation, and are included in this report. Although the appropriation's primary focus is allocating discretionary funds, it also carries mandatory spending for FY2014 that totals $124.6 billion, primarily for domestic nutrition assistance ($101.4 billion), crop insurance ($9.5 billion), and farm commodity and conservation programs ($12.5 billion), although these generally are determined by authorizing legislation such as the farm bill. The total Agriculture appropriation, therefore, with discretionary and mandatory authority is $145.5 billion in FY2014. The largest discretionary items comprising the $20.88 billion discretionary appropriation are as follows. Domestic nutrition programs, including the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), receive $7.15 billion, up 3% from FY2013 post-sequestration levels. FDA receives $2.56 billion of appropriated funding, up 7% from FY2013. Agricultural research agencies total $2.64 billion, up 10% from FY2013. Rural Development agencies receive $2.57 billion, up about 13% from FY2013. Foreign aid and trade programs receive $1.84 billion, up about 8% form FY2013. The Farm Service Agency and Risk Management Agency receive about $1.66 billion for salaries and expenses, and farm loans, up 6% from FY2013. USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service receives $1.01 billion, up 3% from FY2013. Conservation Operations and Watershed Rehabilitation programs receive $0.83 billion, up nearly 6% from FY2013. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service receives $0.82 billion, up 8% from FY2013. The FY2014 appropriation also contains several policy directives that, among other things, limit USDA's ability to regulate livestock and poultry marketing practices, and encourage a delay in implementing some country-of-origin labeling rules."
