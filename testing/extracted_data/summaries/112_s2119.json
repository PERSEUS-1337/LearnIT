Identifies as eligible entities: (1) a state health department or other appropriate child care licensing entities within the state, or (2) a nonprofit organization or a partnership of nonprofit organizations with expertise in the healthy development of children. Requires grant funds to be used to: (1) establish child care collaboratives. (2) provide funding to entities that routinely train child care providers to establish collaboratives. And (3) provide technical assistance to participating providers, a compilation of best practices, strategies, and lessons learned from the collaborative, and a plan to ensure that the collaborative will be sustainable, without additional federal funding, upon the conclusion of the grants. Requires each collaborative to: (1) share best practices, strategies, and techniques for successfully implementing policies and practices relating to healthy eating, physical activity, parental engagement, and other topics relating to the healthy development of children. And (2) incorporate between 5 and 10 day-long, interactive training sessions each year and ongoing technical assistance to participating child care providers.
