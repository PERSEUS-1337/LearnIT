    "content": "The history of the Wright Amendment dates back to the 1960s when the now defunct CivilAeronautics Board (CAB) proposed the creation of a single regional airport in the Dallas-Fort Worth(DFW) area. To construct the new airport, the two cities entered into an agreement that required thephasing out of separate existing airports in Dallas and Ft. Worth and transferring air service to thenew DFW Airport, which opened in 1974. During this time, Southwest Airlines began operating outof Dallas's Love Field as a purely intrastate air carrier. As such, Southwest was not subject to CABregulation. Congress's subsequent passage of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, resulted inSouthwest being allowed to operate interstate flights from Love Field, and prompted concerns frommany local officials about DFW's financial stability. The Wright Amendment represents a compromise that was designed to protect the interestsof both DFW Airport and Southwest Airlines. The Wright Amendment contains a generalprohibition on interstate commercial aviation to or from Love Field subject to exceptions thatpermits Southwest's continued operations in a regional four state market. In addition, the ShelbyAmendment, enacted in 1997, further expands the scope of the regional market to three additionalstates, but nevertheless retains the basic compromise and structure of the original WrightAmendment. The language of the Wright Amendment has been the focus of several administrativeinterpretations by the Department of Transportation, as well as litigation at both at the state andfederal level. Each court decision to date has affirmed the DOT's interpretation of the WrightAmendment. The newest iteration of this long running issue is primarily the result of events that haveoccurred since the Fall of 2004. First, Delta Airlines decided in October 2004 to pull most of itsservice out of Dallas Ft. Worth International Airport (DFW). Next, DFW asked Southwest Airlinesto consider operating long distance flights out of DFW. Southwest rejected the DFW offer andinstead announced in November 2004 that it intended to seek legislative relief from theWright/Shelby Amendments. This announcement ended what was regarded as a long standing truceon this issue. In the period since November, DFW, joined by other parties such as AmericanAirlines, have lobbied in favor of retaining the existing Wright/Shelby restrictions on airlineoperations at Love Field. Southwest, and others, have, at the same time, presented their ownarguments as to why these restrictions should be removed. The DFW arguments are primarily couched in the politics, legalities, and history of theregional compact that created the airport. The rationales for retaining the Amendments are primarilyof local interest and origin, e.g. protecting investments and markets at DFW. The rationale forremoving the restrictions is the rationale for deregulation in the first place, the unrestricted flow ofair commerce. A question for policymakers then is should the exceptions to deregulation that are theWright/Shelby Amendments be retained in the context of the existing national aviation system?Legislation affecting the Wright/Shelby restrictions has been introduced in the 109th Congress; H.R. 2932 , H.R. 2646 , H.R. 3058 , H.R. 3383 , S. 1424 , and S. 1425 . This report will be updated as warranted by events."
