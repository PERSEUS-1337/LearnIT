    "content": "Tax cuts have been addressed recently. Rate reductions and across the board tax cuts were part of the H.R. 1836 , the tax cut signed by the President on June 7. Thisbill includes the changes in standard deductions and rate brackets relating to the marriagepenalty and also included in H.R. 6 , passed earlier by the House. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) provides for an alternative tax calculation, on a broader base but with a large exemption and a two-tier rate that is below the top tax rates inthe regular tax structure. It is paid when the tax liability figured using the AMT base and ratesis higher than regular tax liability. The AMT is expected to grow rapidly and extend furtherinto the middle class because the exemptions in the AMT are not indexed for inflation. Inaddition, the tax credits (such as the child credit) enacted in 1997 would have caused manymiddle class taxpayers to be affected by the AMT. A temporary provision allowing thesecredits to be taken against the AMT was adopted last year, and was made permanent for thechild credit by H.R. 1836 . The marriage penalty legislation, and other proposals for cutting taxes will be limited in their effects for some individuals unless changes are also made in the alternative minimumtax (AMT). Individuals who pay the AMT are not affected by cuts in the regular tax andindividuals who switch to the AMT will not receive the full tax cut. This constraint will growover time. For example, about 28 % of the tax cuts over the next ten years, in a bill similarto H.R. 6 considered in the 106th Congress would not have been received bytaxpayers because of the AMT. This effect grows over time; by 2008, 44% of the tax cut willnot have been received. Cuts in regular tax, without also addressing the AMT, would cause more and more taxpayers to the subject to the complexities of the AMT, and also increase the revenue costsof future measures to restrain the growth of the AMT. H.R. 1836 partiallyaddressed this issue, by making the child credit apply against the AMT. The bill alsoincreased the exemptions by $2,000 for singles and $4,000 for joint returns, but theseprovisions sunset in 2004. There are a number of different policy options that might be considered in evaluating the AMT and its interaction with the regular tax. For some, a priority has been in making theexclusion for credits permanent, while for others indexing may be the most important priority. Both of these approaches will be costly in the future (about $26 billion for the credit ten yearsfrom now and about $14 billion for indexing). Others might wish to eventually phase out theAMT, which will raise about $37 billion by 2010. One can also make a case for expandingthe coverage of the AMT as an eventual flat tax, although in some ways the AMT does notconform to certain design principles (such as adjusting exemptions for family size). Anotherissue is how to adjust the AMT as changes in the regular tax system are made, to keep therelative position and original purpose of the AMT intact. In the latter case, the AMT mightbe adjusted when fundamental changes are made in the regular tax (rates, bracket widths,standard deductions) but not for proposals that provide special subsidies. This report will beupdated to reflect legislative developments."
