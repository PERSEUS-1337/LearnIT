The bill amends the DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of 2004 to require the Department of Justice (DOJ), in providing information about the role of forensic nurses to certain health-related entities, to provide information about the role of both adult and pediatric forensic nurses. DOJ must also provide additional information on the need for pediatric sexual assault nurse examiners in responding to the abuse of both children and adolescents. The bill amends the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 to modify the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program: to add, as a purpose area, increasing the capacity of prosecutors to address the backlog of violent crime cases involving suspects identified through DNA evidence. And to reauthorize through FY2022 the requirement for DOJ to allocate a certain percentage of program funds for grants to audit backlogged rape kits."
