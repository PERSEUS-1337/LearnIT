    "title": "An act to amend, repeal, and add Section 9880.1 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to automotive repair.",
    "content": "Existing law, the Automotive Repair Act, the violation of which is a crime, establishes the Bureau of Automotive Repair under the supervision and control of the Director of Consumer Affairs. Existing law regulates the business of automotive repair and makes it unlawful for any person to be an automotive repair dealer unless registered with the bureau. Existing law defines an automotive repair dealer and an automotive technician as persons who, among other things, repair motor vehicles. Existing law defines the \u201crepair of motor vehicles\u201d to mean all maintenance of, and repairs to, motor vehicles, except repairing tires, changing tires, lubricating vehicles, installing light bulbs, batteries, windshield wiper blades, and other minor services. Existing law defines \u201cautomotive technician\u201d as a dealer, or a person employed by a dealer, who performs maintenance, diagnostics, repair, removal or installation of specified integral automotive components, but excluding minor services, as set forth above. This bill would require the director to adopt regulations prior to January 1, 2018, defining \u201cminor services\u201d for these purposes. This bill would, until January 1, 2018, include installation of propulsive batteries in the definition of \u201crepair of motor vehicles.\u201d This bill, commencing January 1, 2018, would recast the definition of \u201crepair of motor vehicles\u201d to delete the listing of the various types of excluded minor services and to specify that minor services do not include the changing of propulsive batteries, and also would exclude roadside services, as defined. The bill would similarly recast the definition of \u201cautomotive technician\u201d to delete these references and to delete provisions describing the specific work to be performed by an automotive technician. The bill, commencing January 1, 2018, would include the services performed by an operator of a tow truck owned or operated by a person or entity enrolled in the Basic Inspection of Terminals program, as specified, in the definition of \u201croadside services.\u201d This bill would provide that the regulations adopted by the director, prior to January 1, 2018, defining \u201cminor services\u201d continue in effect on and after January 1, 2018. Because the failure of a person installing propulsive batteries to register as a repair dealer or technician with the bureau would constitute a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. The bill would make the operation of its provisions contingent upon the enactment of SB 778 of the 2015\u201316 Regular Session."
