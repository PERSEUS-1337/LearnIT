    "title": "A bill to authorize the Secretary of Education to award grants to local education agencies to improve college access.",
    "content": "Pathways to College Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award competitive five-year grants to local educational agencies that serve mostly high-need secondary schools for programs to increase the number of students from low-income families who attend college. Defines high-need secondary schools as those where at least one-half of the students are from low-income families. Requires grantees to use such funds to: (1) train teachers and counselors to provide students with advice concerning postsecondary education. (2) ensure that each student receives postsecondary information and planning assistance before the end of their first semester of secondary school. (3) inform students and parents regarding the benefits, expenses, and financing of higher education. And (4) ensure that their schools develop comprehensive, school-wide plans of action to strengthen their college-going culture. Directs the Secretary to provide technical assistance to grantees in calculating and analyzing their college-going rates and adopting best practices for elevating such rates. Requires grantees to measure externally verified school-wide college enrollment, track data that leads to increased college-going, and evaluate the success of their grant activities."
