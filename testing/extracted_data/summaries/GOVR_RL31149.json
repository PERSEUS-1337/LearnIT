    "content": "For at least a decade, the use of snowmobiles in Yellowstone and other national parks has been controversial because of the potential impacts on wildlife and, until recently, the absence of standards for snowmobile emissions and noise. The National Park Service has attempted to address the issue by developing Winter Use Plans that establish regulations and limits at individual park units. These plans have been the subject of numerous legal challenges. On September 15, 2008, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the National Park Service's most recent Winter Use Plan for Yellowstone National Park. The plan would have allowed up to 540 snowmobiles per day into the park beginning in the 2008-2009 winter season, provided that they met noise and emission standards and that the riders were accompanied by commercial guides. The NPS plan was opposed by environmental groups and the vast majority of public commenters. With the rule vacated, it is unclear what limits will apply in the coming winter season. Current model snowmobiles emit significant quantities of pollution. In one hour, a new model snowmobile emits as much hydrocarbon as a 2008 model auto emits in about four years (54,000 miles) of driving. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated regulations limiting air emissions from snowmobiles in 2002, but the regulations have the effect of allowing the machines to emit as much hydrocarbon pollution in a day as a new auto emits in its lifetime. Snowmobiles also emit significant amounts of noise. EPA has no snowmobile noise standards. The National Park Service has allowed snowmobile use in 43 units of the national park system, in many cases in apparent violation of Executive Orders from the Nixon and Carter years. Outside of Alaska (where snowmobiles are permitted in most national parks by law), the most popular national park for snowmobiling has been Yellowstone, which saw more than 87,000 snowmobile visits in the 2001-2002 winter season. Under the Clinton Administration, the Park Service decided that the emissions and noise from snowmobiling were incompatible with protecting the park, and promulgated rules that would have phased out snowmobiles from Yellowstone by the winter of 2003-2004. The Bush Administration revisited these rules and announced modifications in March 2003 that would have allowed continued use of snowmobiles. The 2003 rules and the Clinton Administration action have been the subject of conflicting court rulings: a federal court in Wyoming has vacated and remanded the Clinton Administration's phaseout, while a D.C. federal court has vacated and remanded the Bush Administration rules. For the last four winters, Yellowstone and two neighboring park units have operated under a temporary plan that permits 720 snowmobiles per day in Yellowstone, but sets standards for their emissions and requires snowmobilers to be accompanied by commercial guides. Under these rules, snowmobile visits have declined by two-thirds. Efforts to reduce snowmobile emissions and noise remain contentious. This report discusses snowmobile access to the parks, snowmobile emissions, EPA's emission standards, and congressional efforts to address these issues."
