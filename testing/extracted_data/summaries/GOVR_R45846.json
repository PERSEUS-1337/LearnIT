    "content": "Through Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), Congress has delegated authority to the President to negotiate free trade agreements (FTAs). This authority requires congressional approval (through implementation legislation) of comprehensive FTAs. Since 1979, Congress has passed 17 implementation measures for FTAs and multilateral trade agreements. The majority of these trade agreements\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the recent United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 were considered in Congress under TPA, which provides for expedited consideration of FTAs in Congress. Since 1979, Congress has passed six measures extending TPA for limited time periods. As with many international trade issues, TPA has been politically contentious over time, resulting in vigorous debate and two multi-year lapses in authority. USMCA is the most recent free trade agreement (FTA) to be approved by Congress under TPA."
