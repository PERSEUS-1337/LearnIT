    "content": "America's Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008 - Requires quarter dollars, issued beginning in 2010, to have designs on the reverse emblematic of one national site in each state, the District of Columbia, and specified US territories. Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to select in each state a national park or other national site to be honored with a coin. Requires Yellowstone National Park, since it was established on March 1, 1872, as the nation's first national park, to be depicted on the first quarter dollar issued and to be designated to the state of Wyoming. Requires: (1) 5 coin designs in each of the first 10 years of either the original period of issuance or the second period of issuance. And (2) 6 coin designs in the 11th year of either the original period of issuance or the second period of issuance. Instructs the Secretary to strike and make available for sale silver bullion coins that are exact duplicates of such quarter dollars. Authorizes the Director of the National Park Service to purchase for resale or distribution numismatic items issued under this Act. Requires the Secretary to take such actions as are necessary to ensure that minting and issuing coins under this Act will not result in any net cost to the federal government."
