    "content": "Anti-Semitism Awareness Act of 2016 This bill requires the Department of Education, when reviewing whether there has been a violation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 based on an individual's actual or perceived shared Jewish ancestry or Jewish ethnic characteristics, to consider the definition of anti-Semitism as part of its assessment of whether the alleged practice was motivated by anti-Semitic intent. For purposes of this bill, the definition of anti-Semitism is the definition set forth by the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism of the Department of State in the Fact Sheet issued on June 8, 2010, as adapted from the Working Definition of Anti-Semitism of the European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia . Nothing in this bill shall be construed to diminish or infringe upon any right protected under the First Amendment to the Constitution."
