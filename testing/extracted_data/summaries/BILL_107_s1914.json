    "content": "Motor Carrier Fuel Cost Equity Act of 2002 - Amends the Federal transportation code to require any contract or agreement for truckload transportation or service regularly provided by a motor carrier, broker, or freight forwarder subject to the Secretary of Transportation and the Surface Transportation Board to include a requirement to assess a payor of transportation charges a minimum surcharge based on mileage or percentage of revenue for fuel used in the transportation provided to such payor. Requires such a surcharge whenever an increase in the price of such fuel surpasses by $0.05 per gallon the benchmark price of $1.10 per gallon. Requires the surcharge to be the amount necessary to compensate the person responsible for paying for fuel for any increase in the price from the fuel price norm. Requires any motor carrier, broker, or freight forwarder providing transportation or service using motor vehicles not owned by it and using fuel not paid for by it to pass any fuel surcharge through, with due notice in writing, to the person responsible for paying for fuel. Prohibits any reduction in compensatory transportation costs to the payor of fuel for the purpose of adjusting for or avoiding the pass through of the fuel surcharge."
