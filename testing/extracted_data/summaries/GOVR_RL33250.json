    "content": "For the past several decades, U.S. policymakers have debated the most appropriate and effective funding levels for U.S. international family planning programs. In the mid-1980s, controversy arose over U.S. family planning assistance when the Ronald Reagan Administration introduced restrictions that became known as the \"Mexico City policy.\" The Mexico City policy required foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to certify that they would not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning\u2014even if the activities were undertaken with non-U.S. funds. Presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush also suspended contributions to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) due to evidence of coercive family planning practices in China, citing violations of the \"Kemp-Kasten\" amendment, which bans U.S. assistance to organizations that, as determined by the President, support or participate in the management of coercive family planning programs. President Bill Clinton resumed UNFPA funding and rescinded the Mexico City policy in 1993. In 2001, however, President George W. Bush reapplied the Mexico City policy restrictions. The Bush Administration also suspended U.S. contributions to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008 following a State Department investigation of family planning programs in China. In January 2009, President Barack Obama issued a memorandum rescinding the Mexico City policy. The President also stated that the United States would resume U.S. contributions to UNFPA. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is the primary U.S. agency charged with supporting bilateral voluntary family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH) worldwide. Since 1965, it has obligated over $13.8 billion in assistance for international family planning activities. UNPFA is the primary organization through which the United States supports multilateral family planning activities. Recent international family planning-related appropriations and Administration requests are outlined below. FY2016 funding\u2014Similar to the previous two fiscal years, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113), stated that not less than $575 million shall be made available for bilateral FP/RH activities. The act stated that an additional $32.5 million shall be made available for UNFPA, a $2.5 million decrease from the FY2015-enacted level of $35 million. (The Obama Administration had requested a total of $577.6 million in bilateral FP/RH funding, and $35 million for UNFPA.) FY2015 funding\u2014As in FY2014, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235), stated that not less than $575 million shall be made available for bilateral FP/RH activities, and that an additional $35 million shall be made available for UNFPA. FY2014 funding\u2014Enacted in January 2014, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76) directed that not less than $575 million shall be made available for bilateral FP/RH activities, and that an additional $35 million shall be made available for UNFPA.
