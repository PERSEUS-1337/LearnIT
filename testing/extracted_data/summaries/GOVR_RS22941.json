    "content": "The Midwestern Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008 (S. 3322 and H.R. 6587) is intended to assist with the recovery from the severe weather that affected the Midwest during the summer of 2008. The Jobs, Energy, Families, and Disaster Relief Act of 2008 (S. 3335) includes some similar provisions, but these are not limited to the Midwest disaster. The disaster relief in the three bills is similar to that provided to assist with the recovery from the 2005 hurricanes and the 2007 Kansas tornadoes. This report broadly discusses the disaster relief provisions in S. 3322/H.R. 6587 and S. 3335."
