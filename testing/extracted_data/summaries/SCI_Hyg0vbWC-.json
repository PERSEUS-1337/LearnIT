    "content": "We show that generating English Wikipedia articles can be approached as a multi-\n document summarization of source documents. We use extractive summarization\n to coarsely identify salient information and a neural abstractive model to generate\n the article. For the abstractive model, we introduce a decoder-only architecture\n that can scalably attend to very long sequences, much longer than typical encoder-\n decoder architectures used in sequence transduction. We show that this model can\n generate fluent, coherent multi-sentence paragraphs and even whole Wikipedia\n articles. When given reference documents, we show it can extract relevant factual\n information as reflected in perplexity, ROUGE scores and human evaluations. The sequence-to-sequence framework has demonstrated success in natural-language sequence transduction tasks such as machine translation. More recently, neural techniques have been applied to do single-document, abstractive (paraphrasing) text summarization of news articles BID15 , BID9 ). In this prior work, the input to supervised models ranged from the first sentence to the entire text of an article, and they are trained end-to-end to predict reference summaries. Doing this end-to-end requires a significant number of parallel article-summary pairs since language understanding is a pre-requisite to generate fluent summaries.In contrast, we consider the task of multi-document summarization, where the input is a collection of related documents from which a summary is distilled. Prior work has focused on extractive summarization, which select sentences or phrases from the input to form the summaries, rather than generating new text. There has been limited application of abstractive neural methods and one possible reason is the paucity of large, labeled datasets.In this work, we consider English Wikipedia as a supervised machine learning task for multidocument summarization where the input is comprised of a Wikipedia topic (title of article) and a collection of non-Wikipedia reference documents, and the target is the Wikipedia article text. We describe the first attempt to abstractively generate the first section, or lead, of Wikipedia articles conditioned on reference text. In addition to running strong baseline models on the task, we modify the Transformer architecture BID18 to only consist of a decoder, which performs better in the case of longer input sequences compared to recurrent neural network (RNN) and Transformer encoder-decoder models. Finally we show our modeling improvements allow us to generate entire Wikipedia articles. In FIG3 , we show the predictions from three different models (using tf-idf extraction, and the combined corpus) along with the Wikipedia ground truth. As the perplexity decreases we see improvements in the model outputs, in terms of fluency, factual accuracy, and narrative complexity. In particular, the T-DMCA model offers a respectable alternative to the Wikipedia version and is more succinct, while mentioning key facts, such as where the law firm was located, when and how it was formed, and the rise and fall of the firm.In manual inspection of model outputs, we noticed an unexpected side-effect: models learn to translate names from English into multiple languages, e.g. Rohit Viswanath into Hindi (see FIG4 ). Although we did not do a systematic evaluation of the translations, we found they are often correct, and often they are not found in the Wikipedia article itself. We also verified that in general the translation is not merely copied from the source, such as example cases where the target language is the incorrect one (e.g. translation of an English name into Ukrainian). We have shown that generating Wikipedia can be approached as a multi-document summarization problem with a large, parallel dataset, and demonstrated a two-stage extractive-abstractive framework for carrying it out. The coarse extraction method used in the first stage appears to have a significant effect on final performance, suggesting further research on improving it would be fruitful. We introduce a new, decoder-only sequence transduction model for the abstractive stage, capable of handling very long input-output examples. This model significantly outperforms traditional encoderdecoder architectures on long sequences, allowing us to condition on many reference documents and to generate coherent and informative Wikipedia articles."
