    "content": "When legislation is introduced in the House or received from the Senate, it is referred to one or more committees primarily on the basis of the jurisdictional statements contained in clause 1 of House Rule X. These statements define the policy subjects on which each standing committee may exercise jurisdiction on behalf of the chamber. The statements themselves tend to address broad policy areas rather than specific departments, agencies, or programs of the federal government. Because comm ittee jurisdiction often is expressed in general policy terms, it is possible for more than one committee to claim jurisdiction over different aspects of a broad subject that may encompass a myriad of specific programs and activities. When referring a measure to more than one committee (a \"multiple referral\"), the Speaker is directed by clause 2 of House Rule XII to identify a \"primary\" committee of referral, which is the panel understood to exercise jurisdiction over the main subject of the measure. Rule XII further provides the Speaker with the authority to refer legislation to more than one committee either at the point of introduction (an \"initial additional referral\"), or after another committee has reported (a \"sequential referral\"). The Speaker may also divide a measure into its component parts and refer individual pieces to different House panels (a \"split referral\"), but split referrals are rare in current practice. The Speaker is empowered to place time limits on any referral and always does so in the case of a sequential referral. The Speaker also \"may make such other [referral] provision as may be considered appropriate.\" House rules vest these powers of referral in the Speaker; in practice, the House Parliamentarian makes day-to-day referral decisions acting as the Speaker's nonpartisan and disinterested agent. Although clause 1 of Rule X is the main determinant of House committee jurisdiction, other factors may also influence how legislation is referred, including precedents established by past referrals; agreements between committees outlining their jurisdictional boundaries on new, evolving, or contested policy subjects; and statutes that identify how particular kinds of matters will be referred. The jurisdictions of subcommittees are not explicitly stated in House rules. The jurisdiction of a subcommittee is generally determined by the full committee that created it. If a subcommittee's jurisdiction is not explicitly defined by its parent committee, measures are generally referred to subcommittee or retained by the full committee at the discretion of its chair. A distinction can be made between legislative and oversight jurisdiction. Legislative jurisdiction describes the authority of a committee to receive and report measures to the House. Oversight jurisdiction refers to a committee's ability to review matters within its purview, for instance by conducting hearings and investigations. Legislative jurisdiction is defined in clause 1 of Rule X, while clause 2 of the same rule directs all standing committees to \"review and study on a continuing basis the application, administration, execution, and effectiveness of laws and programs addressing subjects within its [legislative] jurisdiction.\""
