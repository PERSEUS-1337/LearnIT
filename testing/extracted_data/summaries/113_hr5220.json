    "content": "No More Land Act - Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to prohibit the Land and Water Conservation Fund from being used for acquisition. Directs the heads of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Forest Service, and the National Park Service to reduce the value of backlogged maintenance that exists on lands under the administrative jurisdiction of that agency by at least 20 in five years, with additional decreases in the backlog for subsequent years. Instructs each agency to publish reports to Congress that document the progress made by reducing the backlogs. Requires each agency to submit to Congress a report that prioritizes lands owned by the federal government and under the administrative jurisdiction of that agency by order of importance to the success of agency programs."
