    "content": "Human-computer conversation systems have attracted much attention in Natural Language Processing. Conversation systems can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (namely a query) in a large conversational repository and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches synthesize new replies. Both ways have certain advantages but suffer from their own disadvantages. We propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based conversation system. The retrieved candidates, in addition to the original query, are fed to a reply generator via a neural network, so that the model is aware of more information. The generated reply together with the retrieved ones then participates in a re-ranking process to find the final reply to output. Experimental results show that such an ensemble system outperforms each single module by a large margin.\n Automatic human-computer conversation systems have long served humans in domain-specific scenarios. A typical approach for such systems is built by human engineering, for example, using manually constructed ontologies ), natural language templates ), and even predefined dialogue state tracking BID29 ).Recently , researchers have paid increasing attention to open-domain, chatbot-style human-computer conversations such as XiaoIce 1 and Duer 2 due to their important commercial values. For opendomain conversations, rules and templates would probably fail since they hardly can handle the great diversity of conversation topics and flexible representations of natural language sentences. With the increasing popularity of on-line social media and community question-answering platforms, a huge number of human-human conversation utterances are available on the public Web BID32 ; BID13 ). Previous studies begin to develop data-oriented approaches, which can be roughly categorized into two groups: retrieval systems and generative systems.When a user issues an utterance (called a query), the retrieval-based conversation systems search a corresponding utterance (called a reply) that best matches the query in a pre-constructed conversational repository BID10 ; BID11 ). Owing to the abundant web resources, the retrieval mechanism will always find a candidate reply given a query using semantic matching. The retrieved replies usually have various expressions with rich information. However, the retrieved replies are limited by the capacity of the pre-constructed repository. Even the best matched reply from the conversational repository is not guaranteed to be a good response since most cases are not tailored for the issued query.To make a reply tailored appropriately for the query, a better way is to generate a new one accordingly. With the prosperity of neural networks powered by deep learning, generation-based conversation systems are developing fast. Generation-based conversation systems can synthesize a new sentence as the reply, and thus bring the results of good flexibility and quality. A typical generationbased conversation model is seq2seq BID23 ; BID22 ; BID20 ), in which two recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are used as the encoder and the decoder. The encoder is to capture the semantics of the query with one or a few distributed and real-valued vectors (also known as embeddings); the decoder aims at decoding the query embeddings to a reply. Long short term memory (LSTM) BID8 Table 1 : Characteristics of retrieved and generated replies in two different conversational systems.(GRUs) BID3 ) could further enhance the RNNs to model longer sentences. The advantage of generation-based conversation systems is that they can produce flexible and tailored replies. A well known problem for the generation conversation systems based on \"Seq2Seq\" is that they are prone to choose universal and common generations. These generated replies such as \"I don't know\" and \" Me too\" suit many queries BID20 ), but they contain insufficient semantics and information. Such insufficiency leads to non-informative conversations in real applications.Previously, the retrieval-based and generation-based systems with their own characteristics, as listed in Table 1 , have been developed separately. We are seeking to absorb their merits. Hence, we propose an ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based conversation systems. Specifically, given a query, we first apply the retrieval module to search for k candidate replies. We then propose a \"multi sequence to sequence\" (multi-seq2seq) model to integrate each retrieved reply into the Seq2Seq generation process so as to enrich the meaning of generated replies to respond the query. We generate a reply via the multi-seq2seq generator based on the query and k retrieved replies. Afterwards, we construct a re-ranker to re-evaluate the retrieved replies and the newly generated reply so that more meaningful replies with abundant information would stand out. The highest ranked candidate (either retrieved or generated) is returned to the user as the final reply. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to build a bridge over retrieval-based and generation-based modules to work out a solution for an ensemble of conversation system.Experimental results show that our ensemble system consistently outperforms each single component in terms of subjective and objective metrics, and both retrieval-based and generation-based methods contribute to the overall approach. This also confirms the rationale for building model ensembles for conversation systems. Having verified that our model achieves the best performance, we are further curious how each gadget contributes to our final system. Specifically, we focus on the following research questions. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based open-domain conversation systems. The retrieval part searches the k best-matched candidate replies, which are, along with the original query, fed to an RNN-based multi-seq2seq reply generator. Then the generated replies and retrieved ones are re-evaluated by a re-ranker to find the final result. Although traditional generation-based and retrieval-based conversation systems are isolated, we have designed a novel mechanism to connect both modules. The proposed ensemble model clearly outperforms state-of-the-art conversion systems in the constructed large-scale conversation dataset."
