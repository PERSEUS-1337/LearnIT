    "content": "Educating to Prevent Eating Disorders Act of 2015 This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to permit the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to establish a pilot program to provide students with interventions for eating disorders. Under this pilot program, grants must be awarded to schools that serve students in grades 6-8 and need a nurse trained in recognizing and responding to eating disorders. Schools must use these grants to develop best practices for health care providers to assess, recognize, and respond to students with eating disorders and to hire a health care provider to: (1) follow these best practices, (2) provide information and seminars on eating disorders to teachers and parents, and (3) otherwise serve as a full time health care provider for the school."
