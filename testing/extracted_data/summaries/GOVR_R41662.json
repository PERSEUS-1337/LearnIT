    "content": "The 112th Congress considered a number of issues related to currently available unemployment insurance programs: Unemployment Compensation (UC), temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08), and Extended Benefits (EB). With the national unemployment rate decreasing but still high, the weekly demand for regular and extended unemployment benefits continued at high levels. Congress deliberated multiple times on whether to extend the authorization for several key temporary unemployment insurance provisions. The EUC08 program, along with temporary provisions surrounding EB, had been set to expire at the end of 2012. The signing of H.R. 8 on January 2, 2013, now means that the EUC08 program is scheduled to expire the week ending on or before January 1, 2014. The 100% federal financing of the EB program will expire on December 31, 2013. In addition, the option for states to use three-year EB trigger lookbacks expires the week ending on or before December 31, 2013. The 112th Congress faced these expirations as well as likely unemployment insurance policy issues, including unemployment insurance financing. In addition, a temporary 0.2% federal unemployment tax (FUTA) surtax expired at the end of June 2011. Among other items, policy discussions focused on the appropriate length and availability conditions of unemployment benefits. This report provides a brief overview of the three unemployment insurance programs\u2014UC, EUC08, and EB\u2014that may currently pay benefits to eligible unemployed workers.
