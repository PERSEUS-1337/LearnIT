    "content": "Reasonable Search Standards Act - Prohibits US Customs Service personnel from subjecting travelers to detention or searches based upon race, religion, gender, national origin, or sexual orientation, except when acting upon specific information that a particular traveler suspected of engaging in illegal activity is described by one or more of such characteristics. Requires Customs Service personnel, before a pat down or intrusive nonroutine search, to document reasons to support a belief that an individual may be carrying contraband in violation of Federal law. Waives such requirement with respect to anyone suspected of carrying a weapon. Instructs the Commissioner of Customs to require Customs Service personnel to undergo periodic training on identification, detention, and search procedures, with particular emphasis on profiling proscriptions."
