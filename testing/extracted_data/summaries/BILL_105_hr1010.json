    "content": "Mandates Information Act of 1997 - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require a congressional committee report on any bill or joint resolution that includes any Federal mandate to contain information concerning the impact of such mandate on consumers, workers, and small businesses, including any disproportionate impact in particular regions or industries. Revises provisions concerning legislation subject to a point of order to: (1) define the point of order for a determination by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office that it is not feasible to determine the economic impact of a Federal mandate. And (2) replace certain references to Federal intergovernmental mandates with references to Federal mandates. Expresses the sense of the Congress that any unfunded mandates that are determined by the CBO Director to exceed the applicable threshold under the Act should be financed through reduced taxes, tax abatements, or direct compensation by the Federal Government."
