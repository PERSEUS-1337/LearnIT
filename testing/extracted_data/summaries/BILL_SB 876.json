    "title": "SB 876",
    "content": "Existing law provides that no person shall, on the basis of race, national origin, ethnic group identification, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, color, genetic information, or disability, be unlawfully denied full and equal access to the benefits of, or be unlawfully subjected to discrimination under, any program or activity that is conducted, operated, or administered by the state or by any state agency, is funded directly by the state, or receives any financial assistance from the state. This bill would afford persons experiencing homelessness the right to use public spaces without discrimination based on their housing status and describe basic human and civil rights that may be exercised without being subject to criminal or civil sanctions, including the right to use and to move freely in public spaces, the right to rest in public spaces and to protect oneself from the elements, the right to eat in any public space in which having food is not prohibited, and the right to perform religious observances in public spaces, as specified. The bill would state the intent of the Legislature that these provisions be interpreted broadly so as to prohibit policies or practices that are discriminatory in either their purpose or effect. The bill would authorize a person whose rights have been violated pursuant to these provisions to enforce those rights in a civil action in which the court may award the prevailing plaintiff injunctive and declaratory relief, restitution, damages, statutory damages of $1,000 per violation, and fees and costs. The bill would also require all applicants for the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Continuum of Care Homeless Assistance Program to annually provide to the Department of Housing and Community Development\u2019s Division of Housing Policy Development a copy of its application for funding from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that includes the organization\u2019s response to the application question regarding steps that its community is taking to reduce criminalization of homelessness. Because the bill would require local agencies to perform additional duties, it would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the Department of Housing and Community Development to compile the information regarding community actions to reduce criminalization of homelessness found in those applications and provide a report to the Assembly Housing and Community Development Committee and the Senate Transportation and Housing Committee The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
