Its statutory mission includes providing greater access for all Americans to telecommunications services; supporting U.S. efforts to open foreign markets; advising the President on international telecommunications negotiations; and funding research for new technologies and their applications. It is also responsible for managing spectrum use by federal agencies. Title VI of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-96), also known as the Spectrum Act, gives the NTIA responsibilities for improving public safety communications. The act required NTIA to assist with the development of the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet), created by Congress to deploy a nationwide public safety broadband network. NTIA is also required to assist in planning and funding for Next Generation 9-1-1 (NG 9-1-1) services, which refers to the transition to digital, Internet-based systems to replace existing analog systems that are currently prevalent throughout the United States. The Spectrum Act also gave the NTIA new responsibilities and requirements for spectrum management, especially regarding the reallocation of federal spectrum. The Spectrum Pipeline Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-74, Title X) added further requirements for actions by the NTIA, including identification of additional spectrum for nonfederal use. The NTIA also plays a central role in representing U.S. interests in the Internet internationally, including an active role in the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN is an international entity that develops policies to support the Internet worldwide. NTIA participates in ICANN as a member of the Governmental Advisory Committee, which provides advice to ICANN. Between FY2010 and FY2011, the NTIA's total budget appropriations increased by 4% to $41.6 million. During that same time, Congress defunded NTIA's Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP, funded at $20 million in FY2010), and more than doubled the budget for administration, salaries, and expenses, from $20.0 million to $41.6 million. This increase was largely attributed by the NTIA to its responsibilities in administering grants for broadband network deployment, as required by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5). Enacted amounts remained above $40 million until FY2015.The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2015 was $51.0 million, and the enacted amount was $38.2 million. For FY2016, the enacted budget amount for the NTIA was $39.5 million, compared to a request for $49.2 million. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2017 was $50.8 million. As reported by the Senate, S. 2837 would have provided a total of $39.5 million to NTIA for FY2017. As reported by the House, H.R. 5393 would have provided $36.3 million. A series of continuing appropriations acts (P.L. 114-223, P.L. 114-254, P.L. 115-30) provided funding for NTIA from October 1, 2016 through May 5, 2017 at about 99.5-99.8% of the FY2016 funding level. Signed by the President on May 5, 2017, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31), provides $32.0 million to NTIA, $7.5 million (19%) less than the FY2016 enacted amount. For FY2018, the budget blueprint released by the White House in March 2017 signaled support for NTIA's role in multi-stakeholder forums on Internet governance and digital commerce and agency efforts on efficient use of federal spectrum. No funding cuts were specified in the blueprint for NTIA, though an overall decrease of $1.5 billion from the FY2017 continuing resolution level was proposed for the Department of Commerce."
