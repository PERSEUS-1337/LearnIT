    "title": "AB 1171",
    "content": "Existing law generally sets forth the requirements for the solicitation and evaluation of bids and the awarding of contracts by local agencies for public works contracts. Existing law authorizes the Department of Transportation, the Santa Clara County Valley Transportation Authority, and the San Diego Association of Governments to use the Construction ManagerGeneral Contractor project delivery method for transit projects within their respective jurisdictions, subject to certain conditions and requirements. This bill would authorize regional transportation agencies, as defined, to use the Construction ManagerGeneral Contractor project delivery method, as specified, to design and construct certain expressways that are not on the state highway system if: (1) the expressways are developed in accordance with an expenditure plan approved by voters, (2) there is an evaluation of the traditional design-bid-build method of construction and of the Construction ManagerGeneral Contractor method, and (3) the board of the regional transportation agency adopts the method in a public meeting. The bill would require the regional transportation agency to provide a report, containing specified information, to its governing body upon completion of a project using the Construction ManagerGeneral Contractor method. The bill would require specified information provided to a regional transportation agency to be verified under oath. By expanding the scope of the existing crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
