    "content": "Charities Helping Americans Regularly Throughout the Year Act of 2017 This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to modify several tax provisions affecting charitable contributions and tax-exempt organizations. The Internal Revenue Service may determine the standard mileage rate for deducting the cost of using a passenger automobile for charitable purposes , and the rate may not be less than the rate for medical purposes . The bill modifies the substantiation requirements for charitable contributions to eliminate an exemption for contributions that are reported on a return filed by a tax-exempt organization. Tax-exempt organizations must file their returns in electronic form. The bill excludes from the gross income of an individual who is at least 70-12 years of age up to $100,000 in distributions from an individual retirement plan to a donor-advised fund (DAF). The bill also modifies disclosure requirements for DAFs. The bill reduces from 2 to 1 the excise tax on the investment income of private foundations and eliminates a provision that reduces the rate to 1 if a foundation meets certain distribution requirements. The bill exempts certain philanthropic business holdings from the tax on excess business holdings of private foundations if a foundation meets requirements for exclusive ownership, donating all profits to charity, and independent operation."
