    "content": "Invest in Women's Health Act of 2017 This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide support to public or nonprofit entities to expand certain preventive health services, with an emphasis on increasing access to cancer screening, particularly for women of color. The bill reauthorizes through FY2020: (1) programs related to breast and gynecologic cancers under Medicaid and family planning programs, and (2) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. HHS must establish a demonstration grant program to train health care providers regarding breast and gynecologic cancer screening. HHS must study and report on access to women's preventive cancer screening, including cancer rates by state, cancer screening by state, and estimated federal savings achieved through early detection of breast and gynecologic cancer."
