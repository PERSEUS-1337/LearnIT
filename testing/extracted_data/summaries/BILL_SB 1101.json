Existing law provides for various programs to eliminate alcohol and drug abuse, and states the finding of the Legislature that state government has an affirmative role in alleviating problems related to the inappropriate use of alcoholic beverages and other drug use. This bill, among other things, would establish the Alcohol and Drug Counseling Professional Bureau within the Department of Consumer Affairs, specify the bureau\u2019s powers and duties, and authorize the bureau to adopt necessary rules and regulations. The bill would prohibit any a person from using the title licensed alcohol and drug counselor unless the person had applied for and obtained a license from the State Department of Health Care Services bureau and would specify the minimum qualifications for a license, including, but not limited to, educational qualifications, being currently credentialed as an advanced alcohol and drug counselor, and having submitted to a criminal background check. The bill would provide that a license for an alcohol and drug counselor would be valid for 2 years unless at any time during that period it is revoked or suspended, that the license would be authorized to be renewed prior to the expiration of the 2-year period, and that a licensee fulfill continuing education requirements prior to renewal. The bill would also require that the license fee the bureau to establish the fees for an original initial alcohol and drug counselor license and the license a renewal fee be license in an amount reasonably related to the department\u2019s bureau\u2019s actual costs in performing its duties under this part, duties, but to not exceed $200. This bill would require the department bureau to ensure that review the state and federal level criminal history of the applicant is reviewed before issuing a license, and the department bureau would be required, with exceptions, to deny, suspend, delay, or set aside a person\u2019s license if, at the time of the department\u2019s bureau\u2019s determination, the person has a criminal conviction or pending criminal charge relating to an offense, the circumstances of which substantially relate to actions as a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. The bill would also require the department to oversee the disciplinary actions of certifying organizations it approves, as provided."
