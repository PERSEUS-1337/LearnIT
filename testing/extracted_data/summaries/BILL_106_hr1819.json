    "content": "Limits the full credit to individuals whose adjusted gross income is under $30,000 . Disallows any credit to a married individual filing a separate return, but treats married individuals living apart and filing separate returns as not married . Prescribes a formula for phase-out of the credit for taxpayers with an adjusted gross income exceeding $30,000 by less than $10,000. Allows self-employed individuals to elect such credit or the deduction for medical expenses, but not both. States that such credit does not apply to long- term health care insurance."
