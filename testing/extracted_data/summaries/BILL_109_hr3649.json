Title III: Extension of Authorization For Use of Funds In Boat Safety Account - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend through FY2005 the authorization of expenditures from the Boat Safety Account to carry out state recreational boating safety programs. Declares that the obligation authority for funds made available under the Transportation, Treasury, Independent Agencies, and General Government Appropriations Act, 2005 for expenses necessary to discharge the functions of the Secretary of Transportation with respect to traffic and highway safety shall be available in an amount equal to the funds provided.
