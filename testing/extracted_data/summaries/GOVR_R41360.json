    "content": "This report details legislation and policies that restrict or place requirements on U.S. funding of abortion or family planning activities abroad. The level and extent of federal funding for these activities is an ongoing and controversial issue in U.S. foreign assistance and has continued to be a point of contention during the 115th Congress. These issues have been debated for over four decades in the context of a broader domestic abortion controversy that began with the Supreme Court's 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade, which holds that the Constitution protects a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy. Since Roe, Congress has enacted foreign assistance legislation placing restrictions or requirements on the federal funding of abortions and on family planning activities abroad. Many of these provisions, often referred to by the name of the lawmakers that introduced them, have been included in foreign aid authorizations, appropriations, or both, and affect different types of foreign assistance. Examples include the \"Helms amendment,\" which prohibits the use of U.S. funds to perform abortions or to coerce individuals to practice abortions; the \"Biden amendment,\" which states that U.S. funds may not be used for biomedical research related to abortion or involuntary sterilization; the \"Siljander amendment,\" which prohibits U.S. funds from being used to lobby for or against abortion; the \"Kemp-Kasten amendment,\" which prohibits funding for any organization or program that, as determined by the President, supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization (the Trump Administration has withheld funding from UNFPA under this law); and the \"Tiahrt amendment,\" which places requirements on voluntary family planning projects receiving assistance from USAID. The executive branch has also engaged in the debate over international abortion and family planning. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan issued what has become known as the \"Mexico City policy,\" which required foreign nongovernmental organizations receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify that they would not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning, even if such activities were conducted with non-U.S. funds. The policy was rescinded by President Bill Clinton and reinstituted and expanded by President George W. Bush to include State Department activities. In January 2009, President Barack Obama rescinded the policy. It was reinstated and expanded by President Trump in January 2017, and renamed \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" (PLGHA). This report focuses primarily on legislative restrictions and executive branch policies related to international abortion and family planning. For information on domestic abortion laws and U.S. global health assistance, including international family planning, see CRS Report RL33467, Abortion: Judicial History and Legislative Response, by Jon O.
