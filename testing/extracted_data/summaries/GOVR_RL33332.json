    "content": "Several sections of the USA PATRIOT Act and one section of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 were originally scheduled to expire on December 31, 2005. In July 2005, both Houses approved USA PATRIOT reauthorization acts, H.R. 3199 and S. 1389 , and the conference committee filed a report, H.Rept. 109-333 . A separate bill, the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006 ( S. 2271 ), provided civil liberties safeguards not included in the conference report. Both H.R. 3199 and S. 2271 were signed into law ( P.L. 109-177 and P.L. 109-178 ) by the President on March 9, 2006. This report describes the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 (the Act) and, where appropriate, discusses the modifications to law made by the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006. Consisting of seven titles, the Act, among other things: Makes permanent 14 of the 16 expiring USA PATRIOT Act sections as well as the material support of terrorism amendments scheduled to expire on December 31, 2006. Creates a new sunset of December 31, 2009, for USA PATRIOT Act sections 206 and 215 (\"roving\" FISA wiretaps and FISA orders for business records), and for the \"lone wolf\" amendment to FISA. Provides for greater congressional and judicial oversight of section 215 orders, section 206 roving wiretaps, and national security letters. Requires high-level approval for section 215 FISA orders for library, bookstore, firearm sale, medical, tax return, and educational records. Enhances procedural protections and oversight concerning delayed notice, or \"sneak and peek\" search warrants. Expands the list of predicate offenses in which law enforcement may obtain wiretap orders to include more than 20 federal crimes. Revises criminal penalties and procedures concerning criminal and terrorist activities committed at seaports or aboard vessels. Reenforces federal money laundering and forfeiture authority, particularly in connection with terrorist offenses. Allows the Attorney General to determine whether a state qualifies for expedited habeas corpus procedures for state death row inmates. Establishes a new National Security Division within the Department of Justice (DOJ), supervised by a new Assistant Attorney General. Creates a new federal crime relating to misconduct at an event designated as a \"special event of national significance,\" whether or not a Secret Service protectee is in attendance. Intensifies federal regulation of foreign and domestic commerce in methamphetamine precursors.
