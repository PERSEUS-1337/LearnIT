    "content": "Section 3 Modernization and Improvement Act of 2015 This bill amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 to revise the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) program for economic opportunities for low- and very low-income persons. Public and Indian housing agencies that receive HUD development assistance, operating assistance, or modernization grants provided under the program (recipients) must report annually to HUD on their compliance with employment and contracting requirements and on the performance of their contractors and subcontractors. HUD must develop and implement policies and procedures for imposing a series of administrative sanctions, graduated in severity, on recipients and their contractors and subcontractors for noncompliance with this Act or the program's requirements. The HUD rental assistance program is exempted from requirements that: opportunities for training and employment in connection with a housing rehabilitation, housing construction, or other public construction project be given to low- and very low-income persons residing within the metropolitan area in which the project is located. And contracts awarded for work in connection with such projects be given to businesses providing economic opportunities for such persons in those areas in which the assistance is expended. HUD shall require that public housing agencies (PHAs) and owners of multifamily properties assisted under the rental assistance program, and their contractors and subcontractors, make their best efforts to give low- and very low-income persons all the training and employment opportunities generated by or in such properties, including opportunities: (1) not involving property construction or rehabilitation. And (2) generated by assistance provided under the program. HUD must also require that such PHAs and owners award work contracts in connection with these properties to businesses that provide economic opportunities for low- and very low-income persons."
