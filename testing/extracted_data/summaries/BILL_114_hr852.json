    "content": "Transparency in Phone Solicitation Act of 2015 or the TIPS Act of 2015 Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit businesses, entities, or individuals from making live telephone solicitations unless the solicitor: (1) states the solicitor's identity, telephone number, and address. (2) states the address of a website that the called party may use to indicate that such party does not wish to receive calls from that solicitor. (3) transmits caller identification information, including a telephone number that the called party may use to return the call directly to such solicitor. And (4) releases the called party's line within five seconds after being notified that the called party has hung up to allow the called party to make or receive other calls. Revises standards applicable to telephone transmissions of artificial or prerecorded voice messages to add comparable procedures requiring any such messages to: (1) state the telephone number and address of the calling entity, (2) state the address of a website that the called party may use to indicate that such party does not wish to receive calls from that entity, and (3) transmit caller identification information. Retains the current law requirement that artificial or prerecorded messages must release the line within five seconds after the called party has hung up."
