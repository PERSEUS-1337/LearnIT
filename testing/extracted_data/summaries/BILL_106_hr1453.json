    "content": "Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of 1999 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for a deduction for two-earner married couples to eliminate the marriage penalty. Allows such deduction, in the case of a joint return, in an amount equal to a specified applicable percentage of the qualified earned income of the spouse with the lower qualified earned income for the taxable year. Specifies such applicable percentage as 20 percent reduced by one percentage point for each $1,000 by which the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income for the taxable year exceeds $50,000. Makes such deduction above-the-line . Requires that the earned income credit phaseout reflect such deduction."
