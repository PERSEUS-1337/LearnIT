    "content": "Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions. Existing law provides that federally qualified health center services and rural health clinic services, as defined, are covered benefits under the Medi-Cal program, to be reimbursed, to the extent that federal financial participation is obtained, to providers on a per-visit basis. \u201cVisit\u201d is defined as a face-to-face encounter between a patient of a federally qualified health center or a rural health clinic and specified health care professionals. This bill would include a marriage and family therapist within those health care professionals covered under that definition."
