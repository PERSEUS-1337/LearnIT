    "content": "Equity for Reservists Pay Act of 2003 - Entitles a Federal employee who is also a member of the reserves and who is absent from his or her civilian employment position under a call or order for active duty service of more than 30 days, to receive an amount equal to the difference in pay between the military compensation received and the civilian compensation that otherwise would have been received during such period. Makes such amounts also payable during: (1) any period of hospitalization or convalescence required as a result of such service. And (2) the 14-day period following such service. Directs the Secretary of the military department concerned to reimburse a State or local government for 50 percent of the civilian compensation paid by such government for pay periods when a State or local government employee is performing active duty service of more than 30 days. Increases such rate to 100 percent if the employee's active duty service period extends beyond nine months. Requires such reimbursement during periods of hospitalization or convalescence and for 14 days after service. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that, for purposes of the general business credit, the Active-Duty Reserve Component employee credit is 50 percent of the compensation paid by the employer to the employee during the period of active duty."
