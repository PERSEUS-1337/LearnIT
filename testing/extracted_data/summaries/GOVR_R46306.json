    "content": "Recent Administrations and Congress have demonstrated bipartisan support for increasing federal assistance to individuals pursuing training and education in postsecondary non-degree programs, sometimes referred to as short -term programs . Non-degree programs are postsecondary training and education programs that are most often shorter in duration than a bachelor's or associate's degree program. They generally provide work-based learning or educational instruction to individuals who are beyond the typical age for secondary education to prepare them for a particular occupation. Examples of support have included proposals to expand existing federal programs, create new programs, and improve coordination between existing programs. This report provides an overview of existing federal programs and benefits that support individuals pursuing training and education in non-degree programs. A prominent argument for supporting individuals pursuing training and education in non-degree programs is that there is a substantial employer need for individuals with some postsecondary credentials but no degree. In 2018, approximately 72% of jobs in the national economy were in occupations for which the typical entry-level education is less than an associate's degree. Just over 6% explicitly required a non-degree credential, but these credentials could prepare individuals for many jobs that do not require a bachelor's or higher level degree. Mean annual wages for individuals whose highest educational attainment is high school completion are similar to those for individuals with a non-degree credential. Earnings for individuals with only non-degree credentials vary based on differences in occupational field, program duration, and type of educational institution attended. Several federal programs provide direct financial support to or on behalf of students to enable them to pursue training and postsecondary education in non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs. None of these federal programs or benefits that provide such support focus exclusively on promoting non-degree program pursuits. The federal programs include the following: Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA; P.L. 113-128 ) is the primary federal workforce development statute. The program relies on state and local workforce development boards to enter into contracts with training and education program providers and oversee the quality of the providers. Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA; P.L. 89-329), as amended, authorizes grant and loan programs that provide financial assistance to higher education students. Non-degree program quality assessment is handled by state authorizers, accrediting agencies, and in some instances through Department of Education certification. Education tax benefits, administered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), partially offset some of the costs of higher education for eligible taxpayers. Many education tax benefits are only available to individuals enrolled in a degree program, but three education tax benefits can also be claimed for postsecondary non-degree programs: the Lifetime Learning Credit, the Exclusion for Employer Provided Educational Assistance, and tax-advantaged 529 plan education savings accounts. The Post-9/11 GI Bill and Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses (VET TEC) were originally intended to help veterans enter the civilian workforce. Post-9/11 GI Bill program quality is primarily overseen by state agencies under contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs. VET TEC program quality is assured by withholding 50% of tuition and fees from providers until participants are employed. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Employment & Training (E&T) provides eligible low-income households with employment and education services. E&T funding is administered by state agencies through contracted providers, which receive funds to cover education and other program costs. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant is best known for providing monthly cash assistance to needy families with children but may be used to support subsidized employment, on-the-job training, and training and education programs."
