    "content": "Family Notification of Death in Custody or Life-Threatening Emergency Act of 2017 or Wakiesha's Law This bill requires federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to obtain identifying information about an individual in custody and contact information for the individual's next of kin or designated emergency contact. It establishes minimum standards with respect to notifying the next of kin or designated emergency contact following an individual's death or life-threatening emergency while in custody. The Department of Justice must reduce by 10 the allocation of funds under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program for a state or local government that fails to comply. The bill also amends the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2013 to require a state or federal law enforcement agency to include, in its quarterly report on deaths in custody, additional information such as the date and time that death notification was provided and the date and time of each unsuccessful notification attempt."
