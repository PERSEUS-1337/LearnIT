    "title": "A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permanently extend and modify the low-income housing tax credit.",
    "content": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to make the low-income housing credit permanent. Modifies provisions concerning unused housing credit carryovers by States to allow States to carry over more unused credits from year to year. Provides that a unit shall not fail to be treated as low-income because it is occupied by students or persons enrolled in job training programs under the Job Training Partnership Act. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to waive: (1) any recapture of credit in the case of any de minimis error in complying with tests for qualified low-income housing projects. Or (2) any annual recertification of tenant income if the entire building is occupied by low-income tenants. Determines the adjusted basis of any building by taking into account the adjusted basis of the property used in community activity facilities if: (1) such facilities are designed to serve individuals meeting income requirements for the housing project. And (2) not more than 20 percent of the aggregate eligible basis of all buildings in the project is attributable to the aggregate basis of such facilities. Applies at-risk rules to low-income housing credit property that also qualifies for the historic site rehabilitation credit and to qualified lenders. Adds conditions prohibiting discrimination against Section 8 tenants for purposes of meeting extended low-income housing commitments required to receive credits."
