    "title": "SB 469",
    "content": "Under existing law, the State Athletic Commission Act, the State Athletic Commission has jurisdiction over all professional and amateur boxing, professional and amateur kickboxing, all forms and combinations of forms of full contact martial arts contests, including mixed martial arts, and matches or exhibitions conducted, held, or given within this state. A violation of the act is a crime. Existing law requires the commission to appoint an executive officer. Existing law repeals these provisions establishing the commission and authorizing it to appoint an executive officer on January 1, 2016. This bill would extend those repeal dates to January 1, 2020. Existing law requires the Advisory Committee on Medical and Safety Standards to consist of 6 licensed physicians and surgeons appointed by the commission and authorizes the commission to call meetings at such times and places as it deems appropriate for the purpose of studying and recommending medical and safety standards for the conduct of boxing, wrestling, and martial arts contests. This bill would provide that a majority of the appointed members of the committee constitutes a quorum for the purposes of those meetings. Existing regulation prohibits the administration or use of any drugs, alcohol or stimulants, or injections in any part of the body, either before or during a match, to or by any boxer. Under existing regulation, a person who applies for or holds a license as a professional boxer and who has at any time had a positive drug test confirmed by any commission for any specified substance is required as a condition of licensure or renewal to provide a urine specimen. Further, under existing regulation, a licensed boxer is required to provide a urine specimen for drug testing either before or after the bout, as directed by the commission. This bill would prohibit the administration or use of any drugs, alcohol, stimulants, or injections in any part of the body or the use of any specified prohibited substances by a professional or amateur boxer or martial arts fighter licensed by the commission. Because a violation of this prohibition would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would authorize the commission, subject to the adoption of regulations, to determine the necessity of exemptions to that prohibition. The bill would authorize the commission to conduct testing at any time during the period of licensure to ensure compliance with the prohibition, as provided. The bill would make a licensee in violation of the prohibition subject to a fine of up to 40 of the value of the total purse. Under existing regulation, contracts between boxers and managers and between boxers or managers and licensed clubs are required to be executed on printed forms approved by the commission. Existing regulation authorizes the commission to recognize or enforce a contract not on its printed form if entered into in another jurisdiction. Existing regulation prohibits no other contract or agreement from being recognized or enforced by the commission. Under existing regulation, all disputes between the parties to the contract, including the validity of the contract, are required to be arbitrated pursuant to the provisions of the contract. Under existing regulation, a person who seeks arbitration of a contract dispute is required to send a written request for arbitration to the commission and to the office of the Attorney General, as specified. This bill would codify these regulatory provisions in statute and would authorize the commission to recover the costs for the arbitration from the parties subject to the arbitration. This bill would renumber various enforcement provisions and would make other nonsubstantive changes. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
