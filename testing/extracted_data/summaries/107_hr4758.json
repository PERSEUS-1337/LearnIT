Directs the President to submit to Congress a proposal to bring the budget of the Government into balance or surplus by FY 2007. Makes it out of order for the House or the Senate, whenever the most recent CBO report projects an on-budget deficit for any fiscal year, to consider any concurrent resolution on the budget that: (1) sets forth or assumes an on-budget deficit for any such fiscal year larger than such projection. (2) sets forth or assumes a budget that is not in on-budget balance or surplus within four fiscal years, and is not in on-budget balance or surplus for any covered subsequent fiscal year. Or (3) contains any reduction in social security benefits. Makes it out of order for the House or the Senate, whenever the most recent CBO report projects both on-budget surpluses and deficits for the fiscal years concerned, to consider any concurrent resolution on the budget that: (1) sets forth or assumes an on-budget deficit for any fiscal year for which the CBO projection is for an on-budget surplus or balance. Or (2) contains any reduction in social security benefits. Suspends such requirements during war or low economic growth."
