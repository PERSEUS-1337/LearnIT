Provides for the convening of boards of inquiry to: (1) investigate evidence relating to the disappearance of a person. (2) recommend whether to continue such person in a missing status or make a finding that such person has deserted, is absent without leave, or is dead. And (3) report its recommendations and findings. Provides for the convening of a board of further inquiry, if a board of initial inquiry recommends that such person be continued in a missing status. Directs the Secretary concerned, upon the written request of a member of the immediate family of a missing person who, before the date of the enactment of this Act, was determined by the Secretary to be dead, to: (1) convene a board of further inquiry to determine whether such finding of death should be upheld or such person should be placed in a missing status. And (2) report its findings. Requires the Secretary, within three years after a board of further inquiry recommends a missing status for any person, to reconvene such board to review such status. Directs the Secretary to invite each member of the immediate family of the missing person to board meetings unless attendance would place such member in danger.

(2) no evidence which reasonably suggests that such person is alive is in the possession of the Government. (3) Government representatives have made a complete search of the area where such person was last seen. And (4) Government representatives have checked the records of the government or entity having control over the area where such person was last seen .
