    "content": "This report discusses the Special Inspector General provisions in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA), which was enacted as P.L. 110-343 on October 3, 2008. This act created a Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP). Under EESA, TARP funds may be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase \"troubled assets,\" defined to include both mortgage-related financial instruments and \"any other financial instrument that the Secretary, after consultation with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, determines the purchase of which is necessary to promote financial market stability.\" The broad authorities provided to the SIGTARP by EESA have not changed even though the Secretary of the Treasury has modified the approach to stabilize the financial industry through the TARP. The 111th Congress has passed two bills containing provisions related to SIGTARP. P.L. 111-15 (S. 383/H.R. 1341), the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program Act of 2009, was enacted on April 24, 2009, and addresses the SIGTARP's auditing, investigative, and hiring authorities. P.L. 111-22, the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 (H.R. 1106/S. 895/S. 896), was enacted on May 20, 2009, and contains provisions concerning SIGTARP in the context of public-private investment funds. Other bills addressing the SIGTARP include H.R. 384 (which passed the House on January 21, 2009), H.R. 1242, H.R. 3179, S. 910, and S. 976. This report will compare the duties and authorities of the SIGTARP to those of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) and the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), as well as statutory IGs under the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended (IG Act). The report will also cover the authority that Inspectors General possess to conduct audits and investigations. Finally, the report will provide an overview of the SIGTARP's request to TARP recipients regarding their use or expected use of TARP funds, as well as their plans for following executive compensation limitations, and possible issues raised by the Paperwork Reduction Act."
