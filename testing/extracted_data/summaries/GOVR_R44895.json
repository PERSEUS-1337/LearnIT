    "content": "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps); the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and Central Utah Project (CUP); the Department of Energy (DOE); the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC); and several other independent agencies. DOE typically accounts for about 80% of the bill's total funding. President Trump submitted his FY2018 budget proposal to Congress on May 23, 2017. The budget requests for agencies included in the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill totaled $34.189 billion (including offsets)\u2014$4.261 billion (11.1%) below the FY2017 level. DOE nuclear weapons activities were proposed for a $994 million increase (10.7%). Final FY2018 funding for energy and water development programs was generally increased by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141), which was signed by the President on March 23, 2018. Major Energy and Water Development funding issues for FY2018 include Water Agency Funding Reductions. The Trump Administration requested reductions of 17.2% for the Corps and 14.3% for Reclamation for FY2018. Those cuts were largely rejected by the House, the Senate Appropriations Committee, and the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Termination of Energy Efficiency Grants. DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program and State Energy Program would have been terminated under the FY2018 budget request. The cuts were not included in the Consolidated Appropriation, and were also not approved by the House or by the Senate committee. Reductions in Energy Research and Development. Under the FY2018 budget request, DOE research and development appropriations would have been reduced for energy efficiency and renewable energy (EERE) by 69.6%, nuclear energy by 30.8%, and fossil energy by 58.1%. The House approved most of the reductions in EERE research and development (48.1% cut from FY2017 enacted levels) but largely did not follow the proposed nuclear and fossil energy reductions (4.7% and no cut, respectively). The Senate committee largely did not follow the proposed reductions in EERE, nuclear energy, and fossil energy and instead included reductions of 7.3%, 10.9%, and 16.6%, respectively. Energy R&D funding was increased 12.9% by the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Nuclear Waste Repository. The Administration's budget request would have provided new funding for the first time since FY2010 for a proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV. DOE would have received $110 million to seek an NRC license for the repository, and NRC would have received $30 million to consider DOE's application. DOE would also have received $10 million to develop interim nuclear waste storage facilities. The requested funding for Yucca Mountain and interim storage was not included in the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The House had approved the request but the Senate panel had not. Elimination of Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2014Energy (ARPA-E). The Trump Administration proposed to eliminate funds for new research projects by ARPA-E, and called for terminating the program after currently funded projects were completed. The ARPA-E termination was approved by the House. The Senate committee recommended against the termination, providing $330 million\u2014$24 million above the FY2017 level. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act increased funding for ARPA-E by 15.5%\u2014to $353.3 million. Plutonium Disposition Plant Termination. Construction of the Mixed-Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF), which would make fuel for nuclear reactors out of surplus weapons plutonium, was proposed for termination under the Trump Administration request. The Obama Administration had recommended termination since FY2015, but Congress had provided funds to continue construction. For FY2018, the House bill would have continued construction, but the Senate panel accepted the Administration request to terminate the project. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act conforms to provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-91) that allow DOE to pursue an alternative plutonium disposal program if sufficient cost savings are projected."
