    "title": "An act to amend Section 15645, and to amend, repeal, and add Section 15643, of the Government Code, relating to the State Board of Equalization.",
    "content": "Existing law requires the State Board of Equalization to make surveys in each county and city and county to determine the adequacy of the procedures and practices employed by the county assessor in the valuation of property. Existing law requires the board to proceed with the surveys of the assessment procedures and practices in the several counties and cities and counties as rapidly as feasible, and to repeat or supplement each survey at least once in 5 years. Existing law requires the surveys of the 10 largest counties and cities and counties to include a sampling of assessments of the local assessment rolls, and requires the board, each year, to select at random at least 3 of the remaining counties or cities and counties to conduct a sample of assessments on the local assessment roll in those counties. This bill would eliminate the board\u2019s requirement to select at random at least 3 remaining counties or cities and counties to conduct a sample of assessments on the local assessment roll, and would instead require the board, commencing January 1, 2016, and each of the next 4 calendar years, to survey the assessment procedures of qualified counties or cities and counties and to conduct sample assessments on the local roll of other qualified counties or cities and counties. This bill would define \u201cqualified counties or cities and counties\u201d for these purposes. This bill would additionally require the board to conduct a sample of assessments in a county or city and county that the board determines has significant assessment problems, as specified. This bill would require the qualified counties and cities and counties to be stratified and selected at random by the board, in consultation with the California Assessors\u2019 Association. Existing law requires the board, upon completion of the survey of the procedures and practices of a county assessor, to prepare a written survey report setting forth its findings and recommendations, and requires the board, before preparing its written survey report, to meet with the assessor to discuss and confer on those matters which may be included in the written survey report. Existing law requires the survey report, together with the assessor\u2019s response and the board\u2019s comments, to constitute the final survey report. Existing law requires the final survey report to be issued by the board within 2 years after the date the board began the survey. This bill would require the board, before preparing its written survey report, to notify the former assessor if the survey reviews the former assessor\u2019s procedures and practices, and to also meet with the former assessor, upon his or her request if the survey reviews, to discuss and confer on those matters that may be included in the survey report. This bill would require an addendum to the final survey report to be published to include the former assessor\u2019s written response and the board\u2019s comments, if any. This bill would shorten the period of time the board has to issue the final survey report from 2 years to 15 months for any survey commenced on or after July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017, inclusive, and to 12 months for any survey commenced on or after July 1, 2017."
