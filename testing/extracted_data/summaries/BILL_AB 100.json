    "title": "AB 100",
    "content": "Existing law requires the adopted course of study for grades 7 to 12, inclusive, to include, among other subjects, the social sciences. Existing law requires the State Board of Education, with the assistance of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, to establish a list of textbooks and other instructional materials that highlight the contributions of minorities in the development of California and the United States. Existing law establishes the Instructional Quality Commission and requires the commission to, among other things, recommend curriculum frameworks to the state board. This bill would require the Superintendent to oversee the development of, and the state board to adopt, a model curriculum to ensure quality courses in ethnic studies. The bill would require the Instructional Quality Commission to advise, assist, and make recommendations to the Superintendent regarding the development of the model curriculum. The bill would, beginning the school year following the adoption of the model curriculum, require each school district maintaining grade 9 to offer to all otherwise qualified pupils in that grade, as an elective in the social sciences, a course of study in ethnic studies based on the model curriculum. By imposing additional duties on school districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions. Existing law authorizes certain internship and fellowship programs, as specified. This bill would establish the California Law Fellowship Program for the purpose of offering licensed attorneys and other qualifying law school graduates limited-term placements in public sector positions within state government as California Law Fellows, and encouraging each fellow to seek permanent public-sector employment at the conclusion of his or her fellowship, as specified. Existing law, commonly known as the Code of Ethics, prohibits a Member of the Legislature or an employee of either house of the Legislature from receiving or agreeing to receive, directly or indirectly, any compensation, reward, or gift from any source except the State of California for any service, advice, assistance, or other matter related to the legislative process, except for specified circumstances. This bill would provide that the services of a California Law Fellow are not compensation, a reward, or a gift to a Member of the Legislature for purposes of the so-called Code of Ethics. The bill would also provide that a participant in the program is not an employee of either house of the Legislature for purposes of the Code of Ethics."
