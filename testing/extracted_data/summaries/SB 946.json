    "title": "An act to amend Sections 46300 and 48205 of the Education Code, relating to pupil attendance.",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes a pupil to be excused from school for specified reasons, including for the purpose of serving as a member of a precinct board for an election. Existing law provides that an excused absence for those specified reasons are, nevertheless, absences for the purpose of computing average daily attendance and do not generate state apportionment payments. Existing law also requires that the attendance of pupils participating in independent study for 5 or more consecutive days, as specified, be included in computing the average daily attendance of the school district. This bill would specify that, for the purpose of computing average daily attendance for pupils in independent study, a pupil serving as a member of a precinct board for an election shall not be required to participate in that activity for 5 or more consecutive days if specified requirements are met, and would specify that an absence for those reasons shall not be considered an absence for purposes of generating state apportionment payments. The bill also would delete an obsolete reference and make other nonsubstantive changes."
