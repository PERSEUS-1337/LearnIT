    "content": "National Beverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act of 2001 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit the sale of certain beverages unless the containers carry a refund value of ten cents. Makes unclaimed refunds available to a State for carrying out pollution prevention and recycling programs. Prohibits distributors and retailers from: (1) selling beverages in metal beverage containers with detachable openings. And (2) disposing of containers subject to this Act or any metal, glass, or plastic from such containers in landfills or solid waste disposal facilities. Makes this Act inapplicable to States that have adopted requirements similar to those under this Act or that have demonstrated a recycling or reuse rate for beverage containers of at least 80 percent. Prohibits States or political subdivisions that impose taxes on the sale of beverage containers from imposing any tax on the amount attributable to the refund value."
