    "content": "Nodes residing in different parts of a graph can have similar structural roles within their local network topology. The identification of such roles provides key insight into the organization of networks and can also be used to inform machine learning on graphs. However, learning structural representations of nodes is a challenging unsupervised-learning task, which typically involves manually specifying and tailoring topological features for each node. Here we develop GraphWave, a method that represents each node\u2019s local network neighborhood via a low-dimensional embedding by leveraging spectral graph wavelet diffusion patterns. We prove that nodes with similar local network neighborhoods will have similar GraphWave embeddings even though these nodes may reside in very different parts of the network. Our method scales linearly with the number of edges and does not require any hand-tailoring of topological features. We evaluate performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, obtaining improvements of up to 71% over state-of-the-art baselines. Structural role discovery in graphs focuses on identifying nodes which have topologically similar local neighborhoods (i.e., similar local structural roles) while residing in potentially distant areas of the network FIG0 ). Such alternative definition of node similarity is very different than more traditional notions BID21 BID7 BID30 BID19 BID15 BID8 BID6 , which all assume some notion of \"smoothness\" over the graph and thus consider nodes residing in close network proximity to be similar. Such structural role information about the nodes can be used for a variety of tasks, including as input to machine learning problems, or even to identify key nodes in a system (principal \"influencers\" in a social network, critical hubs in contagion graphs, etc.).When structural roles of nodes are defined over a discrete space, they correspond to different topologies of local network neighborhoods (e.g., edge of a chain, center of a star, a bridge between two clusters). However , such discrete roles must be pre-defined, requiring domain expertise and manual inspection of the graph structure. A more powerful and robust method for identifying structural similarity involves learning a continuous vector-valued structural signature \u03c7 a of each node a in an unsupervised way. This motivates a natural definition of structural similarity in terms of closeness of topological signatures: For any > 0, nodes a and b are defined to be -structurally similar with respect to a given distance if: dist(\u03c7 a , \u03c7 b ) \u2264 . Thus, a robust structural similarity metric must introduce both an appropriate signature and an adequate distance metric.While several methods have been proposed for structural role discovery in graphs, existing approaches are extremely sensitive to small perturbations in the topology and typically lack one or more desirable properties. They often require manually hand-labeling topological features BID12 , rely on non-scalable heuristics BID22 , and/or return a single similarity score instead of a multidimensional structural signature BID13 .Here we address the problem of structure learning on graphs by developing GRAPHWAVE. Building upon techniques from graph signal processing BID4 BID10 BID26 , our approach learns a structural embedding for each node based on the diffusion of a spectral graph wavelet centered at that node. Intuitively, each node propagates a unit of energy over the graph and characterizes its neighboring topology based on the response of the network to While raw spectral graph wavelet signatures/coefficients \u03a8 of a and b might be very different, we treat them as probability distributions and show that the coefficient distributions are indeed similar.this probe. In contrast to prior work that characterizes the wavelet diffusion as a function of the wavelet scaling parameter, we study how the wavelet diffuses through the network at a given scale as a function of the initial source node. We prove that the coefficients of this wavelet directly relate to graph topological properties. Hence, these coefficients contain all the necessary information to recover structurally similar nodes, without requiring the hand-labeling of features. However, the wavelets are, by design, localized on the graph. Therefore to compare structural signatures for nodes that are far away from each other, typical graph signal processing methods (using metrics like correlation between wavelets or 2 distance) cannot be used without specifying an exact one-to-one mapping between nodes for every pairwise comparison, a computationally intractable task.To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel way of treating the wavelets as probability distributions over the graph. This way the structural information is contained in how the diffusion spreads over the network rather than where it spreads. In order to provide vector-valued signatures which can then be used as input to any machine learning algorithm, we embed these wavelet distributions using the empirical characteristic function BID18 . The advantage of empirical characteristic functions is that they capture all the moments of a given distribution. This allows GRAPHWAVE to be robust to small perturbations in the local edge structure, as we prove mathematically. Computational complexity of GRAPHWAVE is linear in the number of edges, thus allowing it to scale to large (sparse) networks. Finally, we compare GRAPHWAVE to several state-of-the-art baselines on both real and synthetic datasets, obtaining improvements of up to 71% and demonstrating how our approach is a useful tool for characterizing structural signatures in graphs.Summary of contributions. The main contributions of our paper are as follows:\u2022 We develop a novel use of spectral graph wavelets by treating them as probability distributions and characterizing the distributions using empirical characteristic functions.\u2022 We leverage these insights to develop a scalable method (GRAPHWAVE) for learning node embeddings based on structural similarity in graphs.\u2022 We prove that GRAPHWAVE accurately recovers structurally similar nodes.Further related work. Prior work on discovering nodes with similar structural roles has typically relied on explicit featurization of nodes. These methods generate an exhaustive listing of each node's local topological properties (e.g., node degree, number of triangles it participates in, number of k-cliques, its PageRank score) before computing node similarities based on such heuristic representations. A notable example of such approaches is RolX BID12 , which aims to recover a soft-clustering of nodes into a predetermined number of K distinct roles using recursive feature extraction BID11 . Similarly, struc2vec BID22 uses a heuristic to construct a multilayered graph based on topological metrics and simulates random walks on the graph to capture structural information. In contrast, our approach does not rely on heuristics (we mathematically prove its efficacy) and does not require explicit manual feature engineering or hand-tuning of parameters.Another line of related work are graph diffusion kernels BID4 which have been utilized for various graph modeling purposes BID17 BID2 BID24 BID29 . However, to the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to apply graph diffusion kernels for determining structural roles in graphs. Kernels have been shown to efficiently capture geometrical properties and have been successfully used for shape detection in the image processing community BID28 BID20 BID0 . However, in contrast to shape-matching problems, GRAPHWAVE considers these kernels as probability distributions over real-world graphs. This is because the graphs that we consider are highly irregular (as opposed to the Euclidean and manifold graphs ). Therefore, traditional wavelet methods, which typically analyze node diffusions across specific nodes that occur in regular and predictable patterns, do not apply. Instead, by treating wavelets as distributions, GRAPHWAVE characterizes the shape of the diffusion, rather than the specific nodes where the diffusion occurs. This key insight allows us to uncover structural signatures and to discover structurally similar nodes. We have developed a new method for learning structural signatures in graphs. Our approach, GRAPHWAVE, uses spectral graph wavelets to generate a structural embedding for each node, which we accomplish by treating the wavelets as a distributions and evaluating the resulting characteristic functions. Considering the wavelets as distributions instead of vectors is a key insight needed to capture structural similarity in graphs.Our method provides mathematical guarantees on the optimality of learned structural signatures. Using spectral graph theory, we prove that structurally equivalent/similar nodes have nearidentical/similar structural signatures in GRAPHWAVE. Experiments on real and synthetic networks provide empirical evidence for our analytical results and yield large gains in performance over stateof-the-art baselines. For future work, these signatures could be used for transfer learning, leveraging data from a well-explored region of the graph to infer knowledge about less-explored regions."
