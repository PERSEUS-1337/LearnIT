    "content": "Clean Safe Reliable Water Infrastructure Act This bill urges Congress to provide robust funding of capitalization grants to states for state drinking water revolving funds and state clean water revolving funds. The bill amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to: (1) make the implementation of source water protection plans an eligible use of assistance from a drinking water state revolving fund. And (2) apply requirements concerning the selection of architects and engineers to contracts funded by state revolving funds, if the assistance is for a community with a population of more than 10,000. The bill provides statutory authority for the Environmental Protection Agency's WaterSense Program that allows water-efficient products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services to bear a WaterSense label. The bill amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to revise and reauthorize through FY2021 the grant program for addressing combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, and stormwater discharges."
