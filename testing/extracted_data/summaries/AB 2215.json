    "title": "An act to amend Section 8880.5 of the Government Code, relating to the California State Lottery Act.",
    "content": "The California State Lottery Act of 1984, enacted by initiative, authorizes a California State Lottery and provides for its operation and administration by the California State Lottery Commission and the Director of the California State Lottery, with certain limitations. The act establishes the California State Lottery Education Fund and provides for direct payments from the fund to various entities, including the Board of Trustees of the California State University. The act requires funds received by the trustees to be deposited in, and expended from, the California State University Lottery Education Fund or, at the discretion of the trustees, deposited in local trust accounts. Existing law establishes the California State University Trust Fund and specifies its sources of revenue. Existing law provides that all money received by the fund shall augment the support appropriation to the California State University for the fiscal year to which the collections apply. This bill would require the trustees to deposit funds received from the California State Lottery Education Fund in the California State University Trust Fund instead of the California State University Lottery Education Fund. The bill would continue to allow the trustees, in their discretion, to deposit the funds in local trust accounts. The California State Lottery Act of 1984, an initiative measure, specifies that none of its provisions may be changed except to further its purpose by a bill passed by a 23 vote of each house of the Legislature and signed by the Governor. This bill would declare that its provisions further the purposes of the act, as specified, and that the act shall not be interpreted to expand the lawful uses of funds allocated from the California State Lottery Education Fund to the trustees."
