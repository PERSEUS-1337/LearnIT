    "content": "The September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon led to the closing the following day of 50 of the nearly 260 U.S. embassiesand consulates worldwide. A week later, however, all U.S. facilities were open for business. Additionally, threeembassies - in Pakistan, Yemen, andTurkmenistan - allowed for voluntary evacuations immediately after the attack. In the months prior to the attack,travel warnings were issued and embassies wereput on high alert as Osama bin Laden had issued vague, but credible, threats against Americans and Americaninterests around the world. Earlier this year, Secretary of State Colin Powell had testified before Congress that embassy security is among his highest priorities. He made the case that theU.S. government owes State Department personnel on the front lines of diplomacy the same high level of tools andsecurity given to our military on the front lines. The Administration requested a total of $1.3 billion for embassy security and worldwide security upgrades forFY2002. The House concurred; the Senate passed atotal of $1.07 billion. Throughout the summer 2001, the United States received credible threats against American embassies and tourists overseas. The Department of State respondedby issuing a worldwide travel warning to American citizens and cancelling Independence Day celebrations atAmerican overseas facilities. In June 2000 the U.S. Embassy in Amman, Jordan was put on full alert after receiving \"credible evidence\" that Osama bin Laden followers were planning toattack it. Additionally, the Department of State advised American travelers to be mindful of the August7th anniversary of the bombing of U.S. embassies inKenya and Tanzania. Then, in September 2000, terrorists attacked the U.S.S. Cole Navy destroyer. The August 7, 1998 terrorist attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania resulted in a number of actions by the Administration and Congress. Withevidence that bin Laden was involved in the attacks, the Administration, on July 4, 1999, imposed sanctions on theTaliban government because it refused tocooperate in his arrest. In October 1999, the UN Security Council imposed limited sanctions on the Taliban, andin August 2000 both the United States andRussia agreed to work together to tighten the sanctions. Embassy security budget ramifications of the 1998 bombings continue. In November 1999, Congress expanded authority for State's FY2000 through FY2004expenditures on overseas security within the Embassy Security, Construction and Maintenance (ESCM)account to $900 million annually, in addition to securityfunds in the Diplomatic and Consular Programs account (D&CP) for FY2000-FY2004 ( P.L.106-113 )."
