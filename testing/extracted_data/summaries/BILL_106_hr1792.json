    "content": "Bipartisan Rural Law Enforcement Crime-Fighting Scholarship Act - Directs the Attorney General, through the Office of Justice Programs and in consultation with the National Center for Rural Law Enforcement at the University of Arkansas, to establish a rural law enforcement scholarship program by providing grants to rural law enforcement agencies and consortia of law enforcement agencies to be used to allow law enforcement officers to observe the advanced strategies and technologies employed by Federal and urban law enforcement agencies to fight gangs, abolish illegal drug trafficking and distribution systems, and create safer neighborhoods and communities. Requires the Attorney General, before grants are awarded, to identify Federal and urban law enforcement agencies willing to allow rural law enforcement officers to observe and to publish a list of those agencies in the Federal Register. Limits each grant award to $2,500 for an individual rural law enforcement agency and $7,500 for a consortium of law enforcement agencies. Allows officers selected for a rural law enforcement scholarship to participate in a particular observation opportunity for a maximum period of one month. Prohibits more than one officer from the same rural law enforcement agency from participating in the program. Permits grants to be used for paying the costs of official travel, lodging, and expenses that participating law enforcement officers incur. Directs the Attorney General to report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees on the success of participating rural law enforcement agencies in employing strategies or technology observed. Authorizes appropriations."
