    "content": "The loss of retirement assets held in Enron stock by Enron employees has stimulated proposals to restrict the holding of employer stock in retirement plans, and other proposals to regulate theseplans. Stock in the Enron plan came from firm contributions in the form of stock that was notallowed to be sold and from voluntary investment by employees. This report focuses on rationalesfor providing employer retirement plans and for holding (or not holding) employer stock in theseplans, both from the perspective of the private sector and of government policy. Retirement plans fall into two types: defined benefit plans, where a pension based on earningsand years of service is provided; and defined contribution plans, where individuals receive benefitsbased on accumulated principal and interest. Either plan can hold employer stock, but holdings arelimited to 10% of assets in the case of defined benefit plans. These plans receive tax subsidies, asdo employee stock purchase plans and certain types of stock options. The analysis suggests that there are economic reasons that firms and employees may engage in pension and profit sharing (or stock ownership) plans even in the absence of tax subsidies. Pensionplans, primarily defined benefit plans, may be attractive for administrative and risk-reductionreasons, for dealing with inadequate investment in on-the-job training, and for smoothing theretirement of older workers. Stock options and stock ownership plans may be useful for addressinginconsistency in objectives between shareholders and managers and worker monitoring problems,although these benefits are not likely to accrue to stock ownership by the rank and file of largecompanies. These employee stock ownership plans may also deter hostile takeovers, which mayundermine economic efficiency and stockholder interests. Stock contributions are also popularbecause they do not reduce cash flow, which has both benefits and costs from an economic efficiencyperspective. Government subsidies to plans may be justified to increase retirement incomes and access to annuities because of a shortfall in optimal savings and certain economic problems with self selectionin purchasing annuities. These objectives also underlie the justification of Social Security. Pursuingthese goals may actually conflict with another worthy objective, on-the-job training. However,objectives that are addressed via employee stock ownership do not appear important in shaping thenature of large, broadly-based, retirement plans. Diversification of plan assets and prudentinvestment portfolios do appear consistent with rationales for government intervention. Attempts to address this issue might take several forms: restrictions on shares of employer stock in plans, prohibiting employer stock contributions or lifting restrictions on sale, denying a taxdeduction on employer contributions until they could be sold, and requiring independent investmentadvice. The last proposal is not costless and could undermine participation for small firms. Foradministrative and other reasons, it may be rational to impose share restrictions on allocations ofcontributions, rather than on assets. There are no plans to update this report."
