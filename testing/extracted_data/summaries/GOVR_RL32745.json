    "content": "In calling for a clear, strong, and long-term commitment to the military-dominatedgovernment of Pakistan despite serious concerns about that country's nuclear proliferation activities,The 9/11 Commission cast into sharp relief two long-standing dilemmas concerning U.S. policytowards Pakistan and South Asia. First, in an often strained security relationship spanning more thanfive decades, U.S. and Pakistani national security objectives have seldom been congruent. Pakistanhas viewed the alliance primarily in the context of its rivalry with India, whereas Americanpolicymakers have viewed it from the perspective of U.S. global security interests. Second, U.S.nuclear nonproliferation objectives towards Pakistan (and India) repeatedly have been subordinatedto other important U.S. goals. During the 1980s, Pakistan exploited its key role as a conduit for aidto the anti-Soviet Afghan mujahidin to avoid U.S. nuclear nonproliferation sanctions and receivesome $600 million annually in U.S. military and economic aid. Underscoring Pakistan's differentagenda, some of the radical Islamists favored by its military intelligence service later formed thecore of Al Qaeda and the Taliban. A crucial U.S. policy challenge is to gain Pakistani cooperation in shutting down theextensive illicit nuclear supplier network established in the 1990s by the self-designated \"father\" ofPakistan's nuclear bomb, Abdul Qadir Khan, which provided nuclear enrichment technology to Iran,Libya, and North Korea, while at the same time supporting stability in Pakistan and gaining itsmaximum cooperation against terrorism. To date, the Administration appears largely to haveacquiesced in Pakistan's refusal to allow access to Khan by U.S. intelligence officials. TheAdministration has been equally reluctant to publicly criticize the Musharraf government's apparentuse of international arms dealers to obtain controlled U.S. dual-use technology for its own nuclearweapons program, in violation of U.S. law. The 109th Congress has been asked by the Administration to provide some $698 million inmilitary and economic assistance to Pakistan for FY2006, part of a five-year, $3 billion aid package. Some Members of Congress have expressed concern that, as during the 1980s, the urgent need forPakistan's cooperation will prevent the Administration from dealing forcefully with its nuclearproliferation activities, and have introduced legislation that seeks to make U.S. assistance contingenton Pakistan's cooperation on nuclear proliferation. This report: (1) briefly recounts previous failed efforts to reconcile American nuclearnonproliferation and other security objectives regarding Pakistan; (2) documents A.Q. Khan's role,whether with or without official involvement, in supplying nuclear technology to \"rogue\" states andhow these activities escaped detection by U.S. intelligence agencies; (3) considers issues regardingthe objectives, and viability of the military-dominated government of President Pervez Musharraf;and, (4) outlines and evaluates several U.S. options for seeking to gain more credible cooperationfrom Pakistan's regarding its nuclear activities while still maintaining effective counterterroristcooperation. This report will not be further updated."
