    "content": "Much of the U.S. critical infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to cyber-attack. Industrial control computer systems involved in this infrastructure are specific points of vulnerability, as cyber-security forthese systems has not been previously perceived as a high priority. Industry sectorspotentially affected by a cyber-attack on process control systems include the electrical, telephone,water, chemical, and energy sectors. The federal government has issued warnings regarding increases in terrorist interest in the cyber-security of industrial control systems, citing international terrorist organization interest incritical infrastructure and increases in cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure computer systems. Thepotential consequences of a successful cyber-attack on critical infrastructure industrial controlsystems range from a temporary loss of service to catastrophic infrastructure failure affectingmultiple states for an extended duration. The National Strategy for Securing Cyberspace , released in February 2003, contains a number of suggestions regarding security measures for control systems. A focus on the further integrationof public/private partnerships and information sharing is described, along with suggestions thatstandards for securing control systems be developed and implemented. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 ) transferred and integrated several federal entities that play a role in cyber-security of control systems into the Department of HomelandSecurity. These entities include the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office, the NationalInfrastructure Protection Center, the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center, andparts of the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Assurance. Additionally, the HomelandSecurity Act of 2002 created a new class of information, critical infrastructure information, whichcan be withheld from the public by the federal government. Efforts in increasing the cyber-security of control systems occur both at federal government facilities and, in critical infrastructure sectors, through industry groups. The Department of EnergyNational Laboratories, the Department of Defense, and the National Institute of Standards andTechnology all have programs to assess and ameliorate the cyber-vulnerabilities of control systems. Industry-based research into standards, best practices, and control system encryption is ongoing inthe natural gas and electricity sector. Possible policy options for congressional consideration include further development of uniform standards for infrastructure cyber-protection; growth in research into security methods for industrialcontrol systems; assessing the effectiveness of the new exemptions to the Freedom of InformationAct; and the integration of previous offices in the new Department of Homeland Security. This report will be updated as events warrant."
