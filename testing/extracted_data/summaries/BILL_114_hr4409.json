The FTC must establish four categories of such labels, to be known as America Star labels, which may be used to designate products: (1) that satisfy the standard for an unqualified US origin claim set forth by the FTC in the Enforcement Policy Statement on US Origin Claims. Or (2) for which not less than 90, 80, or 70 of the total cost of manufacturing is attributable to US costs. The FTC must promulgate regulations for such labels and enforce such regulations under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The bill also preempts certain state law requirements relating to the use of quot, Made in the USA. quot, or quot, Made in Americaquot. Labels. The preemption provisions provide for: (1) the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to supersede state laws that impose more stringent requirements, and (2) FTC regulations under this bill to supersede state laws."
