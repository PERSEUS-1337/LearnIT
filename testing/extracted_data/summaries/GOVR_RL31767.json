    "content": "International child labor has become an increasingly important issue in discussions concerninginternational trade, human rights and foreign aid. While a number of international, national and localinitiatives seek to abolish the practice, there continues to be a debate on what constitutes child labor. Some consider any work undertaken by children to be child labor, while others may use the term torefer to work under abusive conditions. The International Labor Organization (ILO) defines childlabor as a form of work that is inherently hazardous, employs children below the internationallyrecognized minimum age, or is exploitative. Child labor is used in this report as defined by the ILO. According to the ILO about 246 million children were engaged in child labor in 2000. Some 186million child laborers were below the age of 15, and approximately 110 million were below the ageof 12. While awareness of the issue has increased, the ability to address the complex problem has been complicated by a number of related issues including, rising poverty, surging HIV/AIDS infectionrates, and a lack of relevant education. News stories have featured children working in exportindustries (such as textiles, clothing, carpets and footwear) and caused international uproar. Whilethe news stories have contributed to a heightened awareness about the problem of international childlabor, the ILO has found that child workers in export industries are relatively few compared to thoseemployed in activities geared to domestic consumption. Congressional support for the abolition of international child labor, particularly the worst formsof child labor, is very strong. Congress has funded programs to combat international child labor,initiated bills that expand the United States' role in the global fight against child labor, and includedclauses that require action on eliminating child labor in international trade agreements. AlthoughCongress has consistently boosted American efforts to eliminate child labor world-wide, there area number of issues that continue to impede these efforts, including: ineffective enforcementmechanisms; sparse monitoring systems; and insufficient funding for programs that alleviatepoverty, decrease incidences of HIV/AIDS, and increase access to relevant education. This reportwill discuss the ILO definition of child labor, outline the scope of the problem, explain thedifficulties in eliminating it, describe U.S. and international efforts to counter exploitative childlabor, and present some issues Congress may consider. This report will be updated as events warrant."
