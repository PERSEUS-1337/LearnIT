    "content": "The Capitol Visitor Center (CVC), which opened to the public on December 2, 2008, was designed to enhance the security, educational experience, and comfort of those visiting the U.S. Capitol. The decision to build a subterranean facility beneath the East Front Plaza, largely invisible from an exterior perspective, was made so the structure would not compete with, or detract from, the appearance and historical architectural integrity of the Capitol. The project's designers sought to integrate the new structure with the landscape of the East Capitol Grounds and ultimately recreate the park-like setting intended by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted Sr. in his historic 1874 design for the site. Estimates for the cost of the center were as high as $621 million, although the FY2011 appropriations act subsequently included a $14.6 million rescission. The project was financed with appropriated funds and $65 million from private donations and revenue generated by the sale of commemorative coins. In March 1999, the Architect of the Capitol was authorized $2.8 million to coordinate a team of architects, engineers, and consultants to review and revalidate a 1995 study of the site selection and project design. In order to simplify the approval process for the design and construction phases, Congress transferred authority for these functions to the United States Capitol Preservation Commission in September 1999. Three months later, a revised conceptual design for the center was approved by the commission. A design and engineering obligation plan was approved by the House and Senate legislative appropriations subcommittees in November 1999 and January 2000, respectively. On January 31, 2000, design development work began, and in mid-October 2000, the United States Capitol Preservation Commission approved the final design plan for the center. Subsequently, a construction management firm was hired to oversee the project; an $8 million contract was awarded to relocate utility lines; a $99.9 million contract was awarded for Sequence 1 (foundation/structural work); and a $144.2 million contract was awarded for Sequence 2 (electrical, mechanical, plumbing, and finishing work). Additionally, a firm also was retained to oversee the development of the CVC exhibition gallery; a tree maintenance contractor was hired to help assure the protection of trees on the East Capitol Grounds; historic preservation workers temporarily removed historic Olmsted landscape features from the grounds for their protection; and temporary visitor screening facilities and media sites were constructed. Throughout the entire construction of the nearly 580,000 square foot underground facility, the project was monitored by congressional committees, which held numerous oversight and appropriations request hearings.
