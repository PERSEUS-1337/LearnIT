    "content": "Second Amendment Preservation Act of 2002 - Amends the Federal criminal code to: (1) limit the plaintiff's attorney fees in connection with the settlement or adjudication of a civil action brought to curtail the sale or availability of firearms for legal purposes to the lesser of $150 per hour plus actual expenses or ten percent of the amount that the plaintiff receives. And (2) require the plaintiff to reimburse the defendant for reasonable attorney's fees and court costs if the court finds that the defendant is not wholly or primarily liable, unless special circumstances make such reimbursement unjust. Defines such action as one brought against a firearms manufacturer, importer, or dealer seeking damages in excess of $1 million or 50 percent of the defendant's net assets and seeking to hold such defendant liable for damages caused by the unlawful or tortious use of a firearm by a person not employed by or affiliated with the defendant. Makes any court decision that the Constitution does not confer on Congress the power to enact this Act directly appealable to the Supreme Court."
