    "content": "Child Safety Device Act of 2004 - Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to prohibit any licensed firearms importer, manufacturer, or dealer from selling, delivering, or transferring a handgun to any person other than a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer, unless the transferee is provided with a locking device for that handgun. Makes an exception where the transferee is a Federal, State, or local government, a law enforcement officer, or a rail police officer. Subjects violators to license suspension or revocation or to a civil penalty of up to $15,000, or both. Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission to establish a consumer product safety standard that requires that such locking devices: (1) are sufficiently difficult for children to deactivate or remove. And (2) prevent the discharge of the handgun unless the device has been activated or removed."
