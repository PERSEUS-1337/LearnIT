And (2) standardize and streamline data reporting and processes across regions and areas for the purpose of maintaining such works. Requires such Report to include: (1) a detailed assessment of major repair and rehabilitation needs for all such works. And (2) an itemized list of major repair and rehabilitation needs of individual Reclamation facilities at each Reclamation project, including a budget level cost estimate of appropriations needed to complete each item and an assignment of a categorical rating for each item consistent with existing uniform categorization systems to inform the annual budget process and agency requirements. Directs the Secretary to: (1) coordinate with the non-federal entities responsible for the operation and maintenance of transferred works in developing reporting requirements for Asset Management Reports regarding the condition of, and planned maintenance for, transferred works.
