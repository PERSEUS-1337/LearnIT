    "title": "529 and ABLE Account Improvement Act of 2016",
    "content": "and ABLE Account Improvement Act of 2016 This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to modify the tax treatment of qualified tuition programs and ABLE accounts. The bill excludes from gross income a fringe benefit consisting of up to $100 per year of employer contributions to an employee's 529 or ABLE account. The employer contribution must be made: (1) to an account for which the designated beneficiary is the employee or a member of the employee's family, and (2) in connection with a payroll deduction contribution program established by the employer. The bill also: (1) expands the tax credit for small employer pension plan startup costs to include the costs of establishing a payroll deduction contribution program for 529 plans and ABLE accounts. (2) permits 529 funds to be used for transfers to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), education loan payments, or charitable contributions without being subject to the additional tax for distributions that are not used for qualified higher education expenses. And (3) permits tax-free rollovers of funds between 529 and ABLE accounts for the benefit of the same beneficiary or a family member of the beneficiary. For the purpose of current law restrictions on the frequency of investment directions that a beneficiary or contributor may provide for a 529 or ABLE account, rebalancing investments among broad-based investment strategies established under the program is not an investment direction unless the beneficiary or contributor directs the specific investments within the strategies."
