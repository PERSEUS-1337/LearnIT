Over the past decade, the number of passenger vehicle auto deaths has declined slightly, even as more drivers have been driving more vehicles more miles. But the number of motorcycle fatalities has more than doubled over the past decade, to 4,810 in 2006\u00e2\u0080\u0094representing 14% of all passenger vehicle occupant deaths. Annual motorcycle fatalities are now more that double the number of annual deaths from aviation, rail, marine, and pipeline accidents combined. While part of this increase can be attributed to an increase in the number of motorcyclists, the number of fatalities is increasing at a greater rate than the overall increase in ridership\u00e2\u0080\u0094the number of fatalities has increased by 116% in the past decade, while the number of registered motorcycles increased by 63%. The increase in fatalities has continued in spite of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)'s publication in 2000 of the National Agenda for Motorcycle Safety, a plan for reducing motorcycle accidents and fatalities. The motorcycle industry expects the growth in motorcycle sales to continue, so the total number of motorcycle fatalities may continue to increase, barring new safety measures. A clear understanding of the factors involved in motorcycle crashes is needed in order to develop effective safety measures to reduce the rate of motorcycle crashes. NHTSA has detailed information about the characteristics of fatal motorcycle crashes, but not about causes of the crashes. The last major study of the causes of motorcycle crashes in the United States was published in 1981. Since that time, the motorcycle rider population and the characteristics of both the motorcycle and passenger vehicle fleet have changed. Congress has authorized another major study of the causes of motorcycle crashes; the results of this study are expected in 2010. Congress has also authorized a motorcycle safety grant program promoting rider education and training and motorist awareness of motorcyclists, and established a Motorcycle Advisory Commission to advise DOT on infrastructure issues of concern to motorcyclists. According to NHTSA, the single most effective safety measure to reduce motorcycle fatalities is to wear a helmet that meets DOT standards; such helmets are estimated to reduce fatalities by 37%. Helmets also reduce the severity and cost of injuries received in motorcycle crashes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia currently have universal helmet laws requiring all motorcyclists to wear helmets; most other states only require minors to wear helmets. The National Transportation Safety Board has recommended that all states adopt universal helmet laws. Universal helmet laws have been controversial. Congress has twice adopted and then repealed incentives promoting universal helmet laws, most recently repealing the incentives in 1995. These incentives were effective in getting states to adopt universal helmet laws, and the laws proved effective in promoting helmet use. After each repeal, the number of states with universal helmet laws declined. Surveys indicate that 58% of motorcycle riders wore a helmet in 2007, up from 51% in 2006, but down from 64% in 1996. This report will be updated as warranted."
