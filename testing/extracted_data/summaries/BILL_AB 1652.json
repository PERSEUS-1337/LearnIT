    "title": "AB 1652",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes a school district governing board, a county board of education, or the State Board of Education to grant a charter to a charter school for an initial period not to exceed 5 years followed by renewals every 5 years. This bill would provide that each of the first 2 renewals shall be for a period of 5 years and subsequent renewals shall be for a period requested by the charter school not to exceed 15 years. To the extent this bill would impose additional duties on school districts or county offices of education, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
