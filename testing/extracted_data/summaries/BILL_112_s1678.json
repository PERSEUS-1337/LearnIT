    "content": "Saving Fishing Jobs Act of 2011 - Amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, with respect to multispecies fishing permits in the Gulf of Mexico, to remove a provision limiting the eligible signers of a petition to the Secretary of Commerce requesting that the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Council or Councils be authorized to initiate the development of a limited access privilege program to only those participants who have substantially fished the species proposed to be included in the program. Sets forth procedures for the Secretary to: (1) certify a fishery management plan requested by a percentage of eligible fisherman to establish a limited access privilege program to harvest in fisheries under the authority of the New England, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, or Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. (2) terminate such a program in effect on or established after enactment of this Act for a fishery under the authority of such Councils when, within specified periods, the number of eligible fishermen is at least 15 less than the number of such fishermen previously in the fishery. And (3) collect fees, including observer costs, pursuant to modified fee-setting requirements for such programs. Directs the appropriate Council, within a one-year period, to develop an alternative fishery management plan for any such terminated program."
