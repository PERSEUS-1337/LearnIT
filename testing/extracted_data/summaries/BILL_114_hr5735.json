    "content": "Protecting Girls' Access to Education in Vulnerable Settings Act This bill expresses the sense of Congress that it is critical to ensure that children, particularly girls, displaced by conflicts overseas are able to receive a quality education and that the educational needs of women and girls are considered in implementing US foreign assistance policies and programs. The Department of State and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) may advance programs that: provide safe, quality, primary and secondary education for displaced children. Build the capacity of institutions in countries hosting displaced people to prevent displaced children from facing educational discrimination. And help increase the access of displaced children, especially girls, to educational, economic, and entrepreneurial opportunities. The State Department and USAID may: coordinate with multilateral organizations to work with foreign governments to implement programs and policies that collect data disaggregated by sex and age on displaced people. And work with domestic and foreign private sector and civil society organizations to promote safe, quality, primary and secondary education for displaced children."
