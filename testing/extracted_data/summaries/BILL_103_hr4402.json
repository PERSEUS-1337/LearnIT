    "content": "Timber Fair Trade and Forest Conservation Act of 1994- Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to require the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), in order to determine whether a critical shortage exists of unprocessed timber, or of any species or grade of unprocessed timber, for domestic manufacturing, to monitor: (1) exports of, and contracts to export, unprocessed timber. And (2) domestic supplies of such unprocessed timber for domestic manufacturing purposes. Requires the Secretary to impose quantitative restrictions on the export of unprocessed timber in any State or region where a critical shortage exists. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Congress specified quarterly reports. Requires the Secretary, whenever such export restrictions are imposed, to give preference in the allocation of export licenses to persons who own or have ownership interests in fewer than 3,000 acres of forest land. Authorizes the President to suspend such export restrictions if a ruling is issued under the formal dispute resolution procedures of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) finding that they violate GATT Article XI prohibitions on export restrictions and are not allowable under such Article's exceptions. Directs the Secretary to impose quantitative restrictions on exports of unprocessed timber from Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, and Montana."
