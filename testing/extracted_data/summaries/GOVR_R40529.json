    "content": "The use of biomass as an energy feedstock has regularly been presented as a potentially viable alternative to address U.S. energy security concerns, foreign oil dependence, and rural economic development, and as a tool to possibly help improve the environment (e.g., through greenhouse gas emission reduction). Biomass (organic matter that can be converted into energy) may include food crops, crops grown specifically to produce energy (e.g., switchgrass or prairie perennials), crop residues, wood waste and byproducts, and animal manure. Most legislation involving biomass has focused on encouraging the production of liquid fuels from corn. Efforts to promote the use of biomass for power generation have focused on wood, wood residues, and milling waste. Comparatively less emphasis has been placed on the use of non-corn-based biomass feedstocks\u2014other food crops, non-food crops, crop residues, animal manure, and more\u2014as renewable energy sources for liquid fuel use or for power generation. This is partly due to the variety, lack of availability, and dispersed location of non-corn-based biomass feedstock. The technology development status and costs to convert non-corn-based biomass into energy are also viewed by some as obstacles to rapid technology deployment. To aid in understanding the role of biomass as an energy resource, this report investigates the characterization of biomass in legislation. For over 30 years, the term biomass has been a part of legislation enacted by Congress for various programs, indicating some interest by the general public and policy makers in expanding its use. Biomass-related legislation has provided financial incentives to develop technologies that use biomass. How biomass is defined influences decisions about the types of crops that are grown, where they are grown, and potential preferred energy uses, among other things. There have been 14 biomass definitions included in legislation and in the tax code since 2004. Future discussions about energy\u2014particularly legislation involving the Renewable Fuel Standard, energy tax incentives, or tribal biomass demonstration projects\u2014may prompt further discussion about the definition of biomass. For example, one point of contention regarding the biomass definition and the Renewable Fuel Standard is whether the term should be defined to include biomass from federal lands. Some argue that removal of biomass from these lands may lead to ecological harm. Others contend that biomass from federal lands can aid the production of renewable energy to meet certain mandates (e.g., the Renewable Fuel Standard) and that removal of biomass can enhance forest protection from wildfires. Bills introduced in the 113th Congress (e.g., H.R. 4426, H.R. 4956, H.R. 3084, S. 1267) would have modified the biomass definition. However, little legislative action occurred regarding the definition of biomass in the 113th Congress. This report lists biomass definitions enacted by Congress in legislation and the tax code since 2004, and discusses the similarities and differences among the definitions."
