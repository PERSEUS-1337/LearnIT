    "content": "The FY2007 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill includes funding for the Department of the Interior (DOI), except for the Bureau of Reclamation, and for two agencies within other departments\u2014the Forest Service within the Department of Agriculture and the Indian Health Service within the Department of Health and Human Services. It also includes funding for arts and cultural agencies; the Environmental Protection Agency, which was recently transferred to the appropriations subcommittees that deal with Interior and Related Agencies; and numerous other entities and agencies. On June 29, 2006, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported H.R. 5386 (S.Rept. 109-275), providing $26.05 billion for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies for FY2007, $110.8 million (0.4%) above the House-passed level ($25.94 billion). The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported level would have been a $384.0 million (1%) decrease from the FY2006 enacted level of $26.44 billion, but a $522.8 million (2%) increase over the President's request for FY2007 of $25.53 billion. Among the proposed decreases in the Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bill for FY2007, from the FY2006 level, were the following: $-209.5 million (9%) for the National Park Service (NPS); $-153.5 million (10%) for the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS); $-123.6 million (3%) for the Forest Service (FS); and $-108.5 million (1%) for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Among the increases for FY2007 were the following: $147.5 million (5%) for the Indian Health Service (IHS); $50.2 million (3%) for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM); and $29.3 million (5%) for the Smithsonian Institution. The Senate Appropriations Committee adopted a few amendments in addition to a Manager's package. One sought to require the Secretary of the Interior to re-negotiate leases for Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) oil and gas lease sales where no royalties are currently being paid, and to include the price thresholds that were inadvertently left out of leases from 1998 and 1999. A second amendment, similar to House-passed language, would have prohibited funds in the bill from being used to issue new lease sales to current OCS oil and gas lessees who do not have price thresholds in their leases. The Senate did not consider H.R. 5386, and Congress did not enact a regular annual appropriations law for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies for FY2007. Instead, funds were included in P.L. 110-5, the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution for FY2007. The law provides funding for FY2007 essentially at the FY2006 account levels, except where otherwise stated. Funding below the account level is being determined by the agencies."
