    "title": "A bill to amend the Fair Housing Act.",
    "content": "Amends the Fair Housing Act to state that first amendment-protected conduct or membership and court actions to enforce Federal, State, or local law shall not constitute housing discrimination under such Act. Prohibits, in a housing discrimination proceeding against a governmental official, the admission as evidence that such official: (1) received information pertaining to the protected membership of another person. Or (2) was the subject of a housing discrimination court action. Requires any housing discrimination enforcement guideline to make explicit that protected conduct or membership shall not be restricted nor constitute evidence of discrimination. Prohibits administrative enforcement unless the complaint describes the practice in sufficient detail to enable the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to determine that such practice is not first amendment-protected. Provides sanctions for impermissible complaints."
