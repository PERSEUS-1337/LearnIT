    "content": "The President makes appointments to positions within the federal government, either using authorities granted to the President alone or with the advice and consent of the Senate. There are some 149 full-time leadership positions on 34 federal regulatory and other collegial boards and commissions for which the Senate provides advice and consent. This report identifies all nominations submitted to the Senate for full-time positions on these 34 boards and commissions during the 112th Congress. Information for each board and commission is presented in profiles and tables. The profiles provide information on leadership structures and statutory requirements (such as term limits and party balance requirements). The tables include full-time positions confirmed by the Senate, pay levels for these positions, incumbents as of the end of the 112th Congress, incumbents' parties (where balance is required), and appointment action within each executive department. Additional summary information across all 34 boards and commissions appears in the appendix. During the 112th Congress, the President submitted 76 nominations to the Senate for full-time positions on regulatory boards and commissions (most of the remaining positions on these boards and commissions were not vacant during that time). Of these 76 nominations, 45 were confirmed, 8 were withdrawn, and 23 were returned to the President. The President also made three recess appointments to full-time positions on a regulatory board. At the end of the 112th Congress, 26 incumbents were serving past the expiration of their terms. In addition, there were 20 vacancies among the 149 positions. Information for this report was compiled using the Senate nominations database of the Legislative Information System (LIS) at http://www.lis.gov/nomis/, the Congressional Record (daily edition), the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents, telephone discussions with agency officials, agency websites, the United States Code, and the 2012 Plum Book (United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions). This report will not be updated."
