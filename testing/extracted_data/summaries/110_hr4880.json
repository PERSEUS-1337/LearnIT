And (2) equal access to the state-funded and LEA-funded preschool programs, appropriate secondary education and support services, and before- and after-school programs for which they are eligible, including extracurricula activities. Requires SEA- or LEA-provided transportation to the school of origin for such a child or youth only in certain circumstances, and only if the SEA or LEA is reimbursed by the responsible child welfare agency or other entity."
