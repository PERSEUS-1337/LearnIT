    "title": "An act to amend Section\n1793.22\n1793.2\nof the Civil Code, relating to consumer protection.",
    "content": "Existing law requires a manufacturer of consumer goods sold in this state for which the manufacturer has made an express warranty to maintain sufficient service and repair facilities reasonably close where its goods are sold to carry out the terms of those warranties or to designate and authorize independent repair or service facilities to fulfill this purpose. Existing law requires a manufacturer that is unable to service or repair a new motor vehicle to conform to the express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts to replace the vehicle or promptly make restitution. Existing law requires a manufacturer, in the case of a replacement, to also pay other specified costs, including reasonable repair, towing, and rental car costs actually incurred by the buyer. This bill, in the case of a new motor vehicle replacement as described above, would require the manufacturer to pay the lesser of reasonable repair, towing, and rental car costs and those costs actually incurred by the buyer. Existing law, the Tanner Consumer Protection Act, establishes a presumption that a reasonable number of attempts have been made to conform a new motor vehicle to the applicable express warranties if, within 18 months from delivery or 18,000 miles on the odometer, whichever occurs first, one or more conditions occur. This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to these provisions."
