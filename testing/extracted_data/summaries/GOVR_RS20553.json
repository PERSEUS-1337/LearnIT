    "content": "Since the mid-1990s, EPA has initiated actions resulting in regulatory mandatesand enforcement actions directed primarily at coal-fired electric generating utilities. These actions would, ifimplemented,substantially reduce air pollutants, particularly nitrogen oxides (NOx). These initiatives include the OzoneTransport Rule(also called the NOx SIP Call); a set of \"Section 126 petitions\" in which 12 states allege under Section 126 of theClean AirAct (CAA) that pollutants originating in upwind states prevent their attainment of clean air standards; and a set ofenforcement actions based on New Source Review (NSR) requirements of the CAA that have resulted in lawsuitsagainstseveral utilities and an administrative order against the Tennessee Valley Authority. Although these are separateinitiatives,they are related in that each ultimately focuses on emissions from utilities in the Midwest and South. As of January22,2001, the EPA has declared 11 states and the District of Columbia as failing to submit revised SIPs required undertheOzone Transport Rule; the EPA has approved four section 126 petitions; and two of the NSR lawsuits have resultedinconsent decrees (Tampa Electric Co. and PSEG), and two others have been settled in principle (Virginia Power andCinergy). In June 2002, the Bush Administration recommended new rulemaking be commenced on the definitionof\"routine maintenance\": a key point of contention in the lawsuits. Legislative activity focuses on multi-pollutantstrategiesas an alternative to these piecemeal initiatives. In June 2002, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committeereported out S. 556 - a comprehensive, multi-pollutant reduction bill. This report will be updated as eventswarrant."
