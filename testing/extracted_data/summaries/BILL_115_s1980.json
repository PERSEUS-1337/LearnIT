The bill defines renewable chemical as any chemical that: (1) is produced in the United States from renewable biomass. (2) is sold or used for the production of chemical products, polymers, plastics, or formulated products or as chemicals, polymers, plastics, or formulated products, (3) has a biobased content of not less than 95. (4) is the product of, or reliant upon, biological or thermal conversion of renewable biomass. (5) is not sold or used for the production of any food, feed, or fuel. And (6) is not a chemical for which either of the tax credits established by this bill have been claimed by the taxpayer in any taxable year. The bill requires the Department of the Treasury to establish a program to allocate renewable chemical tax credit amounts to eligible taxpayers and imposes an aggregate limit on the amount of credits that may be allocated to not more than $500 million during the 5-year period after enactment of this bill. The amount of the credits that may be allocated to any taxpayer for any taxable year may not exceed $25 million."
