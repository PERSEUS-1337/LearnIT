    "content": "This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on September 9, 2013. Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2013 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) US ability to attract foreign direct investment is directly linked to US long-term economic prosperity, global competitiveness, and security. (2) it is a top national priority to enhance US global competitiveness, prosperity, and security by removing unnecessary barriers to foreign direct investment and the US jobs it creates and promoting policies to ensure the United States remains the premier global destination in which to invest, hire, innovate, and manufacture products. (3) maintaining the US commitment to open investment policy encourages other countries to reciprocate and enables the United States to open new markets abroad for US companies and their products. (4) US policies regarding foreign direct investment should reflect national security interests and should not disadvantage domestic investors or companies. And (5) US efforts to attract foreign direct investment should be consistent with efforts to maintain and improve the US standard of living. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Federal Interagency Investment Working Group and the heads of other relevant federal agencies, to conduct an interagency review of the US global competitiveness in attracting foreign direct investment and report to Congress recommendations for increasing that US global competitiveness without weakening labor, consumer, financial, or environmental protections."
