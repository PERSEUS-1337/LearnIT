    "content": "The Bush Administration completed its congressionally-mandated Nuclear Posture Review in December 2001. The review led to major changes in U.S. nuclear policy. It found that the Cold Warrelationship with Russia was \"very inappropriate\" and that this nation must be able to deal with newthreats. It planned to retain Cold War-era nuclear weapons, which would suffice for manycontingencies, though at reduced numbers. To complement these weapons so as to improve U.S.ability to deal with new, more dispersed threats in various countries, the Administration sought toexplore additional nuclear capabilities. Accordingly, the FY2004 request included four nuclear weapon initiatives: (1) rescinding the ban that Congress imposed in 1993 on R&D on low-yield nuclear weapons; (2) $6 million for theAdvanced Concepts Initiative (ACI) to begin certain studies of weapon-related science andtechnology; (3) $15 million to continue a study of the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), inwhich an existing bomb would be converted into a weapon able to penetrate into the ground beforedetonating to improve its ability to destroy buried targets; and (4) $25 million to enable the UnitedStates to conduct a nuclear test within 18 months of a presidential order to test, and for relatedpurposes, as compared with the current 24-36 month time that was set shortly after the end of theCold War. Congress acted on these requests in the FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act( P.L. 108-136 ), and acted on the latter three in the FY2004 Energy and Water DevelopmentAppropriations Act ( P.L. 108-137 ). For FY2005, the Administration requests $9.0 million for ACI,$27.6 million for RNEP, and $30.0 million for improving nuclear test readiness. These initiatives are controversial. Supporters claim that the first three initiatives would enhance deterrence, thereby reducing the risk of war, and that some weapons that might result fromthe initiatives could enable the United States to destroy key targets in nations that may pose a threat. Critics are concerned that these initiatives would lead to nuclear testing, increase the risk of nuclearproliferation, and make U.S. use of nuclear weapons more likely. Regarding enhanced test readiness,the Administration argues that nuclear testing might be needed, for example, to check fixes toweapon types with defects, and that 24 to 36 months is too long to wait; critics are concerned thatshortening the time to test could signal a U.S. intent to test, and that renewed testing could lead toa renewed interest in testing by other nations. This report provides the policy context for the four initiatives. For each, it then presents a description, history, FY2004 legislative actions, the FY2005 request (for all but low-yield R&D),and issues for Congress. It is designed for those who want a detailed introduction to the debate,those seeking arguments and counterarguments, and those looking for answers to specific questions. It will track congressional and executive actions on these initiatives through updates as developmentswarrant."
