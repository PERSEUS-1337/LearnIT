    "content": "Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit a person from using any telephone facsimile (fax) machine, computer, or other device to send, to another fax machine, an unsolicited advertisement to a person who has requested that such sender not send such advertisements, or to any other person unless: (1) the sender has an established business relationship with the person. (2) the sender obtained the fax number through voluntary communication from the recipient or from an Internet directory or site to which the recipient voluntarily made the fax number available for public distribution. And (3) the advertisement contains a conspicuous notice on its first page that the recipient may request not to be sent any further unsolicited advertisements, and includes a domestic telephone and fax number for sending such a request. Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide that a request not to send unsolicited advertisements complies with FCC requirements if: (1) the request identifies the recipient fax number to which the request relates. (2) the request is made to the telephone or fax number of the sender. And (3) the person making the request has not subsequently provided express invitation or permission to have such advertisements sent. Authorizes the FCC to: (1) allow professional tax-exempt trade associations to send unsolicited advertisements to their members in furtherance of association purposes. And (2) establish a time limit on established business relationships for purposes of this Act. Requires the: (1) FCC to report annually to Congress on the enforcement of the above requirements. And (2) Comptroller General to study, and report to specified congressional committees on, complaints received by the FCC concerning unsolicited advertisements sent to fax machines."
