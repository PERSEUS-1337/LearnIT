    "content": "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes funding for civil projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of the Interior'sBureau of Reclamation, much of the Department of Energy (DOE), and a number of independent agencies,including the Appalachian Regional Commission, theNuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and the appropriated programs of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The Administration requested $21.7 billionfor these programs for FY1999 compared with $21.0 billion appropriated for FY1998 and $19.97 billion forFY1997. The Senate, by a vote of 98-1, approved theEnergy and Water bill ( S. 2138 ) on June 18, 1998, for a total of $21.4 billion. The House , by a vote of 405-4approved its version of the bill( H.R. 4060 ) on June 22, 1998 for $21.1 billion. The conference agreement, appropriating $21.2 billion, wasreported out September 25, 1998. Theconference report ( H.Rept. 105-749 ) was approved by the House September 28, 1998, and approved by the SenateSeptember 29, 1998. The President signed thebill October 7, 1998. Key issues involving the Energy and Water Development appropriations programs included: Sharp cuts in the Corps of Engineers construction request. However, the House and Senate prevailed in supporting $1.43 billion, nearlydouble the amount of the request. Significant proposed increases in DOE's research and development programs and in the nuclearweapons program. Increases over FY1998were approved by Congress, but the amount agreed to was 3.1% below the Administration's request. The nuclearweapons budget was hiked by about $300million over the FY1998 amount. DOE's proposed \"accelerated cleanup\" of former weapons sites. Environmental cleanup programs were supported at near the level of theDOE request. However, the requested amount for the privatization of DOE waste management projects was cut inhalf by Congress. Increased funding for nuclear energy programs. Congress supported funding for nuclear energy programs at $41 million over FY1998 but$42 million less than the DOE request. Continued funding of TVA's non-power programs. Funding for TVA was not included in the Energy and Water Development bill forFY1999. The FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act ( P.L. 105-277 ) added money to several programs funded in the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, including theCorps of Engineers, DOE's renewable energy program and its defense activities program, and TVA. This additionalfunding is not incorporated in the budgettables that follow, but significant changes are noted in the text under Key Policy Issues.
