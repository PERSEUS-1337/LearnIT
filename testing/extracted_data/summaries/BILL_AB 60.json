    "content": "Existing law, the State Bar Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of attorneys by the State Bar of California, a public corporation. Existing law prohibits an attorney from demanding or accepting the advance payment of any funds from a person before the enactment of an immigration reform act, as defined, that is enacted after October 5, 2013, and before January 1, 2017, and requires any funds received during a specified time to be refunded to the client promptly, but no later than 30 days after the receipt of any funds, as provided. Existing law requires the State Bar to provide specified information relating to immigration reform act services on its Internet Web site. This bill would revise the definition of an immigration reform act to include any immigration reform act enacted after October 5, 2013, the President\u2019s executive actions on immigration announced on November 20, 2014, or any future executive action or order that authorizes an undocumented immigrant who entered the United States without inspection, who did not depart after the expiration of a nonimmigrant visa, or who stayed beyond an approved period, to attain a lawful status under federal law or to otherwise remain in the country. This bill would require the State Bar to announce and post on its Internet Web site when an executive action or order described above has been issued. This bill would provide that it is unlawful for an attorney to demand or accept the advance payment of any funds for immigration reform act services in connection with requests for expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, requests for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or other future relief, as provided, under federal law. This bill would also provide that an advance payment of funds for immigration reform act services may be placed into a client trust account, as specified. Existing law provides for the regulation of a person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of an immigration consultant, and provides that a violation of these provisions is a crime. Existing law requires an immigration consultant to establish a client trust account and to deposit in this account any funds received from the client prior to performing immigration reform act services, as defined, for that client. Existing law prohibits an immigration consultant from demanding or accepting the advance payment of any funds from a person before the enactment of an immigration reform act, as defined, that is enacted after October 5, 2013, and before January 1, 2017, and requires any funds received during a specified time to be refunded to the client promptly, but no later than 30 days after the receipt of any funds, as provided. Existing law prescribes civil penalties, not to exceed $1,000 per day for each violation, for immigration consultants who violate these provisions. This bill would revise the definition of an immigration reform act to include any immigration reform act enacted after October 5, 2013, the President\u2019s executive actions on immigration announced on November 20, 2014, or any future executive action or order that authorizes an undocumented immigrant who either entered the United States without inspection or who did not depart after the expiration of a nonimmigrant visa, to attain a lawful status under federal law. This bill would require the State Bar to announce and post on its Internet Web site when an executive action or order described above has been issued. This bill would provide that it is unlawful for an immigration consultant to demand or accept the advance payment of any funds for immigration reform act services in connection with requests for expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, requests for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, expanded Provisional Waivers of Unlawful Presence, or other future relief, as provided, under federal law. Because a violation of these provisions by an immigration consultant would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."
