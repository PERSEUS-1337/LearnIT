    "content": "The Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bills include funding for more than two dozen independent agencies in addition to the larger entities in the bill (Department of the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President, the District of Columbia, and the judiciary). Among these are Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Election Assistance Commission (EAC), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Federal Election Commission (FEC), Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), General Services Administration (GSA), National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Selective Service System, Small Business Administration (SBA), and United States Postal Service (USPS). The House and Senate FSGG bills include funding for the same agencies, with one exception. Funding for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is considered in the Agriculture appropriations bill in the House and the FSGG bill in the Senate. President Trump submitted his FY2018 budget request on May 23, 2017. The request totaled approximately $3.1 billion for the independent agencies funded through the FSGG appropriations bill, including $330 million for the CFTC. The House Committee on Appropriations reported the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2018 (H.R. 3280, H.Rept. 115-234) on July 18, 2017. Combined total FY2018 funding for the FSGG independent agencies in the reported bill was $253 million, with another $248 million for the CFTC included in the Agriculture appropriations bill (H.R. 3268, H.Rept. 115-232). The resulting total of $501 million would have been about $2.6 billion below the President's FY2018 request, with most of this difference in the funding for the GSA. The text of nearly all of H.R. 3280 was included as Division D of H.R. 3354, an omnibus appropriations bill. The bill was amended numerous times on the floor of the House, shifting funding among FSGG agencies, with the FSGG independent agencies totaling $488 million after the amendments. H.R. 3354 passed the House on September 14, 2017. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not act on an FY2018 FSGG appropriations bill. A draft FY2018 chairmen's recommended FSGG bill and explanatory statement was released on November 20, 2017. Funding in the draft bill totaled approximately $539 million, $2.5 billion below the President's FY2018 request, with most of this difference in funding for the GSA. No appropriations bills were passed prior to the start of FY2018. Five separate continuing resolutions (CRs) were enacted\u2014on September 8, 2017 (P.L. 115-56), December 8, 2017 (P.L. 115-90), December 22, 2017 (P.L. 115-96), January 22, 2018 (P.L. 115-120), and February 9, 2018 (P.L. 115-123). The CRs generally maintained FSGG funding based on FY2017 levels, with P.L. 115-123 also adding supplemental emergency funding for the GSA ($127 million) and the SBA ($1.66 billion) largely to address natural disasters. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (H.R. 1625, P.L. 115-141) was enacted on March 23, 2018. FY2018 enacted appropriations in P.L. 115-141 and P.L. 115-123 combined totaled $4.7 billion for the FSGG agencies, $1.6 billion above the original request, with much of this difference resulting from the emergency funding for the SBA."
