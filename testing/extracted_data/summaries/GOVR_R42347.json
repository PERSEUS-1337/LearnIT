    "content": "Quality gaps in the care delivered by the U.S health care system result in preventable mortality and morbidity and contribute costs to the system, with multiple indicators showing that quality of care could be improved. Although no single definition of high-quality health care has been agreed upon, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) provided a framework for considering the quality of care, based on six domains: (1) effective, (2) efficient, (3) equitable, (4) patient-centered, (5) safe, and (6) timely. Ongoing congressional interest in enhancing the quality of health care is likely given the federal role in the delivery and financing of health care through, for example, the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Many efforts that aim to improve the quality of care focus on increasing health care providers' accountability for the care they provide. These efforts include, among others, the modification of payment through incentives and the public reporting of performance information. Many payment incentives and public reporting policies rely on quality measurement, and numerous issues arise when considering the use of quality measures in these policies. These include, among others (1) the availability of a comprehensive set of quality measures, (2) the strength of the evidence base supporting the measures, and (3) the relative mix of different measure types. The ability to directly compare the performance of providers is an essential component of many payment incentive and public reporting policies, and quality measurement allows for the generation of this comparative provider-specific performance information. Emphasis has been placed on changing the way health care is paid for, away from a system where payment is simply a transaction based on the unit of care provided, to one where higher-quality, lower-cost care is preferentially rewarded. This policy approach is often referred to as value-based purchasing or value-driven health care, and such efforts may include payment incentives in the form of adjustments, performance-based payments, or fees. At the federal level, the Medicare program provides policymakers the opportunity to implement value-based purchasing approaches and other payment modifications; payment incentive policies implemented in the Medicare program may provide valuable data that private insurers and others may use when considering implementing these approaches. Policymakers have undertaken efforts to enhance provider accountability through the public reporting of performance information; these efforts have generally occurred in concert with policies that modify payment to improve quality. Theoretically, making provider performance information public serves to correct an existing information asymmetry; that is, an imbalance in information between the provider and user of a service, in this case, health care services. Consumer decision making in health care is influenced by a number of factors, including, among others (1) awareness of the information, (2) relevance of the information, and (3) usability of the information. Other factors unrelated to the performance information itself may also affect consumer use of this information (e.g., location of hospital). The impact of public reporting on both consumer decision making, as well as quality improvement efforts by providers, is unclear, although evidence suggests that consumers do not use performance information very often in their decision making."
