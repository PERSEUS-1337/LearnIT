    "content": "The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is located in the Executive Office of the President and has the responsibility for creating policies, priorities, and objectives for the federal Drug Control Program. This national program is aimed at reducing the use, manufacturing, and trafficking of illicit drugs and the reduction of drug-related crime and violence and of drug-related health consequences. The director of ONDCP has primary responsibilities of developing a comprehensive National Drug Control Strategy (Strategy) to direct the nation's anti-drug efforts; developing a National Drug Control Budget (Budget) to implement the National Drug Control Strategy, including determining the adequacy of the drug control budgets submitted by contributing federal Drug Control Program agencies; and evaluating the effectiveness of the National Drug Control Strategy implementation by the various agencies contributing to the Drug Control Program. Authorization for ONDCP expired at the end of FY2010, but it has continued to receive appropriations. Congress, while continuously charged with ONDCP's oversight, is now faced with its possible reauthorization. In May 2009, then-Director R. Gil Kerlikowske called for an end to use of the term \"war on drugs.\" This is in part because while drug use was previously considered a law enforcement or criminal justice problem, it has transitioned to being viewed more as a public health problem. Indeed, the Obama Administration has indicated that a comprehensive strategy should include a range of prevention, treatment, and law enforcement elements. The 2014 National Drug Control Strategy outlines seven core areas\u2014ranging from strengthening international partnerships to focusing on intervention and treatment efforts in health care\u2014aimed at reducing both illicit drug use and its consequences. The overall goal is to achieve a 15% reduction in the rate of drug use and its consequences over a five-year period (2010-2015). In creating the National Drug Control Strategy, ONDCP consults with the various federal Drug Control Program agencies. ONDCP then reviews their respective drug budgets and incorporates them into the National Drug Control Budget (Budget), which is submitted to Congress as part of the annual appropriations process. As requested by Congress in the ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-469), the Budget was restructured in FY2012, incorporating the activities and budgets of 19 additional federal agencies/programs, to reflect a more complete range of federal drug control spending. The FY2013 Budget incorporated four additional federal agencies/programs, and the FY2014 Budget incorporated one additional federal program. In the proposed FY2015 Budget, there are five priorities for which resources are requested across agencies: substance abuse prevention and substance abuse treatment (both of which are considered demand-reduction areas), and drug interdiction, domestic law enforcement, and international partnerships (the three of which are considered supply-reduction areas). The FY2015 Budget proposes to use 57% of the funds ($14.436 billion) for supply-side functions and 43% of the funds ($10.927 billion) for demand-side functions. Federal drug control activities were funded at $25.212 billion for FY2014. In September 2014, the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015 (P.L. 113-164) continued funding the federal government at FY2014 spending levels through December 11, 2014. Details of FY2015 federal drug control spending, however, remain unclear. In considering ONDCP's reauthorization, there are several issues on which policy makers may deliberate. Congress may consider whether to authorize specific supply-reduction or demand-reduction programs. Congress may also exercise oversight regarding ONDCP's implementation of evidenced-based activities. Another issue that might be debated is whether the revised Budget structure captures the full scope of the nation's anti-drug activities. Further, ONDCP has created a new Performance Reporting System (PRS) to evaluate annual progress toward each of the Drug Control Program's strategic goals. Congress may exercise oversight regarding the new PRS. Given the current public debate over the legal status of marijuana, Congress may also choose to address ONDCP's ability to support or oppose marijuana legalization. Current law requires the Director of National Drug Control Policy to (1) ensure that no federal funds appropriated to ONDCP are expended for any study or contract relating to the legalization of a substance listed in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and (2) oppose any attempt to legalize the use of any such substance that the Food and Drug Administration has not approved for use for medical purposes. Finally, should Congress choose to reauthorize ONDCP, it may wish to reconsider the role of ONDCP and the director. ONDCP has distanced itself from the seemingly outdated term \"war on drugs,\" but the office is arguably a product of the war on drugs."
