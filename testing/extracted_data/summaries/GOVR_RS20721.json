    "content": "On October 12, 2000, the U.S. Navy destroyer Cole was attacked by a small boat ladenwith explosives during a briefrefueling stop in the harbor of Aden, Yemen. The suicide terrorist attack killed 17 members of the ship's crew,wounded 39 others, and seriously damaged theship. Evidence developed to date suggests that it may have been carried out by Islamic militants with possibleconnections to the terrorist network led by Usamabin Ladin. The FBI, Defense Department, and Navy launched investigations to determine culpability for the attackand to review procedures. A broad DoD reviewof accountability was conducted by a special panel. On January 9, 2001, the panel issued its report which avoidedassigning blame but found significantshortcomings in security against terrorist attacks, including inadequate training and intelligence. On January 23,2001, Senate Armed Services CommitteeChairman, John Warner, announced intentions for the Committee to hold its own investigation. Issues for Congressinclude the adequacy of (1) procedures byU.S. forces to protect against terrorist attacks; (2) intelligence related to potential terrorist attacks; and (3) U.S.anti-terrorism policy and response. This report willbe updated if major new developments warrant."
