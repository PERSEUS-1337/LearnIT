    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) contains 45 separately authorized programs, plus approximately 20 specified sub-programs. The largest of these programs distribute funds by formulas that prescribe how funds are to be allocated among state educational agencies (SEAs) or local educational agencies (LEAs) nationwide. They take the form of mathematical equations through which the U.S. Department of Education (ED), and in many cases also SEAs, calculate grant amounts for each potential grantee meeting statutory eligibility criteria. They almost always include one or more population factors and may also include state or LEA minimum grant provisions, eligibility thresholds, expenditure factors, fiscal accountability provisions, and reservations of funds for a variety of purposes. The recipients of a majority of the funds under almost all ESEA formula grant programs are LEAs. Under most of these programs, grants are provided to LEAs via SEAs: that is, they are \"state-administered formula grant\" programs. Funds are allocated by ED directly to LEAs only under a limited number of ESEA programs. The most influential ESEA allocation formulas are those under the Title I-A program, both because this is the largest ESEA program and because there are five ESEA programs under which grants are made, in part or in full, in proportion to grants calculated under Title I, Part A. As a result, a majority of ESEA funds are allocated under formulas in which the primary population factor is school-age children in poor families, and state expenditure factors are applied. The share of all public K-12 education revenues that is provided under ESEA programs varies substantially among the states, although ESEA funding constitutes only approximately one-tenth or less of total public K-12 education revenues in all cases except Puerto Rico. The average ESEA program grant per school-age child (poor and non-poor) increases as the state average poverty rate rises, with the third of states having the highest poverty rates receiving 1.4 times as much as low poverty states. At the same time, an opposite trend is found in average ESEA grants per school-age child in a poor family, with low poverty states receiving 1.3 times as much as states with the highest poverty rates. Most ESEA allocation formulas include state or LEA minimum grant provisions. As a result, states with the smallest school-age population receive approximately 1.7 times as much as the remaining states per school-age child, and approximately 2.2 times as much per school-age child from a poor family. This report will be updated if substantial changes are made in one or more ESEA program allocation formulas."
