    "content": "Stop Tip-overs of Unstable, Risky Dressers on Youth Act or the STURDY Act This bill requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to promulgate a final consumer product safety standard for free-standing clothing storage units to protect children from tip-over-related death or injury, unless the CPSC determines that a voluntary ASTM International standard adequately protects children and is likely to be complied with by furniture manufacturers. If an ASTM standard meets the CPSC's requirements, the standard shall be treated as a consumer product safety rule."
