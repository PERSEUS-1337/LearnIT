The main event for the week will be the 20th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting to be held September 8-9, 2012. President Barack Obama will not attend the event; Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will lead the U.S. delegation. As host for the 20th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, Russia has set the main agenda items as: advancing trade and investment liberalization and regional economic integration; strengthening food security; establishing reliable supply chains; and promoting cooperation to foster innovative growth. The United States hopes to complete priorities established at last year's Economic Leaders' Meeting in Honolulu and support Russia's agenda in cases where the two nations share a common objective. On November 12-13, 2011, the United States hosted the 19th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Honolulu. While in Honolulu, the nine leaders of negotiating nations\u2014Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States, and Vietnam\u2014met and announced the broad outline for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, which to the United States and some other APEC members may serve as a stepping stone for a broader Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific open to all APEC members. However, not all APEC members support such a vision for the TPP. Following the 19th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, the APEC leaders issued a declaration, reaffirming their opposition to protectionism and pledging to advance regional integration and the expansion of trade among APEC members. The leaders also agreed to set a cap tariff rate on \"environmental goods\" of 5%, and to phase out tariffs on environmental goods by 2015. However, they could not reach a final agreement on which goods would be considered \"environmental goods.\" Given the growing number of alternative regional events or organizations at which the United States can present its views, the heightened U.S. engagement in the Asia-Pacific region has raised questions about APEC's continued role and relevance in U.S. foreign policy. Since taking office, President Obama has strengthened ties with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the East Asian Summit (EAS), raising questions about the roles of each of these groups in U.S. relations in the region. In addition, China has grown concerned about greater U.S. interest in the region, with some Chinese officials viewing it as part of a U.S. containment policy aimed at China. Congressional interest in APEC has generally focused on three issues\u2014implications for U.S. trade policy in general, potential effects on relations with China, and budgetary matters. On occasion, the trade liberalization measures proposed to APEC by the United States have required changes in U.S. trade laws. As an APEC member, the United States must contribute to the annual budget of APEC. The Congressional Budget Justification for FY2013 includes a request for $1.028 million for APEC support."
