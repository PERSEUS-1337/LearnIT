    "content": "On January 23, 2004, the President signed into law an FY2004 consolidated appropriations measure ( P.L. 108-199 , H.R. 2673 ) that includes annual funding for the U.S.Department of Agriculture and Related Agencies. The full House approved the conference agreementof the measure on December 8, 2003. Senate floor action on the conference agreement was delayedfor several weeks until a cloture motion was approved and the conference agreement was adoptedon January 22, 2004. Part of the reason for the delay in Senate consideration of the measure wasopposition to a conference-adopted provision that postpones implementation of country-of-originlabeling (COOL) for fresh fruits and vegetables, and red meats, for two years, until September 30,2006. Until enactment of P.L. 108-199 , FY2004 spending for USDA and related agencies had beengoverned by several continuing resolutions (most recently P.L. 108-135 , H.J.Res. 79 ),which allowed FY2004 spending to continue at the FY2003 level. The FY2004 consolidated appropriations act contains $80.63 billion for USDA and related agencies for FY2004 (excluding the effects of a 0.59% across-the-board rescission in alldiscretionary, non-defense accounts, as required by the final law). As originally reported by theirrespective committees, H.R. 2673 and S. 1427 contained nearly identicalappropriations of $77.49 billion. However, the Senate added $2.2 billion to the mandatory foodstamp account to reflect more recent projections of program participation, and conferees added $1billion to the food stamp reserve account. Just over three-fourths ($63.7 billion) of the spending inthe agriculture portion (Division A) of P.L. 108-199 is classified as mandatory spending, includingfood stamps, child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and the various farm support programs fundedthrough USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. The balance of spending ($16.9 billion) in Division A is for discretionary programs, which is$198 million below the Administration's request and $61 million below both the House- andSenate-passed levels. Discretionary spending in Division A of the measure is $963 million belowthe FY2003 enacted level including supplementals. Agriculture appropriators were allocated nearly$1 billion less for FY2004 discretionary accounts than the FY2003 level including supplementals.To help achieve this goal, P.L. 108-199 includes an FY2004 appropriation for foreign food aid thatis $572 million below the FY2003 level (which was bolstered by supplemental spending). Also, P.L.108-199 contains provisions that limit or prohibit spending on certain mandatory conservation, ruraldevelopment, and research programs, which in total reduced spending in these accounts byapproximately $650 million from authorized levels. The measure did not include a Senate provision that would have relaxed the licensing requirement for travel to Cuba for the sale of agricultural and medical products. Conferees alsorejected a House provision that would have blocked FDA from preventing individuals fromimporting cheaper FDA-approved prescription drugs from foreign suppliers.
