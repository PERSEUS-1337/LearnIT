    "content": "This report assesses the impact of the September 11, 2001 attacks on public and private information infrastructures in the context of critical infrastructure protection, continuity ofoperations (COOP) planning, and homeland security. Analysis of the effects of the terrorist attackssuggests various \"lessons learned.\" These lessons support three general principles. The firstprinciple emphasizes the establishment and practice of comprehensive continuity and recovery plans. One lesson learned in this area is to augment disaster recovery plans . Businesses and agencies, whonow must consider the possibility of complete destruction and loss of a building, may need toaugment their disaster recovery plans to include the movement of people, the rapid acquisition ofequipment and furniture, network connectivity, adequate workspace, and more. A corollary to thislesson learned is the need to assure that recovery procedures are well documented and safeguardedso that they can be fully utilized when necessary. A second lesson is the need to back up data and applications . Without a comprehensive backup system that captures more than just anorganization's data files, a significant amount of time can be lost trying to re-create applications,organize data, and reestablish user access. A corollary to this lesson learned is the need to fully andregularly test backup sites and media to ensure their reliability and functionality. The second principle focuses on the decentralization of operations and the effectiveness of distributed communications. The lesson of decentralizing operations can be applied to the structureand location of an organization's operations. Industry experts suggest recovery sites be located atleast 20-50 miles away form the primary work site. In addition, some observers suggest that humanresources should also be located in more than one place to reduce the potential for losing asignificant portion of one's workforce in a single event. Another lesson in this area is to ensure theability to communicate with internal and external constituencies . In the event of an emergency, thedemand for information skyrockets. An organization not only needs to communicate with employeesregarding actions and procedures, but also with the citizens and customers to whom it is responsiblefor providing goods and services. The third principle involves the institutionalization of system redundancies to eliminate single points of weakness. In this context, the lesson of employing redundant service providers is appliedprimarily to telecommunications services. In the event a central switching station is disabled, havingmultiple providers using different infrastructures for access can reduce the possibility of anorganization losing its communications services and being unable to carry out its responsibilities. Another related lesson learned is the use of generic replaceable technology . In the event of acatastrophe, the ability to replace equipment quickly with easy-to-find products that do not requirecomprehensive customization, can contribute significantly to how quickly an organization'soperations can be functional again. This report will not be updated."
