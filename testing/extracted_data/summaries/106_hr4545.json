    "title": "Internet Minors Protection and Cyberspace Technology Act",
    "content": "Allows temporary interruption of software operation to permit a minor, under the direct supervision of an adult designated by the school or library, to have access to information that is not obscene, is not child pornography, or is otherwise unprotected by the Constitution. Requires determinations of adequate design to be made by an agency or official designated by the State Governor. Authorizes Federal agency heads to respond to violations of this Act by seeking remedies, in the same manner as under the General Education Provisions Act, including withholding of further payments, issuing a complaint to compel compliance through a cease and desist order, or entering into a compliance agreement with the recipient of funds. Prohibits seeking recovery of funds from the recipient."
