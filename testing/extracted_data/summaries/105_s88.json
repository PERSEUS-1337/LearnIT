    "content": "Improved Patient Access to Clinical Studies Act of 1997 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Public Health Service Act to prohibit a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering coverage in connection with a group health plan from denying, limiting, or imposing additional conditions on coverage if: (1) the enrollee is participating in an approved clinical study. (2) the items and services are furnished according to the study's design or to treat conditions resulting from study participation. And (3) the items and services would otherwise be covered. Amends the Public Health Service Act to apply that prohibition to coverage offered by an issuer in the individual market."
