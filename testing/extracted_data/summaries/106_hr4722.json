    "title": "Department of Defense Privatization and Outsourcing Moratorium Act",
    "content": "Requires the Secretary to report to Congress evaluating: (1) each conversion that was carried out since October 1, 1996. And (2) each function that was considered for conversion since such date, but not converted. Directs the Secretary, on account of such moratorium, to provide for an adjustment in the operating budgets of the armed forces and military installations to compensate for the fact that such budgets were previously reduced to reflect savings anticipated from the conversion of such functions to private sector performance."
