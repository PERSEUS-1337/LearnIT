    "content": "This report provides a summary and analysis of selected provisions of the chairman's mark of S. 1733, the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act. The topics covered include electric power and incentives for the development of natural gas technologies. The report also compares those provisions with H.R. 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act. In S. 1733, Subtitle H of Division A has two sections dealing with the use of low carbon emitting energy technologies. Section 181, Clean Energy and Accelerated Emission Reduction Program, directs the EPA administrator to \"establish a program to promote dispatchable power generation projects that can accelerate the reduction of power sector carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions\" (emphasis added). The term \"dispatchable\" is not defined in the bill, but would normally refer to power generating units that can be run at-will by system operators, such as natural gas, nuclear, or coal units. Several features of Section 181 are unspecified or unclear, including the total dollar amount and form of the incentives, whether the emission reduction target for a specific project would change over time, and the deadline for making incentive awards. Section 182 of Subtitle H, Advanced Natural Gas Technologies, would establish two grant programs for accelerating the development of advanced natural gas technologies in the power generation, commercial, and residential sectors. No parts of H.R. 2454 are directly comparable to sections 181 and 182 of S. 1733. Closest in intent is Section 175 of Subtitle H of H.R. 2454, which provides for a government program to help develop and demonstrate high efficiency natural gas burning combustion turbines, for use in combined cycle power plants. H.R. 2454 has several provisions relating to electric power transmission that have no counterparts in S. 1733. These provisions of H.R. 2454 involve transmission planning and permitting; development and deployment of smart grid technologies; requirements for electric utilities to reduce peak demand; net metering for federal agencies; and incentives for transmission technology development. These elements of H.R. 2454 are summarized in this report and discussed in more detail in CRS Report R40643, Greenhouse Gas Legislation: Summary and Analysis of H.R. 2454 as Passed by the House of Representatives, coordinated by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]."
