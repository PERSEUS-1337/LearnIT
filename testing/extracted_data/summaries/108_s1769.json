    "content": "National Class Action Act of 2003 - Amends the Federal judicial code to require: (1) the portion of any attorney's fee paid to class counsel based on a recovery of coupons in a class action settlement to be based on the value to class members of the coupons redeemed. And (2) the attorney's fee in such a settlement otherwise to be based upon the amount of time class counsel expended working on the action, subject to court approval. Grants a US district court jurisdiction over a class action in which one-third or fewer of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate are citizens of the State in which the action was originally filed. Lists grounds under which a US district court may decline to exercise jurisdiction over a class action in which greater than one-third but less than two-thirds of the members of the plaintiff class are citizens of the State in which the action was originally filed. Bars a US district court from exercising jurisdiction over a class action in which: (1) two-thirds or more of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes are citizens of the State in which the action was originally filed. (2) the primary defendants are States, State officials, or other governmental entities against whom the district court may be foreclosed from ordering relief. Or (3) the number of members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate is less than 100. Allows a class action over which a district court would have jurisdiction under this Act to be removed to a US district court by any: (1) defendant without the consent of all defendants. Or (2) plaintiff class member who has intervened, seeks to be designated as a representative class member, and is not a named or representative class member without the consent of all members of such class."
