    "content": "Haiti and its multilateral and bilateral donors developed an international assistance strategy,known as the Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF), to address Haiti's short-term needs between thecollapse of the government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in February 2004 and the initialphase of a new government scheduled to be inaugurated in February 2006. The World Bank, theInter-American Development Bank, the United Nations, and the European Union co-sponsored theInternational Donors Conference on Haiti in Washington, D.C., on July 19-20, 2004. The objectiveof the conference was to garner international financial support for the ICF, which outlines Haiti'spriority needs and programs for 2004-2006. The Interim Cooperation Framework establishes priority needs and projects that fall underfour broad categories, or \"axes\": political governance and national dialogue; economic governanceand institutional development; economic recovery; and access to basic services. For each of thesefour strategic axes, the Framework provides a strategy, priority objectives, and monitoring indicators. Many congressional concerns regarding Haitian development are addressed by the prioritiesand programs outlined in the Interim Cooperative Framework. The main congressional concernsexpressed regarding the Donors Conference strategy is the rate at which funds are being disbursedand the effectiveness of the aid being provided. International organizations and governmentspledged $1.085 billion, to be disbursed over a two and a half-year period, from July 2004 throughSeptember 2006, eight months into a new administration, if elections proceed according to schedule. Initial disbursement was slow. According to the World Bank, however, the rate ofdisbursement began to improve after about six months. At just under the halfway point of theDonors Conference time-frame, a little less than half of the pledged funding had been disbursed, atentative estimate of $500 million as of July 2005. Disbursement has been uneven among donors. The United States has disbursed about half of its pledged funds. Some progress has been made toward the objectives outlined in the Interim CooperationFramework, including voter registration, improvements in fiscal transparency, jobs creation, andbroader access to clean water and other services. Current law related to funding of U.S. assistance to Haiti includes P.L. 108-25 , P.L. 108-199 , P.L. 108-324 , P.L. 108-447 , and P.L. 109-13 . Pending legislation related to funding of U.S.assistance to Haiti includes H.R. 611 , H.R. 945 , H.R. 1130 , H.R. 1213 / S. 704 , H.R. 2601 , H.R. 3057 , and S. 600 .
