    "content": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, P.L. 111-148, March 23, 2010) creates, requires others to create, or authorizes dozens of new entities to implement the legislation. Some of these new entities are offices within existing cabinet departments and agencies, and are assigned certain administrative or representational duties related to the legislation. Other entities are new boards and commissions with particular planning and reporting responsibilities. Still others are advisory bodies that were created to study particular issues, offer recommendations, or both. Although PPACA describes some of these new organizations and advisory bodies in detail, in many cases it is currently impossible to know how much influence they will ultimately have over the implementation of the legislation. This report describes dozens of new governmental organizations or advisory bodies that are mentioned in PPACA, but does not include other types of entities that were created by the legislation (e.g., various demonstration projects, grants, trust funds, programs, systems, formulas, guidelines, risk pools, websites, ratings areas, model agreements, or protocols). A table in the Appendix is organized in terms of entities (1) that were created by PPACA itself (e.g., through statutory language stating that an organization is \"established\" or \"created\"); (2) that PPACA requires the President to establish (e.g., \"the President shall establish\"); (3) that PPACA requires the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish (e.g., \"the Secretary shall establish\"); (4) that PPACA requires some other organization to establish; and (5) that PPACA authorizes to be established. For each entity listed, the table identifies (to the extent provided in the legislation) the relevant section of PPACA, the name of the entity, the date that the entity is required to be created and its location, the composition of the entity and its leadership, and the purpose and duties of the entity. The precise number of new entities that will ultimately be created pursuant to PPACA is currently unknowable, for the number of entities created by some sections is contingent upon other factors, and some new entities may satisfy more than one requirement in the legislation. Although PPACA states that certain entities were \"established\" by the legislation, in practical terms, these entities will not be able to function until members are appointed and appropriations are provided or made available. The legislation sometimes indicates when and where certain entities are to be established, how members are to be appointed, the amount and timing of appropriations, whether certain general management laws are applicable, and when the entities will cease to exist. In other cases, however, PPACA is silent with regard to these and other issues. The degree of specificity in these provisions may have implications for congressional control and, conversely, the amount of discretion that agencies will have in the implementation of the legislation. PPACA significantly increased the appointment responsibilities of the Comptroller General of the United States, and it is unclear how the Government Accountability Office (GAO) will be able to independently audit entities whose members are appointed by the head of GAO. This report will not be updated."
