    "content": "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), the Department of Energy (DOE), and a number of independent agencies. Key budgetary issues for FY2009 involving these programs included the distribution of Corps appropriations across the agency's authorized planning, construction, and maintenance activities (Title I); support of major ecosystem restoration initiatives, such as Florida Everglades (Title I) and California \"Bay-Delta\" (CALFED) (Title II); a proposal by the Bush Administration to eliminate funding for DOE's Weatherization program for low income homes (Title III, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy); the Bush Administration's request for funding of DOE's Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) nuclear weapons program, which Congress had declined to fund for FY2008 (Title III, Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Stewardship); funding for the proposed national nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada (Title III: Nuclear Waste Disposal); and the Bush Administration's Global Nuclear Energy Partnership to supply plutonium-based fuel to other nations (Title III: Nuclear Energy). In considering the FY2009 budget, both the House and the Senate Appropriations Committees voted to report out an Energy and Water Development appropriations bill. However, neither bill reached the floor in either house. On September 24, 2008, the House passed H.R. 2638, the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009, which continued appropriations for Energy and Water Development, among other programs, at the FY2008 level (with some exceptions) until March 6, 2009. The bill passed the Senate September 27 and was signed by the President September 30 (P.L. 110-329). An extension through March 11, 2009, was signed March 6, 2009 (P.L. 111-6). Energy and Water Development funding for all of FY2009 is included in the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (H.R. 1105/111th Congress). The House passed the measure February 25, 2009, by a vote of 245-178. It was passed by the Senate without amendment on March 10, 2009, following a cloture vote of 62-35. President Obama signed the bill March 11, 2009 (P.L. 111-8)."
