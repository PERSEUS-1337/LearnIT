    "title": "SB 881",
    "content": "Existing law requires a county to establish an amnesty program for unpaid fines and bail initially due on or before January 1, 2013, for Vehicle Code infractions to be conducted in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Judicial Council. Existing law requires the program to accept payments from October 1, 2015, to March 31, 2017, inclusive. Existing law requires the program to accept a reduced payment in full satisfaction of the fine or bail if the program participant certifies under penalty of perjury that he or she receives specified public benefits or his or her income is 125 or less of the current poverty guidelines. If the driving privilege of an amnesty program participant or a person who is in good standing in a comprehensive collection program has been suspended due to a Vehicle Code violation that is subject to the amnesty program, existing law requires the court to issue and file a certificate with the Department of Motor Vehicles demonstrating that the participant has appeared in court, paid the fine, or has otherwise satisfied the court. This bill would require the court to issue and file the certificate with the department within 90 days. For applications submitted prior to January 1, 2017, the bill would require the court to issue and file the certificate no later than March 31, 2017. The bill would require, for applications submitted on or before March 31, 2017, that all terms and procedures related to a participant\u2019s payment plans remain in effect after that date."
