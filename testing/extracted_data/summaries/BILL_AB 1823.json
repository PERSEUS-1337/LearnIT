    "title": "AB 1823",
    "content": "Existing law, the Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Clinical Research Act, requires a grantee, defined to include, but not be limited to, a college or university that conducts clinical research using state funds, to ensure that women and minority groups are included as subjects in each research project, except as provided. Existing law establishes the University of California. This bill would provide for the establishment of the California Cancer Clinical Trials Program and would request that the University of California establish or designate an institute or office within the university to administer the program, which would be governed by a board of at least 5 members appointed by the president of the university. The bill would authorize the program administrator to solicit funds from various specified sources for purposes of the program and would require the program administrator, upon receipt of at least $500,000 in funding, to establish the Cancer Clinical Trials Grant Program to increase patient access to eligible cancer clinical trials in underserved or disadvantaged communities and populations, as specified."
