    "content": "Although an involuntary confession has been inadmissible in federal cases since the nineteenth century, the Supreme Court did not denounce physically coercive abuses in State cases until itsdecision in Brown v. Mississippi . The Brown case established the basis for the FourteenthAmendment \"voluntariness\" standard as the due process test for assessing the admissibility ofconfessions in State cases. Under this standard, the admissibility of a confession was evaluated ona case by case basis which would be governed by the \"totality of the circumstances,\" which includedthe facts of the case, the background of the accused, and the behavior of the police during theinterrogation. In Miranda v. Arizona , the Court established several procedures to safeguard the Fifth Amendment rights of persons during custodial interrogations. The Court reasoned that the suspectsneeded the safeguards because \"[t]he circumstances surrounding in-custody interrogation can operatevery quickly to overbear the will of [the suspect...\" and without them no statement can be consideredthe product of his/her free will. Miranda was controversial among policy-makers and academics who debated its legitimacy and desirability over thirty years after its judicial creation. One of the major arguments offered foroverruling Miranda was that it had caused great difficulty to law enforcement efforts in controllingcrime. The ruling in Dickerson v. United States , 530 U.S. 428 (2000), struck down 18 U.S.C. 3501,a federal law that allowed confessions elicited without a police advisory to be used at trial as longas the \"totality of circumstances\" demonstrated that they were given voluntarily. Dickerson made Miranda 's constitutional status clear. The Miranda decisions announced duringthe Court's 2003-2004 term, however, suggest that continued vitality of seemingly confictingpre- Dickerson caselaw is less clear. United States v. Patane , divided the Court so that nosinglerationale united a majority of its members, although five Justices joined in a plurality decision thatdeclined to overrule its pre- Dickerson decisions concerning the admissibility of physical derivateevidence. On the other hand, Missouri v. Seibert likewise resulted in a plurality opinion, but in spiteof contrary suggestions in the pre- Dickerson caselaw five Justices found inadmissible a confessionintentionally wrung from the defendant before Miranda warnings and re-elicited thereafter. FiveJustices did agree in Yarborough v. Alvarado that the state courts did not unreasonably apply federallaw when -- without considering the inexperienced suspect's age (17 years old) -- they determinedthat Miranda 's custodial threshold had not been crossed. And they all agreed in Fellers v. UnitedStates , that the lower courts should not have addressed Miranda/Dickerson implications raisedoutof an interrogation that offended Sixth Amendment requirements."
