    "content": "Berry Amendment Extension Act - Prohibits the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from procuring specified covered items directly related to national security interests that are not grown, reprocessed, reused, or produced in the United States, except to the extent satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity of any such product cannot be procured as and when needed. Makes additional exceptions for: (1) procurements by vessels in foreign waters, (2) emergency procurements. And (3) purchases for amounts not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold ($100,000). Directs the Secretary to ensure that: (1) each member of DHS's acquisition workforce who regularly participates in textile acquisition receives training during FY2008 on this Act's requirements. And (2) any such training includes comprehensive information on such requirements. Makes this Act inapplicable to the extent that it is inconsistent with US obligations under an international agreement."
