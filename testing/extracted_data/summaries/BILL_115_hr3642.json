    "content": "Military Sexual Assault Victims Empowerment Act or the Military SAVE Act This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to carry out a three-year pilot program of hospital care and medical services for eligible veterans at non-VA health care providers to treat injuries or illnesses resulting from sexual assault, battery, or harassment while the veteran was on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training. Program participation shall not affect a veteran's ability to receive VA health care. An eligible veteran may elect to participate in the program and choose his or her provider as long as the provider meets VA requirements. The program shall be carried out at not more than five sites that meet criteria of city size and rates of sexual assault and rape. At least one site shall be a rural site and not more than 75 veterans may participate at any one site. The bill sets forth payment provisions for current and new non-VA providers."
