    "content": "Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, many U.S. officials and others have expressed concerns that the U.S. government is unaware of the addresses and whereabouts of many foreignnationals in the country. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) contains provisions for theregistration of aliens, including the requirement that aliens provide notification of any change ofaddress within 10 days. For many years, however, this address reporting requirement was generallynot enforced. The INA also authorizes the Attorney General to prescribe special regulations for the registration and fingerprinting of any class of aliens who are not U.S. legal permanent residents(LPRs). The Attorney General has exercised this authority at various times by requiring thatnonimmigrant aliens (legal temporary residents) from designated countries be registered,photographed, and fingerprinted at the port of entry. A rule, which took effect on September 11, 2002, applies expanded special registration requirements to certain newly arriving nonimmigrants as part of the National Security Entry-ExitRegistration System (NSEERS). NSEERS covers arriving nonimmigrants from designatedcountries, as well as other arriving nonimmigrants who are determined to pose an elevated nationalsecurity risk. Among other requirements, aliens subject to special registration under this rule areregistered, fingerprinted, photographed, and checked against databases of known criminals andterrorists at the port of entry. Under the original rule, which has since been amended, those whoremained for at least 30 days had to report to an immigration office to complete their registration andthose remaining for more than 1 year had to reaffirm their registration information annually. A seriesof Federal Register notices published in late 2002 and early 2003 similarly required certainnonimmigrant males in the United States from designated countries to report to an immigrationoffice to be registered, fingerprinted, and photographed. A subsequent rule, which became effectiveon December 2, 2003, amended the NSEERS regulations. Among other changes, it suspended theautomatic 30-day and annual re-registration requirements. A proposed rule, published in July 2002, would give notice to aliens, including LPRs, of their obligation to provide the government with a current address, including any change of address within10 days, and the consequences of failing to do so. Congress has acted on alien registration-related measures in recent years. The 107th Congress enacted the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-173 ), whichdirects the General Accounting Office to study the feasibility and utility of requiring nonimmigrantsto submit a current address and, where applicable, the name and address of an employer every year. In the 108th Congress, the FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution ( P.L. 108-7 ) containslanguage requiring the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security,to provide Congress with NSEERS-related documents and materials. This report will be updatedas related developments occur."
