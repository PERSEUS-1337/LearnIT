    "content": "In the 109th Congress, the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and MeansSubcommittee on Human Resources have approved legislation that would reauthorize and revise theTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant. This legislation, S. 667 and H.R. 240 , also includes many changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE)program, a component of the government's social safety net. In 1996, Congress passed significantchanges to the CSE program as part of its reform of welfare. S. 667 was reported by theSenate Finance Committee on March 17, 2005 ( S.Rept. 109-51 ). H.R. 240 was approvedby the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources on March 15, 2005. Although not identical, both bills are similar in focus, direction, and content with respect tothe CSE provisions. Both bills include provisions that seek to improve the CSE program and raisecollections so as to increase the economic independence of former welfare families and provide astable source of income for all single-parent families with a noncustodial parent. Both bills provideincentives (in the form of federal cost sharing) to states to direct more of the child support collectedon behalf of families to the families themselves, thereby reducing the amount that state and federalgovernments retain (often referred to as a family-first policy). Under both bills, families currentlyreceiving TANF benefits as well as former TANF recipients would potentially receive a larger shareof child support that was collected on their behalf. The approach used by the bills differ significantly, however, with regard to how states wouldhelp TANF families receive more child support. S. 667 provides federal cost-sharingfor the entire amount that the state disregards and passes through to families, whereas, under H.R. 240 , federal cost sharing incentives would be offered to encourage states to establish a child support pass-through provision or increase the amount of existing child supportpass-through payments. Also, H.R. 240 provides a more limited amount of federal costsharing for state pass-through and disregard policies than S. 667. Both bills revise some CSE enforcement tools and add others; increase funding for theFederal Parent Locator Service (FPLS); increase funding for federal technical assistance to the states;require states to review child support orders of TANF families every three years; require that a reportbe submitted to Congress on undistributed child support collections; and designate Indian tribes andtribal organizations as persons authorized to have access to information in the FPLS. S. 667 increases funding for the CSE access and visitation program; requires states to adopt a laterversion of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) so as to facilitate the collection ofchild support payments in interstate cases; and requires that medical child support be provided byeither or both parents. H.R. 240 includes a provision that would establish a $25 annualuser fee for individuals who have never been on TANF but received at least $500 via CSE servicesin any given year. This report will be updated as needed."
