    "content": "This report lists and compares military expenditures of the United States and foreign nations using two sources: the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies' (IISS) The MilitaryBalance, and the U.S. State Department's World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers (WMEAT). Although the IISS and the U.S. State Department aim to provide figures that are as consistent and accurate as possible, cross-national comparisons of defense spending are inherently imperfect. Available sets of figures are useful, but often do not correspond with one another for a variety ofreasons. This report provides two sets of figures from widely recognized sources in order to offerCongress a sample of the data published on this topic. This report will be updated as necessary."
