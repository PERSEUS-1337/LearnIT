    "title": "An act to amend Section 399.13 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to energy.",
    "content": "Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. The Public Utilities Act requires the commission to review and accept, modify, or reject a procurement plan for each electrical corporation based on whether it includes specified elements or incentive mechanisms, and whether it accomplishes certain objectives. The California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program, within the act, requires retail sellers, defined as including electrical corporations, and local publicly owned electric utilities to purchase specified minimum quantities of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources, as defined, for specified compliance periods. The program requires the commission to direct each electrical corporation to annually prepare a renewable energy procurement plan to satisfy its procurement requirements pursuant to the program. To the extent feasible, the renewable energy procurement plan is to be proposed, reviewed, and adopted as part of, and pursuant to, the general procurement plan process. This bill would make a nonsubstantive revision to the provision that requires, to the extent feasible, that the renewable energy procurement plan be proposed, reviewed, and adopted as part of, and pursuant to, the general procurement plan process."
