Precludes from such prohibition the use of somatic cell transfer technology to clone molecules, DNA, cells, tissues, or animals. Sets forth registration requirements for individuals who intend to perform human somatic cell nuclear transfer technology. Requires that research involving human somatic nuclear transfer technology be conducted in accordance with Federal standards governing the protection of human subjects. Considers individuals whose cells are used for such research to be human subjects. Requires the individual who provides the cells and the individual with the principal responsibility for conducting the research to submit signed statements that the individual donates the cells for and consents to such research. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to request the Institute of Medicine to enter into an agreement to conduct a study to review the current state of knowledge about: (1) the biological properties of stem cells obtained from embryos and fetal and adult tissues. (2) biological differences among such cells and the consequences for research and medicine. And (3) the ability of stem cells to generate neurons, heart, kidney, blood, liver, and other tissues and the potential clinical uses of these tissues."
