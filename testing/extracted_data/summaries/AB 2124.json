    "title": "An act\nto amend Section 52060 of the Education Code, and\nto amend Section 116385 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to water.",
    "content": "Existing law, the California Safe Drinking Water Act, governs drinking water quality and requires the State Water Resources Control Board to ensure that all public water systems are operated in compliance with the act. The act requires a person operating a public water system to obtain and provide an analysis of the water to the state board, as provided. Under the act, a person who knowingly makes a false statement or representation in a report submitted, maintained, or used for purposes of compliance with the act may be subject to a misdemeanor. This bill would require the person to include in the analysis samples from schools, day care facilities, and health care facilities, to the extent those locations are within the public water system. The bill would require the person to report to the state board other information regarding the samples taken at those sites. The bill would require the state board to post this information on its Internet Web site, as provided. The bill would also require the person to report to the state board the public and private schools to which the public water system provides water. Because a misstatement in these reports could be a crime under the provision described above, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program by expanding the scope of a crime. Existing law requires the governing board of each school district to adopt a local control and accountability plan as provided and to annually update this plan. Existing law requires the plan to include certain elements. This bill would require the plan to also include an assessment of the water access points at each school in the school district, including the number, location, and whether the access points are in good condition, among other things. The bill would require the governing board of the school district to report progress on addressing any deficiencies in its annual update to the local control accountability plan. By imposing new duties on the governing board of a school district, the bill would create a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the State Department of Education to share this information with the state board, for the board to post on its Internet Web site. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
