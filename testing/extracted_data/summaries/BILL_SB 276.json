    "title": "SB 276",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income persons receive health care benefits. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. Existing law provides that specified services, including targeted case management services for children with an individualized education plan (IEP) or an individualized family service plan (IFSP), provided by local educational agencies (LEAs) are covered Medi-Cal benefits, and authorizes an LEA to bill for those services. Existing law requires the department to perform various activities with respect to the billing option for services provided by LEAs. Existing law defines an LEA as the governing body of any school district or community college district, the county office of education, a state special school, a California State University campus, or a University of California campus. This bill would require the department to seek federal financial participation for covered services that are provided by an LEA to a child who is an eligible Medi-Cal beneficiary regardless of whether the child has an IEP or an IFSP, or whether those same services are provided at no charge to the beneficiary or to the community at large, if the LEA takes all reasonable measures to ascertain and pursue claims for payment of covered services against legally liable 3rd parties. The bill would require a legally liable 3rd party to either reimburse the claim or issue a notice of denial of noncoverage of services or benefits if the legally liable 3rd party receives a claim for payment of covered services submitted by an LEA. The bill would authorize an LEA to bill the Medi-Cal program if there is no response to a claim for payment of covered services submitted to a legally liable 3rd party within 45 days, and would require the LEA to retain a copy of the claim submitted to the legally liable 3rd party for a period of 3 years. The bill would expand the definition of an LEA to include the governing body of a charter school. The bill would provide that these provisions shall not be implemented until the department obtains necessary federal approvals. This bill would also expand the authority of an LEA to provide targeted case management services."
