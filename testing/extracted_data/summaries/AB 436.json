    "title": "An act to amend Section 2356.5 of the Probate Code, relating to protective proceedings.",
    "content": "Existing law provides that, upon a court\u2019s findings that a conservatee has dementia, as defined, and a functional impairment, a conservator may place the conservatee in a prescribed secured residential or nursing facility and authorize the administration of prescribed medications appropriate for the care and treatment of dementia. A petition for authority to act under these provisions requires, among other things, that the conservatee be represented by an attorney, as provided. This bill would require the court, upon granting or denying that authority to a conservator, to either discharge the attorney or order continuation of the representation, as specified."
