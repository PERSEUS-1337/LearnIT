    "content": "The anthrax mailings in 2001, which culminated in 5 deaths, 22 infections, and contamination of both postal and congressional buildings, intensified concerns about terrorist use of biologicalagents. This event increased Congressional interest in actions to limit the vulnerability of the UnitedStates to such attacks. High-threat biological agents, defined by the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention as Category A pathogens, are considered relatively easy to disseminate, have highmortality, and have the potential for major public health impacts. High-threat biological agents cause different symptoms in their victims, depending on the pathogen. Since the nature of these agents differs, no single treatment can be given in the case ofa biological attack. As a result, treatment of the victims of a biological attack, especially one whichis covert, may be difficult. The identification process for many pathogens may be complicated bytheir incubation period, and the lack of distinct symptoms early in the disease's progress. Thedifficulties in treating the various high-threat agents may place strain on the resources of the medicalsystem, especially in the case of mass casualties. Protection from biological agents is an area of active research and development. The range of protection and detection equipment available to first responders has led to questions regardingequipment standardization and state and local preparedness. Development and distribution ofvaccines continues to be a contentious issue. Attempts to detect biological releases using sensortechnologies, or through analyzing public health data, continue to be implemented, but thesetechnologies are in relatively early stages of development. It is unclear whether terrorist groups are capable of effectively using biological agents as weapons of mass destruction, but the relatively small amounts of pathogen that may be needed toexecute a significant attack is a source of concern. Some suggest that terrorist interest in biologicalagents is increasing. However, others assert that technical difficulties would make mass casualtyattacks unlikely. Current policies seek to reduce the proliferation of biological weapons by relying on both domestic and international controls, to increase the number of countermeasures available againstsuch pathogens through research and development activities, to improve the nation's ability to detectpathogen releases, and to increase the ability of hospitals and care providers to treat mass casualties. Policymakers may be called upon to further address potential biological terrorism vulnerabilities, including overseeing the use of atmospheric monitoring equipment for pathogendetection; the direction of continued research and development into biological agent detectors;review of further research into protective equipment, prophylaxis and treatment against high-threatpathogens; and assessment of first responder emergency preparedness. This report will be updatedas events warrant."
