Trump Administration released their budget request for FY2021, including a $75.84 billion budget request for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS is the third largest agency in the federal government in terms of personnel. The appropriations bill that funds it\u00e2\u0080\u0094providing $70 billion in FY2020\u00e2\u0080\u0094is the seventh largest of the twelve annual funding measures developed by the appropriations committees, and is the only appropriations bill that funds a single agency in its entirety and nothing else. This report provides an overview of the FY2021 budget request for the Department of Homeland Security. It provides a component-level overview of the appropriations sought in the FY2021 budget request, putting the requested appropriations in the context of the FY2020 requested and enacted level of appropriations, and noting the primary drivers of changes from the FY2020 enacted level. The FY2021 budget request represents the fourth detailed budget proposed by the Trump Administration. It is the earliest release of a budget request by the Trump Administration, and comes 52 days after the enactment of the FY2020 consolidated appropriations measures\u00e2\u0080\u0094the longest such gap since the release of the FY2017 request (53 days), and the first since then to include prior-year enacted funding levels as a comparative baseline. Some of the major drivers of change in the FY2021 request include A $3 billion reduction in border barrier funding through U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) compared to the FY2020 request; A $2.4 billion reduction from the enacted level of funding due to the proposed move of the U.S. Secret Service to the Department of the Treasury; A $709 million increase in requested Transportation Security Administration (TSA) fee revenues; A $9 billion reduction in disaster relief funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) compared to the FY2020 request; A $986 million increase from the FY2020 requested level for the U.S. Coast Guard\u00e2\u0080\u0094proposing funding $129 million above the enacted level; A $1.1 billion increase from the FY2020 requested level for Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u00e2\u0080\u0094$2 billion (24%) more than enacted in FY2020; and A $456 million increase for the Transportation Security Administration's budget from the FY2020 requested level\u00e2\u0080\u0094proposing funding $59 million below the enacted level. Six of the seven smallest components by gross budget authority saw their budget requests reduced by at least 5% from the enacted level, and four of those components saw reductions of more than 10%. This report will not be updated."
