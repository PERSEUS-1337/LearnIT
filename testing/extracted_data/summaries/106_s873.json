    "title": "A bill to close the United States Army School of the Americas.",
    "content": "Directs the Secretary of the Army to close the military education and training facility known as the United States Army School of the Americas at Fort Benning, Georgia. Repeals current statutory authority for the School. Expresses the sense of the Congress that, in each training activity undertaken by the United States with foreign security forces, the Secretary of Defense should: (1) substantially increase emphasis upon respect for human rights, the proper role of a military within a democratic society, and appropriate management of defense and security policy. And (2) implement Department of Defense regulations regarding the screening of foreign candidates for inclusion in the training activity to ensure that the United States does not train individuals implicated in human rights abuses, illegal drug trafficking, or corruption."
