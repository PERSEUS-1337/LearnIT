The Administration requested $731 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative forFY2005, and $114 million for economic assistance programs. Congress also changed the level ofU.S. military and civilian contractor personnel allowed to be deployed in Colombia, in response toan Administration request. Congress continues to express concern with the volume of drugs readilyavailable in the United States and elsewhere in the world. The three largest producers of cocaine areColombia, Bolivia, and Peru, with 90% of the cocaine in the United States originating in, or passingthrough, Colombia. Regional security issues have also come into sharper focus after the attacks ofSeptember 11, 2001. The United States has made a significant commitment of funds and material support to helpColombia and the Andean region fight drug trafficking since the development of Plan Colombia in1999. Congress passed legislation providing $1.3 billion in assistance for FY2000 ( P.L. 106-246 )for Colombia and its neighbors. From FY2000 through FY2005, the United States has provided atotal of about $5.4 billion for the region in both State Department and Defense Departmentcounternarcotics funds. Congress appropriated $731 million in FY2005 funds for the AndeanCounterdrug Initiative, with an additional $106.5 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) funds. The United States also provides funding for Development Assistance, Child Survival and Health,and Economic Support Funds. In FY2005, this economic assistance was estimated to be $115.3million for ACI countries. Since 2002, Congress has granted expanded authority to usecounternarcotics funds for a unified campaign to fight both drug trafficking and terroristorganizations in Colombia.
