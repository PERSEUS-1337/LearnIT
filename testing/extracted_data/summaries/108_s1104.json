    "title": "A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide for parental involvement in abortions of dependent children of members of the Armed Forces.",
    "content": "Prohibits physicians from using facilities of the Department of Defense (DOD) to perform an abortion on a pregnant unemancipated minor who is a child of a member of the armed forces unless: (1) the physician gives at least 24 hours actual notice to the member, another parent of the minor, or a court-appointed conservator or guardian. (2) the judge of an appropriate district court issues an order authorizing the minor to consent to the abortion. (3) the appropriate district court by its inaction constructively authorizes such consent. Or (4) the physician concludes that a condition exists that necessitates immediate abortion and certifies to the appropriate medical officer of DOD, and in the patient's medical record, the medical indications supporting such judgment. Outlines provisions concerning: (1) alternative notification. And (2) physician penalties for violations. Allows: (1) such a minor, under specified procedures, to file with the court an application for the performance of the abortion without parental or guardian notification. And (2) for judicial appeal of a denial of such application."
