Defines quot, exascale computingquot. As computing through the use of a computing machine that performs near or above 10 to the 18th power floating point operations per second. Directs the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to: conduct a research program to develop exascale computing machine architectures to promote DOE missions. Establish national laboratory partnerships with industry partners and institutions of higher education (IHEs) for the research and development of exascale computing systems across all applicable DOE organizations. Provide, on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis, access for researchers in US industries, IHEs, National Laboratories, and other federal agencies to the exascale computing systems developed under this Act, select members for such partnerships through a competitive, peer-review process. And execute the program through an integration of application, computer science, and computer hardware architecture using those partnerships to ensure that exascale computing machine architectures are capable of solving DOE target applications and broader scientific problems."
