    "content": "Religious Liberty Protection Act of 2012 - Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) from implementing or enforcing any provision of the interim final rule published on July 19, 2010, related to the coverage of preventive health services under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) or any amendment to such rule insofar as such provision or amendment require any individual or entity to provide coverage of sterilization or contraceptive services to which the individual or entity is opposed on the basis of religious belief. Amends PPACA to declare that a health plan shall not be considered to have failed to provide essential health benefits, to fail to be a qualified health plan, or to fail to fulfill any other requirements on the basis that the plan does not provide or pay for coverage of sterilization or contraceptive services because: (1) providing or paying for such coverage is contrary to the religious or moral beliefs of the sponsor, issuer, or other entity offering the plan. Or (2) such coverage, in the case of individual coverage, is contrary to the religious or moral beliefs of the purchaser or beneficiary of the coverage."
