    "title": "An act to amend Section 1363 of the Health and Safety Code, and to amend Section 10603 of the Insurance Code, relating to health care coverage.",
    "content": "Existing law, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), requires a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage to provide a written summary of benefits and coverage (SBC) and requires that the SBC be provided in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner, as specified. Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires a plan or insurer to provide certain disclosures of the benefits, services, and terms of a contract or policy. Existing law requires that contracts and policies subject to PPACA satisfy certain of those disclosure requirements by providing the SBC required under PPACA. Existing law requires the departments to adopt regulations establishing standards and requirements to provide enrollees and insureds with access to language assistance, including requirements for the translation of vital documents, as specified. This bill would, commencing October 1, 2016, provide that the SBC constitutes a vital document and would require a plan or insurer to comply with requirements applicable to those documents. The bill would, commencing July 1, 2016, require the Department of Managed Health Care and the Insurance Commissioner to develop written translations of the template uniform summary of benefits and coverage and to make available those translations in specified languages on their respective Internet Web sites. Because a willful violation of those requirements by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
