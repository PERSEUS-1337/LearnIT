    "title": "An act to amend Section 667.61 of the Penal Code, relating to crimes.",
    "content": "Existing law, as amended by Proposition 83, the Sexual Predator Punishment and Control Act , approved by the voters at the November 7, 2006, statewide general election, provides that a defendant shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for 25 years to life if convicted of certain crimes, including rape, sexual penetration, sodomy, oral copulation, continuous sexual abuse of a child, or rape, spousal rape, or sexual penetration in concert, if certain circumstances were present, including, among other things, if the defendant has been previously convicted of a specified offense. Proposition 83 provides that the Legislature may amend the provisions of the act to expand the scope of their application or increase the punishment or penalties by a statute passed by a majority vote of each house. This bill would specify that the 25-year to life prison term of 25 years to life applies if the defendant has been convicted of a separate violation of a more than one specified offense on charges brought and tried separately, irrespective of the order in which the offenses were committed or the convictions obtained."
