    "content": "Neuronal assemblies, loosely defined as subsets of neurons with reoccurring spatio-temporally coordinated activation patterns, or \"motifs\", are thought to be building blocks of neural representations and information processing. We here propose LeMoNADe, a new exploratory data analysis method that facilitates hunting for motifs in calcium imaging videos, the dominant microscopic functional imaging modality in neurophysiology. Our nonparametric method extracts motifs directly from videos, bypassing the difficult intermediate step of spike extraction. Our technique augments variational autoencoders with a discrete stochastic node, and we show in detail how a differentiable reparametrization and relaxation can be used. An evaluation on simulated data, with available ground truth, reveals excellent quantitative performance. In real video data acquired from brain slices, with no ground truth available, LeMoNADe uncovers nontrivial candidate motifs that can help generate hypotheses for more focused biological investigations. Seventy years after being postulated by Hebb (1949) , the existence and importance of reoccurring spatio-temporally coordinated neuronal activation patterns (motifs), also known as neuronal assemblies, is still fiercely debated BID12 Singer, 1993; BID17 Ikegaya et al., 2004; Cossart & Sansonetti, 2004; BID4 BID13 BID20 Stevenson & Kording, 2011; BID0 Carrillo-Reid et al., 2015) . Calcium imaging, a microscopic video technique that enables the concurrent observation of hundreds of neurons in vitro and in vivo (Denk et al., 1990; Helmchen & Denk, 2005; Flusberg et al., 2008) , is best suited to witness such motifs if they indeed exist. We have presented a novel approach for the detection of neuronal assemblies that directly operates on the calcium imaging data, making the cumbersome extraction of individual cells and discrete spike times from the raw data dispensable. The motifs are extracted as short, repeating image sequences. This provides them in a very intuitive way and additionally returns information about the spatial distribution of the cells within an assembly.The proposed method's performance in identifying motifs is equivalent to that of a state-of-the-art method that requires the previous extraction of individual cells. Moreover, we were able to identify repeating firing patterns in two datasets from hippocampal slice cultures, proving that the method is capable of handling real calcium imaging conditions.For future work, a post-processing step as used in BID21 or a group sparsity regularization similar to the ones used in BID2 or BID10 could be added to determine a plausible number of motifs automatically. Moreover, additional latent dimensions could be introduced to capture artefacts and background fluctuations and hence automatically separate them from the actual motifs. The method is expected to, in principle, also work on other functional imaging modalities. We will investigate the possibility of detecting motifs using LeMoNADe on recordings from human fMRI or voltage-sensitive dyes in the future."
