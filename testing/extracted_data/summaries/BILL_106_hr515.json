Requires that such regulations, at a minimum, set forth a minimum safety standard that such a product must meet in order to be manufactured, sold, transferred, or delivered consistent with this Act. Directs the Secretary, in developing the standard, to: (1) give appropriate consideration to products that are not detachable, but are permanently installed and incorporated into the design of a handgun. And (2) consider using test protocols relating to poison prevention packaging standards. Requires the standard to ensure that any product that meets the standard is of adequate quality and construction to prevent children from operating a handgun, and that such product cannot be removed except through the use of a key, combination, or other method of access made possible by the manufacturer. Authorizes the Secretary to issue an order: (1) prohibiting the manufacture, sale, transfer, or delivery of a product which the Secretary finds has been designed, or has been or is intended to be manufactured, transferred, or distributed, in violation of this Act. And (2) requiring the manufacturer of, and any dealer in, a product which the Secretary finds to violate such provision to provide notice of the risks associated with the product. To bring the product into conformity with regulations prescribed by this Act. To repair, replace, refund the purchase price of, or recall, the product. Or to submit to the Secretary a satisfactory plan for implementation of any such action. Authorizes the Secretary, at reasonable times in order to ascertain compliance, to: (1) enter any place in which products are manufactured, stored, or held, for distribution in commerce, and inspect those areas. And (2) enter and inspect any conveyance being used to transport a product for commercial purposes. Prohibits: (1) a licensed manufacturer or importer from selling, transferring, or delivering to any person any handgun without a product that meets the standard. And (2) a licensed dealer from selling, transferring, or delivering to any person any handgun without the product supplied to the dealer by the licensed manufacturer or importer. Makes exceptions for Federal, state, and local governments. Prohibits a licensed manufacturer, importer, or dealer from selling, transferring, or delivering a handgun: (1) with accompanying packaging or other descriptive materials without a specified warning label regarding the consequences of child operation of, child access to, and storage of, handguns. And (2) without accompanying packaging or other descriptive materials unless the label described is affixed to the handgun by a method to be prescribed by the Secretary. Sets forth reporting requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to assess civil penalties, and to revoke a Federal firearms license, under specified circumstances. Creates a private right of action for damages by persons aggrieved by a violation of this Act. Sets forth criminal penalties for violations.
