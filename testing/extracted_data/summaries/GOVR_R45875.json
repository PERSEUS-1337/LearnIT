    "content": "The Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill contains funding for more than 30 agencies and entities. They include most of the Department of the Interior (DOI) as well as agencies within other departments, such as the Forest Service within the Department of Agriculture and the Indian Health Service within the Department of Health and Human Services. The bill also provides funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), arts and cultural agencies, and other organizations and entities. Issues for Congress include determining the amount, terms, and conditions of funding for agencies and programs. Currently, Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies generally are receiving appropriations at the FY2019 level (in Division E of P.L. 116-6 ). Continuing appropriations are being provided because no regular appropriations were provided before the start of the 2020 fiscal year (on October 1, 2019). Division A of P.L. 116-59 provided continuing appropriations through November 21, 2019. The House and Senate passed a measure extending continuing appropriations through December 20, 2019, unless full-year appropriations are enacted sooner. The President signed that measure on November 21, 2019. For FY2020, President Trump requested $32.47 billion for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, including $2.25 billion for DOI and Forest Service wildfire suppression under a discretionary cap adjustment. For the 10 major DOI agencies in Title I of the bill, the request was $11.75 billion, or 36.2% of the $32.47 billion total requested. For EPA, funded in Title II of the bill, the request was $6.22 billion, or 19.2% of the total. For the 23 agencies and other entities currently funded in Title III of the bill, the request was $14.50 billion, or 44.7% of the total. The President's FY2020 request would be $3.14 billion (8.8%) lower than the FY2019 regular enacted appropriation of $35.61 billion (in P.L. 116-6 , Division E), and $4.72 billion (12.7%) lower than the FY2019 total appropriation of $37.19 billion, which included $1.58 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for disaster relief (in P.L. 116-20 , Title VII). (See the figure below.) On June 25, 2019, the House passed H.R. 3055 with $39.59 billion (in Division C) in FY2020 appropriations for agencies in the Interior bill. This total included $2.25 billion for wildfire suppression under the cap adjustment, as requested by the President. The FY2020 House-passed total would be $2.40 billion (6.4%) higher than the FY2019 total of $37.19 billion in regular and emergency appropriations, and $3.98 billion (11.2%) higher than the FY2019 total of $35.61 billion in regular appropriations. It would also be $7.12 billion (21.9%) higher than the President's FY2020 request of $32.47 billion and $1.48 billion (3.9%) higher than the FY2020 Senate-passed amount of $38.11 billion. On October 31, 2019, the Senate passed H.R. 3055 with $38.11 billion (in Division C) for agencies in the Interior bill. This total included $2.25 billion for wildfire suppression under the cap adjustment. The FY2020 Senate-passed total would be $918.8 million (2.5%) higher than the FY2019 total of $37.19 billion in regular and emergency appropriations, $2.50 billion (7.0%) higher than the FY2019 total of $35.61 billion in regular appropriations, and $5.64 billion (17.4%) higher than the FY2020 President's request of $32.47 billion. However, the Senate-passed amount would be $1.48 billion (3.7%) lower than the FY2020 House-passed amount of $39.59 billion. For individual agencies and programs in the bill, there are many differences among the funding levels enacted for FY2019 and those requested by the President for FY2020, approved by the House for FY2020, and approved by the Senate for FY2020. This report highlights funding for selected agencies and programs that have been among the many of interest to Congress, stakeholders, and the public. They include the Bureau of Land Management, EPA, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, Indian Affairs, Indian Health Service, Land and Water Conservation Fund, National Park Service, Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program, Reorganization of DOI, Smithsonian Institution, U.S. Geological Survey, and Wildland Fire Management."
