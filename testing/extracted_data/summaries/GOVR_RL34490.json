    "content": "The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act, P.L. 111-8, was enacted on March 11, 2009. Division G of the act provides $4.4 billion for legislative branch activities. This represents an approximate 11% increase over the nearly $4 billion approved by Congress for FY2008. Legislative branch entities had requested nearly $4.7 billion for FY2009, or an increase of 18%. An additional $25 million was provided for the Government Accountability Office in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5). On September 30, 2008, the President signed the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 110-329, 122 Stat. 3574). Division A, the FY2009 Continuing Appropriations Resolution, extended funding for nine FY2009 regular appropriations bills, including the legislative branch, from October 1, 2008, through March 6, 2009. P.L. 111-6 continued funding through March 11, 2009. The House Appropriations Legislative Branch Subcommittee previously held a markup of the FY2009 bill on June 23, 2008, and ordered it reported to the full committee. The subcommittee bill provided $3.4 billion for the legislative branch (excluding Senate items). Neither the full House Appropriations Committee nor the Senate Appropriations Committee held a markup on the bill. Among issues that were considered during hearings on the FY2009 budget in the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, Subcommittees on Legislative Branch, are the following: completion of the Capitol Visitor Center and funding for initial activities; the designation of appropriate locations for tour buses to drop off and pick up visitors given security concerns around the Capitol Complex; the Architect's request for $127 million to repair the Capitol Power Plant utility tunnels in accordance with the settlement agreed to with the Office of Compliance; funds for the Digital Talking Book program within the Library of Congress; the use of funds the U.S. Capitol Police received in the FY2007 emergency appropriations act to purchase new interoperable radios; funds requested to support the \"Greening of the Capitol\" initiative and the use of alternative fuels; and the future of the Open World Leadership Program, including the location of the program within the government and the selection of participant countries. This report will be updated to reflect major congressional action."
