    "content": "Foreign Business Bribery Prohibition Act of 2016 This bill amends the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) to authorize private rights of action against persons that violate the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions, which prohibit giving things of value to foreign officials or political parties for purposes of obtaining or retaining business. A person that violates the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions shall be liable for up to treble damages to a securities issuer, domestic business concern, or US person damaged by the violation. A plaintiff must prove an FCPA anti-bribery violation by the defendant that: (1) prevented the plaintiff from obtaining or retaining business, and (2) assisted the defendant in obtaining or retaining such business."
