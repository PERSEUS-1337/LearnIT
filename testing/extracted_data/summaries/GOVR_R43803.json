    "content": "Under the United States Grain Standards Act (USGSA) of 1916, the federal government is authorized to establish official marketing standards (not health and safety standards) for grains and oilseeds, and to provide procedures for grain inspection and weighing. To encourage the marketing of high-quality grain for an agriculture sector that is highly dependent on export demand, the USGSA requires that exported grains and oilseeds be officially inspected (if sold by grade) and weighed. Domestic shipments do not require official inspection and weighing, but the service is available and is often performed. As authorized by the USGSA, all official services are financed by user fees, with the federal portion of fee revenue maintained in a trust fund. Activities such as developing grain standards and procedures for measuring quality are financed with congressionally appropriated funds. The Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) promotes the uniform application of U.S. grain standards by official inspection personnel. FGIS inspects or oversees the inspection (by official state or private agencies) of more than half of the grain produced in the United States. FGIS directly inspects about two-thirds of exported grain and oversees the inspection (by state agencies) of the remainder. Most of the USGSA is permanently authorized, including mandatory inspection and weighing of exported grain, as well as authority to amend grain standards of quality. However, several provisions were set to expire on September 30, 2015. A lapse in authorization could have disrupted the current grain inspection and weighing program, but it would not necessarily have halted official grain inspections. The USGSA was reauthorized on September 30, 2015, with the enactment of the Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-54). Four expiring provisions\u2014authority for appropriations, authority to charge fees, an administrative/supervisory cost cap, and authority for an advisory committee\u2014were extended until September 30, 2020. Besides extending the four expiring provisions, the act addressed several policy issues. These policy issues were included in either the original House (H.R. 2088) or Senate (S. 1417) reauthorization bills, or both. For example, the final reauthorization act (P.L. 114-54) included provisions on disruptions in inspection and weighing services. The act requires USDA to take immediate action to address a disruption of inspection and weighing services, but leaves the decision about how to resume services to the Secretary. The act also requires USDA to keep Congress informed should there be other disruptions in service. P.L. 114-54 also allows customers to utilize inspection and weighing services outside of exclusive geographic boundaries if certain conditions are met. In addition, the act requires that delegated state agencies be certified every five years and UDSA has one year to establish a notice-and-comment process for certifying delegated state agencies."
