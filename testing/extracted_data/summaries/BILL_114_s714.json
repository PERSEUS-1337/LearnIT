    "content": "Frontline Mental Health Provider Training Act Requires the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to jointly commence a pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of expanding use of physician assistants specializing in psychiatric medicine at DOD and VA medical facilities in order to meet the increasing demand for mental health care providers at such facilities through the completion of two 18-month psychiatry fellowship programs for physician assistants. Directs DOD to carry out the pilot program at not less than one military medical treatment facility under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Army, one under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy, and one under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Air Force. Requires the VA to carry out the program at not less than three VA medical centers. Requires each Department to select at least 12 physician assistants to participate in each fellowship program. Sets forth qualifications for eligible physician assistants. Requires each fellowship program to: (1) meet the training model for acuity, mixture, and volume established for psychiatric residency programs. And (2) provide to the selected individuals training equivalent to that received during a psychiatric residency, education leading to a clinical doctorate of science in psychiatry, and education that addresses the particular needs of rural and other under served populations of members of the Armed Forces and veterans."
