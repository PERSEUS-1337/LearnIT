    "content": "During the 108th Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate Finance Committee approved two different versions of a bill that would have reauthorized and revised the TemporaryAssistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant. This legislation, H.R. 4 , alsoincluded many changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. H.R. 4 waspassed by the House in February 2003. The Senate Finance Committee reported a substitute versionof the bill in September 2003 ( S.Rept. 108-162 ). On March 29-April 1, 2004, the Senate debatedH.R. 4; disagreement arose regarding amendments to the bill, and Republicans failed topass a motion to limit debate. H.R. 4 was not passed by the Senate. Although not identical, both versions of H.R. 4 were similar in focus, direction, and content with respect to the CSE provisions. Both versions of H.R. 4 includedprovisions that sought to improve the CSE program and raise collections so as to increase theeconomic independence of former welfare families and provide a stable source of income for allsingle-parent families with a noncustodial parent. Both versions of the bill provided incentives (inthe form of federal cost sharing) to states to direct more of the child support collected on behalf offamilies to the families themselves, thereby reducing the amount that state and federal governmentsretain (often referred to as a family-first policy). Under both bills, families currently receiving TANFbenefits as well as former TANF recipients would have potentially received a larger share of childsupport that was collected on their behalf. The approach used by the bills differed significantly, however, with regard to how states would help TANF families receive more child support. Under the House-passed bill, states would havebeen given federal cost sharing incentives to encourage states to increase (or establish) the amountof child support payments they pass through to TANF families (and disregard in determining TANFbenefits). The Senate Finance Committee version of the bill provided federal cost-sharing for theentire amount that the state disregards and passes through to families. Moreover, the House-passedbill provided a more limited amount of federal cost sharing for state pass-through and disregardpolicies than the Senate Finance Committee bill. Both versions of the bill would have revised some CSE enforcement tools and added others; increased funding for the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS); increased funding for federaltechnical assistance to the states; required states to review child support orders of TANF familiesevery three years; and required that a report be submitted to Congress on undistributed child supportcollections. The House-passed bill included a provision that would have established a $25 annualuser fee for individuals who had never been on TANF but received CSE services and who receivedat least $500 in any given year. The Senate Finance Committee-approved bill included provisionsthat would have increased funding for the CSE access and visitation program; and required statesto adopt a later version of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) so as to facilitate thecollection of child support payments in interstate cases.
