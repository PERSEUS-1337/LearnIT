    "title": "SB 330",
    "content": "Existing law prohibits Members of the Legislature, and state, county, district, judicial district, and city officers or employees from being financially interested in a contract, as specified, made by them in their official capacity or by any body or board of which they are members, subject to specified exceptions. Existing law identifies certain remote interests that are not subject to this prohibition and other situations in which an official is not deemed to be financially interested in a contract, including, among others, that of a parent in the earnings of his or her minor child for personal services. Existing law makes a willful violation of this prohibition a crime. This bill would, on and after January 1, 2017, instead include within the definition of remote interests that of a public officer who is an elected member of any state or local body, board, or commission, if that public officer\u2019s spouse, child, parent, sibling, or the spouse of the child, parent, or sibling, has a financial interest in any contract made by that public officer in his or her official capacity, or by any body, board, or commission of which that public officer is a member. Existing law imposes a criminal penalty for every officer or person who willfully violates the prohibitions against making or being financially interested in contracts, as specified. This bill would additionally provide that a member who knows and fails to disclose his or her remote interest in a contract, as defined, or knows and willfully fails to disclose the fact of his or her remote interest in a contract, as defined, is subject to criminal penalty. By expanding these prohibitions, this bill would create a new crime, and thus, would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
