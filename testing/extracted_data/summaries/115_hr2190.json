Examine the establishment of central DHS locations in each such geographical region and the co-location of DHS components based on their mission sets and responsibilities. Identify opportunities to reduce overhead costs through co-location or consolidation of real property interests or mission support activities. Manage the current Department Workspace Standard for Office Space in accordance with the DHS office workspace design process to develop the most efficient and effective spaces within the workspace standard net usable square foot ranges for all leases for office space entered into after enactment of this bill.

And (2) acting through regional property managers, to report annually to DHS on underutilized space and identify space that may be made available for use by other components or federal agencies. DHS may grant an exception to the workspace standard usable square foot ranges for specific office locations at which a reduction or elimination of otherwise underutilized space would negatively impact a component's ability to execute its mission based on readiness performance measures or would increase the cost of such space. Each component shall identify a senior career employee to serve as the property manager for each geographic region. Each such manager shall: (1) serve as a single point of contact for DHS headquarters and other DHS components for real property matters, (2) provide data and any other support necessary for the DHS Regional Mission Support Coordinator strategic asset and portfolio planning and execution, and (3) provide to DHS annually data on each component's real property holdings.
