    "title": "AB 316",
    "content": "Under existing law, the Veterinary Medicine Practice Act, the Veterinary Medical Board licenses and regulates veterinarians and the practice of veterinary medicine. It is unlawful for any person to practice veterinary medicine in this state unless he or she holds a valid, unexpired, and unrevoked license issued by the board, except under specified circumstances, including when regularly licensed veterinarians are actually called from other states to attend cases in this state and do not open an office or appoint a place to do business within the state. This bill would further specify, for purposes of that provision, that a regularly licensed veterinarian in good standing who is called from another state by a law enforcement agency or animal control agency to attend to cases that are a part of an investigation of an alleged violation of federal or state animal fighting or animal cruelty laws within a single geographic location shall be exempt from specified licensing requirements if the agency determines that it is necessary to call the veterinarian in order to conduct the investigation, as specified. The bill would require an agency, department, or officer that calls a veterinarian pursuant to these provisions to notify the board of the investigation. The bill would also authorize a veterinarian who is called from another state to care for animals that are affected by an investigation with a temporary shelter facility established only for the purpose of the investigation, which would be exempt from specified registration requirements if it meets specified conditions."
