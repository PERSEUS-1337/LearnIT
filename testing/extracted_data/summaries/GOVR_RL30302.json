    "content": "The excise tax on tires was first levied in 1918 mainly because of revenue needs broughtabout by World War I. The tax was reduced after the war and then repealed in 1926. The levy wasreintroduced during the Great Depression at a time when federal individual income tax revenueswere plummeting and was increased to help finance World War II. A general reduction in rates wasin the offing just before the outbreak of the Korean conflict but revenue needs brought about by thatwar prevented the lowering of rates. More recent history shows that in 1956 the rate of the tax wasraised in response to legislation enacted to build the interstate highway system and to create theHighway Trust Fund. Scheduled reductions did not occur after the construction of the interstatehighway system had been extended. A goal of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982was to redistribute highway costs between car and truck users. At that time, the tax structure waschanged so that the tax was imposed only on heavy tires with tax rates that are graduated, andincreased along with the tire's weight. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 repealed the exclusion ofthe value of the tires from the 12% retail excise tax on heavy highway trucks, trailers, and tractors,but provided a credit offset to the retail tax for the tire tax paid. Under the American Jobs CreationAct of 2004 the tax based on tire weight was replaced with rates based on the load capacity of thetire. The federal excise tax imposed on tires is now scheduled to expire on October 1, 2011. Today, the premise for the excise tax on tires is that heavier vehicles cause greater damageto both roadways and bridges, and that the excise tax on tires resembles a pricing mechanism thatis a proxy for highway wear-and-tear charges. This premise still holds true as load capacity mustexceed 3,500 pounds before the tax is imposed, thus exempting tires on lighter vehicles. Tire excisetaxes still produce revenues for the Highway Trust Fund and repeal of the existing tax would requireadditional taxes to be imposed on other sources so as to provide an equivalent amount of revenuesto build and maintain roadways. This excise tax is said to be easy to administer with minimal federalcollection costs. Several arguments are advanced against the imposition of the tire tax. First, some view thisselective excise tax as discriminating against the tire and related industries whose products are taxedand also the trucking industry, which depends on the product. The commercial truck transportationindustry pays this tax while competitors such as railroads and waterways have no correspondingexcise tax, thus creating an intermodal equity issue. Second, to the extent that the excise tax on tiresis passed forward into the cost of goods sold, it places a burden on lower income individuals sinceindividuals with lower incomes, relative to those with higher incomes, tend to spend a larger portionof their income for the same consumption amount (thus, to the extent that the tax is passed forwardto consumers, the tax is regressive).
