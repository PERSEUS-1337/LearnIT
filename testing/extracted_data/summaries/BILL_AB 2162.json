    "title": "AB 2162",
    "content": "The Z\u2019berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act of 1973 prohibits a person from conducting timber operations unless a timber harvesting plan prepared by a registered professional forester has been submitted to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The Oak Woodlands Conservation Act provides funding for the conservation and protection of California\u2019s oak woodlands. Any violation of the Fish and Game Code is a crime. This bill would enact the Oak Woodlands Protection Act, which would prohibit a person from removing from an oak woodland, as defined, specified oak trees, unless an oak removal plan and oak removal permit application for the oak tree removal has been submitted to and approved by the Director of Fish and Wildlife. By June, 30, 2016, the bill would require the Fish and Game Commission to adopt regulations to implement the act, including regulations establishing an oak removal permit application fee. The bill would require the fee to be deposited into the Oak Woodlands Protection Act Fund, as created by the bill. Moneys in the fund would be continuously appropriated to the department for purposes of paying the total costs incurred by the department in administering and enforcing the act, thereby making an appropriation. The bill would provide that any person who violates the act is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 for each violation. The bill would require all civil penalties collected to be apportioned in a specified manner, including 50 to be distributed to the Wildlife Conservation Board for deposit into the Oak Woodlands Conservation Fund. Existing law requires a county to determine whether a project may result in a conversion of oak woodlands that will have a significant effect on the environment, and if it does, existing law requires the county to require one or more specified oak woodlands mitigation alternatives to mitigate the significant effect. This bill would delete this law. To the extent this bill would provide for additional criminal prosecutions for violations of the Fish and Game Code, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
