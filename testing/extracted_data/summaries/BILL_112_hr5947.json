    "content": "Justice Exists for All of Us Act of 2012 - Prohibits a state, for each fiscal year beginning after three years after enactment of this Act, from having in effect a law or policy that: (1) allows a person to use deadly force when such person is threatened and that does not, except where the person is a victim of domestic violence, impose a duty to retreat before using such force in any place where that person is lawfully present. Or (2) allows the establishment, organization, or operation of, or participation in, a Neighborhood Watch program that is not registered with the local law enforcement agency and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Allows the Attorney General to authorize up to two one-year extensions of such deadline. Provides that a state that fails to substantially implement this Act for any fiscal year shall not receive 20 of the funds that would otherwise be allocated to it under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program. Provides for alternative procedures for compliance by a state that is unable to substantially implement this Act because of a conflict with the state's constitution."
