    "title": "AB 774",
    "content": "Existing law, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, authorizes a licensed winegrower or a licensed beer manufacturer to apply to the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control for a certified farmers\u2019 market sales permit, which allows, among others, the licensee to sell wine or beer at a certified farmers\u2019 market, under specified conditions, and requires the licensee to pay a fee of $50 for the permit. Existing law requires a certified farmers\u2019 market sales permit issued to a licensed winegrower, but not a licensed beer manufacturer, to allow an instructional tasting event on the subject of wine at a certified farmers\u2019 market, under specified conditions. Existing law provides that moneys collected as fees pursuant to the act are to be deposited in the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund. These moneys are generally allocated to the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control upon appropriation by the Legislature. This bill would also require a certified farmers\u2019 market sales permit issued to a licensed beer manufacturer to allow an instructional tasting event on the subject of beer at a certified farmers\u2019 market, under specified conditions. Existing law authorizes specified nonprofit corporations that have not been issued a license authorizing the sale of wine to receive and possess wine donated to that nonprofit corporation, if the nonprofit corporation has submitted a license application to sell wine with the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. This bill would additionally authorize those nonprofit corporations to receive and possess beer under the same circumstances. Existing law authorizes the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to issue a special temporary on-sale or off-sale wine license to a nonprofit corporation that is exempt from payment of income taxes, subject to specified requirements and limitations. This bill would extend this authorization to issue a special temporary on-sale or off-sale license to sell beer."
