    "content": "Preserving Crime Victims' Restitution Act of 2006 - Amends the federal criminal code to establish guidelines for cases in which a defendant in a criminal prosecution dies prior to the final adjudication of guilt. Sets forth rules for restitution to victims, appeals, motions, petitions, and civil forfeiture in such cases. Provides, as a general rule, that the death of a defendant who has been convicted of a federal criminal offense shall not be the basis for abating or otherwise invalidating a plea of guilty or nolo contendere accepted, a verdict returned, a sentence announced, or a judgment entered prior to the death of such defendant, or for dismissing or otherwise invalidating the indictment, information, or complaint, except as provided by this Act."
