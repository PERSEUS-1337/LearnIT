    "title": "AB 2760",
    "content": "Existing law regulates the relationship between landlord and tenant and the terms and conditions of tenancies. This bill would authorize a tenant to maintain a support animal, as defined, on the property if specified conditions are met. This bill would authorize a tenancy to be terminated or a tenant to be denied accommodations on the property for having a support animal if specified conditions apply. This bill would authorize the landlord to require tenants with support animals to adhere to all standards that are imposed uniformly on all tenants and to include the payment of an extra charge or security deposit for maintaining a support animal on the property. This bill would prohibit a tenant from maintaining any protected species, venomous reptiles, amphibians or insects, or any other illegal species as a support animal. Existing law requires the owners of assistance dogs to comply with all state and local ordinances regarding health and licensure requirements. This bill would expand that requirement by also making it applicable to support animals. This bill would authorize a residential lease to require a tenant who possesses a support animal, as defined, on the rented premises or associated common areas to be subject to specified conditions, and would require a breach of these conditions, if contained in the lease, to be a breach of the lease. The bill would provide that a tenant or prospective tenant shall not be prohibited from possessing a support animal on the rented premises or associated common areas if the tenant or prospective tenant satisfies specified conditions."
