    "title": "To amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to provide for uniform food safety warning notification requirements, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "National Uniformity for Food Act of 2004 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to prohibit any State or political subdivision from establishing or continuing in effect for any food in interstate commerce: (1) any requirement that is not identical to specified FDCA provisions , including those related to adulterated foods, unsafe food additives, and new animal drugs. Or (2) any notification requirement that provides for a warning concerning the food's safety that is not identical to FDCA provisions. Allows current State notification or food safety requirements to continue for 180 days, during which such State may petition for an exemption or a new national standard. Allows a State to petition for an exemption or to establish a national standard regarding any requirement under FDCA or the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act relating to food regulation. Allows the Secretary of Health and Human Service to provide such an exemption if the requirement: (1) protects an important public interest that would otherwise be unprotected. (2) would not cause any food to be in violation of any Federal law. And (3) would not unduly burden interstate commerce. Allows a State to establish a requirement that would otherwise violate FDCA provisions relating to national uniform nutrition labeling or this Act if the requirement is needed to address an imminent hazard to health that is likely to result in serious adverse health consequences and if other requirements are met. Declares that this Act does not preempt State and local laws relating to freshness dating, open date labeling, grade labeling, a State inspection stamp, religious dietary labeling, organic or natural designation, returnable bottle labeling, unit pricing, a statement of geographic origin, or a consumer advisory relating to food sanitation imposed on a food establishment or recommended by the Secretary."
