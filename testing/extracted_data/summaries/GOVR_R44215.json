    "content": "This report is part of a suite of reports that discuss appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2016. It specifically discusses appropriations for the components of DHS included in the second title of the homeland security appropriations bill\u2014Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), and the U.S. Secret Service (USSS). Collectively, Congress has labeled these components in recent years as \"Security, Enforcement, and Investigations.\" The report provides an overview of the Administration's FY2016 request for Security, Enforcement, and Investigations, the appropriations proposed by the House and Senate appropriations committees in response, and those enacted thus far. Rather than limiting the scope of its review to the second title, the report includes information on provisions throughout the bills and report that directly affect these functions. Security, Enforcement, and Investigations is the largest of the four titles that carry the bulk of the funding in the bill. The Administration requested $32,481 million for these components in FY2016, $807 million more than was provided for FY2015. The amount requested for these components is 78.5% of the Administration's $41.4 billion request for DHS in net discretionary budget authority. The proposed increase in discretionary funding for the components is 46.7% of the total net increase requested for the department. The largest budget increase proposed in the request for these five agencies was $806 million (7.4%) for CBP, while the largest budget decrease proposed was $227 million (2.8%) for the USCG. Senate-reported S. 1619 would have provided the components included in this title $32,484 million in net discretionary budget authority. This would have been $3 million (0.01%) more than requested, and $810 million (2.6%) more than was provided in FY2015. House-reported H.R. 3128 would have provided the components included in this title $32,182 million in net discretionary budget authority. This would have been $299 million (0.9%) less than requested, and $508 million (1.6%) more than was provided in FY2015. On December 18, 2015, the President signed into law P.L. 114-113, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Division F of which was the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2016. The act included $33,062 million for these components in FY2016, $1,388 million (4.4%) more that was provided for FY2015, and $581 million (1.8%) more than was requested. Additional information on the broader subject of FY2016 funding for the department can be found in CRS Report R44053, Department of Homeland Security Appropriations: FY2016, as well as links to analytical overviews and details regarding appropriations for other components. This report will be updated if supplemental appropriations are provided for any of these components through the FY2016 appropriations process."
