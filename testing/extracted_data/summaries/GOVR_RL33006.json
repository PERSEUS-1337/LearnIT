    "content": "The House approved an omnibus energy bill ( H.R. 6 ) on April 21, 2005, thatwould open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas leasing, substantiallychange oversight of electric utilities, increase the use of alternative motor fuels, provide $8.1 billionin energy tax incentives, and authorize numerous energy R&D programs. The Senate passed itsversion of H.R. 6 on June 28 without ANWR provisions but with $14.1 billion in taxincentives -- including a nuclear energy production credit -- and provisions on global climate change.Highlights of the bills include: Electricity. Both the House and the Senate versions of the bill would repeal the Public UtilityHolding Company Act (PUHCA), but the Senate bill has provisions for more stringent oversight ofutility mergers than the House version. Standard market design (SMD) would be remanded to theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) by the House bill, while the Senate version wouldterminate the rulemaking altogether. Renewable Energy. An increase in renewable fuel and ethanol consumption to 5 billiongallons annually by 2012 would be mandated by the House bill, as opposed to 8 billion gallons inthe Senate bill. The Senate bill includes a \"renewable portfolio standard\" (RPS) -- rejected in theHouse -- requiring utilities to generate at least 10% of their electricity from renewable energy sourcesby 2020. MTBE. Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), a gasoline additive widely used to meet CleanAir Act requirements, has caused water contamination. The House and Senate bills would phase outthe use of MTBE with some possible exceptions and provide funds for MTBE cleanup, with somedifferences. The House version would provide protection for fuel producers and blenders ofrenewable fuels and MTBE from defective product lawsuits, while the Senate bill would coverrenewable fuels but not MTBE. Energy Taxes. The House bill would reduce energy taxes by about $8.1 billion over 11 years,as compared with $14.1 billion in the Senate version. A nuclear energy production tax credit isincluded among the Senate incentives. ANWR. The House-passed bill would authorize oil and gas exploration, development, andproduction in ANWR, with a 2,000-acre limit on production and support facilities. No ANWRprovisions are included in the Senate version. Energy Production on Federal Lands. Both bills include numerous provisions to increaseenergy production on federal lands. The Senate version of H.R. 6 would require aninventory of oil and natural gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), while the Houseversion would not. This report will not be updated."
