    "title": "An act to amend Section 67386 of the Education Code, relating to student safety.",
    "content": "Existing law requires the governing boards of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions to adopt and implement written procedures or protocols to ensure that students, faculty, and staff who are victims of sexual assault on the grounds or facilities of their institutions receive treatment and information, including a description of on-campus and off-campus resources. Existing law also requires the governing boards of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions, in order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, to adopt policies concerning sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking that include certain elements, including an affirmative consent standard in the determination of whether consent was given by a complainant. Existing law also requires these governing boards, in order to receive those state funds, to adopt certain sexual assault policies and protocols, as specified, and requires the governing boards, to the extent feasible, to enter into memoranda of understanding or other agreements or collaborative partnerships with on-campus and community-based organizations to refer students for assistance or make services available to students. Existing law also requires the governing boards, in order to receive those state funds, to implement comprehensive prevention and outreach programs addressing sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. This bill would make nonsubstantive changes in this provision."
