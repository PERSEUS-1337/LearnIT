    "content": "The economic rise of China and the growing network of trade and investment relations innortheast Asia are causing major changes in human, economic, political, and military interactionamong countries in the region. This is affecting U.S. relations with China, China's relations with itsneighbors, the calculus for war across the Taiwan Straits, and the basic interests and policies ofChina, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. These, in turn, affect U.S. strategy in Asia. China, forexample, has embarked on a \"smile strategy\" in which it is attempting to coopt the interests ofneighboring countries through trade and investment while putting forth a less threatening militaryface (to everyone but Taiwan). Under the rubric of the Six-Party Talks, the United States, China,Japan, Russia, and South Korea are cooperating to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis. Taiwanese businesses have invested an estimated $70 to $100 billion in factories in coastal China. China relies on foreign invested enterprises for about half its imports and exports. For Taiwan,Japan, and South Korea, China has displaced the United States as their major trading partner. China interacts with Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea on four levels: human relations,economic and financial interaction, diplomatic and political intercourse, and military relations. Thetemperature of relations at each level ranges from cold to hot depending on the type of interactionand country or state being considered. At the human level the temperatures are mixed, at theeconomic level hot, at the diplomatic level cold for Taiwan to warm for South Korea, and at themilitary level, temperatures of interaction are cold. The implications of China's globalization and rise as a major economic power can be seenin its impact both on Beijing and on policy deliberations in Taipei, Tokyo, and Seoul. The ChineseCommunist leadership not only is having to cede space in its decision making process to industrialinterests but the leaders themselves are coming into power with experience in the transformation ofsociety that comes from development and modernization after opening to the outside world. Chinanow depends on international investment and trade for the economic growth needed to maintain theparty's legitimacy. For China's trading partners, dependency on the Chinese market means thatBeijing is looming larger in all aspects of policy making. While this is not likely to challenge U.S.security ties with Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, it raises several policy issues. One is how to dealwith a modernizing and more powerful Chinese military financed by the growing Chinese economy. Another is how to explicitly incorporate into U.S. policy the greater weight that Beijing is beinggiven in policy deliberations in Tokyo and Seoul. A further policy issue is whether to take explicitmeasures to offset the rising economic clout of China and attempts by Beijing to create East Asianinstitutions with China at the center and the United States pushed to the periphery. A positive resultof the mutual trade and financial dependency that has developed in northeast Asia is that all partiesnow have much to lose by an international military crisis that would interrupt economic and financialflows in the region. All four governments, therefore, seek stability in international relations. Thisreport will be updated as circumstances warrant."
