    "content": "On February 4, 2008, President Bush sent his FY2009 budget request to Congress. The House Appropriations State-Foreign Operations Subcommittee marked up its then-unnumbered bill on July 16. The Chairwoman's Mark totaled $36.62 billion, $3.82 billion more than FY2008 enacted levels. No further action on that bill occurred. The Senate took up its State Department-Foreign Operations appropriation bill (S. 3288) on July 18; the full Senate Appropriations Committee reported it out the same day with $36.78 billion for FY2009. With no further progress on several appropriations bills, on September 24, the House approved a continuing resolution (H.R. 2638) that continued most funding through March 6, 2009, at FY2008 levels. The President signed the bill into law (P.L. 110-329) on September 30. The 111th Congress passed another CR on March 6, 2009 (P.L. 111-6) funding the government through March 11, 2009. On May 2, 2008, the Administration requested supplemental funds for FY2009. Congress took action on both the pending FY2008 and newly requested FY2009 supplemental appropriations (H.R. 2642) in May and June. Congress passed the supplemental at the end of June; the President signed it into law (P.L. 110-252) on June 30, 2008. (For more detail, see CRS Report RL34451, FY2008 Spring Supplemental Appropriations and FY2009 Bridge Appropriations for Military Operations, International Affairs, and Other Purposes (P.L. 110-252), by [author name scrubbed] et al.) This report analyzes the FY2009 request, recent-year funding trends, and congressional action for FY2009. This report will be updated to further reflect congressional action."
