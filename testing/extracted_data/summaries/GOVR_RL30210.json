    "content": "The military construction (MilCon) appropriations bill finances (1) military construction projects in the United States and overseas; (2) military family housing operations and construction;(3) U.S. contributions to the NATO Security Investment Program; and (4) most base realignment andclosure costs. This paper reviews the appropriations and authorization process for military construction. The congressional debate perennially centers on the adequacy of the President's budget for militaryconstruction needs and the necessity for congressional add-ons, especially for Guard and Reserveprojects. In recent years, Congress has pointed out that the Pentagon has not funded nor plannedadequately for military construction. The Administration has asked the Congress to approve an unusual funding mechanism for the FY2000 military construction program, in order to fit its defense budget request within the caps seton total discretionary spending in the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997. For FY2000, theAdministration has requested budget authority of $5.4 billion, which is only part of the fundingnecessary to carry out the proposed projects. The rest of the FY2000 military construction programwould be funded by advance appropriations of $3.1 billion in FY2001. (In this advanceappropriations proposal, Congress would approve the $3.1 billion now for the FY2000 program,which would be spent and scored in FY2001.) Adding the split FY2000 request with the advanceappropriations request brings the total value of the proposed FY2000 military construction programto $8.5 billion. This total continues a downward trend from the FY1996 level of $11.2 billion, theFY1997 level of $9.8 billion, the FY1998 level of $9.3 billion and the FY1999 level of $8.7 billion. Appropriations and authorization hearings on the FY2000 military construction budget have highlighted the following issues: split funding and advance appropriations proposal for the FY2000 militaryconstruction budget request, long-term planning for the military construction program,and implementation of privatization of the military family housinginitiative. The conference committee for military construction appropriations printed its conference report ( H.Rept. 106-266 ) on July 27, 1999. The conference report agreed to a total $8.4 billion militaryconstruction appropriation, which is $776 million less than current FY1999 funding. The conferencesplit the difference between the Senate- approved $8.3 billion and House-approved $8.5 billionamounts. The House passed the conference report on July 29, 1999, by a vote of 412-8. The Senatepassed the conference report on August 3, 1999, by voice vote. The bill became law ( P.L. 106-52 )on August 17, 1999.
