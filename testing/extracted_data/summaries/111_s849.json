    "title": "A bill to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a study on black carbon emissions.",
    "content": "Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to conduct a study of black carbon emissions, which shall include: (1) phase I to establish for the scientific community standard definitions of the terms black carbon and organic carbon. (2) phase II to summarize the available scientific and technical information concerning an identification of the major sources of black carbon emissions in the United States and throughout the world, an estimate of the quantity of current and projected emissions and the net climate effects of the emissions from those sources, the most effective control strategies for additional domestic and international reductions in black carbon emissions, and the health benefits associated with additional reductions. (3) phase III to summarize the amount, type, and direction of all actual and potential financial, technical, and related assistance provided by the United States to foreign countries to reduce, mitigate, or otherwise abate black carbon emissions and any health, environmental, and economic impacts associated with those emissions and to identify opportunities to achieve significant black carbon emission reductions in foreign countries through the provision of technical assistance or other approaches. And (4) phase IV to provide recommendations regarding areas of focus for additional research for cost-effective technologies, operations, and strategies with the highest potential to reduce black carbon emissions and protect public health and regarding government actions to encourage or require additional black carbon emission reduction. Sets forth reporting deadlines for each phase. Authorizes appropriations."
