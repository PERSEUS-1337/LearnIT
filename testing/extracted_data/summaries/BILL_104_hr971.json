Directs each agency to: (1) require any person filing an application to conduct property impacting activity to provide affected homeowners with written notice, (2) provide a toll-free telephone number for homeowner response. And (3) investigate the proposed activity's impact on home values. Creates a homeowner right of action, including class action authority, for certain home value reductions."
