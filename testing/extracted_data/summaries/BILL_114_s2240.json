Requires the department concerned to develop a strategic plan for the implementation of an invasive species program that endeavors to achieve an annual 5 net reduction of invasive species populations on land managed by that department. Requires each strategic plan to be developed: (1) in coordination with eligible states, their political subdivisions, and federally recognized Indian tribes. And (2) according to the priorities established by at least one governor of an eligible state in which an ecosystem affected by an invasive species is located. Requires the USDA and Interior to prioritize the use of the least costly option necessary to perform effectively, based on sound scientific data and other commonly used cost-effective benchmarks in an area. Requires projects and activities carried out under this Act to be coordinated with affected local governments according to certain criteria regarding the development and revision of land use plans under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976."
