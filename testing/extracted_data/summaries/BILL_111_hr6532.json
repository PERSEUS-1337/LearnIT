Permits a court to issue such warrant if the United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that: (1) the property with respect to which the warrant is sought is subject to the sanction. And (2) the property may be moved outside the jurisdiction of the United States. Permits imposing a sanction prior to applying to the court for a warrant if there is reason to believe that delay may have an adverse result, including: (1) endangering the life or physical safety of an individual, (2) flight from prosecution, (3) destruction of or tampering with evidence, (4) intimidation of potential witnesses. Or (5) otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation. Directs the President to establish specified procedures with respect to the imposition of a sanction that blocks the property of a charity.
