    "content": "The Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) convenes for the 21st time (COP21) in Paris, France, from November 29 to December 11, 2015. The United States ratified the UNFCCC in 1992. Accordingly, the United States and the other 195 UNFCCC Parties already have legally binding but qualitative obligations under the treaty. COP21 intends to finalize an agreement under the UNFCCC to address climate change from 2020 on. A major focus is to lay out a path toward stabilizing greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere to avoid a 2o Celsius (3.6oF) increase in global temperature. The expected agreement would replace the Kyoto Protocol, to which the United States is not a Party. The Kyoto Protocol contains obligations for a limited set of the highest income countries to the year 2020. This report identifies critical issues regarding (1) the expected Paris Agreement and (2) a Decision that would give effect to the Agreement. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) draws on the draft negotiating texts, publicly available reports, and commentaries to suggest likely outcomes. These are not predictions. While many stakeholders are optimistic that agreement will be reached, the conclusions are far from certain. There are many issues under negotiation. The main issues include (with key terms italicized) the following: Which provisions will be legally binding, and on which Parties? Will responsibilities be differentiated among Parties with different circumstances and capacities? Will all Parties agree to modify the existing bifurcation into Annex I and developing country Parties? Is resolution possible if the Agreement does not ensure differentiated but efficacious participation of all Parties? Will a durable Agreement, intended to provide a multi-decade framework, include binding processes for all Parties to ensure progression toward the long-term UNFCCC objective? Might greater priority be given to adaptation to climate change, particularly with regard to financing and capacity-building? Will Parties find common ground on Means of Implementation (MOI), including assistance in financing, capacity building, and access to technologies? Will all Parties accept a common transparency framework with international reviews of national performance and consultations to address noncompliance? Would Parties with historically high contributions to current GHG concentrations agree to address loss and damage from climate change, or would Parties that feel most vulnerable to climate change accept an agreement without it? Will an agreement set long-term goals to avoid future temperature increases of 2o Celsius (3.6oF) or lower, or to impose deadlines to achieve decarbonization of economies? Legal form and force: A new agreement could be internationally legally binding but not add legally binding obligations for the United States. If it does not, a new agreement may constitute an executive agreement that may not require the advice and consent of the Senate under the Constitution. Some in Congress, however, suggest that an executive agreement could be an \"end run\" or violate the treaty clause of the Constitution. Financing: Financing beyond 2020 remains a crucial issue for the Paris deal. Some Parties seek to make financing pledges legally binding; scale up amounts on a timetable; restrict contributors to public funds from developed country Parties, and pay for loss and damage in developing countries. The United States and many current donor countries oppose proposals to pay for loss and damage. Worldwide Participation: Very broad participation has already been achieved by the negotiating process. While only a few Annex I Parties of the 1992 UNFCCC took on specific obligations to produce national plans to mitigate their GHG emissions, 174 Parties to the UNFCCC\u2014almost 90%\u2014voluntarily submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) prior to the Paris conference, almost all containing pledges to limit or reduce their GHG emissions."
