    "content": "Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2001 - Provides for a program of emergency extended unemployment compensation (EEUC). Sets forth EEUC program requirements for Federal-State agreements, formulae for determining amounts in individual EEUC accounts and weekly benefits, payments to States, and financing. Includes among eligibility requirements an individual's not having rights, with respect to a week, to other compensation . Reduces an individual EEUC account by the aggregate amount of any extended compensation for the same benefit year. Makes EEUC agreements applicable to weeks of unemployment: (1) beginning on or after the first day of the first week after the date on which such agreement is entered into. And (2) ending before the date that is 18 months after enactment of this Act. Amends the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to authorize appropriations to expand the National Emergency Grant program, for an 18-month period, to include grants to States to provide certain employment and training assistance and temporary health care coverage premium assistance for workers affected by major economic dislocations, such as plant closures, mass layoffs, or multiple layoffs, caused by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001."
