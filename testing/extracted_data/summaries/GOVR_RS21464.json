    "content": "The United States and Morocco reached agreement on March 2, 2004 to create a free trade agreement (FTA). The Senate approved implementing legislation ( S. 2677 ) on July 2, 2004 by a vote of 85-13 and the House approved identical legislation ( H.R. 4842 ) on July 22, 2004 by a vote of 323-99. The next day, the Senate passed House approved H.R. 4842 without amendment by unanimous consent. The legislation was signed by President Bush into law ( P.L. 108-302 ) on August 3, 2004. The agreement entered into force on January 1, 2006, a year later than planned due to the need for Morocco's Parliament to pass amendments to its intellectual property laws. The FTA is intended to strengthen bilateral ties, boost trade and investment flows, and bolster Morocco's position as a moderate Arab state. More than 95% of bilateral trade in consumer and industrial products became duty-free upon entry into force, while most other remaining barriers are to be phased out over a number of years. This report will be updated later this year."
