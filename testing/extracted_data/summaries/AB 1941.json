    "title": "An act to amend Sections 14998.2 and 14998.4 of the Government Code, relating to the California Film Commission.",
    "content": "Existing law, the Motion Picture, Television, and Commercial Industries Act of 1984, establishes the California Film Commission within the Governor\u2019s Office of Business and Economic Development. Under existing law, the Governor appoints 13 of the 26 members of the commission, with 6 of those appointments based upon specified occupational criteria. Existing law requires the commission to, among other duties, adopt guidelines for a standardized film permit and to administer the qualified motion picture tax credits. This bill would require one of the Governor\u2019s appointees to be an independent filmmaker and would also require one of the Governor\u2019s appointees to be a member who is an independent commercial producer, or an employee of a trade association representing independent commercial producers. The bill would also require the commission to create on its Internet Web site a navigational link labeled \u201cIndependent Films\u201d that contains information explaining the qualified motion picture tax credits available to independent films and highlights the required allocation of 5 of the aggregate amount of the credits to independent films."
