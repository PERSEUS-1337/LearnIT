    "content": "Enacted March 26, 2013, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6), appropriated funding for the full fiscal year through September 30, 2013. Seven regular appropriations acts, including Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, which funds EPA, are covered by the full-year continuing appropriations provided in Division F of P.L. 113-6. The final level of appropriations ultimately available to EPA and other federal departments and agencies in FY2013 includes the application of an across-the-board rescission required by P.L. 113-6 and the executive branch calculations of the automatic spending reductions triggered by sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25), as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA; P.L. 112-240). Section 1113 of P.L. 113-6 required federal departments and agencies funded in Division F of the law to report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations to identify the allocations of FY2013 enacted funding by program, project, or activity within each statutory appropriations account, including the application of rescissions and sequestration, within 30 days of enactment. In its FY2013 Operating Plan submitted to the committees on May 7, 2013, EPA reported a total enacted FY2013 post-sequestration funding level of $7.90 billion, $443.4 million (5.3%) less than the President's FY2013 request and $548.3 million (6.5%) below the FY2012 enacted level. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-2), provided another $577.3 million (post-sequestration) to EPA in FY2013 for water infrastructure, cleanup, and other recovery efforts in areas of states affected by Hurricane Sandy, for a combined agency total of $8.48 billion. Prior to the enactment of P.L. 113-6, EPA and other federal departments and agencies had operated under the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 (P.L. 112-175, H.J.Res. 117), enacted September 28, 2012, in the 112th Congress. With a few exceptions, P.L. 112-175 generally had provided FY2013 appropriations for EPA and most other federal departments and agencies apportioned at 0.612% above the FY2012 enacted levels. Although not enacted, Title II of H.R. 6091, the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013, as reported by the House Committee on Appropriations on July 10, 2012, had included $7.06 billion for EPA for FY2013. The bipartisan leadership of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies also had released a draft bill on September 25, 2012, which included different funding priorities and proposed $8.52 billion for EPA in FY2013. In addition to funding levels for EPA programs and activities, several recent and pending EPA regulatory actions received considerable interest during the consideration of the FY2013 appropriations debate similar to recent fiscal-year appropriations. Although several directive provisions to prohibit or restrict funding for certain EPA actions were included in H.R. 6091 as reported by the House Committee on Appropriations, these provisions were not included in the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee leadership draft bill, the partial-year continuing resolution for FY2013 in P.L. 112-175, or P.L. 113-6, which provided funding for the full fiscal year. This report summarizes actions on FY2013 appropriations for EPA and presents the FY2013 enacted levels after the application of the across-the-board rescission and reductions triggered by sequestration, as reported in EPA's Operating Plan. A breakout of the agency total is presented for each account and selected programs and activities within those accounts that received prominent attention in the congressional debate. A comparison of the FY2013 enacted levels to the President's FY2013 budget request and the FY2012 enacted levels is included."
