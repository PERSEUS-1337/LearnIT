    "title": "AB 772",
    "content": "Existing law requires a person or entity that sells any quantity of specified substances to record the date of sale, product description, purchaser\u2019s identification, and other specified information. Existing law requires the seller to retain this information for a period of 5 years and to present it upon demand by any law enforcement officer or authorized representative of the Attorney General. Existing law requires a person or entity that purchases any quantity of these specified substances to record the date of purchase, product description, and other specified information for a period of 3 years and to present it upon demand by any law enforcement officer or authorized representative of the Attorney General. A violation of these provisions is a crime. This bill would add butane to the list of specified substances for which these requirements apply. The bill would also prohibit any person from purchasing more than 400 milliliters of butane in a calendar month. Because the bill would create a new crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
