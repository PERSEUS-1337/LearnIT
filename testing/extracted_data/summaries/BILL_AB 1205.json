    "title": "AB 1205",
    "content": "Existing law, as part of the hazardous waste control law, requires a facility handling hazardous waste to obtain a hazardous waste facilities permit from the Department of Toxic Substances Control. Existing law requires the department to impose certain conditions on each hazardous waste facilities permit and authorizes the department to impose other conditions on a hazardous waste facilities permit, as specified. A violation of the hazardous waste control law is a crime. This bill would require the department, within 90 days of receiving a renewal application for a hazardous waste facilities permit, to hold a public meeting for specified purposes in or near the community in which the hazardous waste facility is located. Existing law prohibits the department from issuing or renewing a permit to operate a hazardous waste facility unless the owner or operator of the facility establishes and maintains financial assurances. This bill would require the department to review the financial assurances required to operate a hazardous waste facility at least once every 5 years. If the department\u2019s review finds the financial assurances for a facility to be inadequate, the bill would require the department to notify the owner or operator of the facility and would require the owner or operator to update and adopt adequate financial assurances within 90 days. Because a violation of the bill\u2019s requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. Existing law establishes various plans and programs to preserve, protect, and rehabilitate lands adjacent to rivers in the state. The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases. The state board is required to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 to be achieved by 2020. This bill would require the Natural Resources Agency to establish a grant program for projects on or adjacent to riparian corridors that, among other things, furthers the regulatory purposes of the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and to consider the extent to which a project reduces emissions of greenhouse gases and provides the greatest level of specified cobenefits. The bill would create the CalRIVER Fund in the State Treasury, with moneys in the fund to be available upon appropriation to implement the grant program. The bill would require the secretary of the agency to develop regulations, criteria, or procedural guidelines for the implementation of the grant program."
