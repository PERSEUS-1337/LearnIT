    "title": "SB 738",
    "content": "Existing law requires school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools to provide emergency epinephrine auto-injectors to school nurses and trained personnel who have volunteered, as specified, and authorizes school nurses and trained personnel to use epinephrine auto-injectors to provide emergency medical aid to persons suffering, or reasonably believed to be suffering, from an anaphylactic reaction. Existing law requires a qualified supervisor of health or administrator at a school district, county office of education, or charter school to obtain the prescription for epinephrine auto-injectors from an authorizing physician and surgeon, as defined, and authorizes the prescription to be filled by local or mail order pharmacies or epinephrine auto-injector manufacturers. This bill would prohibit an authorizing physician and surgeon from being subject to professional review, being liable in a civil action, or being subject to criminal prosecution for the issuance of a prescription or order, pursuant to these provisions, unless the physician and surgeon\u2019s issuance of the prescription or order constitutes gross negligence or willful or malicious conduct. The bill would also update an entity reference."
