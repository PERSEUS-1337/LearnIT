    "content": "Permits continuation of collection and communications activities during the period of initial notice of debt unless the consumer requests cessation of such activities. Expands the scope of debt collector's civil liability for noncompliance to include any series of class actions arising out of the same violations by the same debt collector. Adds to the mandatory factors for court consideration of debt collector's liability for noncompliance the amount of actual damages awarded. Shields a debt collector from liability for a violation resulting from good faith compliance with either Federal or State rules of civil procedure or a nonjudicial foreclosure proceeding. Prescribes guidelines under which a servicer of a federally related mortgage loan secured by a first lien is exempt from requirements pertaining to: (1) certain false or misleading representations to the consumer in connection with debt collection. Or (2) debt validation activities. Requires such servicer to provide to the consumer, at least 30 days before an acceleration of the debt, a validation statement or a notice of the consumer's right to receive a validation statement."
