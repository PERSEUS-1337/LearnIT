    "content": "This report provides information on the federal statutes, regulations, and guidelines concerning the restrictions on the acceptance of gifts and things of value by officers or employees in the executive branch of the United States government. The laws and regulations on the receipt of \"gifts\" by executive branch personnel provide, generally, that an employee may not solicit or accept a gift: (1) if the gift is from a \"prohibited source\" or (2) if the gift is given because of the employee's official position. A \"prohibited source\" under the regulations is one who seeks official action from the employee's agency; one who does business or seeks to do business with the agency; one whose activities are regulated by the employee's agency; one whose interests may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee's official duties; or an organization a majority of whose members fit any of the above categories. A gift is given \"because of\" the employee's official position if it would not have been offered \"had the employee not held the status, authority or duties associated with his Federal position.\" Gifts that are \"motivated by a family relationship or personal friendship\" may therefore be accepted without limitation. There are several exceptions to the gifts restrictions for the receipt of certain gifts, including a general de minimis exception for the receipt of gifts of under $20 in value; modest items of food and drink that are not offered as part of a meal; greeting cards and items with little intrinsic value, such as plaques or trophies; certain bona fide awards; certain expenses for some conferences and symposiums when approved by the agency; and items related to an outside business or employment activity of the employee. In addition to the regulations on \"gifts,\" there are additional criminal statutory provisions that may apply to the receipt of things of value by a federal officer or employee when that receipt is connected in some way to, or influences, an official act or the official duties of the officer or employee. These include criminal statutory prohibitions on the receipt of \"bribes\" and \"illegal gratuities,\" prohibitions on official extortion, and the \"honest services\" fraud component of the mail and wire fraud statutes. Gifts from foreign governments or foreign officials to all federal officers or employees are prohibited by a constitutional provision, unless such gifts are permitted by Congress (Article I, Section 9, clause 8). Congress has consented to the receipt of gifts in certain circumstances from official foreign sources in the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act."
