    "content": "Community Broadband Act of 2017 This bill bars state, local, or tribalnbsp. Governments from prohibiting or inhibiting such government entities or their affiliatesnbsp. From serving as public providers of telecommunications services or advanced telecommunications capabilities to any person or any public or private entity. The bill prohibits suchnbsp. Government and government-affiliated providers of public telecommunications services from favoring themselves over competing providers in the application of regulations, ordinances, public rights-of-way, or permitting requirements. The bill expresses the sense of Congress that suchnbsp. Governments or affiliates intending to provide public telecommunications services should consider public-private partnerships. Public providers must provide public notice and opportunities for public input and private-sector bidding before providing telecommunications service to the public. The bill provides an exemption from the prohibition on such governments favoring themselves in the application of regulations, and from the requirement to provide public notice and private bidding opportunities, during an emergency declared by the President, a governor, or an authorized elected local official."
