    "content": "Veterans Success on Campus Act of 2016 This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to: (1) provide educational and vocational counseling services for veterans at VA-selected institutions of higher learning, and (2) select locations where the maximum number of veterans would have access to such services. The bill revises the fee that is deducted from a veteran's education entitlement under the Post-911 educational assistance program from a monthly to a prorated fee for: (1) certain license and certification tests, and (2) national tests. The bill extends provisions requiring rounding down to the next lower dollar amount through FY2024, and rounding to the nearest whole dollar amount after FY2024, with respect to veterans educational assistance increases for: (1) the All-Volunteer Force, and (2) survivors and dependents. The Veterans' Advisory Committee on Education is extended through December 31, 2021. The VA shall, in consultation with state approving agencies, prescribe training requirements for a school certifying official (SCO) employed by a covered educational institution offering approved veterans education courses. The VA may disapprove any course of education offered by a covered educational institution that does not ensure that an SCO meets such requirements. A reporting fee paid by the VA to an educational institution or joint apprenticeship training committee after the date of enactment of the Post-911 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2011 with respect to an institution that has 75 or more enrollees may not be used for or merged with amounts available for the general fund of the educational institution or joint apprenticeship training committee. The VA Inspector General shall apply heightened scrutiny to any education program if any federal or state agency has made a final judgment or settlement that the program used deceptive or misleading practices that are potentially in violation of advertising, sales, and enrollment practices. The VA shall: (1) provide notice of, and the reasons for, such heightened scrutiny to an individual who is enrolled in an approved course and entitled to educational assistance. And (2) advise such individual to request a transcript and seek counseling about transferring any credits earned. The VA shall: (1) monitor allegations of deceptive and misleading practices made against educational programs. And (2) include information about any such allegation on the GI Bill Comparison Tool or any similar VA website. The VA shall: (1) disapprove a course of education provided by an institution of higher learning if the VA determines, pursuant to such heightened scrutiny, that the institution has engaged in deceptive or misleading practices. And (2) provide transfer counseling services to individuals enrolled in a disapproved course."
