    "content": "Sanctions Implementation Procedures Act of 1998 - Authorizes the President to delay the initial imposition of sanctions against a foreign country mandated by statute if it is determined that such delay is necessary: (1) to assist in negotiating a cessation by the country of the sanctionable activity. Or (2) for a review of the potential effectiveness of such sanction. Terminates such a delay and imposes such a sanction: (1) 45 days after the delay commenced. Or (2), if earlier, when a report submitted under this Act does not recommend that the sanction should not apply. Allows an extended delay of 15 days if such a report does recommend that the sanction should not apply. But requires imposition of the sanction after such 15-day period if the Congress has not enacted a joint resolution approving the recommendation. Directs the President to submit to the Congress a report setting forth: (1) the objectives of the country sanction delayed. (2) the extent of multilateral support, if any, for such sanction, (3) the estimated impact on the country to be sanctioned. (4) the costs and benefits to the United States of imposing the country sanction. And (5) if the President so determines, based upon such information, a recommendation that the country sanction should not apply with respect to a sanctionable activity. Declares that a country sanction with respect to which the President has made such a recommendation shall not apply with respect to the sanctionable activity if the Congress enacts a joint resolution approving such recommendation. Directs the President, two years after the initial imposition of any country sanction, and annually thereafter, to submit a similar report to the Congress. Sets forth congressional procedures for the approval of joint resolutions."
