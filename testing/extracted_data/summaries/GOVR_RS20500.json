    "content": "The HIPAA privacy rule gives patients the right of access to theirmedical information and prohibits health plans and health care providers from using or disclosing individuallyidentifiable health information without a patient's written authorization except as expressly permitted orrequired by the rule. Plans and providers are permitted to use and disclose health information for treatment,payment, and other routine health care operations and for various specified national priority activities (e.g., lawenforcement, public health, research). Providers may also share certain information with family members andothers, as long as the patient is given the opportunity to object. Health plans and providers must give enrolleesand patients a notice explaining their privacy rights and how their information will be used. They are alsorequired to have in place reasonable safeguards to protect the privacy of patient information and, in general,must limit the information used or disclosed to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish the intendedpurpose of the use or disclosure. Entities that fail to comply with the rule are subject to civil and criminalpenalties, but patients do not have the right to sue in federal court for violations of the rule. The privacy ruledoes not preempt, or override, state laws that are more protective of medical records privacy."
