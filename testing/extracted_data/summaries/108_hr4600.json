    "content": "Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2004 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit a person from using any telephone facsimile (fax) machine, computer, or other device to send, to another fax machine, an unsolicited advertisement, unless the advertisement: (1) is from a sender with an established business relationship with the recipient. And (2) contains a notice on its first page that the recipient may request not to be sent any future unsolicited advertisements, and that failure to comply with such request is unlawful. Requires such notice to include a domestic contact telephone and fax machine number for the recipient to transmit such a request, as well as a cost-free mechanism for sending the request. Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide that a request not to send unsolicited advertisements complies with FCC requirements if: (1) the request identifies the recipient fax number to which the request relates. (2) the request is made to the telephone or fax number of the sender. And (3) the person making the request has not subsequently provided express invitation or permission to the sender to have such advertisements sent. Authorizes the FCC to allow tax-exempt, nonprofit professional or trade associations to send unsolicited advertisements to their members in furtherance of professional or association purposes. Authorizes the FCC, upon determining a significant number of complaints involving unsolicited fax advertisements, to limit the duration of the existence of an established business relationship exemption to a period not shorter than five and not longer than seven years after the last occurrence of an action sufficient to establish such relationship. Requires the: (1) FCC to report annually to Congress on the enforcement of the above requirements. And (2) Comptroller General to study, and report to specified congressional committees on, complaints received by the FCC concerning unsolicited advertisements sent to fax machines."
