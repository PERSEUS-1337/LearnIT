    "content": "Momentary fluctuations in attention (perceptual accuracy) correlate with neural activity fluctuations in primate visual areas. Yet, the link between such momentary neural fluctuations and attention state remains to be shown in the human brain. We investigate this link using a real-time cognitive brain machine interface (cBMI) based on steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs): occipital EEG potentials evoked by rhythmically flashing stimuli. Tracking momentary fluctuations in SSVEP power, in real-time, we presented stimuli time-locked to when this power reached (predetermined) high or low thresholds. We observed a significant increase in discrimination accuracy (d') when stimuli were triggered during high (versus low) SSVEP power epochs, at the location cued for attention. Our results indicate a direct link between attention\u2019s effects on perceptual accuracy and and neural gain in EEG-SSVEP power, in the human brain.\n"
