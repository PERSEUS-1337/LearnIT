    "title": "An act to amend Section 25503.6 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to alcoholic beverages.",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes the holder of a winegrower\u2019s license, a beer manufacturer, a distilled spirits manufacturer, or a distilled spirits manufacturer\u2019s agent, to purchase advertising space and time from, or on behalf of, an on-sale retail licensee, under certain conditions, if the on-sale retail licensee is the owner, manager, agent of the owner, assignee of the owner\u2019s advertising rights, or major tenant of specified facilities. This bill would expand the exceptions to existing law to allow beer manufacturers, winegrowers, distilled spirits rectifiers, distilled spirits manufacturers, or distilled spirits manufacturer\u2019s agents to purchase advertising space and time from, or on behalf of, on-sale retail licensees at a fairgrounds with a horse racetrack and equestrian and sports facilities located in the County of San Diego. By creating new crimes this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of San Diego. This bill would incorporate changes to Section 25503.6 of the Business and Professions Code proposed by both this bill and SB 462, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, and this bill is chaptered last. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
