    "content": "Health Care Price Transparency Promotion Act of 2006 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require state Medicaid plans to provide that the state will establish and maintain laws to require disclosure of information on hospital charges, to make such information available to the public, and to provide individuals with information about estimated out-of-pocket costs for health care services. Directs the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to research and report to Congress on: (1) the types of information on the charges and out-of-pocket costs for health care services that individuals find useful in making decisions about where, when, and from whom to receive care. (2) how such types of information vary by whether they have health benefits coverage, and what kinds. And (3) ways in which such information may be available on a timely basis and in easy-to-understand form to individuals facing such decisions."
