    "content": "Marine Mammal Capture, Export, and Public Display Protection Act of 1993 - Amends the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) to require, instead of the penalty applicable under the AWA for a violation regarding a marine mammal, that a person be liable for a civil or criminal penalty under specified provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA). Mandates review and, if appropriate, modifications to AWA standards regarding the care and habitat of marine mammals in captivity. Amends the MMPA to direct the Secretaries of Commerce and Agriculture to jointly establish a system for tracking marine mammals taken in waters under US jurisdiction or imported. Makes it unlawful to take any marine mammal before establishment of the system. Makes it unlawful to export a marine mammal without a permit under this Act. Requires regulations under the MMPA for exporting as well as for taking and importing marine mammals. Authorizes issuance of export permits under the same requirements as taking and importing permits. Allows issuance of an export permit only: (1) to maintain or improve the health and well-being of the mammal. And (2) if the permit prohibits use of the mammal for any other purpose. Modifies scientific research permit requirements regarding issuance, takings involving surgical procedures, lethal takings, release requirements, permanent marking of released mammals, and permit effective periods."
