    "title": "A bill to provide anti-retaliation protections for antitrust whistleblowers.",
    "content": "Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act - Prohibits discharging or in any other manner discriminating against a whistleblower in terms and conditions of employment because: (1) the whistleblower provided information to the employer or the federal government concerning a violation of antitrust law or another criminal law committed in conjunction with a potential violation of antitrust law. Or (2) the whistleblower participated in, or otherwise assisted, an investigation relating to such a violation. Allows a whistleblower who alleges discharge or other discrimination to seek relief: (1) by filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor. Or (2) if the Secretary has not issued a final decision within 180 days of filing such complaint, to bring an action at law or equity. Entitles a whistleblower who prevails in any such action to all relief necessary to make such whistleblower whole."
