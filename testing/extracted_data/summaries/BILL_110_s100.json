    "content": "Healthy Students Act of 2007 - Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to require the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to establish a Commission to Improve School Meals composed of nutrition and children's health experts tasked with developing new nutritional standards for the School Lunch, Summer Food Service, Child and Adult Care Food, and School Breakfast programs. Requires such standards to ban foods of minimal nutritional value. Provides for the adjustment of program payment rates to compensate for compliance with such standards. Repeals the current requirement that the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) issue guidance to states and school food authorities to increase the consumption of foods and food ingredients recommended in the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Requires the Secretary to establish a pilot program providing grants to school districts or nonprofit organizations for use in promoting healthy food alternatives under the School Lunch and School Breakfast programs. Directs the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to elementary and secondary schools for Healthy Hour pilot programs which increase each school day by an hour that is exclusively devoted to physical activity. Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish a student loan forgiveness program for nurses who agree to employment as full-time nurses in elementary or secondary schools for three complete school years. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow corporations a tax deduction for the charitable contribution to a private foundation of exercise or gymnasium equipment for use by elementary and secondary school students."
