    "title": "AB 1419",
    "content": "Existing law prohibits the management of hazardous waste, except in accordance with the hazardous waste laws. Existing law requires the Department of Toxic Substances Control to regulate the management and disposal of hazardous waste. Under existing regulations, the department classifies a waste as hazardous waste if the waste exceeds certain total threshold limitation concentrations, which are established by the department for various substances, including barium. A violation of the hazardous waste laws is a crime. This bill, except as specified, would provide that used, broken cathode ray tube (CRT) panel glass and processed CRT panel glass that exceeds the total threshold limit concentration only for barium is not a waste and is not subject to regulation by the department if that panel glass meets certain requirements. The bill would provide that used, broken CRT panel glass and processed CRT panel glass that is recycled is not subject to the department\u2019s regulations on the export of materials. The bill would prohibit the use of that CRT panel glass except in specified end uses. Because a violation of this requirement would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
