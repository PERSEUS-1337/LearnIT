    "content": "Service Members Student Loan Relief Act - Amends title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to allow members of the Armed Forces and National Guard to defer payments of principal on their Federal Family Education Loans, William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans, and Federal Perkins Loans for the period beginning on the date they receive a call or order to duty in connection with a war, military operation, or national emergency and ending on their first day of service. Allows individuals whose call to duty is cancelled before their first day of service: (1) due to a service training injury, to defer payments of principal on those loans through what would have been their period of service. And (2) for a reason other than a service training injury, to defer payments of principal on those loans for 14 days after that cancellation."
