    "content": "Initial and continuing determinations of eligibility for the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs are made by state Disability Determination Services (DDS). These DDS agencies are fully funded by the federal government. However, because DDS employees work for the states, rather than the federal government, they are subject to furloughs, hiring freezes, and other personnel actions taken by state governments. As of October 15, 2009, 10 states had either furloughed or plan to furlough DDS employees, and 6 states have either implemented or plan to implement hiring freezes that would affect DDS agencies. Eleven states had implemented or planned to implement other personnel actions, such as limitations on overtime or reductions in pay, that would apply to DDS agencies and employees. These furloughs, hiring freezes, and other personnel actions will reduce the capacity of the DDS to process initial SSDI and SSI applications as well as continuing disability reviews (CDRs). This reduced capacity may result in delays in moving people who qualify for SSDI or SSI onto the benefit rolls, which may also result in a greater reliance by these people on benefits funded or administered by the states."
