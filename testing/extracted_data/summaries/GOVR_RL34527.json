    "content": "During the 109th Congress, the President submitted to the Senate 283 nominations to executive department full-time positions. Of these 283 nominations, 233 were confirmed; nine were withdrawn; and 41 were returned to him in accordance with Senate rules. For those nominations that were confirmed, an average of 75 days elapsed between nomination and confirmation. The median number of days elapsed was 57. These statistics do not include the days during which the Senate was adjourned for its summer recesses and between sessions of Congress. President George W. Bush made a total of 13 recess appointments to the departments during this period. All 13 were made during recesses within the first or second session of the 109th Congress (intrasession recess appointments). None were made during the recess between the first and second sessions of the Congress (intersession recess appointments). Information for this report was compiled from data from the Senate nominations database of the Legislative Information System http://www.congress.gov/nomis/, the Congressional Record (daily edition), the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents, telephone discussions with agency officials, agency websites, the United States Code, and the \"Plum Book\" (United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions). This report will not be updated."
