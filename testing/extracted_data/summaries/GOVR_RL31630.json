    "content": "There has been interest in the amount of money spent, as well as the amount of federal funds available to provide emergency medical care to unauthorized (illegal) aliens in the United States. It is extremely difficult to ascertain the amount of money spent for emergency medical care for unauthorized aliens since most hospitals do not ask patients their immigration status. Additionally, prior to the passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-173) on December 8, 2003 there were no federal funds available for the specific purpose of reimbursing hospitals or states for emergency medical care provided to unauthorized aliens (undocumented immigrants). Although the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) barred unauthorized aliens from receiving most Medicaid benefits, they are eligible for emergency Medicaid services. Unauthorized aliens are also eligible for emergency medical services provided by the states. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-173) signed into law on December 8, 2003 includes a provision, \u00a71011, to provide reimbursement to states for emergency care afforded to unauthorized aliens. For each fiscal year FY2005-FY2008 the provision appropriates $250 million to states to be distributed based on estimates of the number of undocumented aliens residing in the state and on the number of apprehensions for the six states with the highest number of apprehensions. This program is similar to one created in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA97) which had expired. In addition, the Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) authorized reimbursement of public hospitals and certain nonprofit hospitals for emergency medical assistance to unauthorized aliens, and reimbursement of state and local governments for emergency ambulance services provided aliens injured while crossing U.S. borders while in custody. Neither program has been funded. However, in FY1998 Congress appropriated money for a pilot program in Nogales, Arizona to attempt to reimburse state and local governments for ambulance services. INS concluded from the pilot program that reimbursement for ambulance services was not a feasible program. H.R. 1515 would provide reimbursement for the costs of emergency medical care and ambulance services furnished to aliens paroled for medical reasons. The provisions in PRWORA which limited immigrant access to public benefits were the result of the desire that immigrants be self-sufficient and not rely on public resources to meet their needs. Additionally, proponents did not want the availability of public benefits to constitute an incentive for immigrants to migrate to the United States. Nonetheless, many contend that since the federal government is wholly responsible for establishing immigration policy, and for policing the borders to keep out unauthorized aliens the burden to pay for immigration related costs should be born by the federal government not the states. This report will be updated as needed."
