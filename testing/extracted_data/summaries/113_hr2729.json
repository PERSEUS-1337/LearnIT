Requires the Secretary of HHS to: (1) compare information in the National Directory with information provided by USDA about such individuals. And (2) disclose to USDA, in turn, National Directory information about them. Authorizes USDA to use the information resulting from a data match to: (1) verify the employment and income of such individuals. And (2) analyze such information after the removal of personal identifiers. Sets forth rules for the types of disclosures permitted and conditions on disclosure.
