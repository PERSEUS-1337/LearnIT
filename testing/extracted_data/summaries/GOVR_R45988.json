    "content": "In the beginning of the 21 st century, natural gas prices were increasing and the United States was viewed as a growing natural gas importer. Multiple liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals were built while existing ones were recommissioned and expanded. However, the market conditions also drove domestic producers to innovate. As average U.S. prices peaked in 2008, domestic shale gas production was brought to market. Improvements in technologies such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling made the development of unconventional natural gas resources such as shale and other lower-permeability rock formations economically possible. Improved efficiency has lowered production costs, making shale gas production competitive at almost any price. The large amount of natural gas brought to market enabled large-scale exports from the United States. Of today's total global trade in natural gas, some 35% takes the form of LNG. As U.S. natural gas production increased and prices fell, U.S. consumption of natural gas grew. The rise in consumption did not keep pace with production, so companies turned to greater exports of natural gas, first by pipeline to Mexico and then as LNG to other parts of the world. The United States started exporting LNG from the lower-48 states in February 2016. The entrance of the United States as an exporter of LNG has caused significant changes to LNG markets. The U.S. natural gas market is one of the few that does not link the price of natural gas to oil, and this has carried in to LNG contracts. Some buyers view U.S. LNG exports as a hedge against oil prices. U.S. exporters do not require destination clauses, although where U.S. LNG exports end up must be reported to the U.S. Department of Energy. The relatively low price of U.S. natural gas has also helped consumers in other regions negotiate better prices for imports from non-U.S. sources. The United States is poised to rise in the export rankings and may have the most LNG export capacity, worldwide, within the next five years. According to projections by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. natural gas production, consumption, and exports will continue to grow for decades to come, while U.S. prices are projected to stay relatively low. One aspect of EIA projections is a status quo assumption when it comes to technology, laws and regulations, and markets among other things. As the advent of shale gas has shown, changes to the industry happen and may happen in significant ways and quickly. Natural gas has been and continues to be a topic of interest for Congress. One hundred bills have been introduced in the 116 th Congress related to different aspects of natural gas. Natural gas may play a bigger or smaller role in the U.S. economy depending, in part, upon congressional actions. Nevertheless, natural gas is an integral part of the U.S. and global energy mix. Knowing the major natural gas producing and exporting nations and how natural gas is transported for export are essential to understanding the sector and how U.S. natural gas fits into the global market."
