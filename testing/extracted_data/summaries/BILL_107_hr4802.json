    "content": "State and Tribal Mining Reclamation Fairness Act of 2002 - Amends the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to increase the incentives for States and Indian tribes to achieve coal mining reclamation priorities by requiring the Secretary of the Interior to pay to the States or tribes, without further Act of appropriation, their allocated but unappropriated reclamation fee balance. Makes the mandated reclamation fee 12 of the amount that would otherwise apply and such entities, respectively, ineligible for any subsequent allocation. Allows a State or Indian tribe to use such payment to make grants to achieve any of the priorities in the Act's purview that remain unmet in the State or on the lands under the tribe's jurisdiction."
