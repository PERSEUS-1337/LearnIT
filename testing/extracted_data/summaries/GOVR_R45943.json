    "content": "Title IX, the energy title, of the 2018 farm bill (Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018; P.L. 115-334 ) contains authority for the energy programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). USDA energy programs incentivize research, development, and adoption of renewable energy projects, including solar, wind, and anaerobic digesters. However, the primary focus of USDA energy programs has been to promote U.S. biofuels production and use\u00e2\u0080\u0094including corn starch-based ethanol (the predominant biofuel produced and consumed in the United States), cellulosic biofuels, and soybean-based biodiesel. The USDA energy programs via the farm bill are separate from the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and tax incentives contained in separate energy and tax legislation. Four farm bills have contained an energy title: 2002, 2008, 2014, and 2018. For all four farm bills, the majority of the energy programs expire and lack baseline funding. Many of the energy title programs are authorized to receive both mandatory and discretionary funding. Historically, mandatory funding has been the primary support for these programs, as appropriators have not provided funding for most of the discretionary authorizations. The programs that have received discretionary authorizations under the 2018 farm bill are the Rural Energy for America Program, the Rural Energy Savings Program, and the Sun Grant Program. The 2018 farm bill extended most of the energy provisions of the 2014 farm bill with new funding authority. There are two exceptions, as the 2018 farm bill repealed both the Repowering Assistance Program and the Rural Energy Self-Sufficiency Initiative. Additionally, the 2018 farm bill established one new program\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Carbon Utilization and Biogas Education Program. The 2018 farm bill contains initiatives that address noncorn feedstocks (e.g., cellulosic feedstocks). The most important programs to this end are the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, which pays producers for production of eligible advanced biofuels; the Biorefinery, Renewable Chemical, and Biobased Product Manufacturing Assistance Program (formerly the Biorefinery Assistance Program), which assists in the development of new and emerging technologies for advanced biofuels; and the Renewable Energy for America Program (REAP), which has funded a variety of biofuels-related projects. Over the five-year reauthorization period (FY2019-FY2023), the 2018 farm bill contains a total of $375 million in new mandatory funding and authorizes discretionary funding (i.e., subject to annual appropriations) of $1.7 billion for the various farm bill energy programs. This discretionary total includes discretionary authorizations for the Sun Grant Program and the Rural Energy Savings Program. The mandatory funding provided for the energy programs under the 2018 farm bill is approximately 46% less than what was provided in the 2014 farm bill, which had authorized $694 million in mandatory funding over the five-year period of FY2014-FY2018. Conversely, the 2018 farm bill provides discretionary authorizations that are approximately 13% more than what was provided in the 2014 farm bill ($1.5 billion) for the energy programs (although, as noted above, farm bill energy programs generally have not received discretionary appropriations). At issue for Congress is oversight of the energy programs and the future of annual funding for these programs. This report provides an overview and funding summary of the various energy titles contained in the farm bills from 2002 to the present, and provides a description of the 2018 farm bill energy programs including their funding levels, program implementation status, and any changes made to the programs by the 2018 farm bill."
