    "title": "AB 2143",
    "content": "Existing law requires the county recorder in each county to complete a yearly statistical report on a specified form of documents recorded and filed. This bill would require the report to also include information regarding electronically submitted documents, and would require documents to be counted and reported in the same manner without regard to method of transmission. The Electronic Recording Delivery Act of 2004 authorizes a county recorder, upon approval by resolution of the board of supervisors and system certification by the Attorney General, to establish an electronic recording delivery system for the delivery for recording of specified digitized electronic records, subject to specified conditions. The act authorizes a county recorder to enter into a contract with specified entities for the delivery for recording, and return to the party requesting recording, a digitized electronic record that is an instrument affecting a right, title, or interest in real property. This bill, until January 1, 2027, would authorize a county recorder to also enter into a contract with an authorized submitter for the delivery for recording, and return to the party requesting recording, of a digital or digitized electronic record that is an instrument to be recorded consistent with a specified provision. The bill, until January 1, 2027, would require an authorized submitter, as specified, and any agent submitting documents on behalf of an authorized submitter, to provide proof of financial responsibility in the form of general liability coverage, as provided. Existing law requires the Attorney General, in consultation with interested parties, to adopt regulations for the review, approval, and oversight of electronic recording delivery systems. Existing law authorizes the regulations to include specified requirements and procedures. This bill, until January 1, 2027, would additionally authorize the regulations to include requirements for general liability coverage as described above."
