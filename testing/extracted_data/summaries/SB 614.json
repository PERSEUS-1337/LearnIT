    "title": "An act to amend Section 987.8 of the Penal Code, relating to criminal procedure.",
    "content": "Existing law requires a court to assign counsel to defend a defendant if the defendant desires the assistance of counsel and cannot afford to pay for counsel. Upon conclusion of the proceedings against the defendant, or withdrawal of counsel, existing law authorizes the court to make a determination of the ability of a defendant to pay all or a portion of his or her defense. Existing law authorizes the court to order a defendant to reimburse the county for those costs. Existing law provides a presumption that a defendant sentenced to state prison is determined not to have a reasonably discernible future financial ability to reimburse the costs of his or her defense, except as specified. This bill would extend that presumption to a defendant sentenced to county jail for a period longer than 364 days."
