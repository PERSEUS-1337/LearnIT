    "content": "The Davis-Bacon Act is one of several statutes that deals with federal governmentprocurement. (See also the Walsh-Healey Act of 1936 and the McNamara-O'Hara Service ContractAct of 1965.) Enacted in 1931, Davis-Bacon requires, inter alia , that not less than the locallyprevailing wage be paid to workers engaged in federal contract construction. The act does not dealdirectly with non-federal construction. In addition to the act per se , the prevailing wage principlehas been incorporated within a series of federal program statutes through the years. And, manystates have enacted \"little Davis-Bacon\" acts of their own. The act of 1931, as amended, provides that the President \"may suspend the provisions of thissubchapter during a national emergency.\" With slight variation, that provision has been a part of thestatute since it was enacted. The act has been suspended explicitly on four separate occasions: (a) In 1934, PresidentFranklin Roosevelt suspended the act in what appears to have been for administrative convenienceassociated with New Deal legislation. It was restored to full strength in less than 30 days with fewpeople, seemingly, aware of the suspension. (b) In 1971, President Richard Nixon suspended theact as part of a campaign intended to quell inflationary pressures that affected the constructionindustry. In just over four weeks, the act was reinstated, the President moving on to differentapproaches to the problem. (c) In 1992, in the wake of Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki, PresidentGeorge H. W. Bush suspended the act in order to render reconstruction and clean-up in Florida andthe Gulf Coast and in Hawaii more efficient. The impact of the suspension is unclear for the act wassuspended on October 14, 1992, just days prior to the 1992 election. President William Clintonrestored the act on March 6, 1993. And, (d) on September 8, 2005, President George W. Bushsuspended the act in order to render more efficient reconstruction and clean-up of Florida and theGulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The act was reinstated on November 8, 2005. In the suspensions of 1934 and 1971, the suspension applied to the entire country -- possiblywith the understanding that it would be restored once the immediate emergency was over. In 1992and in 2005, only portions of the country were involved. In 1992, it remains unclear how long thesuspension might have lasted -- if George H. W. Bush had been re-elected. Similarly, the suspensionunder George W. Bush was intended to be open-ended -- i.e., \"until otherwise provided.\" But in fact,it lasted for about two months. The suspensions are also separated by the definition of \"nationalemergency\" used to invoke them: administrative convenience in 1934, inflationary pressures in theconstruction industry in 1971, and issues associated with hurricane damages in 1992 and in 2005. This report reviews the several cases during which the Davis-Bacon Act was suspended andwill likely be updated as developments make necessary."
