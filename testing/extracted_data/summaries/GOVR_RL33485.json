    "content": "On January 28, 2003, during his State of the Union Address, President George Bush proposed that the United States spend $15 billion over five years to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The President proposed that most of the spending on PEPFAR programs be concentrated in 15 countries. Of the $15 billion, the President suggested spending $9 billion on prevention, treatment, and care services in the 15 Focus Countries, where the Administration estimated 50% of all HIV-positive people lived. The President also proposed that $5 billion of the funds be spent on existing bilateral HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs and research, and $1 billion of PEFPAR funds be reserved for U.S. contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund). Between FY2004 and FY2008, PEPFAR aims to have supported care for 10 million people affected by HIV/AIDS, including children orphaned by AIDS; prevented 7 million new HIV infections; and supported efforts to provide anti-retroviral medication (ARV) to 2 million HIV-infected people. From FY2004 through FY2008 Congress provided almost $20 billion to fighting the global spread of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, some $5 billion more than the President proposed. The President's FY2008 budget request included about $5.8 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts. The Administration proposed that the bulk of the funds, about $5.0 billion, be provided through Foreign Operations appropriations and that about $800 million be provided through Labor/HHS appropriations, of which $300 million would be reserved for a U.S. contribution to the Global Fund. Congress exceeded the President's request by some $560 million, providing $6.3 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts, including some $840 million for a U.S. contribution to the Global Fund. This report reviews U.S. appropriations for treatment and prevention of the three diseases from FY2004 through FY2008. The report will not be updated; PEPFAR authorization expires in FY2008. Subsequent reports will analyze additional funding should the initiative be reauthorized."
