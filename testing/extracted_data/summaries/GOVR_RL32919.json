    "content": "The annual Foreign Operations appropriations bill in the House, and the State, Foreign Operations measure in the Senate are the primary legislative vehicles through which Congress reviews the U.S. international affairs budgets and influences executive branch foreign policy making generally. They contain the largest shares\u2014the House bill, about two-thirds; the Senate bill, about 97%\u2014of total U.S. international affairs spending. Funding for Foreign Operations and State Department/Broadcasting programs have been rising for five consecutive years, while amounts approved in FY2004 reached an unprecedented level compared with the past 40 years. Emergency supplementals enacted since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to assist the front line states in the war on terrorism, Afghanistan and Iraq reconstruction, and for State Department operations and security upgrades have pushed spending upward. The President sought $22.8 billion for Foreign Operations and $9.8 billion for State Department and Related Agencies appropriations. These amounts were 15.7% and 12.2%, respectively, higher than FY2005 amounts enacted in \"regular,\" non-supplemental appropriations. The combined State/Foreign Operations request of $32.67 billion was 14.6% larger than regular FY2005 funding. Including the $4.55 billion FY2005 supplemental (H.R. 1268; enacted on May 11), the FY2006 combined request was slightly smaller (-1.1%) than the total appropriation of $33.05 billion for FY2005. A major challenge for Congress in considering the President's Foreign Operations and State Department spending proposals has been the tightening budget environment. The FY2006 Budget Resolution (H.Con.Res. 95) set international affairs spending 7% below the President's request. The House Appropriations Committee's spending allocation among all spending bills provided $20.27 billion for Foreign Operations, 11.2% less than the proposal. The Senate Committee allocation of $31.67 billion for the combined State Department/Foreign Operations measure was $1 billion, or 3% below the request. Other key issues for congressional review were foreign aid in support of the war on terror, the Millennium Challenge Account, HIV/AIDS funding, allocations among \"core\" development programs, public diplomacy, educational exchange programs, rising demands for U.N. peacekeeping contributions, and democracy promotion activities. On November 14, President Bush signed a $20.94 billion Foreign Operations appropriation for FY2006 (P.L. 109-102; H.R. 3057). The bill is nearly $1.9 billion, or 8% below the Administration's request. The total falls closer to the House-passed $20.27 billion level than to the Senate's $22.16 amount. State Department funds included in the Senate version of H.R. 3057 became part of the conference on H.R. 2862, the Science, State, Justice, and Commerce spending bill. This report will be updated to reflect congressional action on the legislation."
