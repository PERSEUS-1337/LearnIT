    "content": "In the 108th Congress, the House and Senate passed competing versions of the Patient Safetyand Quality Improvement Act ( H.R. 663 , S. 720 ), but the differencesbetween the two measures were never resolved. On March 9, 2005, the Senate Committee onHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions unanimously approved S. 544 , which isidentical to S. 720 . The legislation would establish legal protections for data andreports on medical errors in an effort to encourage voluntary reporting of such information. Thepatient safety bills are in response to the 1999 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report To Err Is Human ,which concluded that preventable medical errors cause as many as 98,000 deaths a year. The IOMfound that medical errors are primarily the result of faulty systems, processes, and conditions thatlead people to make mistakes. It recommended establishing a national mandatory reporting systemto hold hospitals accountable for serious medical errors, as well as developing voluntary, confidentialsystems for reporting errors that result in little or no harm. Analysis of such voluntarily reported datacould be used to identify vulnerabilities in health care systems. Twenty-two states mandate medical error reporting by hospitals. However, providers arereluctant to report adverse events in part because they fear that the information will be used inmalpractice litigation. States have sought to allay those concerns by passing laws to protect reporteddata from legal discovery and by de-identifying data and receiving reports anonymously. Suchmeasures risk limiting the usefulness of the data for research and quality management. There are several national voluntary reporting systems for medical errors, including thePatient Safety Information System within the Department of Veterans Affairs. Analysis of these andother voluntary reporting systems -- notably the Aviation Safety Reporting System -- has identifiedseveral design features associated with effective programs. For example, the reporting processshould be user-friendly and the information kept confidential and protected from legal discovery. Also, reports should be promptly evaluated by experts who are trained to recognize underlyingsystems causes, and reporters should receive timely feedback with recommendations forsystems-based improvements. To encourage voluntary reporting, H.R. 663 would have protected reportedinformation from legal discovery in civil and administrative proceeding, and from a Freedom ofInformation Act request. The bill required the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)to certify patient safety organizations to collect and analyze the information reported by providers. Such organizations would develop and disseminate recommendations for systems-based solutionsto improve patient safety and health care quality. H.R. 663 also would have requiredAHRQ to establish a national database to receive and analyze de-identified information submittedby patient safety organizations. S. 544 would protect information from use in criminalas well as civil and administrative proceedings, unless a judge determined that it contained evidenceof an intentional act to directly harm the patient. This report will be updated as legislative eventsin the 109th Congress warrant."
