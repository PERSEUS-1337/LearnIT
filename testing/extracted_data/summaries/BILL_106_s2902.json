    "content": "Requires such carrier to make advanced service available: (1) to 80 percent of its customers in a State within three years after enactment of this Act, where such services can be provided using an industry-approved standard and existing loop facilities. And (2) within five years of such date, upon request of any customer. Allows carriers that meet such time limits to continue to receive the regulatory relief provided under this Act, while discontinuing such relief for failure to do so. Prohibits advanced service offered by such carriers from being subject to common carrier regulation by the FCC or a State in any exchange where advanced service is being provided by an unaffiliated advanced service provider. Allows for a petition to the FCC for such regulatory relief. Prohibits Federal or State regulation in any geographic area in which the carrier was not the local incumbent exchange carrier on February 8, 1996. States that, for services not found to be subject to unaffiliated competition, the carrier furnishing advanced service must file with the FCC a schedule of charges and practices. Discontinues the regulatory relief provided under this Act for a carrier for which a State makes a final determination of failure to comply with FCC or State rules concerning collocation or loop provisioning . Requires carriers using equipment located in a remote terminal to provide to any requesting telecommunications carrier access to subloop elements at such terminal for the provision of advanced services and rights-of- way for such purposes. Mandates that no carrier shall be required to: (1) make any payment for the transport, delivery, or termination of telecommunications to the Internet or any Internet service provider. Or (2) provide network elements on an unbundled basis unless those elements are to be used predominately to provide telephone exchange service."
