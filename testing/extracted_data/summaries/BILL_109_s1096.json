Prohibits such designated river segments from being administered as part of the National Park System. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage those segments in accordance with the Musconetcong River Management Plan , which establishes goals and actions to ensure long-term protection of the outstanding values of the river segments and compatible management of land and water resources associated with such segments. Considers the management plan as satisfying the requirements for a comprehensive management plan for those river segments. Directs the Secretary, in determining whether a proposed water resources project would have a direct and adverse effect on the values for which a river segment is designated as part of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System, to consider the extent to which the project is consistent with the management plan. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance, staff support, and funding to assist in the implementation of the management plan. Requires the Secretary to manage the river segments in cooperation with appropriate Federal, State, regional, and local agencies. Requires any cooperative agreement entered into under the Act relating to a river segment to be consistent with the management plan.
