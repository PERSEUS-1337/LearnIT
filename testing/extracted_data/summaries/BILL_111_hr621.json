    "content": "Girl Scouts USA Centennial Commemorative Coin Act - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue up to 350,000 $1 coins in commemoration of the centennial of the founding of the Girl Scouts of the USA. Requires the coin design to be emblematic of the centennial of the Girl Scouts of the United States of America. Restricts issuance of such coins to calendar year 2013. Subjects coin sales to a surcharge of $10 per coin. Requires payment of such surcharges to the Girl Scouts of the United States of America for Girl Scout program development and delivery. Provides for examination by the Comptroller General of books, records, documents, and other data of the Girl Scouts as may be related to the expenditures of the amounts paid. Prohibits any surcharge if the coin's issuance would cause the number of commemorative coin programs issued during the year to exceed the annual two commemorative coin program issuance limitation. Permits continuation of the issuance of numismatic items that contain one-cent coins minted in 2009 until June 30, 2010. Amends the Jamestown 400th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act of 2004 to remove reference to the Secretary of the Interior as being a one of the recipients of the distribution of the surcharges received from the sale of coins issued in commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the Jamestown settlement in Virginia and specifies the distribution among the remaining two recipients."
