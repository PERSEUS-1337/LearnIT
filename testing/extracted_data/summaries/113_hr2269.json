(2) assisting local law enforcement and local schools with costs associated with collecting information on, evaluating, updating, and digitizing such plan data and making plans electronically available to local dispatch centers and first responders through mobile data terminals and mobile data computers. And (3) enabling law enforcement to consult with schools to develop emergency plans, including such plan data, to ensure that plans are comprehensive, complete, and current. Requires the Director of the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services to give preferential consideration to an application for a grant for such an activity from a jurisdiction that demonstrates that: (1) the activity will cover a significant number of schools, (2) such jurisdiction uses an electronic record management system that is compatible across multiple jurisdictions, or (3) there is community interest with respect to such activity. Reauthorizes such Program for FY2014-FY2017."
