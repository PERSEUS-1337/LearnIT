    "title": "AB 2068",
    "content": "Existing law regulates the licensing and operation of talent services within the entertainment industry. Existing law prohibits specific activities or omissions by a talent service or its owners, directors, officers, agents, and employees, including the failure to remove information about, or photographs of, an artist displayed on the talent service\u2019s Internet Web site or an Internet Web site that the service has the authority to design or alter, within 10 days of delivery of a request made by telephone, mail, facsimile transmission, or email from the artist or from a parent or guardian of the artist if the artist is a minor. If the talent service offers to display information about, or a photograph of, an artist on the service\u2019s Internet Web site, existing law requires a contract between an artist and a talent service to contain a notice that the talent service will remove the content within 10 days of a request by the artist or the artist\u2019s parent or guardian, if a minor. A willful violation of those prohibitions is a crime. This bill would prohibit these specific activities or omissions of a talent service, its owners, directors, officers, agents, and employees through any means of communication. The bill would extend the prohibition of the failure to remove an artist\u2019s information or photographs to those displayed on an online service, online application, or mobile application of the talent service or one that the talent service has the authority to design or alter and would require the talent service to also act on requests to remove information or photographs made by text message or other electronic communication. The bill would expand the above-described notice requirement to contracts in which the talent service offers to display information about, or a photograph of, an artist on the service\u2019s online service, online application, or mobile application. Because a violation of these provisions would be a crime under certain circumstances, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
