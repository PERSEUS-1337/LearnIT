Authorizes appropriations to the Attorney General for grants to States to establish or improve their criminal record databases to qualify as a fully participating member. Title II: Liability for Early Release of Violent Felons - Grants the victim of a violent crime a Federal cause of action in any district court against a State if the individual committing the crime previously had been convicted by the State of a violent offense, was released from incarceration prior to serving his or her full sentence, and committed the violent crime before the original sentence would have expired. Immunizes a State from such liability if the State requires a violent criminal to be incarcerated for the entire term of imprisonment to which the criminal is sentenced. Makes a State liable to the victim in an action brought under this title for the actual damages resulting from the violent crime, but not for punitive damages."
