    "content": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is the primary federal agency involved in federal construction to help reduce community flood risk. Congressional direction on USACE flood risk reduction activities has evolved from primarily supporting levees, dams, and engineered dunes and beaches. Since 1974, Congress has required that USACE evaluate nonstructural alternatives, such as elevation of structures and acquisition of floodplain lands, during its planning of projects. Since the mid-2010s, Congress also has directed the consideration of natural and nature-based features (NNBFs). Examples of potential NNBFs for reducing flood risk include wetlands; oyster, mussel, and coral reefs; and the combination of these natural features with hard components, such as rock and concrete. Various factors are shaping how USACE is incorporating NNBFs into its flood risk reduction projects and post-flood repair activities. NNBFs in Flood Risk Reduction Projects Congress specifically included NNBFs as a planning requirement for USACE flood risk reduction projects in 2016. In 2018, Congress required that USACE feasibility reports for flood risk reduction projects consider using traditional and natural infrastructure, alone or in conjunction with each other. In recent feasibility reports, USACE primarily has proposed using NNBFs (other than engineered dunes and beaches) in combination with traditional structural measures rather than having the NNBFs as the primary means for reducing flood risk. To be recommended for congressional construction authorization, a USACE flood risk reduction project generally must have national flood risk reduction benefits that exceed the project's costs. Under current Administration guidance, USACE's evaluation of NNBFs is tailored to each project (i.e., it is case-by-case rather than standardized). NNBFs in Program to Repair Damaged Nonfederal Flood Control Works In 1996, Congress amended USACE's program to repair damage to certain nonfederal flood control works. Congress allowed for the program to fund nonstructural alternatives in lieu of USACE making repairs if a nonfederal entity requests and assumes responsibility for the nonstructural alternative. In 2016, Congress defined the program's nonstructural alternatives to include restoring and protecting natural resources (e.g., floodplains, wetlands, and coasts), if those alternatives reduce flood risk. In practice, the program continues to predominantly repair the damaged flood control works. That is, there remain a limited number of nonfederal entities pursuing nonstructural alternatives under this program. Identifying Challenges and Opportunities for NNBFs as Flood Risk Reduction Measures Quantifying the effectiveness and reliability of NNBFs as flood risk reduction measures in different environmental conditions and for different floods and storms is an area of ongoing research. In some circumstances, NNBFs may provide flood risk reduction and a suite of environmental and social benefits. In other applications, NNBFs may be unable to replicate the level of flood risk reduction provided by traditional structural and nonstructural measures. Congress may consider the following issues for NNBFs in USACE flood risk reduction activities: knowledge gaps in measuring the benefits and limitations of NNBFs and the research to fill these gaps; how USACE processes account for NNBFs' benefits, costs, and performance; and effects of agency practice, Administration guidance, and statutory authority on the consideration and adoption of NNBFs for flood risk reduction. Congress has requested two reports related to NNBFs from USACE. These reports, when available, may inform congressional deliberations on whether\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, if so, how\u00e2\u0080\u0094to support the use of NNBFs as part of USACE flood risk reduction efforts."
