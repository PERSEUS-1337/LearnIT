    "title": "An act to amend Sections 1203.067 and 3008 of, and to add Section 645.5 to, the Penal Code, relating to sex offenders.",
    "content": "Existing law, as amended by Proposition 83 of the November 7, 2006, statewide general election, requires every inmate who has been convicted of an offense that requires him or her to register as a sex offender or any attempt to commit any of those offenses and who is committed to prison and released on parole to be monitored by a global positioning system for life. Existing law requires the terms of probation or parole for all persons placed on formal probation or parole for an offense that requires registration as a sex offender to include, among other things, participation in, or completion of, a sex offender management program, as specified. This bill would make it a felony for a person to willfully remove or disable an electronic, global positioning system, or other monitoring device, if the device was affixed as a condition of parole, postrelease community supervision, or probation as a result of a conviction of certain specified sex offenses, if the person intended to evade supervision and either does not surrender, or is not apprehended, within one week of the issuance of a warrant for absconding, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for 16 months, or 2 or 3 years. The bill would require the terms of probation or parole of a person who has committed a violation of these provisions to include participation and completion of a sex offender management program. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
