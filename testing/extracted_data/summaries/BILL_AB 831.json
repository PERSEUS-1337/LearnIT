    "title": "AB 831",
    "content": "Existing law, the Ortiz-Pacheco-Poochigian-Vasconcellos Cal Grant Program, establishes the Cal Grant A and B Entitlement awards, the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement awards, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B awards, the Cal Grant C awards, and the Cal Grant T awards under the administration of the Student Aid Commission, and establishes eligibility requirements for awards under these programs for participating students attending qualifying institutions. Existing law specifies the amounts of the maximum Cal Grant A and B awards for students attending private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions and private for-profit postsecondary educational institutions that are regionally accredited, as specified. This bill would change, in accordance with a prescribed formula, the maximum Cal Grant awards for students attending private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions, commencing with the 2015\u201316 award year. The bill would impose requirements on private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions to provide specified data to a specified association as a condition for the funding of Cal Grant maximum awards to their students, and would require the association to report on that information to the Legislature, the Governor, the Department of Finance, and the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office. The bill would also make conforming changes. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."
