    "content": "Protecting Girls' Access to Education in Vulnerable Settings Act or the Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act This bill expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) it is critical to ensure that children, particularly girls, displaced by conflicts overseas are able to access educational services because such access can combat extremism and reduce exploitation and poverty. And (2) the educational needs of vulnerable women and girls should be considered in US foreign assistance policies and programs. The Department of State and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) may advance programs that: provide safe, primary and secondary education for displaced children. Build the capacity of institutions in countries hosting displaced people to prevent displaced children from facing educational discrimination. And help increase the access of displaced children, especially girls, to educational, economic, and entrepreneurial opportunities. The State Department and USAID may: coordinate with multilateral organizations to work with foreign governments to collect relevant data, disaggregated by age and gender, on the ability of displaced people to access education and participate in economic activity. And work with domestic and foreign private sector and civil society organizations to promote safe, primary and secondary education for displaced children. The State Department and USAID shall include in any congressional report relating to a foreign assistance program for natural or man-made disaster relief: (1) a breakdown of program beneficiaries by location, age, gender, marital status, and school enrollment status, (2) a description of how such program benefits displaced people. And (3) a description of any primary or secondary educational services supported by such program that specifically address the needs of displaced girls."
