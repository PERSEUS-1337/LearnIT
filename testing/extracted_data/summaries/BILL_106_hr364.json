Requires State and local entities that administer such programs to inform individuals of the availability of such services.

Or (3) while serving on active duty, participated in a US military operation for which an armed forces service medal was awarded. Requires veterans qualifying under this Act to be given appropriate recruitment appointments within the Federal Government. Directs the Secretary of Labor to provide specified veterans' employment rights and benefits assistance to veterans qualifying under this Act. Provides for the filing, investigation, and determination of claims, by qualifying individuals, that an entity has failed to comply with hiring requirements of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to allocate an additional ten full-time equivalent positions from the Employment and Training Administration of the Department of Labor to the Veterans' Employment and Training Service to carry out work training and employment services for qualifying individuals."
