Existing law establishes a 3-percent participation goal for disabled veteran business enterprises in state procurement. This bill would allow entities meeting specified requirements to apply to the Department of Veterans Affairs to become certified California veteran service providers. The bill would require the department to maintain a list of certified California veteran service providers on its Internet Web site, including the type of supportive services provided by the providers. The bill would require that certification would remain valid for 3 years unless the entity is decertified by the department. The bill would require the department, no later than July 1, 2017, to adopt rules, procedures, and regulations as necessary to certify an entity, and to decertify an entity if it no longer meets the requirements to be a certified California veteran service provider. The bill would require the department to adopt a fee to defray the department\u2019s reasonable cost of certification not to exceed $750."
