    "content": "This report is part of a suite of reports that discuss appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2017. It specifically discusses appropriations for the components of DHS included in the first title of the homeland security appropriations bill\u2014the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management, the Office of the Under Secretary for Management, the DHS headquarters consolidation project, the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the Office of the Chief Information Officer, Analysis and Operations, and the Office of Inspector General for the department. Collectively, Congress has labeled these components in recent years as \"Departmental Management and Operations,\" although this year, the House Appropriations Committee chose to rename the title \"Departmental Management, Operations, Intelligence, and Oversight\"\u2014a name change that was carried forward in the FY2017 act. The report provides an overview of the Administration's FY2017 request for these components, the appropriations proposed by the appropriations committees in response, and those enacted in Division F of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31). The report includes information on provisions throughout the bills and reports that directly affect these components. Departmental Management and Operations is the smallest of the four titles that carry the bulk of funding in the bill. The Obama Administration requested almost $1.5 billion for these components in FY2017, $37 million less than was provided for FY2016. The amount requested for these components is 3% of the Administration's $47.7 billion request in net discretionary budget authority and disaster relief funding for DHS. Senate Appropriations Committee-reported S. 3001 would have provided the components included in this title more than $1.4 billion in net discretionary budget authority in FY2017. This would have been $24 million (1.7%) less than requested, and $62 million (4.2%) less than was provided in FY2016. House Appropriations Committee-reported H.R. 5634 would have provided the components included in this title more than $1.3 billion in net discretionary budget authority in FY2017. This would have been $126 million (8.6%) less than requested, and $163 million (10.8%) less than was provided in FY2016. On September 29, 2016, President Obama signed into law P.L. 114-223, which contained a continuing resolution that funds the government at the same rate of operations as FY2016, minus 0.496% through December 9, 2016. This was the first of a series of continuing resolutions that funded DHS until its annual appropriations were finalized. On March 16, 2017, the Trump Administration submitted an amendment to the FY2017 budget request, which included a request for $3 billion in additional funding for DHS. Congress chose to address this request in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (signed into law as P.L. 115-31 on May 5, 2017). Division F of the act included both annual and supplemental appropriations for DHS. The act provided the components included in this title $1.25 billion in net discretionary budget authority. This was $209 million (14.3%) less than requested by the Obama Administration, and $246 million (16.5%) less than was provided in FY2016. For information on the broader subject of FY2017 funding for DHS, details on the continuing resolutions, links to analytical overviews, and details regarding components in other titles, see CRS Report R44621, Department of Homeland Security Appropriations: FY2017. This report will be updated if further supplemental appropriations are provided for DHS for FY2017."
