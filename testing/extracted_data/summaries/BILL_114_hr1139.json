    "content": "Detergent Poisoning And Child Safety Act of 2015 or the Detergent PACS Act of 2015 Requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to establish safety standards for liquid detergent packets to protect children who are younger than five years of age from injury or illness. Directs the CPSC to establish such standards by promulgating a rule or adopting voluntary ASTM International standards. Provides for any final rule that is promulgated to include: (1) requirements for special packaging and warning labels, (2) standards to make the color and design of packets less attractive to children, and (3) liquid composition standards to make the consequences of exposure less severe. Requires the rule or standards to be treated as consumer product safety standards under the Consumer Product Safety Act."
