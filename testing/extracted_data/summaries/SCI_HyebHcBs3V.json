    "content": "The recent work of Super Characters method using two-dimensional word embedding achieved state-of-the-art results in text classification tasks, showcasing the promise of this new approach. This paper borrows the idea of Super Characters method and two-dimensional embedding, and proposes a method of generating conversational response for open domain dialogues. The experimental results on a public dataset shows that the proposed SuperChat method generates high quality responses. An interactive demo is ready to show at the workshop. And code will be available at github soon. Dialogue systems are important to enable machine to communicate with human through natural language. Given an input sentence, the dialogue system outputs the response sentence in a natural way which reads like humantalking. Previous work adopts an encoder-decoder architecture BID9 , and also the improved architectures with attention scheme added BID0 BID10 BID11 . In architectures with attention, the input sentence are encoded into vectors first, and then the encoded vectors are weighted by the attention score to get the context vector. The concatenation of the context vector and the previous output vector of the decoder, is fed into the decoder to predict the next words iteratively. Generally, the encoded vectors, the context vector, and the decoder output vector are all one-dimensional embedding, i.e. an array of real-valued numbers. The models used in decoder and encoder usually adopt RNN networks, such as bidirectional GRU BID0 Preliminary work. Under review by the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). Do not distribute. BID3 , LSTM BID6 , and bidirectional LSTM BID11 . However, the time complexity of the encoding part is very expensive.The recent work of Super Characters method has obtained state-of-the-art result for text classification on benchmark datasets in different languages, including English, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. The Super Characters method is a two-step method. In the first step, the characters of the input text are drawn onto a blank image. Each character is represented by the two-dimensional embedding, i.e. an matrix of real-valued numbers. And the resulting image is called a Super Characters image. In the second step, Super Characters images are fed into a twodimensional CNN models for classification. Examples of two-dimensional CNN models are used in Computer Vison (CV) tasks, such as VGG BID7 , ResNet BID4 , SE-net BID5 and etc. in ImageNet BID1 .In this paper, we propose the SuperChat method for dialogue generation using the two-dimensional embedding. It has no encoding phase, but only has the decoding phase. The decoder is fine-tuned from the pretrained two-dimensional CNN models in the ImageNet competition. For each iteration of the decoding, the image of text through two-dimensional embedding of both the input sentence and the partial response sentence is directly fed into the decoder, without any compression into a concatenated vector as done in the previous work. In this paper, we propose the SuperChat method for dialogue response generation. It has no encoding, but only decodes the two-dimensional embedding of the input sentence and partial response sentence to predict the next response word iteratively. The pretrained two-dimensional CNN model is fine-tuned with the generated SuperChat images. The experimental results shows high quality response. An interactive demonstration is to show at the workshop TAB0 Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2019 TAB0 . Sample response sentences generated by the SuperChat method on the Simsimi data set."
