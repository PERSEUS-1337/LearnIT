    "title": "A bill to promote the adoption of children with special needs.",
    "content": "Adoption Equality Act of 2003 - Amends title IV part E of the Social Security Act (SSA) to modify the requirements of a child with special needs whose adoptive parents are eligible to receive a State adoption assistance payment. Eliminates the requirement that the child with special needs meet specified income eligibility criteria under SSA title IV part A (TANF) relating solely to the biological parents whose rights have been terminated. Makes eligible to receive adoption assistance payments the adoptive parents of a child who is not a US citizen or resident, but who otherwise meets the eligibility requirements for such payments, with the exception of a child adopted outside the United States or brought into it for adoption purposes. Declares that payments shall not be construed as prohibited with respect to the latter kind of child if he or she is placed in foster care following the failure of the initial adoption of the child by the adoptive parents. Requires treatment as meeting such requirements of any children determined eligible with respect to a prior adoption , and who are available for adoption again because the prior adoption has been dissolved and the parental rights of the adoptive parents have been terminated, or because the child's adoptive parents have died. Requires a State to spend an amount equal to the amount of savings in State expenditures resulting from the application of this Act to provide to children or families any service that may be provided under this part or part B . Revises requirements for the determination under SSA of a child with special needs to require that: (1) the State determine, pursuant to criteria established by it , that the child cannot or should not be returned to the home of hisher parents. Or (2) the child meets all medical or disability requirements of title XVI (SSI), and specific factors or conditions apply."
