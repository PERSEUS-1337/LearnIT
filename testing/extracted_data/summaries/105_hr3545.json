    "content": "Neighborhood Integrity and Responsibility Act - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to require public housing agencies (PHAs) administering the section 8 housing certificate program to: (1) ensure that program rents are reasonable in comparison with private rentals. And (2) disapprove leases that are not reasonable. Requires PHAs to disapprove leases that are not reasonable under the section 8 rental voucher program. Makes PHA administrative fee eligibility dependent upon compliance with such provisions. Prohibits a PHA from providing section 8 tenant-based assistance for more than five units owned by any single owner. Revises tenant rent and monthly assistance provisions under the certificate and voucher programs."
