    "title": "An act to add Section 2750.8 to the Labor Code, and to add Article 8.6 (commencing with Section 1160) to Chapter 4 of Part 1 of Division 1 of the Unemployment Insurance Code, relating to employment.",
    "content": "Existing law governs the relationship between an employer and an employee with regard to hiring, promotion, discipline, wages and hours, working conditions, and administrative and judicial remedies. Existing law sets forth guidelines for determining whether a person who performs work for another pursuant to a contract is an employee or an independent contractor. Existing law authorizes the Labor Commissioner to investigate employee complaints and to conduct a hearing in any action to recover wages, penalties, and other demands for compensation. This bill would establish the Motor Carrier Employer Amnesty Program pursuant to which, notwithstanding any law, a motor carrier performing drayage services may be relieved of liability for statutory or civil penalties associated with misclassification of commercial drivers as independent contractors if the motor carrier enters into a settlement agreement with the Labor Commissioner, with the cooperation and consent of the Employment Development Department, prior to January 1, 2017, whereby the motor carrier agrees to convert all of its commercial drivers to employees, and the settlement agreement contains prescribed components, including, but not limited to, an agreement by the motor carrier to pay all wages, benefits, and taxes owed, if any. The bill would permit a settlement agreement to contain a provision authorizing the Labor Commissioner and the Employment Development Department to recover from the motor carrier the reasonable, actual costs of the Labor Commissioner and the Employment Development Department for their respective review, approval, and compliance monitoring of that settlement agreement."
