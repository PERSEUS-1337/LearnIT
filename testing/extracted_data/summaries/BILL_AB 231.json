    "title": "AB 231",
    "content": "Existing law generally requires that an inmate released on parole or postrelease community supervision be returned to the county of last legal residence. Existing law provides, however, that an inmate who is released on parole for an offense involving stalking shall not be returned to a location within 35 miles of the victim\u2019s actual residence or place of employment if specified criteria are satisfied. This bill would make that provision applicable to an inmate released on postrelease community supervision. The bill would also authorize a supervising county agency to transfer an inmate who is released on postrelease community supervision to another county, upon approval of the receiving county, when the inmate cannot be placed in his or her county of last legal residence in compliance with this provision. The bill would make other clarifying changes. By imposing additional duties on supervising county agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
