In this paper, we show that fine-tuning BERT on legal documents similarly provides valuable improvements on NLP tasks in the legal domain. Demonstrating this outcome is significant for analyzing commercial agreements, because obtaining large legal corpora is challenging due to their confidential nature. As such, we show that having access to large legal corpora is a competitive advantage for commercial applications, and academic research on analyzing contracts. Businesses rely on contracts to capture critical obligations with other parties, such as: scope of work, amounts owed, and cancellation policies. Various efforts have gone into automatically extracting and classifying these terms. These efforts have usually been modeled as: classification, entity and relation extraction tasks. In this paper we focus on classification, but in our application we have found that our findings apply equally and sometimes, more profoundly, on other tasks. Recently, numerous studies have shown the value of fine-tuning language models such as ELMo [3] and BERT [4] to achieve state-of-the-art results [5] on domain specific tasks [6, 7] . In this paper we investigate and quantify the impact of utilizing a large domain-specific corpus of legal agreements to improve the accuracy of classification models by fine-tuning BERT. Specifically, we assess: (i) the performance of a simple model that only uses the pre-trained BERT language model, (ii) the impact of further fine tuning BERT, and (iii) how this impact changes as we train on larger corpora. Ultimately, our investigations show marginal, but valuable, improvements that increase as we grow the size of the legal corpus used to fine-tine BERT -and allow us to confidently claim that not only is this approach valuable for increasing accuracy, but commercial enterprises seeking to create these models will have an edge if they can amass a corpus of legal documents."
