    "title": "A bill to amend the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act to ensure uniform treatment by States of Federal overseas absentee ballots, to amend titles 10 and 18, United States Code, and the Revised Statutes to remove the uncertainty regarding the authority of the Department of Defense to permit buildings located on military installations and reserve component facilities to be used as polling places in Federal, State, and elections for public office, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "Amends the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act with regard to the treatment of absentee ballots of uniformed and overseas voters to ensure the acceptance and counting of any valid absentee ballot from an overseas voter with respect to any election for Federal office, regardless of whether such ballot contains a postmark, if the ballot was: (1) mailed or otherwise delivered to the appropriate State election official on or before the election date to which the ballot refers. And (2) received by the appropriate State official not more than ten days after the date of the election to which the ballot refers. Amends the Federal criminal code to provide sanctions against anyone who knowingly gives false information for the purpose of establishing the date an absentee ballot of an overseas voter is mailed or delivered. Amends Federal armed forces law to authorize the use of buildings on military installations and reserve component facilities as polling places in any Federal, State, or local election for public office. Permits the States to make certain facilities available for such use as well. States that if a military installation or reserve component facility was made available as the site of a polling place with respect to an election for Federal office held during 2000, the same or comparable site shall be made available for use as a polling place with respect to any general election for Federal office to be held in November 2002."
