    "content": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed into law by President Obama on February 17, 2009 (P.L. 111-5). The primary purposes of the ARRA focus on promoting economic recovery, assisting those most affected by the recession, improving economic efficiency by \"spurring technological advances in science and health,\" investing in infrastructure, and stabilizing state and local government budgets. The ARRA provides funds to several existing education programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education (ED), including programs authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and the Higher Education Act (HEA). It also provides general state fiscal stabilization grants to support education at the elementary, secondary, and postsecondary levels, as well as \"public safety and other government services.\" Funds made available through the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund may be used for modernization, renovation, or repair of public school or higher education facilities. Under the House and Senate versions of H.R. 1, funds also would have been provided to several existing education programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education (ED), including programs authorized by the ESEA, IDEA, and HEA. The House bill, but not the Senate bill, would have created new programs to support school modernization, renovation, and repair at the elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education levels. Both the House bill and the Senate bill would have provided general funds for education to support state fiscal stabilization. This report provides a brief overview of the key provisions related to education programs that are or will be administered by ED that were included in the ARRA under Division A, Title VIII, Department of Education, and under Title XIV, State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. It also includes a discussion of relevant provisions that were included in the House and Senate bills. Education-related tax provisions, as well as Vocational Rehabilitation programs administered by ED, are beyond the scope of this report. The report will be updated as warranted by legislative or administrative action."
