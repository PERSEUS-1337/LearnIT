Or (2) any third party that is reimbursed by the seller or any such party. Makes eligible for mortgage insurance, in spite of a seller-financed downpayment, any mortagors with credit scores equivalent to a FICO score of: (1) 680 or more, (2) at least 620 but less than 680. Or (3) 619 or less. Prescribes conditions for mortgage insurance in the latter two situations."
