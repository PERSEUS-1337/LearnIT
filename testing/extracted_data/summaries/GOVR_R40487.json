Natural gas continues to be a major fuel supply for the United States, supplying about 24% of total energy in 2008. The year began with a relatively tight demand/supply balance, and this generated upward spot price movement. For the 2007-2008 heating season, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a price increase of more than 30% (beginning to end of season). The key \"benchmark\" price for the United States, the Henry Hub spot price, generally rose through the first half of 2008 to a peak of $13.32 per million British thermal units (Btu) on July 3, 2008. By the end of 2008, the Henry Hub spot price had decreased 56% to $5.83 per million Btu, lower than the $7.83 per million Btu price on January 2, 2008. Closer to consumers, the EIA average citygate price increased 47% from January to $12.08 per million Btu in July and then decreased to $7.94 per million Btu as of December, a 2% drop from the start of 2008. Residential consumers saw a 68% increase through July and then a decline that had December 5% above January's average price. The supply outlook for the lower-48 states began a potentially important change in 2008. Onshore production in Texas and the Rocky Mountain region increased by 15%, especially because of the production of unconventional natural gas (e.g., deep shale gas). Noteworthy events in 2008: The national natural gas market experienced an unusual price pattern in the first half of the year, with EIA reporting average citygate (delivery area) prices lower than Henry Hub (supply area) spot prices. The normal pattern is the prices in delivery areas, which include transportation costs, are higher than supply area prices. Lower-48 onshore natural gas production increased 10% to reach more than 20.5 trillion cubic feet, a level not achieved since 1974. This production, along with other factors such as the weakened economy, appears to have prevented the 350 Bcf of lost gas production due to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in the Gulf of Mexico from increasing prices. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports decreased 54% from the record level in 2007. Average use was less than 10% of reported capacity at operational LNG import facilities. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved another 2 Bcf per day of new import facilities in 2008. Gas for power use decreased 2.4% from 2007 and electric power remained the largest end use category for natural gas consumption for a second year. Going forward, current economic turbulence may contribute to natural gas market challenges, in terms of investment or attempts at market mischief. Vigilance in market oversight could grow in importance."
