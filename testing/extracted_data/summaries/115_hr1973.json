    "content": "Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act of 2017 This bill amends the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 to extend the duty to report suspected child abuse to adults who are authorized to interact with minor or amateur athletes at an amateur sports organization facility or at an event sanctioned by a national governing body (NGB) or member of an NGB. An NGB is an amateur sports organization that is recognized by the International Olympic Committee. An authorized adult who fails to report suspected child abuse is subject to criminal penalties. The bill amends the federal criminal code to revise civil remedy provisions for a victim of a human trafficking offense or federal sex offense. Among other things, it changes the civil statute of limitations to 10 years from the date the victim reasonably discovers the violation or injury . The bill also extends the statute of limitations for a minor victim of a federal sex offense to file a civil action to 10 years from the date such individual reaches age 18. Finally, the bill amends the Amateur Sports Act of 1978: to expand the authorities and duties of NGBs to prevent, report, and respond to the abuse of minor or amateur athletes. To limit the civil and criminal liability of the US Olympic Committee, an NGB, or an amateur sport organization in certain circumstances. To prohibit construing certain provisions to limit the ability of an NGB to prevent interactions between an alleged abuser and an amateur athlete. And to require the US Olympic Committee to review an NGB's certification."
