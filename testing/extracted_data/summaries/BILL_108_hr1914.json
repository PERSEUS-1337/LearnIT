Directs that: (1) half of the surcharges be used to support programs to promote the understanding of the legacies of Jamestown. And (2) half be used to sustain the ongoing mission of preserving Jamestown, to enhance national and international educational programs relating to Jamestown, to improve infrastructure and archaeological research activities relating to Jamestown, and conduct other programs to support the commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the settlement of Jamestown .
