    "content": "Fair Campus Act of 2015 This bill amends title I of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to establish requirements with respect to sexual violence allegations at institutions of higher education (IHEs). An IHE that receives HEA funds, except a foreign institution, must provide support services to affected students and annual training to relevant personnel. This bill prohibits an IHE from imposing sanctions on a person, including a student organization , with respect to alleged sexual violence, except pursuant to a formal hearing in accordance with institutional disciplinary proceedings. It specifies due process requirements for such proceedings, permits an IHE to select the applicable standard of proof, and directs an IHE to publish applicable procedures in its student handbook. An IHE may initiate an institutional disciplinary proceeding to impose certain interim sanctions . It also prohibits an IHE from requiring a sorority or fraternity to: (1) admit members who do not meet membership requirements, or (2) waive its coverage exemption under title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 as a disciplinary or punitive measure."
