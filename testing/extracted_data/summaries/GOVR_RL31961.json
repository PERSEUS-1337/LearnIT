    "content": "Since the collapse of Enron Corp. in late 2001, there has been a series of scandals involvingmajor U.S. corporations. This report lists civil suits filed by federal regulatory agencies chargingindividuals and corporations with violations related to these scandals. The list is limited tocorporations and their officers or employees that fit within the Enron pattern. That is, these are casesthat allege one or more of the following: irregular accounting and auditing, management self-dealing,conflicts of interest between firms and financial advisors (or Wall Street firms and their customers),and manipulation or abusive trading in energy markets. Small \"garden variety\" examples ofsecurities or accounting fraud are excluded. A number of these cases have also resulted in criminal indictments, some followed by guiltypleas. These post-Enron criminal charges are listed in CRS Report RL31866 , Criminal Charges inCorporate Scandals , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]. The civil cases listed here include only those filed by federal regulatory agencies --principally the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but also a few actions by theCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission(FERC). Private lawsuits, such as shareholder derivative actions, are not included, although manyof the companies listed are targets of multiple private suits brought by investors, employees, andothers. It should be noted that the most common form of resolution of civil cases like these is theconsent agreement, whereby the defendant neither admits nor denies any wrongdoing. Despite theformal nonadmission of guilt, the consent agreement often imposes fines and other sanctions. Theseare described in the list. This report will be updated as events warrant."
