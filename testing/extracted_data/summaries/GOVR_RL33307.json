In FY2006,spending on them is anticipated to be $18.4 billion, supported by new appropriations of alesser amount ($17.9 billion). The Administration's FY2007 budget request envisionsspending a total of $19.1 billion, with new appropriations of $18.8 billion. For FY2007, theHouse and Senate appropriations bills ( H.R. 5384 ) call for spending $19.2billion, supported by new appropriations of $18.6 billion in the House and $18.9 billion inthe Senate. Child Nutrition Programs. The School Lunch and School Breakfast programs provide cash subsidies for all meals they serve to schools choosing to participate; largersubsidies are granted for free and reduced-price meals offered to lower-income children. The Child and Adult Care Food program subsidizes meals/snacks served by child care centersand day care homes; federal subsidy rules differ significantly between those provided tocenters and those for day care homes. Schools and organizations operating programs forchildren also can receive subsidies for snacks (and, in some cases, meals) served in after-school and other outside-of-school settings . The Summer Food Service program subsidizes food service operations by public/private nonprofit sponsors volunteering tooperate projects during the summer; all meals/snacks they serve are free. The Special Milkprogram operates in schools and other venues without a lunch program and subsidizes allmilk served. All these subsidies are inflation-indexed and are paid only where themeals/snacks meet federal nutrition and other standards. In addition to cash aid, manyproviders receive food commodities from the Agriculture Department, at a set value per meal(and may receive \"bonus\" commodities from Department surplus stocks). Grants also aremade to help cover state administrative expenses . Other significant federalprograms/activities include a free fresh fruit and vegetable program in selected schools,money for a Food Service Management Institute, a small nutrition education initiative,activities to improve program integrity, meal quality, food service and safety, and support forlocal school \"wellness policies.\" Separately, the WIC program provides nutrition services(e.g., nutrition education, breastfeeding support) and tailored food packages to lower-incomepregnant and postpartum women, infants, and children who are judged to be at nutritionalrisk. And a WIC farmers' market program offers vouchers to WIC recipients for the purchaseof fresh fruit and vegetables at farmers' markets. These are administered by the Agriculture Department's Food and Nutrition Serviceand state education, health, social service, and agriculture agencies. They actually areoperated, under state oversight, by over 300,000 local providers (such as schools, child carecenters, health clinics). Federal payments do not necessarily cover all program costs, andnonfederal support is significant (e.g., children's families' school meal payments, state/localcontributions). This report will be updated as warranted."
