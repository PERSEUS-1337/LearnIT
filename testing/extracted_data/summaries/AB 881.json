Existing law further defines \u201celectronic act\u201d as both the creation and transmission originated on or off the schoolsite, by means of an electronic device, including, but not limited to, a telephone, wireless telephone, or other wireless communication device, computer, or pager, of a communication, as specified. This bill would instead, for purposes of pupil suspension or recommendation for expulsion from a school, define \u201celectronic act\u201d as either the creation or transmission of that communication, as specified."
