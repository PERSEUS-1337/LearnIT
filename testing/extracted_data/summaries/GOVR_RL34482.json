The Administration requested a net appropriation of $38,849 million in budget authority for FY2009. The House Appropriations Committee reported its version of the FY2009 DHS Appropriations bill on June 24, 2008. The bill was filed on September 18, 2008, as H.R. 6947, and the accompanying report has been numbered H.Rept. 110-862. House-reported H.R. 6947 would have provided a net appropriation of $41,137 million in budget authority for DHS for FY2009. This amounted to an increase of $2,288 million, or nearly 6% increase over the President's request. The Senate-reported its version of the bill on June 19, 2008. S. 3181 would have provided $41,314 million in net budget authority for DHS for FY2009, a $2,465 million or 6% increase over the President's request. On September 23, 2008, the House Rules Committee reported H.Res. 1488 for consideration of the Senate amendment to H.R. 2638, the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009. H.R. 2638 was originally introduced as the FY2008 DHS Appropriations Act but was amended to serve as the legislative vehicle for the proposed Continuing Resolution, a Disaster Relief Emergency Supplemental, the Department of Defense FY2009 Appropriations Act, the FY2009 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, and the FY2009 Military Construction and Veterans Assistance Act (see the CRS Appropriations Status table for more information: http://www.crs.gov/Pages/fy2009-status-table.aspx). H.R. 2638 was enacted as P.L. 110-329 on September 30, 2008. Division D of P.L. 110-329 provided a net appropriation of $41,225 million for DHS for FY2009. This amounted to nearly $2,376 million more than the President's request for FY2009, $88 million more than was reported by the House in H.R. 6947, and $89 million less than was reported by the Senate in S. 3181. Net appropriations for major agencies within DHS were as follows: Customs and Border Protection (CBP), $9,821 million; Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), 4,989 million; Transportation Security Administration (TSA), $4,367 million; Coast Guard, $9,361 million; Secret Service, $1,413 million; National Protection & Programs Directorate, $1,158 million; Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), $6,963 million; Science and Technology, $933 million; and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, $514 million. Additionally, Division B of the Act also contained the following amounts for DHS agencies in emergency supplemental FY2008 funding: $300 for the Coast Guard, $7.96 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Account, and $100 million for FEMA to reimburse the American Red Cross. P.L. 111-5, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, provided $2,765 million in emergency supplemental funding for DHS in FY2009. Funding was broken out as follows: $205 million for Departmental Operations; $680 million for CBP; $20 million for ICE; $1,000 million for TSA; $250 million for the Coast Guard; and $610 million for FEMA.
