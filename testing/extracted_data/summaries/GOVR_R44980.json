    "content": "The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) administers renewable energy and end-use energy efficiency technology programs in research, development, and implementation. EERE works with industry, academia, national laboratories, and others to support research and development (R&D). EERE also works with state and local governments to assist in technology implementation and deployment. EERE supports nearly a dozen offices and programs including vehicle technologies, solar energy, advanced manufacturing, and weatherization and intergovernmental programs, among others. Funding for EERE is provided in the annual Energy and Water Development (E&W) Appropriations bill. At issue for the 115th Congress is the level of EERE appropriations and which activities EERE should support, including whether to continue support for specific initiatives and programs. On May 23, 2017, the Trump Administration submitted the budget proposal for FY2018. The FY2018 budget request for DOE is $28.2 billion of which about 2% is for EERE. The budget request for EERE is $636.1 million, a decrease of $1.5 billion, or nearly 70%, from the FY2017 enacted level of approximately $2.1 billion. The proposed reduction, if enacted, would affect all offices within EERE. For FY2018, the bulk of the EERE request is allocated to three areas: 25% for energy efficiency programs, 21% for renewable energy programs, and about 29% for sustainable transportation programs. The request estimates that two-thirds of the current portfolio of 2,500 multi-year projects (e.g., early-stage R&D projects) would remain active in FY2018. DOE anticipates that eliminating one-third of these projects would result in a reduction of approximately 30% in EERE-funded full-time equivalent staff. The President's request would include two specific program eliminations: the Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program, which received FY2017 appropriations of $225.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively. The President's request for EERE emphasizes early-stage R&D, limited validation testing and simulation to inform R&D, and analysis to support regulatory activities. The DOE budget justification states that funding for EERE would focus on \"early-stage R&D, where the Federal role is critically important, and reflects an increased reliance on the private sector to fund later-stage research, development, and commercialization of energy technologies.\" There are several bills before Congress that recommend FY2018 appropriations for EERE. The bills contain EERE funding levels that are below the FY2017 enacted level, but higher than the President's budget request. The House passed H.R. 3219, the Defense, Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, Legislative Branch, and Energy and Water Development National Security Appropriations Act, 2018, on July 27, 2017. Division D of H.R. 3219\u2014which contains the E&W appropriations\u2014provides funding of $1.1 billion for EERE, $1.0 billion below the FY2017 enacted level and $449 million above the request. Floor amendments to H.R. 3219 reduced funding for EERE in H.R. 3219 by $18.4 million from H.R. 3266, the House Appropriations Committee version of the FY2018 E&W appropriations bill. H.R. 3266 would provide funding of $1.1 billion to EERE\u2014$986 million below the FY2017 enacted level and $468 million above the request (H.Rept. 115-230). The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 1609, the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2018, on July 20, 2017. S. 1609 would appropriate $1.9 billion to EERE\u2014$153 million below the FY2017 enacted level and $1.3 billion above the request (S.Rept. 115-132). The President signed P.L. 115-56, the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 and Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017 on September 8, 2017, providing FY2018 funding at the FY2017 appropriations level through December 8, 2017."
