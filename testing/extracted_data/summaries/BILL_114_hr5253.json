    "content": "Strong Visa Integrity Secures America Act This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Department of State to assign, in a risk-based manner, State Department employees to at least 50 visa-issuing diplomatic and consular posts based upon the following criteria: the number of nationals of a country in which such posts are located who were identified in US terrorist databases, such a country's counterterrorism cooperation with the United States, the adequacy of border and immigration control of such country, terrorist organization activity in such country, and the number of negative security advisory opinions regarding nationals of such country. Such employees shall, in addition to other duties, screen admissions applications against federal criminal, national security, and terrorism databases. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall: establish within US Immigration and Customs Enforcement a visa security advisory opinion unit to respond to State Department requests for visa security reviews. And provide, in a risk-based manner, for remote pre-adjudicated visa security assistance at at least 50 posts that are not assigned such employees. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) shall, within one year after enactment of this bill: screen electronic passports at US entry airports by reading each passport's embedded chip, and utilize facial recognition or other biometric technology to screen travelers at such airports. Electronic passport screening shall apply to US citizens, nationals of a visa waiver program country, and nationals of any other foreign country that issues electronic passports. Facial recognition or other biometric technology screening shall apply to nationals of a visa waiver program country. The CBP shall, in a risk-based manner, continuously screen individuals issued any visa and individuals who are visa waiver program nationals against criminal, national security, and terrorism databases. The annual visa overstay report is revised. DHS shall: (1) ensure that certain foreign student information is available at each US port of entry to CBP officers who conduct primary inspections of aliens seeking US admission. (2) review the social media accounts of visa applicants who are citizens of, or who reside in, high-risk countries, and (3) review open source information of visa applicants."
