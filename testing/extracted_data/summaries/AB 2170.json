    "title": "An act to amend Sections 2192 and 2192.2 of the Streets and Highways Code, relating to transportation.",
    "content": "The Highway Safety, Traffic Reduction, Air Quality, and Port Security Bond Act of 2006 created the Trade Corridors Improvement Fund and provided for allocation by the California Transportation Commission of $2 billion in bond funds for infrastructure improvements on highway and rail corridors that have a high volume of freight movement, and specified categories of projects eligible to receive these funds. Existing law continues the Trade Corridors Improvement Fund in existence in order to receive revenues from sources other than the bond act for these purposes. This bill would require revenues apportioned to the state from the National Highway Freight Program established by the federal Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act to be allocated for trade corridor improvement projects approved pursuant to these provisions. Existing law requires the commission, in determining projects eligible for funding, to consult various state freight and regional infrastructure and goods movement plans and the statewide port master plan. This bill would delete consideration of the State Air Resources Board\u2019s Sustainable Freight Strategy and the statewide port master plan and would instead include consideration of the applicable port master plan and the California Sustainable Freight Action Plan of July 2016 when determining eligible projects for funding. The bill would also expand eligible projects to include rail landside access improvements, landside freight access improvements to airports, and certain capital and operational improvements. The bill would require the commission to use existing guidelines for the Trade Corridors Improvement Fund in allocating available funding but would authorize the commission to adopt amendments to the guidelines by April 1, 2017, and would impose various other requirements on the commission."
