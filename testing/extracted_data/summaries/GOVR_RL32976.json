    "content": "The Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 (Title II, P.L. 101-647 ) authorized three programs: Children's Advocacy Centers, the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) program, andTraining for Judicial Practitioners and Personnel. Funding authorization for each of these programsexpired with FY2005. In mid-December 2005, Congress approved the Violence Against Womenand Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 ( H.R. 3402 ), which reauthorizesfunding for the CASA program (for FY2007-FY2011) at its FY2005 authorization level of $12million. That legislation (now P.L. 109-162 ) also extends funding for training and technicalassistance related to the Children's Advocacy Centers for FY2006-FY2010, increasing thatauthorization level to $7.5 million (previously $5 million) -- although it does not extend theauthorization for the Children's Advocacy Centers themselves. Despite the expiration of theirspending authorizations, funding for each of the Victims of Child Abuse Act programs was includedin FY2006 appropriations ( P.L. 109-108 ), and the Administration has requested funding for theseprograms in FY2007. Children's Advocacy Centers are authorized to provide services to child victims of abuse (andto their non-offending family members), to coordinate child abuse investigations in ways that reducetheir trauma, and to provide for related training and technical assistance. Funding for the centers andrelated training and technical assistance grew from approximately $13 million in FY2004 to closeto $15 million in each of FY2005 and FY2006. For FY2007, the Administration has requested $11.7million in funding for Children's Advocacy Centers. Under the CASA program, funding is provided to the National Court Appointed SpecialAdvocates Association to initiate and expand local programs that provide volunteer advocates (calledCASAs) to children who are the victims in child abuse or neglect cases. The Violence AgainstWomen and Department of Justice Act reauthorizes funding for CASA for FY2007-FY2011 and,among other changes, includes authority for the use of these funds to \"sustain\" CASA programs. Funding for CASA was $11.7 million in FY2005. For FY2006, Congress appropriatedapproximately $11.7 million for CASA. The Administration has requested $11.8 million for theprogram in FY2007. Funds appropriated for Training Judicial Practitioners and Personnel have been awarded tothe National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, and have been used to create the ongoing\"model courts\" initiative. Funding for this program was somewhat lower in FY2005 ($1.9 million)than in each of the seven preceding fiscal years. For FY2006, Congress appropriated approximately$2.3 million for this training program, and the Administration has requested the same level offunding for FY2007. This report will be updated as necessary."
