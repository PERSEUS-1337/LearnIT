    "content": "Funds for the judicial branch are included annually in the Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) Appropriations bill. The bill provides funding for the Supreme Court; the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit; the U.S. Court of International Trade; the U.S. Courts of Appeals and District Courts; Defender Services; Court Security; Fees of Jurors and Commissioners; the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts; the Federal Judicial Center; the U.S. Sentencing Commission; and Judicial Retirement Funds. The judiciary's FY2017 budget request of $7.58 billion was submitted on February 9, 2016. By law, the President includes the requests submitted by the judiciary in the annual budget submission without change. The FY2017 budget request represents a 3.3% increase over the FY2016 enacted level of $7.34 billion provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113), Division E, Title III, enacted December 18, 2015. The House Appropriations Committee held a markup (H.R. 5485) on June 9, 2016, and recommended a total of $7.55 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee held a markup (S. 3067) on June 16, 2016, and recommended a total of $7.58 billion. On July 5, the House agreed to a structured rule (H.Res. 794) for consideration of the Financial Services and General Government bill (H.R. 5485). One amendment (#60) related to the judiciary was made in order, and subsequently passed by voice vote. H.R. 5485 was agreed to on July 7, with a vote of 239-185 (Roll no. 398). No further action was taken on H.R. 5485 or S. 3067 prior to the start of FY2017 on October 1, 2016, and judicial branch activities were funded through continuing appropriations resolutions (P.L. 114-223, P.L. 114-254, and P.L. 115-30) until the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31). Division E of this act provides $7.5 billion for the judiciary, an increase of $176.2 million (2.4%) from FY2016 and $63.0 million (-0.8%) less than the request. Appropriations for the judiciary comprise approximately 0.2% of total budget authority. This report will be updated as events warrant."
