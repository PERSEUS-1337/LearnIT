    "content": "Existing law, the Unruh Civil Rights Act, states that all persons within this state are free and equal, and no matter what their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, citizenship, primary language, or immigration status are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments. Under existing law, the Department of Fair Employment and Housing is responsible for receiving, investigating, conciliating, mediating, and prosecuting complaints alleging a violation of the act. This bill would enact the Stop Consumer Racial Profiling Act of 2016, which would prohibit a business establishment from using consumer racial profiling, as defined.

This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 12930 of the Government Code, proposed by SB 1442, to be operative only if SB 1442 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last."
