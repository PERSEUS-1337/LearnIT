    "content": "Fairness in Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations governing the manufacture, distribution, sale, labeling, and advertising and promotion (manufacture) of tobacco products which are consistent with regulations governing other products which are ingested, but bars the Secretary from outlawing the sale and distribution of a tobacco product solely because tobacco causes disease. Sets minimum requirements pursuant to such regulations, including a prohibition on the sale or distribution of tobacco products to minors. Establishes in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the Tobacco and Nicotine Products Advisory Committee which shall review: (1) the available scientific evidence on the effects of tobacco products on human health, including the effects of environmental tobacco smoke on nonsmokers, (2) the manufacturing process of tobacco products. (3) the role of nicotine as part of the smoking habit, (4) the marketing and promotional techniques used by tobacco manufacturers. And (5) current Federal, State, and local laws governing the manufacture of tobacco products. Requires each tobacco product manufacturer to: (1) register with the Secretary. And (2) pay an annual fee determined by the Secretary based upon the total market share for each brand of tobacco product. Credits fees collected for a fiscal year to the appropriation account for salaries and expenses of the FDA. Amends: (1) the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA) and the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 (CSTHEA) to modify warning labels to emphasize the addictive nature of smoking. And (2) the FFDCA to include tobacco products within recordkeeping requirements applicable to the interstate shipment and factory inspection of food, drugs, devices, and cosmetics. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) modify the warning labels required by the FCLAA and CSTHEA if the modification in the content of the label does not weaken the health message and is in the best interests of the public health. And (2) increase the size and placement of such required labels."
