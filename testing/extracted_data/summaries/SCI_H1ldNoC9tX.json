    "content": "Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning addresses the problem of learning a binary classifier from positive (P) and unlabeled (U) data. It is often applied to situations where negative (N) data are difficult to be fully labeled. However, collecting a non-representative N set that contains only a small portion of all possible N data can be much easier in many practical situations. This paper studies a novel classification framework which incorporates such biased N (bN) data in PU learning. The fact that the training N data are biased also makes our work very different from those of standard semi-supervised learning. We provide an empirical risk minimization-based method to address this PUbN classification problem. Our approach can be regarded as a variant of traditional example-reweighting algorithms, with the weight of each example computed through a preliminary step that draws inspiration from PU learning. We also derive an estimation error bound for the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in not only PUbN learning scenarios but also ordinary PU leaning scenarios on several benchmark datasets. In conventional binary classification, examples are labeled as either positive (P) or negative (N), and we train a classifier on these labeled examples. On the contrary, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning addresses the problem of learning a classifier from P and unlabeled (U) data, without need of explicitly identifying N data BID6 BID42 ).PU learning finds its usefulness in many real-world problems. For example, in one-class remote sensing classification , we seek to extract a specific land-cover class from an image. While it is easy to label examples of this specific land-cover class of interest, examples not belonging to this class are too diverse to be exhaustively annotated. The same problem arises in text classification, as it is difficult or even impossible to compile a set of N samples that provides a comprehensive characterization of everything that is not in the P class BID24 BID8 . Besides, PU learning has also been applied to other domains such as outlier detection BID13 BID36 ), medical diagnosis BID45 , or time series classification BID28 .By carefully examining the above examples, we find out that the most difficult step is often to collect a fully representative N set, whereas only labeling a small portion of all possible N data is relatively easy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to study the problem of learning from P, U and biased N (bN) data, which we name PUbN learning hereinafter. We suppose that in addition to P and U data, we also gather a set of bN samples, governed by a distribution distinct from the true N distribution. As described previously , this can be viewed as an extension of PU learning, but such bias may also occur naturally in some real-world scenarios. For instance, let us presume that we would like to judge whether a subject is affected by a particular disease based on the result of a physical examination. While the data collected from the patients represent rather well the P distribution, healthy subjects that request the examination are in general highly biased with respect to the whole healthy subject population.We are not the first to be interested in learning with bN data. In fact, both BID22 and BID7 attempted to solve similar problems in the context of text classification. BID22 simply discarded negative samples and performed ordinary PU classification. It was also mentioned in the paper that bN data could be harmful. BID7 adapted another strategy. The authors considered even gathering unbiased U data is difficult and learned the classifier from only P and bN data. However, their method is specific to text classification because it relies on the use of effective similarity measures to evaluate similarity between documents. Therefore, our work differs from these two in that the classifier is trained simultaneously on P, U and bN data, without resorting to domain-specific knowledge. The presence of U data allows us to address the problem from a statistical viewpoint, and thus the proposed method can be applied to any PUbN learning problem in principle.In this paper, we develop an empirical risk minimization-based algorithm that combines both PU learning and importance weighting to solve the PUbN classification problem, We first estimate the probability that an example is sampled into the P or the bN set. Based on this estimate, we regard bN and U data as N examples with instance-dependent weights. In particular, we assign larger weights to U examples that we believe to appear less often in the P and bN sets. P data are treated as P examples with unity weight but also as N examples with usually small or zero weight whose actual value depends on the same estimate.The contributions of the paper are three-fold:1. We formulate the PUbN learning problem as an extension of PU learning and propose an empirical risk minimization-based method to address the problem. We also theoretically establish an estimation error bound for the proposed method. 2. We experimentally demonstrate that the classification performance can be effectively improved thanks to the use of bN data during training. In other words, PUbN learning yields better performance than PU learning. 3. Our method can be easily adapted to ordinary PU learning . Experimentally we show that the resulting algorithm allows us to obtain new state-of-the-art results on several PU learning tasks.Relation with Semi-supervised Learning With P, N and U data available for training, our problem setup may seem similar to that of semi-supervised learning BID2 BID29 . Nonetheless, in our case, N data are biased and often represent only a small portion of the whole N distribution. Therefore, most of the existing methods designed for the latter cannot be directly applied to the PUbN classification problem. Furthermore, our focus is on deducing a risk estimator using the three sets of data, whereas in semi-supervised learning the main concern is often how U data can be utilized for regularization BID10 BID1 BID20 BID25 . The two should be compatible and we believe adding such regularization to our algorithm can be beneficial in many cases.Relation with Dataset Shift PUbN learning can also be viewed as a special case of dataset shift 1 BID31 ) if we consider that P and bN data are drawn from the training distribution while U data are drawn from the test distribution. Covariate shift BID38 BID39 ) is another special case of dataset shift that has been studied intensively. In the covariate shift problem setting, training and test distributions have the same class conditional distribution and only differ in the marginal distribution of the independent variable. One popular approach to tackle this problem is to reweight each training example according to the ratio of the test density to the training density BID15 . Nevertheless, simply training a classifier on a reweighted version of the labeled set is not sufficient in our case since there may be examples with zero probability to be labeled. It is also important to notice that the problem of PUbN learning is intrinsically different from that of covariate shift and neither of the two is a special case of the other. This paper studied the PUbN classification problem, where a binary classifier is trained on P, U and bN data. The proposed method is a two-step approach inspired from both PU learning and importance weighting. The key idea is to attribute appropriate weights to each example to evaluate the classification risk using the three sets of data. We theoretically established an estimation error bound for the proposed risk estimator and experimentally showed that our approach successfully leveraged bN data to improve the classification performance on several real-world datasets. A variant of our algorithm was able to achieve state-of-the-art results in PU learning. DISPLAYFORM0"
