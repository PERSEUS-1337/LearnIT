    "title": "Mud Dump Permanent Closure and Remediation Act of 2000",
    "content": "Provides that an existing permit shall not be effective if it authorizes dumping in violation of this Act. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to develop standards for evaluating dredged materials to be used solely for remediation purposes at the Site. Directs the Administrator, in developing such standards, to ensure that the materials used for remediation: (1) contain significantly lower levels of contaminants than exist at the Site. (2) will significantly reduce contamination levels in biota and sediments at the Site. And (3) will reduce the number, extent, and magnitude of undesirable effects on marine life in and around the Site. Requires the goals of such standards to be to reduce the level of contamination at the Site to a level that reflects background ambient contamination levels in the ocean."
