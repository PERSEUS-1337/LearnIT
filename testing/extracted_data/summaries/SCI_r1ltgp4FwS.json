    "content": "We focus on temporal self-supervision for GAN-based video generation tasks. While adversarial training successfully yields generative models for a variety of areas, temporal relationship in the generated data is much less explored. This is crucial for sequential generation tasks, e.g. video super-resolution and unpaired video translation. For the former, state-of-the-art methods often favor simpler norm losses such as L2 over adversarial training. However, their averaging nature easily leads to temporally smooth results with an undesirable lack of spatial detail. For unpaired video translation, existing approaches modify the generator networks to form spatio-temporal cycle consistencies. In contrast, we focus on improving the learning objectives and propose a temporally self-supervised algorithm. For both tasks, we show that temporal adversarial learning is key to achieving temporally coherent solutions without sacrificing spatial detail. We also propose a novel Ping-Pong loss to improve the long-term temporal consistency. It effectively prevents recurrent networks from accumulating artifacts temporally without depressing detailed features. We also propose a first set of metrics to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy as well as the perceptual quality of the temporal evolution. A series of user studies confirms the rankings computed with these metrics. Generative adversarial models (GANs) have been extremely successful at learning complex distributions such as natural images (Zhu et al., 2017; Isola et al., 2017) . However, for sequence generation, directly applying GANs without carefully engineered constraints typically results in strong artifacts over time due to the significant difficulties introduced by the temporal changes. In particular, conditional video generation tasks are very challenging learning problems where generators should not only learn to represent the data distribution of the target domain, but also learn to correlate the output distribution over time with conditional inputs. Their central objective is to faithfully reproduce the temporal dynamics of the target domain and not resort to trivial solutions such as features that arbitrarily appear and disappear over time. In our work, we propose a novel adversarial learning method for a recurrent training approach that supervises both spatial content as well as temporal relationships. We apply our approach to two video-related tasks that offer substantially different challenges: video super-resolution (VSR) and unpaired video translation (UVT). With no ground truth motion available, the spatio-temporal adversarial loss and the recurrent structure enable our model to generate realistic results while keeping the generated structures coherent over time. With the two learning tasks we demonstrate how spatio-temporal adversarial training can be employed in paired as well as unpaired data domains. In addition to the adversarial network which supervises the short-term temporal coherence, long-term consistency is self-supervised using a novel bi-directional loss formulation, which we refer to as \"Ping-Pong\" (PP) loss in the following. The PP loss effectively avoids the temporal accumulation of artifacts, which can potentially benefit a variety of recurrent architectures. The central contributions of our work are: a spatio-temporal discriminator unit together with a careful analysis of training objectives for realistic and coherent video generation tasks, a novel PP loss supervising long-term consistency, in addition to a set of metrics for quantifying temporal coherence based on motion estimation and perceptual distance. Together, our contributions lead to models that outperform previous work in terms of temporally-coherent detail, which we quantify with a wide range of metrics and user studies. features, but collapses to essentially static outputs of Obama. It manages to transfer facial expressions back to Trump using tiny differences encoded in its Obama outputs, instead of learning a meaningful mapping. Being able to establish the correct temporal cycle-consistency between domains, ours and RecycleGAN can generate correct blinking motions. Our model outperforms the latter in terms of coherent detail that is generated. In paired as well as unpaired data domains, we have demonstrated that it is possible to learn stable temporal functions with GANs thanks to the proposed discriminator architecture and PP loss. We have shown that this yields coherent and sharp details for VSR problems that go beyond what can be achieved with direct supervision. In UVT, we have shown that our architecture guides the training process to successfully establish the spatio-temporal cycle consistency between two domains. These results are reflected in the proposed metrics and user studies. While our method generates very realistic results for a wide range of natural images, our method can generate temporally coherent yet sub-optimal details in certain cases such as under-resolved faces and text in VSR, or UVT tasks with strongly different motion between two domains. For the latter case, it would be interesting to apply both our method and motion translation from concurrent work (Chen et al., 2019) . This can make it easier for the generator to learn from our temporal self supervision. In our method, the interplay of the different loss terms in the non-linear training procedure does not provide a guarantee that all goals are fully reached every time. However, we found our method to be stable over a large number of training runs, and we anticipate that it will provide a very useful basis for wide range of generative models for temporal data sets."
