    "content": "Home Energy Generation Act - Amends the Federal Power Act to mandate that: (1) each retail electric supplier make available an electric energy meter capable of net metering to certain retail customers that have installed an energy generation unit intended for net metering. And (2) rates, charges, and contract terms for electric energy sales to customer-generators be the same as those that would be applicable if the customer-generator did not own or operate a qualified generation unit and use a net metering system. Prescribes the manner in which such retail electric suppliers shall calculate the net energy measurement and billing for a customer using a net metering system. Subjects qualified generation units and net metering systems to specified safety, performance, and reliability standards. Authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to: (1) adopt additional control and testing requirements for customer-generators necessary to protect public safety and system reliability. And (2) prohibit additional charges by electric suppliers and local distribution systems for equipment or services for safety or performance additional to those necessary to meet such standards. Sets a deadline for FERC to promulgate: (1) model standards for the physical connection between local distribution systems and qualified generation units and other specified electric generation units. And (2) regulations ensuring simplified contracts will be used for the interconnection of electric energy by electric energy transmission or distribution systems and generating facilities with a power production capacity of 250 kilowatts or less."
