    "content": "A provision in the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA, P.L. 107-71 \u00c2\u00a7 108; 115Stat. 611) permits each airport where federal screeners are currently deployed to request privatescreeners instead of federal screeners starting in November 2004. A pilot program created by theact was established at five airports to examine the advantages and disadvantages of private airportscreening. Concerns have been raised, however, that the pilot program may provide too small asample and, as currently implemented, is too similar in design to the federal screening function tomake a valid comparison of federal and private screening, and that the pilot program airports maynot serve as ideal models for future private screening systems. Also, no regulatory framework orguidelines currently exist for evaluating private screening proposals and overseeing private screeningfirms. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is currently working on these and expectsto have preliminary information for airports on the program's implementation by mid-May 2004. Many airports have expressed interest in pursuing private screening options but believe that legal protections, program flexibility to adapt to local needs, and stable funding mechanisms areneeded for successful implementation. Other issues to be addressed regarding private screening arerelated to how private screening entities will interface with federal aviation security functions suchas intelligence gathering and data sharing, and deployment of new screening technologies. Theeffect of private screening on the security screening workforce is also a critical issue, since highturnover rates among screeners before September 11, 2001, were a key factor in the decision tocreate a federal screening workforce under ATSA. Implementation of the security screening opt-out provision is likely to be an issue ofconsiderable interest during the remainder of the 108th Congress. While privatization advocates arecalling for an expansion of the opt-out provision to allow for greater program flexibility and lessfederal control of private airport screening, advocates for federal control of aviation security viewa return to private screening as a move that could reintroduce deficiencies in aviation security thatexisted before the federalization of passenger screening under ATSA. This report will be updated as warranted by events."
