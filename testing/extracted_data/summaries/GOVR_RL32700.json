    "content": "The Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) legislatively approved the World TradeOrganization (WTO) Agreement and the specialized agreements annexed to it. It also enacted theprovisions implementing the many obligations the United States undertook under them, and containsprovisions (Section 125) establishing the legislative procedure for Congressional withdrawal of suchapproval. Initiation of such withdrawal action is predicated on the transmission by the Administrationof a mandatory quinquennial report, next due by March 1, 2005, analyzing the costs and benefits ofpast U.S. participation in the WTO as well as the value of continued U.S. participation. Thereupon,a privileged joint resolution may be introduced by any Member to withdraw the Congress' approvalof the WTO Agreement provided by the URAA. The legislative procedure for such withdrawal basically follows Section 152 of the Trade Actof 1974, which provides for the enactment of joint resolutions disapproving certain trade-relatedactions, which for this purpose has been modified specifically by Section 125 of the URAA. Theprocedure provides for a (nonmandatory) introduction of the resolution, with mandatory,nonamendable language, and specific expedited (fast-track) consideration. Although the immediate function of the withdrawal provision is to create a mechanism thatwill permit periodic Congressional review of U.S. participation in the WTO and the provisionfocuses specifically on withdrawing the approval of the WTO Agreement, it has been considered inCongress and in the civil society in the broader context of United States' withdrawal from actualparticipation (i.e., membership) in the WTO. On June 9, 2005, the House defeated a resolution ( H.J.Res. 27 ) to withdrawapproval of the WTO Agreement by a vote of 338-86. A similar resolution in the year 2000 failedby a wider margin (363-56) in the House, and a withdrawal resolution was not even introduced inthe Senate. A resolution offers Congress the opportunity to debate the costs and benefits of U.S.participation in the WTO. In this context, Congressional concern with U.S. trading partners,particularly the European Union and Canada, and various other contentious issues emerged in thefloor debate and statements on H.J.Res. 27 . Such issues are dealt with in detail in CRS Report RL32918 , World Trade Organization (WTO): Issues in the Debate on U.S. Participation, by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]. This report, which will be updated as needed, sets out the background of the issue, thefunctional timetable and requirements for taking the legislative action for such withdrawal, and therelated WTO procedure. It also describes past and current activity under the withdrawal provisionand suggests the probable consequences of the withdrawal resolution, if enacted and implemented."
