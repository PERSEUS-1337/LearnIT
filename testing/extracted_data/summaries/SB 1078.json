    "title": "An act to amend Section 1281.9 of, and to add Section 1281.65 to, the Code of Civil Procedure, relating to arbitration.",
    "content": "Existing law governs arbitration in civil proceedings. Under existing law, a neutral arbitrator is defined as one who is selected jointly by the parties or by the parties\u2019 arbitrators, or is appointed by the court if the parties or their arbitrators cannot jointly select an arbitrator. Existing law requires a person selected to serve as a neutral arbitrator to disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt as to the proposed neutral arbitrator\u2019s impartiality. Existing law requires the disclosure to include, among other things, whether or not the proposed neutral arbitrator has a current arrangement concerning prospective employment or other compensated service as a dispute resolution neutral with a party to the proceeding, or is participating in, or has participated within the last 2 years in, discussions regarding such prospective employment or service. This bill, in a consumer arbitration case, would also require the disclosure of any solicitation made within the last 2 years by, or at the direction of, a private arbitration company to a party or lawyer for a party. The bill would only require disclosure of solicitations made after January 1, 2017. The bill would specify what is, and what is not, a solicitation for purposes of this disclosure. The bill would prohibit the solicitation of a party or lawyer for a party during the pendency of the arbitration. The bill would also prohibit an arbitrator, from the time of appointment until the conclusion of the arbitration, from entertaining or accepting any offers of employment or offers of new professional relationships, and, in a consumer arbitration case, would prohibit the arbitrator from entertaining or accepting any offers of employment as a dispute resolution neutral in another case from a party or lawyer for a party in the pending arbitration, except as provided. This bill would exempt specified self-regulatory organizations from the application of the bill. The bill would provide that its provisions are severable."
