    "content": "Women's Choice and Reproductive Health Protection Act of 1995 - Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) current provisions of law requiring funding for abortion services in cases of life endangerment, and for victims of rape or incest, to women eligible for medical assistance through the Medicaid program are essential to their health. (2) Federal resources are necessary to ensure that women have safe access to reproductive health facilities and that health professionals can deliver services in a secure environment free from threats of force. (3) it is necessary and appropriate to use Federal resources to combat the nationwide campaign of violence and harassment against reproductive health centers. (4) the program of grants under title XV of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) should receive a level of funding that is adequate for all States to receive grants under such title. (5) the program of research centers under the PHSA should receive a level of funding that is adequate for a reasonable number of individuals to conduct research under the program. And (6) the program of loan-repayment contracts under the PHSA should receive a level of funding that is adequate for a reasonable number of individuals to conduct research under the program. Amends the PHSA to authorize appropriations for FY 1996 through 2000 for population research and family planning programs. Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit any government authority from limiting the right of any individual to provide or receive nonfraudulent information about the availability of reproductive health care services, including family planning, prenatal care, adoption, and abortion services. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) assure that the Food and Drug Administration evaluates the drug Mifepristone or RU 486. And (2) assess initiatives by which the Department of Health and Human Services can promote the testing, licensing, and manufacturing of the drug Mifepristone or other antiprogestins in the United States. Prohibits Federal law from being construed to prohibit health insurance providers from offering coverage for any reproductive health care services, including abortion services. Amends Federal law to provide that the performance of an abortion in a facility of the uniformed services located outside the 48 contiguous States of the United States is not prohibited provided specific requirements are met."
