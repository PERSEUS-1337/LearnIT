Requires such regulations to require an operator to: (1) provide annual training to local first responders on well hazards and proper emergency response techniques. And (2) file a report annually with OSHA that provides detailed information on the response team assigned to each of the operator's wells and affirmatively states that the operator is in compliance with this Act."
