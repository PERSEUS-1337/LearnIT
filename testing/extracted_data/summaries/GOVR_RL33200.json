    "content": "Countries in Latin America serve as source, transit, and destination countries for trafficking in persons (TIP). Victims are exploited within their own countries and trafficked to other countries in the region. Latin America is also a primary source region for people trafficked to the United States, including by transnational organized crime groups. In FY2015, Mexico was the primary country of origin for foreign trafficking victims certified as eligible to receive U.S. assistance. Recent victims identified in the United States also have originated in Brazil and Central America. Smaller numbers of Latin Americans are trafficked to Europe and Asia. Latin America also serves as a transit region for Asian victims. On June 30, 2016, the State Department issued its 16th annual congressionally mandated report on human trafficking. The report categorizes countries into four \"tiers\" according to the government's efforts to combat trafficking. Only Tier 1 countries, approximately 19.5% of those assessed, are fully compliant with U.S.-established minimum standards to eliminate severe forms of human trafficking. Those countries that do not cooperate in the fight against trafficking (Tier 3) have been made subject to U.S. aid restrictions. Chile, Colombia, and the Bahamas received the top Tier 1 ranking in this year's report. Belize, Haiti, Suriname, and Venezuela are the only Latin American countries ranked in Tier 3, as Cuba remained in the Tier 2 Watch List. Other countries in the region\u2014Antigua and Barbuda, Bolivia, Costa Rica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago\u2014are on the Tier 2 Watch List. Since enactment of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA; P.L. 106-386), Congress has taken steps to address human trafficking through legislation (including reauthorizations of the TVPA in 2005, 2008, and 2013), appropriations, and oversight. In February 2016, Congress enacted the International Megan's Law (P.L. 114-119) requiring U.S. agencies to notify foreign governments when registered sex offenders are visiting their countries. Congress also enacted the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-125) eliminating an exception that had allowed goods produced by forced labor to be imported if demand for those items could not be met by U.S. producers. Congress provided funding for anti-TIP programs in the FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 114-113), including $5 million for programs in Guatemala and $4 million for forensics to solve TIP cases in Central America. P.L. 114-113 withheld some aid to the governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras until they demonstrated anti-TIP efforts. Congress is monitoring human trafficking trends in the region and overseeing U.S.-funded anti-TIP programs, including U.S.-Mexican law enforcement efforts to disrupt cross-border TIP networks.
