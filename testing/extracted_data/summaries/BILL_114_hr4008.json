(2) has filed, or is a material witness to, a workplace claim. And (3) has been helpful in a federal, state, or local law enforcement action related to the claim. The bill sets forth workplace claim procedural requirements and protections in an enforcement action leading to a removal proceeding. The bill establishes exceptions to a stay of removal or other specified relief where DHS establishes that: (1) the alien has been convicted of a felony, or (2) a workplace claim was filed in bad faith with intent to delay or avoid the alien's removal."
