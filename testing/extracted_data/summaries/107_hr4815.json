    "content": "Real Solutions to World Hunger Act of 2002 - Makes it unlawful for any person to ship, or offer to ship, or for any carrier or person to transport, or receive for transportation, to any foreign country, any genetically engineered animal, plant, or seed if the person knows or has reason to believe that the engineered article will be used to produce an agricultural commodity if: (1) such article was denied Federal approval for US marketing, or its application for approval was withdrawn. Or (2) the foreign government has not certified that related ecological impacts of such article have been satisfactorily mitigated. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to make grants to designated international research institutions to promote development of sustainable agricultural techniques that rely on minimum artificial inputs to meet developing countries' food and fiber needs. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the United States Executive Director at each international financial institution to make no effort to encourage the institution from prohibiting countries eligible for certain assistance from requiring compulsory licensing of genetically engineered animals, plants, or seeds. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) impose a tax on a corporation equal to one percent of the gross income that is attributable to the US marketing of any genetically engineered organism , or the holding of a patent on any such organism. And (2) establish in the Treasury the Sustainable Agriculture Trust Fund."
