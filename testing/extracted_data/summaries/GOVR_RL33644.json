    "content": "The federal government provides grants for family planning services through the Family Planning Program, Title X of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7300 to 300a-6). Enacted in 1970, it is the only domestic federal program devoted solely to family planning and related preventive health services. In 2015, Title X-funded clinics served 4.0 million clients. Title X is administered through the Office of Population Affairs (OPA) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Although the authorization of appropriations for Title X ended with FY1985, funding for the program has continued through appropriations bills for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (Labor-HHS-Education). The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) provided $286.5 million for Title X, the same as the FY2016 level. The FY2017 act continued previous years' requirements that Title X funds not be spent on abortions, that all pregnancy counseling be nondirective, and that funds not be spent on promoting or opposing any legislative proposal or candidate for public office. Grantees continued to be required to certify that they encourage \"family participation\" when minors seek family planning services and to certify that they counsel minors on how to resist attempted coercion into sexual activity. The appropriations law also clarified that family planning providers are not exempt from state notification and reporting laws on child abuse, child molestation, sexual abuse, rape, or incest. The President's FY2018 budget request includes $286.5 million for Title X, the same as the FY2017 enacted level. The House-reported FY2018 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill, H.R. 3358, would provide no funding for the Title X program in FY2018. The House Rules Committee has announced that H.R. 3354, the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act, 2018, would be the legislative vehicle for several FY2018 appropriations bills, including the House Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill. H.R. 3354, as posted on the House Rules Committee website on August 16, 2017, would provide no funding for the Title X program in FY2018. As of this writing, an FY2018 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill has not been introduced in the Senate. In December 2016, OPA released a final rule to limit the criteria Title X grantees could use to restrict subawards: \"No recipient making subawards for the provision of services as part of its Title X project may prohibit an entity from participating for reasons other than its ability to provide Title X services.\" On April 13, 2017, the President signed P.L. 115-23, which nullified the rule under the Congressional Review Act. Federal law (42 U.S.C. \u00a7300a-6) prohibits the use of Title X funds in programs where abortion is a method of family planning. According to OPA, family planning projects that receive Title X funds are closely monitored to ensure that federal funds are used appropriately and that funds are not used for prohibited activities such as abortion. The prohibition on abortion does not apply to all the activities of a Title X grantee, but only to activities that are part of the Title X project. A grantee's abortion activities must be \"separate and distinct\" from the Title X project activities."
