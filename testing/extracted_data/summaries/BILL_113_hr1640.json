    "content": "Cyber Warrior Act of 2013 - Directs the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to establish in each state and the District of Columbia a separate team of National Guard members to be known as the Cyber and Computer Network Incident Response Team to perform analysis and protection in support of programs to prepare for and respond to emergencies involving an attack or natural disaster impacting a computer, electronic, or cyber network. Authorizes National Guard members to assist the combatant commands in developing and expanding their capacity to prepare for and respond to such events. Prohibits members from performing such duties unless the Secretary certifies to Congress that the members possess the requisite skills, training, and equipment to be proficient in all mission requirements. Requires the homeland defense activities for which the Secretary is authorized to provide funds to a governor for National Guard units to include: (1) the National Guard's provision of cyber emergency education and training for state and local law enforcement and governmental personnel. And (2) upon a governor's order, the National Guard's performance of activities undertaken by state and local governments to prepare for and respond to such emergencies. Sets forth requirements for the Secretaries of the Army and the Air Force to provide appropriate cyber training to members of the Army National Guard and Air National Guard."
