    "content": "The mission of the Department of Justice (DOJ) is to \"enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States according to the law; to ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic; to provide federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime; to seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior; and to ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans.\" DOJ carries out its mission through the activities of agencies and bureaus such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the U.S. Marshals Service; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; the U.S. Attorneys Office; and the Bureau of Prisons. This report provides an overview of the FY2015 appropriations, the Administration's FY2016 request, House and Senate committee action, and FY2016 appropriations for DOJ. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) provided a total of $27.030 billion for DOJ for FY2015. The Administration requested $29.240 billion for DOJ for FY2016, an increase of 8.2%. The House recommended $28.007 billion for DOJ, while the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $27.828 billion. The FY2016-enacted appropriation for DOJ is $29.090 billion, an amount that is 7.6% greater than the FY2015 appropriation, but 0.5% below the Administration's request. The Administration put forth several budget proposals for DOJ for FY2016. While policymakers might have an interest in a wide variety of topics within the purview of DOJ's responsibilities, the proposals discussed in this report are based on topics that either tend to be a perennial interest for policymakers or which have become topics of national significance due to recent events. Such topics might include the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosive's efforts to combat firearm violence in the United States through its administrative and enforcement functions; DOJ's efforts to combat cybercrime and ensure cybersecurity; grant funding for state and local law enforcement; federal marijuana enforcement efforts in light of state efforts to liberalize their marijuana policies; and federal efforts to combat violent extremism."
