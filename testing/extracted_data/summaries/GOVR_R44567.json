    "content": "This report discusses FY2017 appropriations (discretionary budget authority) for the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of the Census (Census Bureau), which make up the Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) in the U.S. Department of Commerce. The report will not be updated. The Administration's FY2017 budget request for ESA (except the Census Bureau, whose budget justification is published separately from ESA's) was $114.6 million, $5.6 million (5.2%) above the $109.0 million FY2016-enacted funding level. Of the $114.6 million, the $110.7 million requested for BEA exceeded the $105.1 million FY2016-enacted amount by $5.6 million (5.3%); the $4.0 million requested to fund ESA's policy support and management oversight was $83,000 (2.1%) more than the $3.9 million approved for FY2016. The FY2017 request for the Census Bureau was $1,633.6 million, $263.6 million (19.2%) above the $1,370.0 million FY2016-enacted amount. The FY2017 request was divided between the bureau's two major accounts: $285.3 million for Current Surveys and Programs and $1,348.3 million for Periodic Censuses and Programs. Two key programs under this account are the 2020 Decennial Census, with an FY2017 request of $778.3 million, $179.4 million (30.0%) above the $598.9 million enacted for FY2016; and the American Community Survey (ACS), with a request of $251.1 million, $20.2 million (8.7%) above the $230.9 million FY2016-enacted amount. On April 21, 2016, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 2837, the Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2017 (CJS), with recommended funding of $109.0 million for ESA (showing no separate breakout for BEA). The amount was identical to ESA's FY2016 appropriation and $5.6 million (4.9%) below the FY2017 request. S. 2837, as reported, recommended $1,518.3 million for the Census Bureau, $148.3 million (10.8%) above the FY2016 appropriation and $115.3 million (7.1%) below the FY2017 request. Current Surveys and Programs was to receive $270.0 million, the same as in FY2016 and $15.3 million (5.4%) below the FY2017 request. The $1,248.3 million for Periodic Censuses and Programs would have exceeded FY2016 funding by $148.3 million (13.5%) and been $100.0 million (7.4%) less than requested for FY2017. The House Committee on Appropriations approved the House FY2017 CJS appropriations bill, H.R. 5393, on June 7, 2016. Recommended funding for ESA was $107.0 million (with no separate breakout for BEA), $2.0 million (1.8%) less than enacted for FY2016 and approved by the Senate committee, and $7.6 million (6.7%) below the FY2017 request. The Census Bureau was to receive $1,470.0 million, $100.0 million (7.3%) more than in FY2016, $163.6 million (10.0%) less than requested for FY2017, and $48.3 million (3.2%) below the Senate committee's recommendation. The $270.0 million recommended for Current Surveys and Programs equaled the FY2016-enacted and FY2017 Senate-committee-recommended amounts and was $15.3 million (5.4%) less than requested. The $1,200.0 million for Periodic Censuses and Programs was $100.0 million (9.1%) above the FY2016-enacted level, $148.3 million (11.0%) less than the FY2017 request, and $48.3 million (3.9%) below what the Senate committee approved. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, H.R. 244, P.L. 115-31, became law on May 5, 2017. It provided ESA with $107.3 million (showing no separate amount for BEA), $1.7 million (1.6%) less than enacted for FY2016 and recommended by the Senate committee, $7.3 million (6.4%) below the FY2017 request, and $300,000 (0.3%) more than the House committee approved. The $1,470.0 million for the Census Bureau in FY2017, including $270.0 million for Current Surveys and Programs and $1,200.0 million for Periodic Censuses and Programs, matched the House committee's recommendations."
