    "content": "Hurricanes Katrina and Rita shut down oil and gas production from the Outer ContinentalShelf in the Gulf of Mexico, the source for 25% of U.S. crude oil production and 20% of natural gasoutput. Katrina, which made landfall on August 29, resulted in the shutdown of most crude oil andnatural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as a great deal of refining capacity in Louisianaand Alabama, 554,000 barrels per day of which was still closed as of late October, 2005. Offshoreoil and gas production was resuming when Hurricane Rita made landfall on September 24, and anadditional 4.8 million barrels per day (mbd) of refining capacity in Texas and nearby Louisiana wasclosed. Combining the effects of both storms, 1.3 mbd of refining -- about 8% of national capability-- is shut down, reducing the supply of domestically refined fuels commensurately. Much of therefined product shortfall was made up by imports of refined products, some of which were madeavailable by strategic supplies released by International Energy Agency (IEA) member nations onSeptember 2. As part of the IEA drawdown, 30 million barrels of crude oil were made available from theU.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which holds only crude. Only 11 million barrels was soldfrom the SPR, in part because limited refinery capacity reduced the call on crude. Natural gas production from Gulf of Mexico and Louisiana state lands has been recoveringsince the storms, but the equivalent of about 3% of U.S. consumption remains shut-in because ofproduction or transport problems. Unlike refined products, which can be imported, there is littleextra available supply. A normal storage situation at the start of the heating season -- coupled witha very warm winter -- saw Spring 2006 arrive with surplus gas in storage and gas prices well belowequivalent oil prices. This report will be updated to reflect significant restoration of gas and oil production andrelated infrastructure, as well as relevant changes in hydrocarbon supply and demand."
