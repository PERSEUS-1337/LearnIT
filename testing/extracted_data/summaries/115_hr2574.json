    "content": "Building a Health Care Workforce for the Future Act This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award matching grants to enable states to implement scholarship programs to ensure an adequate supply of health professionals. Scholarships must cover tuition and educational expenses and provide a cost-of-living stipend. Scholarship recipients must agree to serve as providers in shortage areas in the state for one year for each year they receive the scholarship. HHS may award grants to assist medical schools in developing and strengthening primary care mentorship programs and cultivating leaders in primary care among its students. In order to foster curricular innovations to improve the education and training of health care providers, HHS must award grants to medical and other health professions schools to promote priority competencies that are selected annually by the Advisory Committee on Training in Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry. The National Academy of Medicine must study the documentation requirements for cognitive services under Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurers, including whether the requirements are overly burdensome."
