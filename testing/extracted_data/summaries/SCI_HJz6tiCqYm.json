    "content": "In this paper we establish rigorous benchmarks for image classifier robustness. Our first benchmark, ImageNet-C, standardizes and expands the corruption robustness topic, while showing which classifiers are preferable in safety-critical applications. Then we propose a new dataset called ImageNet-P which enables researchers to benchmark a classifier's robustness to common perturbations. Unlike recent robustness research, this benchmark evaluates performance on common corruptions and perturbations not worst-case adversarial perturbations. We find that there are negligible changes in relative corruption robustness from AlexNet classifiers to ResNet classifiers. Afterward we discover ways to enhance corruption and perturbation robustness. We even find that a bypassed adversarial defense provides substantial common perturbation robustness. Together our benchmarks may aid future work toward networks that robustly generalize. The human vision system is robust in ways that existing computer vision systems are not BID50 BID1 . Unlike current deep learning classifiers BID36 BID21 BID60 , the human vision system is not fooled by small changes in query images. Humans are also not confused by many forms of corruption such as snow, blur, pixelation, and novel combinations of these. Humans can even deal with abstract changes in structure and style. Achieving these kinds of robustness is an important goal for computer vision and machine learning. It is also essential for creating deep learning systems that can be deployed in safety-critical applications.Most work on robustness in deep learning methods for vision has focused on the important challenges of robustness to adversarial examples BID54 BID5 , unknown unknowns BID25 BID23 BID41 , and model or data poisoning BID53 . In contrast, we develop and validate datasets for two other forms of robustness. Specifically, we introduce the IMAGETNET-C dataset for input corruption robustness and the IMAGENET-P dataset for input perturbation robustness.To create IMAGENET-C, we introduce a set of 75 common visual corruptions and apply them to the ImageNet object recognition challenge BID7 . We hope that this will serve as a general dataset for benchmarking robustness to image corruptions and prevent methodological problems such as moving goal posts and result cherry picking. We evaluate the performance of current deep learning systems and show that there is wide room for improvement on IMAGENET-C. We also introduce a total of three methods and architectures that improve corruption robustness without losing accuracy.To create IMAGENET-P, we introduce a set of perturbed or subtly differing ImageNet images. Using metrics we propose, we measure the stability of the network's predictions on these perturbed images. Although these perturbations are not chosen by an adversary, currently existing networks exhibit surprising instability on common perturbations. Then we then demonstrate that approaches which enhance corruption robustness can also improve perturbation robustness. For example, some recent architectures can greatly improve both types of robustness. More, we show that the Adversarial Logit Pairing \u221e adversarial example defense can yield substantial robustness gains on diverse and common perturbations. By defining and benchmarking perturbation and corruption robustness, we facilitate research that can be overcome by future networks which do not rely on spurious correlations or cues inessential to the object's class. In this paper, we introduced what are to our knowledge the first comprehensive benchmarks for corruption and perturbation robustness. This was made possible by introducing two new datasets, IMAGENET-C and IMAGENET-P. The first of which showed that many years of architectural advancements corresponded to minuscule changes in relative corruption robustness. Therefore benchmarking and improving robustness deserves attention, especially as top-1 clean ImageNet accuracy nears its ceiling. We also saw that classifiers exhibit unexpected instability on simple perturbations. Thereafter we found that methods such as histogram equalization, multiscale architectures, and larger featureaggregating models improve corruption robustness. These larger models also improve perturbation robustness. However, we found that even greater perturbation robustness can come from an adversarial defense designed for adversarial \u221e perturbations, indicating a surprising interaction between adversarial and common perturbation robustness. In this work, we found several methods to increase robustness, introduced novel experiments and metrics, and created new datasets for the rigorous study of model robustness, a pressing necessity as models are unleashed into safety-critical real-world settings."
