    "content": "The electric utility industry is a major source of air pollution, particularly sulfur dioxide(SO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and mercury (Hg), as well as suspected greenhouse gases, particularlycarbon dioxide (CO 2 ). On October 27, 2005, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) releaseda long-awaited analysis comparing the costs and benefits of alternative approaches to controlling thispollution. The alternative schemes focus on using market-oriented mechanisms directed at multiplepollutants to achieve health and environmental goals. The new analysis compares four versions ofthe Administration-based \"Clear Skies\" proposal to bills introduced by Senator Jeffords( S. 150 ) and Senator Carper ( S. 843 of the 108th Congress), which wouldimpose more stringent requirements. This report, which will not be updated, examines EPA's analysis and adjusts some of itsassumptions to reflect current regulations. The most important adjustment is the choice of baseline. The agency's analysis assumes as a baseline that, in the absence of new federal legislation, EPA andthe states will take no additional action to control SO 2 , NOx, Hg, or CO 2 emissions beyond thoseactions finalized by mid-2004. This baseline is put forth despite three rules recently promulgated byEPA that limit SO 2 , NOx, and Hg emissions on a timeframe similar to that proposed by the ClearSkies legislation. CRS reexamines EPA's data, producing cost and benefit estimates for each bill incrementalto the costs and benefits of current law and promulgated regulations. The reanalysis finds that ClearSkies would have negligible incremental costs and added benefits of $6 billion in 2010 and $3 billionin 2020. For the same years, S. 843 would have annual net benefits 8 and 5 times asgreat as Clear Skies at annual costs of $4.2 billion and $3 billion, and S. 150 wouldhave annual net benefits 10 and 16 times those of Clear Skies at annual costs of $23.6 billion and$18.1 billion. EPA conducted limited sensitivity analyses to examine the effect on cost of selectcombinations of assumptions, including (1) the responsiveness of electricity demand to changes inprice; (2) the availability of skilled labor to install control equipment; and (3) the growth ofelectricity demand and natural gas prices. However, some potentially useful combinations ofassumptions were not examined. For example, if EPA had combined a relaxed skilled laborconstraint with some responsiveness of electricity demand to changes in price, the cost of S. 150 and S. 843 would be substantially reduced. CRS also concludedthat the Hg control costs used in the analysis may be substantially overstated because of datedassumptions. Numerous benefits were not estimated by EPA, partly because of methodologicaldifficulties. Benefits not estimated include the environmental (as opposed to health) benefits ofcontrolling the pollutants; the health effects of mercury control; and any benefits from controllingCO 2 emissions. Thus, even though benefits exceeded costs for each of the options in both EPA's andour analysis, one should perhaps view the benefit estimates as a floor rather than a best estimate,particularly for S. 150 and S. 843 , which include significant Hg and CO 2 reductions."
