    "content": "The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-383) declares that, \"Support for democratization is a fundamental principle of U.S. foreign policy. As such, it naturally applies to United States policy toward Hong Kong.\" China's law establishing the Hong Kong Special Administration Region (HKSAR), commonly referred to as the \"Basic Law,\" declares that \"the ultimate aim\" is the selection of Hong Kong's Chief Executive (CE) and Legislative Council (Legco) by universal suffrage. The year 2015 may be a pivotal year for making progress toward the objectives of both of these laws. It could also be a year in which the democratic aspirations of many Hong Kong residents remain unfulfilled. Hong Kong's current Chief Executive, Leung Chun-ying, initiated a six-step process in July 2014 whereby Hong Kong's Basic Law could be amended to allow the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage in 2017. On August 31, 2014, China's National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) completed the second step of the reform process when it issued a decision setting comparatively strict conditions on the adoption of universal suffrage for the 2017 CE elections that seemingly preclude the nomination of a pro-democracy candidate. The third step of the process, the CE submitting legislation to Legco to amend the Basic Law, came on June 17. On June 18, Legco defeated the proposed election reforms by a vote of 28 against and 8 in favor of the legislation, completing the fourth step and terminating one path to universal suffrage. Public opinion in Hong Kong over the proposed CE election reforms is split, with opinion surveys showing a sharp division of opinion on accepting the NPCSC's conditions. In the autumn of 2014, anger in Hong Kong over the NPCSC's August 2014 decision precipitated the occupation of several major Hong Kong roads by thousands of Hong Kong residents. These occupations were ended in December 2014 by the deployment of thousands of police officers, but scattered protests continue. The democratization of Hong Kong not only has implications for U.S. relations with Hong Kong, but also for U.S. relations with China and the political development of Taiwan and cross-Strait relations. In response to the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, Members of the 113th Congress introduced the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (H.R. 5696 and S. 2922), to amend the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. The Senate version of the legislation was amended by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar on December 11, 2014, but did not receive consideration by the full Senate. The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act has been reintroduced in the 114th Congress in the House of Representatives (H.R. 1159) with some changes, but not in the Senate. In addition, the 114th Congress may consider continuing appropriations for existing programs to promote the democratization of Hong Kong. Because the process of possibly reforming Hong Kong's election laws is underway, this report will be updated as circumstances or conditions in Hong Kong significantly change. This update reflects Legco's defeat of the proposed resolution and possible next steps in election reforms."
