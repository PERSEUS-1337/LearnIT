    "content": "This report examines the legislative history and design structure of the nation's four federally chartered regional commissions: the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), the Denali Commission (DC), the Delta Regional Authority (DRA), and the Northern Great Plains Regional Authority (NGPRA). For each of the four entities, this report includes a summary of the legislative history leading to its creation, its funding history, and a listing by state of political subdivisions included in its designated service areas. The report also identifies criteria a jurisdiction must meet in order to be designated as a recipient of funding, the structure of the governing authority charged with administering funds, and current funding and legislative issues, if any."
