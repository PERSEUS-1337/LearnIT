(2) review, adjudicate, and respond in writing, within 30 days, to an individual who files an appeal and redress request. And (3) maintain a Comprehensive Cleared List of individuals who are determined by the Director to have been misidentified. Directs the Secretary: (1) to ensure that such Cleared List is electronically integrated into the systems for screening individuals against the terrorist watchlist, (2) to transmit to government entities that use such watchlist such Cleared List and any other information necessary to resolve misidentifications, (3) to work with such entities to ensure that the Cleared List is considered when assessing the security risk of an individual, and (4) in conjunction with DHS's Chief Privacy Officer, to take specified steps to protect or limit the use of personally identifiable information, including requiring DHS employees to complete mandatory privacy and security training before being authorized to handle such information. Requires the Office to: (1) provide, at each airport at which DHS has a presence, written information to individuals about how to begin the appeal and redress process. And (2) ensure the availability, at each airport at which DHS has a significant presence, of a TSA or CBP supervisor to provide support to individuals in need of guidance in such process. Requires the DHS Inspector General to report on the implementation and impact of this Act. Incorporates the appeals and redress process into the Secure Flight Program."
