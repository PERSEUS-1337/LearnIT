    "title": "SB 1169",
    "content": "Existing federal law establishes nutritional standards for all food and beverages other than meals reimbursed under programs authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 available for sale to pupils on the school campus during the schoolday. Existing state law establishes nutritional standards for all food and beverages sold or served to pupils in elementary, middle, and high school. This bill would enact the Healthy Food, Healthy Student Act to update state law regarding school nutritional standards to conform to the federal standards. To the extent these changes would impose new duties on school districts and county offices of education, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing law requires every public school to post the school district\u2019s nutrition and physical activity policies in public view within all school cafeterias or other central eating areas. This bill would, instead, require every public school to inform the public about the content of the school\u2019s local school wellness policy, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."
