    "content": "Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment ActThis bill requires federal agencies to: (1) identify all personnel positions that require the performance of information technology, cybersecurity, or other cyber-related functions. And (2) assign a corresponding employment code to such positions using a coding structure that the National Institute of Standards and Technology must include in the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education's National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. To implement the coding structure: (1) the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) must coordinate with the Director of National Intelligence to establish procedures to identify such federal civilian positions, and (2) the Department of Defense must establish procedures to identify such federal noncivilian positions. Federal agencies must submit to Congress a report identifying: (1) the percentage of personnel with such job functions who currently hold industry-recognized certifications, (2) the preparedness of other civilian and noncivilian cyber personnel without existing credentials to pass certification exams, and (3) a strategy for mitigating any identified gaps with training and certification for existing personnel. The agencies must establish procedures to identify all encumbered and vacant positions with such functions and assign the appropriate employment code to each position. Annually through 2022, the agencies must submit a report to the OPM that identifies cyber-related roles designated as critical needs in the agency's workforce. The OPM must provide agencies with guidance for identifying roles with acute and emerging skill shortages. The OPM, within two years after enactment of this Act, must identify critical needs for the cyber workforce across all federal agencies and report to Congress regarding the implementation of this Act."
