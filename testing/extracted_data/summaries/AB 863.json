    "title": "An act to amend Sections 27375 and 34500.4 of the Vehicle Code, relating to modified limousines.",
    "content": "Existing law, on and after January 1, 2016, requires any person operating a modified limousine that is modified prior to July 1, 2015, to ensure that the vehicle is equipped with at least 2 rear side doors and one or 2 rear windows that the rear seat passengers or all passengers of the vehicle may open from the inside of the vehicle in case of any fire or other emergency, as specified. Under this bill, the requirement that those modified limousines be equipped with one or 2 rear windows would instead apply on and after January 1, 2017. The bill would make other nonsubstantive changes to these provisions. Existing law requires, not later than July 1, 2016, the Department of the California Highway Patrol to implement a program to conduct safety inspections of modified limousine terminals that are operated by passenger stage corporations pursuant to the Public Utilities Act or by charter-party carriers of passengers pursuant to the Passenger Charter-party Carriers\u2019 Act. This bill would extend the operative date of the safety inspection program to July 1, 2017."
