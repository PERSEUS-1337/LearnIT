    "content": "African Elephant Conservation and Legal Ivory Possession Act of 2014 - Reauthorizes the African Elephant Conservation Act (AECA) through FY2019. Authorizes ivory to be imported or exported under the AECA and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) if: (1) the raw ivory or worked ivory is solely for a museum. (2) it was lawfully importable into the United States on February 24, 2014, regardless of when it was acquired. Or (3) the worked ivory was previously lawfully possessed in the United States. Authorizes the Department of the Interior to station one US Fish and Wildlife Service law enforcement officer in the primary US diplomatic or consular post in each African country that has a significant population of African elephants to assist local wildlife rangers in protecting the elephants and facilitating the apprehension of individuals who illegally kill them or assist in killing them. Requires Interior to certify a finding that a county is a significant transit or destination point for illegal ivory trade and report the certification to the President for the purposes of the Pelly Amendment to the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967. Authorizes under the AECA and ESA: (1) the possession, sale, delivery, receipt, shipment, or transportation of African elephant ivory that has been lawfully imported or crafted in the United States, and (2) the importation of a sport-hunted African elephant trophy if the country in which the elephant was taken has elephants that are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) at the time the trophy is imported."
