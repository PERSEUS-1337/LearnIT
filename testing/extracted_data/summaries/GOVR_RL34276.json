    "content": "Congress approved an FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 2764) during the week of December 17, 2007, that included some emergency supplemental funding for international affairs requested by the White House. The President signed the spending measure on December 26 (P.L. 110-161). The White House had submitted emergency supplemental requests to Congress for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and international affairs programs totaling $196.5 billion. The request was made in two installments\u2014an estimate of additional expenses was sent to Congress with the FY2008 regular budget request in February 2007, and a second amended request was made on October 22, 2007. Of the total, $6.897 billion consisted of international affairs spending, relating to State Department operations and foreign assistance programs, and included $350 million in Agriculture Department food aid appropriations. This report analyzes the international affairs portion of the request and tracks related legislative activity. On February 6, 2007, the Administration sent to Congress its regular FY2008 budget that included $35.1 billion for international affairs. At the same time, the President sent Congress a separate FY2008 emergency supplemental request of $3.301 billion for international affairs. On October 22, 2007, the Administration amended its supplemental request with $3.596 billion in additional spending. While the largest portion of the total request was for State Department operations and foreign assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan, it also included sizeable requests for programs in Mexico, the West Bank and Gaza, North Korea, Sudan, and Pakistan. The Bush Administration has increasingly requested supplemental funds for international affairs budgets. Some budget experts and others have criticized the Administration for relying too heavily on supplementals, saying that many items have become routine, particularly relating to Iraq and Afghanistan, and should be incorporated into the regular appropriations cycle. The Administration counters that given the nature of rapidly changing overseas events and unforeseen emergencies, it is necessary to make supplemental requests for what it asserts are unexpected and non-recurring expenses. Some congressional leaders have said that an additional supplemental bill may be considered later in 2008. In the meantime, nearly $2.4 billion in international affairs funding requested in the supplemental was included in an omnibus FY2008 appropriations bill. H.R. 2764, the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriation bill, was the vehicle used to accommodate 11 outstanding appropriations measures for both regular FY2008 and supplemental funding. The omnibus also included supplemental funding for military operations.
