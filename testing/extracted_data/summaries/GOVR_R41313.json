    "content": "To address concerns about the public postsecondary education offerings available to District of Columbia residents, the District of Columbia College Access Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-98) established the District of Columbia Tuition Assistance Grant (DCTAG) program. The program is meant to provide college-bound DC residents with a greater array of choices among institutions of higher education by providing grants for undergraduate education. Grants for study at public institutions of higher education (IHEs) nationwide offset the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition and fees, up to $10,000 per year and a cumulative maximum of $50,000. Students may also receive grants of up to $2,500 per year and a cumulative maximum of $12,500 for undergraduate study at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) nationwide and private IHEs in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area. DCTAG program grants are provided regardless of need or merit. However, to be eligible to receive a program grant, individuals must, among other criteria, be District of Columbia residents; be enrolled or accepted for enrollment on at least a half-time basis in a degree, certificate, or credential granting program; maintain satisfactory progress in their course of study; be 24 years of age or younger; and have received a secondary school diploma or its equivalent. Post-baccalaureate students who have already earned a bachelor's degree or students whose family's federal taxable income equals or exceeds $1 million annually are ineligible to participate. As of February 2012, a total of 18,663 students have received a total of $307 million in DCTAG awards and have attended over 600 institutions of higher education (IHEs) in 49 states. There has been a substantial increase in the amount appropriated for the DCTAG program since its inception (from $17 million in FY2000 to $28.4 million in FY2013), but there has been no change to the maximum award size in response to rising postsecondary education costs, which may be leaving many program participants paying more per year for their education than in previous years or possibly limiting their choices of which institution to attend. This report first discusses the history of the DCTAG program and the events and legislation leading up to its passage. It then describes the program's administration, including recipient eligibility and the amount of award available based on the type of institution attended, award interaction with federal student aid, and funding. Next, the report presents DCTAG performance data, such as the types of institutions DCTAG recipients primarily attend and the types of students served by the program (e.g., the number of grants received, by DC ward). Finally, the report provides an analysis of grant benefits and discusses the extent to which DCTAG awards may be bridging the gap between in-state and out-of-state tuition."
