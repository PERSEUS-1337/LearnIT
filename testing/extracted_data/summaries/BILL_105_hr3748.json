Conditions availability of a specified amount of such funds on the Commission adopting a re-prioritization plan for improving enforcement procedures and preventing the unnecessary dismissal of appropriate enforcement actions. Provides for the appointment of the Commission's staff director and general counsel by an affirmative vote of four Commissioners. Prohibits: (1) the staff director and general counsel of the Commission from serving for more than four consecutive years without reappointment. (2) an individual appointed to finish an unexpired term of office of a staff director or general counsel from serving beyond that term. Or (3) a person serving as staff director or general counsel from subsequently serving in any Commission capacity unless reappointed. Sets forth procedures allowing the Commission to find that a person violated FECA provisions involving the reporting of receipts or disbursements and to impose civil monetary penalties. Entitles any person to file a petition with the appropriate US district court to obtain a review of an adverse determination under such procedures. Requires the Commission's general counsel, within 90 days after the time for responding to a filed complaint has elapsed for all respondents, to provide a recommendation to the Commission regarding whether there is sufficient reason to investigate the violation alleged in the complaint."
