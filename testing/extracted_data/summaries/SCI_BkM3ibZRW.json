    "content": "While autoencoders are a key technique in representation learning for continuous structures, such as images or wave forms, developing general-purpose autoencoders for discrete structures, such as text sequence or discretized images, has proven to be more challenging. In particular, discrete inputs make it more difficult to learn a smooth encoder that preserves the complex local relationships in the input space. In this work, we propose an adversarially regularized autoencoder (ARAE) with the goal of learning more robust discrete-space representations. ARAE jointly trains both a rich discrete-space encoder, such as an RNN, and a simpler continuous space generator function, while using generative adversarial network (GAN) training to constrain the distributions to be similar. This method yields a smoother contracted code space that maps similar inputs to nearby codes, and also an implicit latent variable GAN model for generation. Experiments on text and discretized images demonstrate that the GAN model produces clean interpolations and captures the multimodality of the original space, and that the autoencoder produces improvements in semi-supervised learning as well as state-of-the-art results in unaligned text style transfer task using only a shared continuous-space representation. Recent work on regularized autoencoders, such as variational BID15 BID29 and denoising BID37 variants, has shown significant progress in learning smooth representations of complex, high-dimensional continuous data such as images. These codespace representations facilitate the ability to apply smoother transformations in latent space in order to produce complex modifications of generated outputs, while still remaining on the data manifold.Unfortunately, learning similar latent representations of discrete structures, such as text sequences or discretized images, remains a challenging problem. Initial work on VAEs for text has shown that optimization is difficult, as the decoder can easily degenerate into a unconditional language model BID2 . Recent work on generative adversarial networks (GANs) for text has mostly focused on getting around the use of discrete structures either through policy gradient methods BID40 or with the Gumbel-Softmax distribution BID17 . However, neither approach can yet produce robust representations directly.A major difficulty of discrete autoencoders is mapping a discrete structure to a continuous code vector while also smoothly capturing the complex local relationships of the input space. Inspired by recent work combining pretrained autoencoders with deep latent variable models, we propose to target this issue with an adversarially regularized autoencoder (ARAE). Specifically we jointly train a discrete structure encoder and continuous space generator, while constraining the two models with a discriminator to agree in distribution. This approach allows us to utilize a complex encoder model, such as an RNN, and still constrain it with a very flexible, but more limited generator distribution. The full model can be then used as a smoother discrete structure autoencoder or as a latent variable GAN model where a sample can be decoded, with the same decoder, to a discrete output. Since the system produces a single continuous coded representation-in contrast to methods that act on each RNN state-it can easily be further regularized with problem-specific invariants, for instance to learn to ignore style, sentiment or other attributes for transfer tasks.Experiments apply ARAE to discretized images and sentences, and demonstrate that the key properties of the model. Using the latent variable model (ARAE-GAN), the model is able to generate varied samples that can be quantitatively shown to cover the input spaces and to generate consistent image and sentence manipulations by moving around in the latent space via interpolation and offset vector arithmetic. Using the discrete encoder, the model can be used in a semi-supervised setting to give improvement in a sentence inference task. When the ARAE model is trained with task-specific adversarial regularization, the model improves the current best results on sentiment transfer reported in BID33 and produces compelling outputs on a topic transfer task using only a single shared code space. All outputs are listed in the Appendix 9 and code is available at (removed for review). We present adversarially regularized autoencoders, as a simple approach for training a discrete structure autoencoder jointly with a code-space generative adversarial network. The model learns a improved autoencoder as demonstrated by semi-supervised experiments and improvements on text transfer experiments. It also learns a useful generative model for text that exhibits a robust latent space, as demonstrated by natural interpolations and vector arithmetic. We do note that (as has been frequently observed when training GANs) our model seemed to be quite sensitive to hyperparameters. Finally, while many useful models for text generation already exist, text GANs provide a qualitatively different approach influenced by the underlying latent variable structure. We envision that such a framework could be extended to a conditional setting, combined with other existing decoding schemes, or used to provide a more interpretable model of language."
