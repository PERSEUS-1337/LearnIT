    "content": "Child nutrition programs (e.g., school meal programs, summer food service, child care foodprograms) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (theWIC Program) are subject to periodic comprehensive reviews, when appropriations and otherauthorities expire and have to be reauthorized. They were up for reauthorization review in the 108thCongress, and the only substantial child nutrition-WIC legislation in the 108th Congress, and so farin the 109th Congress, has been the 2004 reauthorization law -- the Child Nutrition and WICReauthorization Act of 2004, P.L. 108-265 , enacted June 30, 2004. The 2004 law extended virtually all expiring authorities through FY2009 and containedimportant, but incremental, changes in child nutrition programs and the WIC program; theCongressional Budget Office estimated that it will generate net new spending totaling about $230million through FY2009. Its major feature was a set of amendments aimed at improving the integrityand administration of the school meal programs. Significant changes were made in proceduresrelating to the way children's eligibility for free and reduced-price school meals is certified andverified, and new initiatives to upgrade schools' administration of their meal programs were put inplace. However, minimal revisions were made to the school meal programs themselves -- forexample, expansion of eligibility for homeless, runaway, and migrant children, loosened rules forcertain higher school breakfast subsidies -- and a major proposal to phase in higher income eligibilitylimits for free school meals was limited to an authorization for a pilot project. Relatively minoramendments also affected the Summer Food Service and Child and Adult Care Food programs --for example, making permanent and expanding coverage of \"Lugar\" rules facilitating participationby summer program sponsors and making permanent and nationally applicable a rule looseningChild and Adult Care Food program eligibility rules for for-profit child care centers. Another area of concern addressed by the reauthorization law was nutrition, health, andnutrition education. Here, the biggest initiative was a requirement that all schools participating inschool meal programs establish locally designed \"wellness policies\" to set nutrition, physical activity,and other goals and strategies for meeting them. Coupled with it were (1) authorizations for newnutrition education efforts, (2) an expansion of the program offering free fresh fruit and vegetablesin selected schools, and (3) significant changes in food safety rules. Finally, a large number of revisions were made to the law governing the WIC program. Themost important among them were amendments aimed at strengthening rules that help contain foodcosts incurred by the program; these included provisions placing substantial limits on vendorsreceiving the majority of their revenue from WIC vouchers (so-called \"WIC-only\" stores). This report will be updated as events and legislation warrant."
