    "content": "Recent improvements to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made it possible to generate realistic images in high resolution based on natural language descriptions such as image captions. Furthermore, conditional GANs allow us to control the image generation process through labels or even natural language descriptions. However, fine-grained control of the image layout, i.e. where in the image specific objects should be located, is still difficult to achieve. This is especially true for images that should contain multiple distinct objects at different spatial locations. We introduce a new approach which allows us to control the location of arbitrarily many objects within an image by adding an object pathway to both the generator and the discriminator. Our approach does not need a detailed semantic layout but only bounding boxes and the respective labels of the desired objects are needed. The object pathway focuses solely on the individual objects and is iteratively applied at the locations specified by the bounding boxes. The global pathway focuses on the image background and the general image layout. We perform experiments on the Multi-MNIST, CLEVR, and the more complex MS-COCO data set. Our experiments show that through the use of the object pathway we can control object locations within images and can model complex scenes with multiple objects at various locations. We further show that the object pathway focuses on the individual objects and learns features relevant for these, while the global pathway focuses on global image characteristics and the image background. Understanding how to learn powerful representations from complex distributions is the intriguing goal behind adversarial training on image data. While recent advances have enabled us to generate high-resolution images with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), currently most GAN models still focus on modeling images that either contain only one centralized object (e.g. faces (CelebA), objects (ImageNet), birds (CUB-200), flowers (Oxford-102), etc. ) or on images from one specific domain (e.g. LSUN bedrooms, LSUN churches, etc.) . This means that, overall, the variance between images used for training GANs tends to be low BID14 . However, many real-life images contain multiple distinct objects at different locations within the image and with different relations to each other. This is for example visible in the MS-COCO data set BID11 , which consists of images of different objects at different locations within one image. In order to model images with these complex relationships, we need models that can model images containing multiple objects at distinct locations. To achieve this, we need control over what kind of objects are generated (e.g. persons, animals, objects, etc.), the location, and the size of these objects. This is a much more challenging task than generating a single object in the center of an image.Current work BID10 BID9 BID6 Wang et al., 2018) often approaches this challenge by using a semantic layout as additional conditional input. While this can be successful in controlling the image layout and object placement, it also places a high burden on the generating process since a complete scene layout must be obtained first. We propose a model that does not require a full semantic layout, but instead only requires the desired object locations and identities (see Figure 1 ). One part of our model, called the global pathway, is responsible for generating the general layout of the complete image, while a second path, the object pathway, is used to explicitly generate the features of different objects based on the relevant object label and location. Our experiments indicate that we do indeed get additional control over the image generation process through the introduction of object pathways in GANs. This enables us to control the identity and location of multiple objects within a given image based on bounding boxes and thereby facilitates the generation of more complex scenes. We further find that the division of work on a global and object pathway seems to improve the image quality both subjectively and based on quantitative metrics such as the Inception Score and the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance.The results further indicate that the focus on global image statistics by the global pathway and the more fine-grained attention to detail of specific objects by the object pathway works well. This is visualized for example in rows C and D of Figure 5 . The global pathway (row C) generates features for the general image layout and background but does not provide sufficient details for individual objects. The object pathway (row D), on the other hand, focuses entirely on the individual objects and generates features specifically for a given object at a given location. While this is the desired behavior Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2019 of our model it can also lead to sub-optimal images if there are not bounding boxes for objects that should be present within the image. This can often be the case if the foreground object is too small (in our case less than 2% of the total image) and is therefore not specifically labeled. In this case, the objects are sometimes not modeled in the image at all, despite being prominent in the respective image caption, since the object pathway does not generate any features. We can observe this, for example, in images described as \"many sheep are standing on the grass\", where the individual sheep are too small to warrant a bounding box. In this case, our model will often only generate an image depicting grass and other background details, while not containing any sheep at all.Another weakness is that bounding boxes that overlap too much (empirically an overlap of more than roughly 30%) also often lead to sub-optimal objects at that location. Especially in the overlapping section of bounding boxes we often observe local inconsistencies or failures. This might be the result of our merging of the different features within the object pathway since they are simply added to each other at overlapping areas. A more sophisticated merging procedure could potentially alleviate this problem.Another approach would be to additionally enhance the bounding box layout by predicting the specific object shape within each bounding box, as done for example by BID6 .Finally , currently our model does not generate the bounding boxes and labels automatically. Instead , they have to be provided at test time which somewhat limits the usability for unsupervised image generation. However , even when using ground truth bounding boxes, our models still outperform other current approaches that are tested with ground truth bounding boxes (e.g. BID6 ) based on the IS and FID. This is even without the additional need of learning to specify the shape within each bounding box as done by BID6 . In the future, this limitation can be avoided by extracting the relevant bounding boxes and labels directly from the image caption, as it is done for example by BID6 With the goal of understanding how to gain more control over the image generation process in GANs, we introduced the concept of an additional object pathway. Such a mechanism for differentiating between a scene representation and object representations allows us to control the identity, location, and size of arbitrarily many objects within an image, as long as the objects do not overlap too strongly. In parallel, a global pathway, similar to a standard GAN, focuses on the general scene layout and generates holistic image features. The object pathway, on the other hand, gets as input an object label and uses this to generate features specifically for this object which are then placed at the location given by a bounding box The object pathway is applied iteratively for each object at each given location and as such, we obtain a representation of individual objects at individual locations and of the general image layout (background, etc.) as a whole. The features generated by the object and global pathway are then concatenated and are used to generate the final image output. Our tests on synthetic and real-world data sets suggest that the object pathway is an extension that can be added to common GAN architectures without much change to the original architecture and can, along with more fine-grained control over the image layout, also lead to better image quality."
