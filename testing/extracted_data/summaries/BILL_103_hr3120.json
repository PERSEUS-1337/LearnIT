    "content": "Crime Victims' Bill of Rights Act - Amends Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to require the court, before imposing sentence, to address personally any victim of the offense for which sentence is to be imposed who is present at the sentencing hearing and to afford such individual the opportunity to make a statement and present information in relation to the sentence. Permits the court, upon request by a victim, to hear in camera such a statement by that victim. Amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to condition Federal grant eligibility of crime victim compensation programs on a State providing an effective system of notice to eligible victims of the existence of compensation and other programs to assist victims of crime. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to: (1) authorize drug control and system improvement grants to States to be used for programs that allow for the physical and visual separation of a victim of crime from an alleged perpetrator of such crime while waiting in a judicial facility for a courtroom appearance. And (2) provide for a reduction of formula grants by 25 percent for States which fail to notify a crime victim of specified rights. Directs the Attorney General to assure that Federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials: (1) provide an effective system of notice to crime victims of the existence of compensation and other programs to assist victims who might be eligible to participate. (2) notify crime victims of the availability of, and provide such victims the opportunity for, visual and physical separation from alleged crime perpetrators while waiting in a judicial facility for a courtroom appearance. And (3) provide a crime victim with the earliest possible notice of the scheduling of each court proceeding or parole hearing that the witness is required or entitled to attend."
