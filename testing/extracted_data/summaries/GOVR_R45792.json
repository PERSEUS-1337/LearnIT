    "content": "When the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves a drug for sale in the United States, the approval includes a section entitled \"Indications for Use.\" This section lists the one or more diseases, conditions, or symptoms for which the drug's sponsor (usually the manufacturer) has provided, to FDA's satisfaction, evidence in support of the drug's safety and effectiveness. FDA approval is also based on its review of the drug's dosage, packaging, manufacturing plan, and labeling. Before changing any of those elements, the sponsor must inform, and usually receive permission from, FDA. In essence, FDA regulates all approval and post-approval aspects of a drug product. But FDA traditionally has not regulated the practice of medicine. Physicians, therefore, may prescribe an FDA-approved drug for indications that FDA has not reviewed for safety and effectiveness. Those uses, furthermore, are not addressed in the labeling information regarding, among other things, dosing, warnings about interactions with other drugs, and possible adverse events. How Are Off-Label Prescription Drugs Used? Prescribing for so-called off-label uses can be accepted medical practice, often reflecting cutting-edge clinical expertise. For example, this is the case with oncology drug use, more than half of which is off-label. Off-label prescribing can be a reasonable choice when labeling overlooks certain populations\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, when a drug tested in adults is prescribed to children. A drug may be used off-label when it was tested for the treatment of one disease and prescribed in an attempt to prevent or treat another, when it was tested at one dose and used at higher or lower doses, or when it was tested in an eight-week trial and prescribed for long-term use. Estimates for how common off-label prescriptions are in the United States are hardly precise. Credible researchers have estimated they make up as little as 12% and as much as 38% of doctor-office prescriptions. What Are the Risks of Off-Label Prescriptions? Prescriptions for off-label uses of FDA-approved drugs are made without the benefit of an FDA-reviewed analysis of safety and effectiveness data. Physicians may resort to such prescribing to take advantage of new ideas and treatment approaches when available information to support them is inadequate. However, despite the potential risks associated with off-label uses, efforts to prohibit such uses might hurt the public. Some off-label prescribing may result because manufacturers have chosen not to invest the resources needed to have FDA add indications to the drug's approval and labeling. A worst-case scenario for the nation's health would be the widespread acceptance of a drug for an off-label use that sufficient research would have revealed to be ineffective, unsafe, or both. Aside from the drug's direct harm, the time spent waiting to see whether it worked would have been time not spent exploring other treatment options. Unchecked off-label prescribing may also threaten the FDA gold standard of drug approval. If clinicians had already accepted a new use into practice through off-label prescribing, a manufacturer may choose to not invest resources to go through clinical trials and the FDA process to win approval. Although manufacturers do share information on off-label uses, courts have sometimes found they had overstepped allowable bounds. Congress has given permission for limited sharing. Are there other ways to share clinical information that do not put the public's health or FDA's authority at risk? What Role Can Congress Play in the Use of Off-Label Prescriptions? How might Congress, in its legislative or oversight roles, consider the use of off-label drugs to protect the public's health? Legislators and health analysts have suggested both restrictive and permissive actions regarding off-label use. Ideas\u00e2\u0080\u0094some of which conflict with others\u00e2\u0080\u0094include disclosure to patients; data collection, availability, and analysis; dissemination of clinical data; linking reimbursement and coverage to evidence of safety and effectiveness; clinical research and research transparency; clinical guidance; congressional oversight through the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Department of Health and Human Services; and consideration of other countries' approaches to off-label use. Some actions would require federal legislation. Other proposals would involve actions by other entities, such as state authorities and professional organizations, which Congress could urge."
