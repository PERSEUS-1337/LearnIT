    "content": "Food and Drug Administration (FDA) funding for the first five months of FY2009 is provided in the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2009 (the CR), which is Division A of the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 110-329). It allows most agencies to continue at the same rate of spending as set by the FY2008 appropriations. For FDA, the base includes the mid-year FY2008 supplemental. The CR carries through March 6, 2009. If Congress chooses to continue at that rate for the remainder of FY2009, FDA would receive $2.42 billion, 10.6% ($256 million) less than the Administration's FY2009 amended budget request of $2.676 billion. The Administration FY2009 request (as amended), according to budget documents, would provide for expanded activities to ensure the safety of foods and drugs, enhance workforce development and recruitment, and accelerate the availability of new medical products. The request included $609 million in currently authorized user fees (including $14 million for the advisory review of direct-to-consumer [DTC] television prescription drug advertising) and $21 million in proposed user fees for the review of generic human and animal drugs. It described another $27 million in proposed fees for reinspections and food and animal feed certification, but did not include them in the budget request totals. The Senate Committee on Appropriations, in S. 3289, recommended an FY2009 total of $2.646 billion for FDA. It did not include the requested user fees for generic drug review, reinspection and certification, or DTC advertising review. The full Senate did not consider S. 3289. There was no FY2009 agriculture appropriations action in the House committee. Updates to this report will track legislative activity as the fiscal year continues."
