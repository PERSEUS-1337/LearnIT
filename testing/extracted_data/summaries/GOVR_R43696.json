But the trend of recent years\u2014increasing export sales and a wider agricultural trade surplus\u2014was reversed in FY2015, and the reversal is expected to be more pronounced in FY2016. After climbing to a record $152.3 billion in FY2014, U.S. farm exports declined to $139.7 billion in FY2015, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) projects a further reduction to $125 billion in FY2016. Meanwhile, the value of U.S. agricultural imports has continued to climb: In consequence, the U.S. agricultural trade surplus fell to $25.7 billion in FY2015 from a peak of $43.1 billion in FY2014, and it is projected to narrow further to $6.5 billion in FY2016. Exports are a major outlet for many farm commodities, representing about 20% of the value of farm production, making exports an important contributor to farm income. Among the key variables affecting the value of U.S. agricultural exports are commodity prices, the value of the U.S. dollar vis-a-vis currencies of trading partners, and the pace of economic growth\u2014particularly in developing and emerging countries. According to USDA, factors contributing to a continued downturn in U.S. farm exports in FY2016 include low commodity prices, a strong U.S. dollar, relatively weak importer demand, and strong foreign competition. The United States operates a number of programs aimed at developing overseas markets for U.S. agricultural products and facilitating exports. The Agricultural Act of 2014, P.L. 113-79, extended most programs from FY2014 through FY2018. The trade title (Title III) of the 2014 farm bill authorized, amended, and repealed three main types of agricultural export programs: 1. Export market development programs. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) of USDA administers five market development programs that aim to assist U.S. industry efforts to build, maintain, and expand overseas markets for U.S. agricultural products. The five are the Market Access Program (MAP), the Foreign Market Development Program (FMDP), the Emerging Markets Program (EMP), the Quality Samples Program (QSP), and the Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops Program (TASC). 2. Export credit guarantee programs. Through the GSM-102 Program and the Facility Guarantee Program, USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) guarantees loans so that private U.S. financial institutions will extend financing to buyers in emerging markets that want to purchase U.S. agricultural products. The 2014 farm bill shortened the loan term on which export credit guarantees would be made available to conform to U.S. commitments in the World Trade Organization (WTO). 3. Direct export subsidy programs. The 2014 farm bill terminated the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP), which had been inactive for several years. The 2014 farm bill also directed the Secretary of Agriculture to reorganize USDA's export and import activities and create a new Under Secretary of Agriculture position to oversee trade-related sanitary and phytosanitary issues affecting agriculture, as well as non-tariff trade barriers. In view of the more challenging market environment for U.S. farm exports, Congress could weigh possible opportunities to expand foreign markets and remove impediments to farm exports. For example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP), if implemented, would lower many tariffs that Japan and other TPP nations impose on U.S. farm and food exports. Also, numerous U.S. agricultural interests assert that U.S. farm exports to Cuba could increase if Congress were to repeal statutory restrictions on this trade. In addition, U.S. farm groups and lawmakers have identified foreign subsidies as distorting trade and displacing U.S. farm exports. Another possible issue for Congress involves overseeing plans to reorganize USDA's trade functions."
