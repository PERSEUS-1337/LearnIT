    "content": "Multiethnic Placement Act of 1993 - Prohibits an agency or entity that receives Federal assistance and is involved in adoptive or foster care placements from categorically denying to any person the opportunity to become an adoptive or a foster parent, or delaying or denying the placement of a child, solely on the basis of race, color, or national origin of the adoptive or foster parent or parents, or the child, involved. Permits consideration of the child's race, color, or national origin when such factors are: (1) considered in conjunction with other factors. And (2) relevant to the child's best interest. Withholds specified adoption assistance funds from such an agency or entity in cases of noncompliance. Grants any individual aggrieved by a noncomplying agency or entity the right to bring an action in the appropriate US District Court. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the application of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978."
