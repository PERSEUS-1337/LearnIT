    "content": "At-Birth Abandoned Baby Act of 1993 - Amends part E of title IV of the Social Security Act to require States to place babies abandoned at birth with preadoptive parents within 30 days of obtaining custody of such babies, and to find new preadoptive parents for such babies if the initial preadoptive parents do not petition the courts of the State within 90 days of receiving them for an expedited hearing to become their permanent adoptive parents. Treats such babies as children with special needs, thus qualifying their adoptive parents for adoption assistance."
