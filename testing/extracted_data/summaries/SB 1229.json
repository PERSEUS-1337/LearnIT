    "title": "An act to add Section 1714.24 to the Civil Code, relating to pharmaceutical waste.",
    "content": "Under existing law, the Medical Waste Management Act, the State Department of Public Health regulates the management and handling of medical waste, including pharmaceutical waste, as defined. The act generally prohibits a person from transporting, storing, treating, disposing, or causing the treatment of medical waste in a manner not authorized by the act. A violation of that provision is a crime. Under existing law, everyone is generally responsible, not only for the result of his or her willful acts, but also for an injury occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his or her property or person, except so far as the latter, has willfully or by want of ordinary care, brought the injury upon himself or herself. This bill would provide that a collector, as defined, is not liable for civil damages, or subject to criminal prosecution, for any injury or harm that results from the collector maintaining a secure drug take-back bin on its premises provided that the collector, not for compensation, acts in good faith to take specified steps, including that the collector regularly inspects the area surrounding the secure drug take-back bin for potential tampering or diversion, to ensure the health and safety of consumers and employees and the proper disposal in the waste stream of home-generated pharmaceutical waste, as defined, contained in the bins."
