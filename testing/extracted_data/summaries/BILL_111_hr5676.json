(2) increase the per incident limit on expenditures from the Fund from $1 billion to $10 billion for cleanup of oil spills and from $500 million to $5 billion for natural resource damage assessments and claims. And (3) increase and make permanent the Fund financing rate. Applies the Jones Act to individuals employed on an offshore facility and authorizes such an individual or a seaman injured in the course of employment, or such person's surviving spouse, parent, child, sibling, or dependent relative, to bring an action against the employer or any person whose act or omission was a cause of the injury or death. Amend the Deaths on the High Seas Act to revise provisions concerning civil actions to allow for recovery by the decedent's surviving spouse, parent, child, sibling, or dependent relative of: (1) punitive damages in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, (2) nonpecuniary damages.

And (2) be vetted by impartial experts. Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to: (1) prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from issuing any license or permit authorizing drilling for oil and gas on the outer Continental Shelf unless the applicant has such a response plan approved for the vessel or facility that will conduct such drilling.

Requires the President to: (1) establish an emergency oil spill coordination team. (2) appoint a research and development team to review and recommend new technologies that prevent oil spills, especially deep water drilling oil spills. And (3) issue regulations that establish limitations on liability under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 that are substantially similar to the limitations established by the Price-Anderson Act. Requires: (1) the oil industry to establish a $1 billion research and development fund to develop the latest technologies related to oil spill recovery, remediation, and cleanup. (2) the DHS Secretary to make extensive post-traumatic stress disorder counseling available to victims of significant oil spill disasters.
