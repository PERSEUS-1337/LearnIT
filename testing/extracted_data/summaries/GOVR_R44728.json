    "content": "State Approving Agencies (SAAs) play an important role in the administration of GI Bill\u00ae benefits. GI Bill benefits provide educational assistance payments to eligible veterans and servicemembers and their families enrolled in approved programs of education. The SAA role is intended to ensure that veterans and other GI Bill participants have access to a range of high-quality education and training programs at which to use their GI Bill benefits. In FY2017, the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) is estimated to distribute over $14 billion in GI Bill benefits to over 1 million eligible participants. Statutory provisions provide for the establishment of SAAs and describe their role in administering GI Bill benefits. Each state is \"requested\" to create or designate a state department or agency as its SAA. The VA contracts (or enters into agreement) with each SAA annually to provide approval, oversight, training, and outreach activities by qualified personnel as specified in the contract to ensure the quality of programs of education and proper administration of GI Bill benefits. The VA oversees the processes for approving and reviewing approved programs of education, educating the entities and individuals involved in GI Bill claims processing, and increasing awareness among potential GI Bill participants. The VA and any other federal entity or individual is prohibited from exercising any supervision or control over SAAs except as specifically provided in statutory provisions. For example, 38 U.S.C. \u00a73674 requires the VA take into consideration an annual evaluation of each SAA's performance on its contractual standards when negotiating a new contract. One of the key SAA roles is to initially approve programs of education for GI Bill purposes. Each sponsoring facility (e.g., educational institutions and training establishments) must submit an application to its SAA. Approval is intended to ensure that each program of education and sponsoring facility meets all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, including proper benefit administration and program of education quality. The approval process and requirements vary depending on the program's educational objective (e.g., non-college degree or flight training) and existing government oversight. For example, some programs that are approved by other government programs or processes are \"deemed approved\" and require a less in-depth review. The remaining programs undergo more comprehensive approval processes that may include the SAA reviewing institutional policies, staff qualifications, and academic curriculum. The SAA may conduct a site visit. Once the SAA completes the initial approval review in accordance with the approval standards, the SAA issues an approval or disapproval letter to the facility. The VA maintains the compiled list of all approved programs of education. Another key SAA role is to conduct compliance surveys. Compliance surveys are designed to ensure that the facility and approved programs are in compliance with all applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy provisions and the facility understands the provisions. Statutory provisions establish the number of institutions requiring annual compliance surveys. The VA conducts compliance surveys but also assigns some of the required compliance surveys to SAAs. During the onsite compliance survey visit, the SAA reviews student files to verify that GI Bill payments have been made properly, conducts student interviews, verifies institutional operations, and reviews additional documents and areas as outlined on the compliance survey checklist. Discrepancies uncovered during the compliance survey may be resolved immediately, may result in the creation of a GI Bill debt or payment, or may result in the suspension or disapproval of a program of education. The SAA may suspend a program of education from new enrollments for up to 60 days while the SAA provides assistance to help the facility resolve the issue. The SAA may disapprove the program of education such that no GI Bill payments may be made based on an individual's pursuit of the program of education."
