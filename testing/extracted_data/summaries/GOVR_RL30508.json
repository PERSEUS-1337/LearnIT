    "content": "President Clinton signed the FY2001 Department of Transportation (DOT) Appropriations Act ( P.L. 106-346 ; H.Rept. 106-940 ) on October 23, 2000. The agreement provides $57.978 billion forDOT. This is an increase of more than 14% over the enacted FY2000 level. The Act providesincreases for all major DOT agencies except the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). OnDecember 21, 2000, President Clinton signed the FY2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L.106-554 ). The Act provided for a government-wide rescission of 0.22%. This cut $125 million fromthe DOT budget for FY2001. Both houses of Congress had passed somewhat different versions of the FY2001 appropriations bill ( H.R. 4475 ). The House of Representatives version would have provided totalbudgetary resources of $55.2 billion; the Senate version $54.7 billion. The roughly $500 milliondifference was partly an outgrowth of the lower budget cap that Senators had to work with. For theoverall DOT budget, the Senate bill would have represented a 9.5% increase over the FY2000budget; the House bill a nearly 10.5% increase. The FY2001 Act reflects the ongoing impact of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21). It raises highway funding by 16% and mass transit funding by almost 8.5%.These spending levels meet or exceed TEA-21's requirements. The Administration had proposedincreases of 5% for highways and roughly 9% for transit. The enacted version of H.R. 4475 appropriates additional funds not included in either the House or Senate-passed versions, such as: $1.37 billion for miscellaneous highwayprojects, $600 million for the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge, roughly $55 million for theAppalachian development highway system; and $720 million for the Emergency Relief Federal AidHighway Program. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (FAIR21) ( P.L. 106-181 )has also had a major impact on the FAA's funding for FY2001. H.R. 4475 ,in conformance with FAIR21, provides for an increase in the FAA's total budget of roughly 25%. The FY2001 Act includes language to strengthen state drunk driver blood alcohol standards to 0.08% but phases in the highway funds reduction penalties more gradually than in the Senate passedbill -- at a rate of 2% annually beginning in FY2004 up to a maximum of 8%. It also permits theFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to collect and analyze public comments anddata on its proposed hours of service rules but prohibits FMCSA from taking final action duringFY2001.
