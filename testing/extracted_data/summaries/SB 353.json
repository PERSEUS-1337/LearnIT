    "title": "An act to add Chapter 6.4 (commencing with Section 30030) to Division 3 of Title 3 of the Government Code, relating to criminal justice realignment, and making an appropriation therefor.",
    "content": "Existing law, the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety and related statutes, requires that certain specified felonies be punished by a term of imprisonment in a county jail for 16 months, or 2 or 3 years, and provides for postrelease community supervision by county officials for persons convicted of certain specified felonies upon release from prison or county jail. As part of the realignment of public safety services to local agencies, existing law establishes the Local Revenue Fund 2011 into which specified tax revenues are deposited and are continuously appropriated for the provision of public safety services, as defined. This bill, the 2015 Realignment Legislation addressing justice reinvestment, would establish the Realignment Reinvestment Fund in the State Treasury as a continuously appropriated fund. The bill would require the Director of Finance, in consultation with the Legislative Analyst, to annually calculate the net savings to the state for the prior fiscal year and an estimate of the net current fiscal year savings resulting from the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety, as specified. The bill would require the Controller to transfer $1,543,783,000 from the General Fund to the Realignment Reinvestment Fund for the 2015\u201316 fiscal year, thereby making an appropriation. The bill would, beginning in the 2016\u201317 fiscal year, and each fiscal year thereafter, require the Controller to transfer an amount equal to the estimate of net current fiscal year savings resulting from the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety, adjusted by the difference between the preceding year\u2019s estimate and the calculated prior fiscal year net savings, thereby making an appropriation. The bill would require the Controller to annually allocate moneys in the Realignment Reinvestment Fund, no later than September 1 of each year, to each county for deposit in the county\u2019s Realignment Reinvestment Services Account proportionally, based on the average daily population of realigned offenders under each county\u2019s supervision for the preceding fiscal year. The bill would require the Controller to consult with the Board of State and Community Corrections to determine the average daily population for each county. The bill would require a Realignment Reinvestment Services Account to be established in each county treasury. The bill would require the moneys to implement a comprehensive, locally run, supplemental community-based corrections plan, as specified. The bill would require the supplemental community-based corrections plan to be developed by each county\u2019s local Community Corrections Partnership and to be voted on by an executive committee of each county\u2019s Community Corrections Partnership, as specified. The bill would deem the supplemental community-based corrections plan accepted by the county board of supervisors unless the board rejects the plan by a 45 vote. The bill would require each county or city and county to annually report to the county board of supervisors and the Board of State and Community Corrections on the programs funded pursuant to these provisions, as specified. By imposing additional duties on local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the Director of Finance, in consultation with the Legislative Analyst, to develop a yearly estimate of the cost avoidances expected to be realized by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation that are a result of the 2011 Realignment Legislation, and would require the director to report those estimates to the Legislature, as provided. The bill would require that moneys allocated from a Realignment Reinvestment Services Account be expended exclusively for purposes of the bill\u2019s provisions. The bill would require that funds received pursuant to its provisions be expended or encumbered no later than June 30 the following year, and would require unspent moneys to be remitted for deposit in the Realignment Reinvestment Fund. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
