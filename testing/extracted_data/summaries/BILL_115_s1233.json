    "content": "Rail Shipper Fairness Act of 2017 This bill amends federal transportation law to: (1) require rail transportation service to be efficient and reliable based on a shipper's reasonable service requirements, and (2) expand enumerated US transportation policies to provide for and promote the protection of the shipping public. The Surface Transportation Board (STB) may: issue emergency service orders that include rail carrier shipments moving under contract if such shipments are part of a regional service order. And require reports, service plans, or other documents that cover shipments moving under contract. Rail carriers shall be liable for damages or equitable relief as a result of inadequate or deficient service. Civil penalties for rail carriers who violate certain federal requirements are increased from $5,000 to $25,000 per violation. The bill allows shippers to obtain rates to or from any interchange points within 100 miles of two or more rail carriers . The STB shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding to develop a market-based revenue methodology for determining the reasonableness of challenged rail rates. A rail carrier must compute fuel surcharges in accordance with changes in actual fuel prices, rather than using an index. The STB must: (1) suspend collection of rate increases in stand-alone cost cases while a rate case is pending, and (2) replace its revenue adequacy test for rail carriers with a formula for calculating a carrier's cost of capital."
