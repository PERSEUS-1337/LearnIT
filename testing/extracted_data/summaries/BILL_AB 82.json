    "title": "AB 82",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the practices and procedures for the issuance of an original or a renewal of a driver\u2019s license. The federal Military Selective Service Act requires specified persons to register with the federal Selective Service System. This bill would permit a person who is required to register under the federal act to consent to registration with the federal Selective Service System by affirming his consent to that registration at a specified location on his application for a driver\u2019s license. The bill would require the Department of Motor Vehicles to include specified notices on an application for an original driver\u2019s license and would require the department, at least monthly, to forward the necessary personal information required for registration to the federal Selective Service System in an electronic format. This bill would require the Department of Motor Vehicles to implement the provisions of this bill by a certain date only if federal funding in an amount sufficient to pay for implementation and first-year operating costs has been provided and the federal Selective Service System executes a memorandum of understanding with the department, as specified."
