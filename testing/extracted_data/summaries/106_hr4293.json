    "content": "Requires: (1) the Attorney General to notify nursing facilities of the requirements of this Act. (2) each nursing facility to require each applicant for employment to make a statement in writing containing the applicant's name, address, and date of birth appearing on a valid identification document, a description of the identification document used, the applicant's Social Security number, and a statement that such applicant has never been convicted of a crime of violence or a crime involving illegal activity relating to controlled substances. (3) the nursing facility to transmit each applicant statement to the Attorney General. And (4) the Attorney General to determine whether the applicant has ever been convicted of such a crime and, if so, to inform the nursing facility that the applicant did not pass the background check. Specifies that if after a specified period the nursing facility has not been informed by the Attorney General that the applicant has been so convicted, the applicant shall be deemed to have passed the background check. Provides that: (1) in no case shall the nursing facility or the applicant be charged a fee in connection with the background check process. And (2) it is a complete defense to any cause of action against a nursing facility based on a failure or refusal to hire the applicant that the applicant did not pass the check. Amends title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid) and title XVIII of such Act (Medicare) to require a nursing facility administrator to meet the requirements of this Act. Requires the Attorney General to study and report to Congress on the effects of background checks in nursing home settings."
