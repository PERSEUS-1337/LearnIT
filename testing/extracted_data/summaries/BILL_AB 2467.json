    "title": "AB 2467",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of health facilities, including general acute care hospitals, by the State Department of Public Health. This bill would require covered hospitals and medical entities, as defined, to annually submit to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development an executive compensation report for every executive whose annual compensation exceeds a specified threshold. The bill would also require each covered hospital or medical entity with 100 or more employees to annually report compensation information by employee classification and by gender, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, and gender identity, as self-reported by its employees. The bill would require specified information to be included in these reports, and would require that certain reports be attested to under penalty of perjury. Because a violation thereof would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would authorize the office to impose a reasonable fee to cover the costs of implementation and administration of these provisions. The bill would require the office to post these reports on its Internet Web site. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
