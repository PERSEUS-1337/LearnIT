    "content": "Preventing Our Federal Building Workers and Visitors From Exposure to Deadly Smoke (PRO-FEDS) Act of 1993 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue guidelines for enforcing a nonsmoking policy at Federal agencies. Requires such policy, at a minimum, to prohibit smoking in each portion of a Federal building that is not ventilated separately. Directs the heads of Federal agencies, the Director of the Administrative Office of US Courts, and specified entities of the legislative branch to adopt such a nonsmoking policy. Authorizes agencies to petition for a waiver from the general requirements if extenuating circumstances prevent enforcement and such agencies make a good-faith effort to enforce an alternative policy that will protect individuals from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Requires Federal agencies in which a labor organization has been accorded bargaining unit recognition to engage in collective bargaining to ensure implementation of requirements that affect work areas predominantly occupied by the organization's members. Exempts such work areas from the nonsmoking policy if the bargaining unit and the Federal agency have a collective bargaining agreement that includes provisions relating to smoking privileges that are in violation of this Act's requirements. Terminates such exemption on the earlier of the first expiration date of the agreement or one year after the date of issuance of the guidelines. Directs the Administrator and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide technical assistance to Federal agencies and other persons who request it. Requires the Administrator to: (1) establish an outreach program informing the public of the dangers of environmental tobacco smoke. (2) establish an Environmental Tobacco Smoke Advisory Office within the EPA Office of Radiation and Indoor Air. And (3) report to the Congress on compliance with this Act and an assessment of the legal status of smoking in public places."
