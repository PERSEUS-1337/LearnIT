    "content": "Agricultural exports contribute to the prosperity of the U.S. agricultural economy. Their value is projected at $57 billion for FY2003, and they are expected to grow over the long term. Theseexports are the equivalent of about a quarter of the gross income of U.S. farmers and generate bothfarm and nonfarm employment. U.S. agricultural imports, expected to reach $43 billion in FY2003,are fostered by low average U.S. tariffs, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, and consumer tastesand preferences for high value food products, the largest component of imports. A large share ofagricultural imports compete against U.S. products, but they also generate economic activity in theU.S. economy. Although many world economic and other factors influence exports, many farm groups believe that U.S. agriculture's future prosperity also depends on such U.S. trade policies as 1) negotiatingimproved market access for U.S. products bilaterally, regionally, and multilaterally; 2) assuringmarket access and consumer acceptance at home and abroad for products of agriculturalbiotechnology; 3) assuring that China adheres to its World Trade Organization (WTO) agriculturalmarket access commitments; and 4) resolving contentious commodity trade disputes. Some farmgroups, mainly producers of import-sensitive commodities, question opening U.S. markets to foreigncompetition. Agricultural trade issues that are being or could be considered during the 108th Congressinclude: Free trade agreements (FTAs) with Chile and Singapore, which Congress will take up accordingto expedited or fast track procedures in the Trade Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-210 ). The 2002 Trade Actalso requires congressional-executive branch consultation on trade negotiations, which currentlyinclude negotiation of FTAs with 12 other countries or regional groups, negotiations with 34western hemisphere countries for the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), and multilateraltrade negotiations in the WTO. Biotechnology regulations in other countries, especially in the EU, which will affect U.S. commodity exports. China's implementation of its WTO market opening commitments for agriculture , which has been slow and uncertain, and has failed to meet expectations of U.S. agricultural exporters. Country-of-origin labeling for meats, fresh produce, seafood and peanuts, established by the 2002farm bill, but whose implementation has raised questions about benefits versus compliance costs. Other trade issues of interest to the 108th Congress include commodity trade disputes overcotton, wheat, meat and poultry, and sweeteners; the scope of restrictions that should apply to agricultural sales to Cuba ; and funding for U.S. agricultural export and food aidprograms.
