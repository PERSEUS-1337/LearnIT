    "content": "Multi-relational graph embedding which aims at achieving effective representations with reduced low-dimensional parameters, has been widely used in knowledge base completion. Although knowledge base data usually contains tree-like or cyclic structure, none of existing approaches can embed these data into a compatible space that in line with the structure. To overcome this problem, a novel framework, called Riemannian TransE, is proposed in this paper to embed the entities in a Riemannian manifold. Riemannian TransE models each relation as a move to a point and defines specific novel distance dissimilarity for each relation, so that all the relations are naturally embedded in correspondence to the structure of data. Experiments on several knowledge base completion tasks have shown that, based on an appropriate choice of manifold, Riemannian TransE achieves good performance even with a significantly reduced parameters. 1.1 BACKGROUND Multi-relational graphs, such as social networks and knowledge bases, have a variety of applications, and embedding methods for these graphs are particularly important for these applications. For instance, multi-relational graph embedding has been applied to social network analysis (KrohnGrimberghe et al., 2012) and knowledge base completion BID2 . A multi-relational graph consists of entities V, a set R of relation types, and a collection of real data triples, where each triple (h, r, t) \u2208 V \u00d7 R \u00d7 V represents some relation r \u2208 R between a head entity h \u2208 V and a tail entity t \u2208 V. Embedding a multi-relational graph refers to a map from the entity and the relation set to some space. Mathematical operations in this space enable many tasks, including clustering of entities and completion, prediction, or denoising of triples. Indeed, completion tasks for knowledge bases attract considerable attention, because knowledge bases are known to be far from complete, as discussed in (West et al., 2014) BID13 . Multi-relational graph embedding can help its completion and improve the performance of applications that use the graph. This is the reason why much work focuses on multi-relational graph embedding. FIG0 shows an example of a multi-relational graph and a completion task.In multi-relational graph embedding, reducing the number of parameters is an important problem in the era of big data. Many parameters are needed with tensor-factorization-based methods, such as Bayesian clustered tensor factorization (BCTF) (Sutskever et al., 2009) , RESCAL (Nickel et al., 2011) , and a neural tensor network (NTN) (Socher et al., 2013) , where each relation has a dense matrix or tensors (O D 2 or more parameters, where D is dimensionality of the space). Thus, TransE BID2 was proposed to reduce the number of parameters, to overcome this problem. In TransE, each entity is mapped to a point in Euclidean space and each relation is no more than a vector addition (O (D) parameters), rather than a matrix operation. The successors to TransE, TransH (Wang et al., 2014) and TransD BID11 , also use only a small number of parameters. Some methods succeeded in reducing parameters using diagonal matrices instead of dense matrices: e.g. DISTMULT (Yang et al., 2015) , ComplEx (Trouillon et al., 2016) , HolE (through the Fourier transform) (Nickel et al., 2016) , and ANALOGY BID15 . In these methods, all relations share one space for embedding, but each relation uses its own dissimilarity criterion. The success of these methods implies that one common space underlies whole data, and each relation can be regarded as a dissimilarity criterion in the space.Whereas these methods use distances or inner products in Euclidean space as dissimilarity criteria, recent work has shown that using non-Euclidean space can further reduce the number of parameters. One typical example of this is Poincar\u00e9 Embedding (Nickel & Kiela, 2017) for hierarchical data, where a hyperbolic space is used as a space for embedding. Here, the tree structure of hierarchical data has good compatibility with the exponential growth of hyperbolic space. Recall the circumference with radius R is given by 2\u03c0 sinh R(\u2248 2\u03c0 exp R) in a hyperbolic plane. As a result, Poincar\u00e9 embedding achieved good graph completion accuracy, even in low dimensionality such as 5 or 10. On the other hand, spheres (circumference: 2\u03c0 sin R) are compatible with cyclic structures. Since Poincar\u00e9 embedding, several methods have been proposed for single-relational graph embedding in non-Euclidean space (e.g. BID8 , (Nickel & Kiela, 2018) ) and shown good results. The success of these methods suggests that the appropriate choice of a manifold (i.e., space) can retain low dimensionality, although these methods are limited to single-relational graph embedding.According to the success of the TransE and its derivation and Poincar\u00e9 embedding, it is reasonable in multi-relational graph embedding to assume the existence of a single structure compatible with a non-Euclidean manifold. For example, we can consider a single tree-like structure, which contains multiple hierarchical structures, where root selection gives multiple hierarchical structures from a single tree, which is compatible with hyperbolic spaces (See Figure 2) . Therefore, embedding in a single shared non-Euclidean manifold with multiple dissimilarity criteria used in TransE is promising. Taking Poincar\u00e9 embedding's success with low dimensionality into consideration, this method should work well (e.g., in graph completion tasks) with small number of parameters. This is the main idea of this paper. There are five entities and two kinds of relation (hypernym and synonym). Graph completion refers to answering questions such as \"is mammal a hypernym of cannis?\"Figure 2: Multiple hierarchical relations in a single tree. As this example shows, it is possible that multiple relations are given by multiple dissimilarity criteria in a single structure. We proposed Riemannian TransE, a novel framework for multi-relational graph embedding, by extending TransE to a Riemannian TransE. Numerical experiments showed that Riemannian TransE outperforms baseline methods in low dimensionality, although its performance depends significantly on the choice of manifold. Hence, future research shall clarify which manifolds work well with particular kinds of data, and develop a methodology for choosing the appropriate manifold. This is important work not only for graph completion tasks but also for furthering our understanding of the global characteristics of a graph. In other words, observing which manifold is effective can help us to understand the global \"behavior\" of a graph. Other important work involves using \"subspaces\" in non-Euclidean space. Although the notion of a subspace in a non-Euclidean manifold is nontrivial, it may be that our method offers advantages over TransH and TransD, which exploit linear subspaces."
