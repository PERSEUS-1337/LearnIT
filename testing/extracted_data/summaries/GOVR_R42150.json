    "content": "Although \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) has been a long-standing policy issue, it was highlighted by the financial crisis, when the government intervened to prevent the near-collapse of several large financial firms in 2008. Financial firms are said to be TBTF when policymakers judge that their failure would cause unacceptable disruptions to the overall financial system. They can be TBTF because of their size or interconnectedness. In addition to fairness issues, economic theory suggests that expectations that a firm will not be allowed to fail create moral hazard\u2014if the creditors and counterparties of a TBTF firm believe that the government will protect them from losses, they have less incentive to monitor the firm's riskiness because they are shielded from the negative consequences of those risks. If so, TBTF firms could have a funding advantage compared with other banks, which some call an implicit subsidy. There are a number of policy approaches\u2014some complementary, some conflicting\u2014to coping with the TBTF problem, including providing government assistance to prevent TBTF firms from failing or systemic risk from spreading; enforcing \"market discipline\" to ensure that investors, creditors, and counterparties curb excessive risk-taking at TBTF firms; enhancing regulation to hold TBTF firms to stricter prudential standards than other financial firms; curbing firms' size and scope, by preventing mergers or compelling firms to divest assets, for example; minimizing spillover effects by limiting counterparty exposure; and instituting a special resolution regime for failing systemically important firms. A comprehensive policy is likely to incorporate more than one approach, as some approaches are aimed at preventing failures and some at containing fallout when a failure occurs. Parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111-203) address each of these policy approaches. For example, it created an enhanced prudential regulatory regime administered by the Federal Reserve for non-bank financial firms designated as \"systemically important\" (SIFIs) by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and banks with more than $50 billion in assets. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 115-174) raised this threshold to $250 billion in assets, but gave the Federal Reserve discretion to apply individual provisions as needed to banks between $100 billion and $250 billion in assets. Thirteen U.S. bank holding companies and a larger number of foreign banks have more than $250 billion in assets, and FSOC designated three insurers (AIG, MetLife, and Prudential Financial) and GE Capital as systemically important. MetLife's designation was subsequently rescinded by a court decision, and AIG's and GE Capital's designations were rescinded by FSOC. A handful of the largest banks face additional capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements stemming from Basel III, an international agreement. The Dodd-Frank Act also allowed FSOC to designate payment, clearing, and settlement systems as systemically important \"financial market utilities\" (FMUs) that are subject to enhanced prudential regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the \"orderly liquidation authority\" (OLA), a special resolution regime administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to take into receivership failing firms that pose a threat to financial stability. This regime has not been used to date, and has some similarities to how the FDIC resolves failing banks. Statutory authority used to prevent financial firms from failing during the crisis has either expired or been narrowed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The fact that most large firms have grown in dollar terms since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act has led some critics to question whether the TBTF problem has been solved and propose more far-reaching solutions, such as repealing parts of the Dodd-Frank Act, breaking up the largest banks, or restoring Glass-Steagall. Others argue that systemic risk regulation should focus on risky financial activities, regardless of firm size. (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain in government conservatorship and have not been addressed by legislation to date.)"
