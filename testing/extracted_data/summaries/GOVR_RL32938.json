    "content": "There are more than 9,000 local election jurisdictions in the United States. Local electionofficials (LEOs) are responsible for administering elections in those jurisdictions. LEOs aretherefore critical to the successful implementation of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA, P.L. 107-252 ) and state election laws, but there has been little objective information on theperceptions and attitudes of those officials about election reform. This report, which will not beupdated, discusses the results of a recent scientific survey of LEOs. The findings may be useful toCongress in considering funding and possible reauthorization of HAVA. The demographic characteristics of LEOs are unusual for a group of government officials. Almost three-quarters are women, and 5% belong to minority groups. Most do not have a collegedegree, and most were elected to their positions. Some survey results suggest areas of potentialprofessional improvement, such as in education and in professional involvement at the national level. Over the past 20 years, jurisdictions have turned increasingly to computer-assisted votingsystems -- especially optical scan and direct recording electronic (DRE) systems. The mostimportant factors reported by LEOs in the acquisition of new systems are federal and staterequirements and funding. HAVA encourages but does not require systems that detect voter error,but it does require that voting machines be available that are fully accessible to persons withdisabilities. About half of jurisdictions with optical scan systems use central-count, which cannothelp voters to correct mistakes before casting the ballot. However, most jurisdictions acquiring newvoting systems are choosing either precinct-count optical scan or DREs, both of which can helpvoters avoid errors. LEOs are generally highly satisfied with whatever voting systems they are using now. Theyhave less confidence in the performance and security of other systems. DRE users generally opposethe use of voter-verified paper audit trails (VVPAT) for DREs, but users of other systems favor it. This result could mean that users are overconfident in DREs or that nonusers are insufficientlyknowledgeable about them. LEOs also tend to favor new systems that have characteristics similarto what they have been using -- for example, lever machine users tend to favor DREs. LEOs trustthe voting system vendors they work with but do not believe that those vendors are very influentialin decisions about acquiring new voting systems. LEOs consider themselves knowledgeable about and familiar with HAVA. They supportindividual provisions of the act, most strongly for federal funding and least strongly for provisionalballoting. To some extent, provisions rated more difficult to implement receive less support. MostLEOs believe that HAVA has resulted in some improvement in elections in their jurisdictions. Those rating HAVA higher overall tend to be younger, more comfortable with technology, and morefamiliar with the act. The areas for improvement of HAVA most commonly listed are federalfunding and the requirements for registration, voter identification, and provisional balloting."
