    "content": "This report reviews the status of energy efficiency and renewable energy legislationintroduced during the 109th Congress. Action in the second session has focused on appropriationsbills; the first session focused on omnibus energy policy bill H.R. 6 ( P.L. 109-58 ), H.R. 3 ( P.L. 109-59 ), and several appropriations bills. The enacted version of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 , H.R. 6 )authorizes or reauthorizes several energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. It alsoestablishes several new commercial and consumer product efficiency standards, sets new goals forenergy efficiency and renewable energy in federal facilities and fleets, broadens the Energy Starproducts program, expands programs for hydrogen fuel cell buses, extends daylight savings time,and sets a renewable fuels standard for increased use of ethanol and biodiesel. Further, it extendsthe renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) for two years, but it does not includeSenate-proposed provisions for oil conservation, a renewable portfolio standard (RPS), or a broaderrange of legislated equipment efficiency standards. The enacted version of the Transportation Equity Act ( P.L. 109-59 , H.R. 3 ) hasprovisions for clean (renewable) fuels, energy conservation, and advanced vehicle technologies. Specific sections include 1113, volumetric excise tax credit for alternative fuels; 1121, highoccupancy vehicle (HOV) facilities; 1307, magnetic levitation transportation; 1807, nonmotorizedtransportation pilot program; 1808, additions to congestion mitigation and air quality (CMAQ);1952, congestion relief; 1954, bicycle transportation and pedestrian walkways; 3005, metropolitantransportation planning; 3010, clean fuels grant program; 3016, national research and technologyprograms; 3044, clean fuels grants; 3045, national fuel cell bus technology development program;4149, office of intermodalism; 5301, intelligent transportation systems; 5502, congestion reliefresearch initiative; 6001, transportation planning; 6015, clean school buses; and 9002, study ofhigh-speed rail. Appropriations bills have also been a focus, including P.L. 109-54 ( H.R. 2361 ,Environmental Protection Agency energy efficiency programs for climate protection); P.L. 109-103 ( H.R. 2419 , Department of Energy programs for energy efficiency and renewableenergy); P.L. 109-97 ( H.R. 2744 , Department of Agriculture program for renewableenergy grants and loans); P.L. 109-108 ( H.R. 2862 , telecommuting program at severalagencies); P.L. 109-102 ( H.R. 3057 , Department of State funding for energy efficiencyand renewable energy in developing nations); and H.R. 2863 (Department of Defensewind energy project for an Air Force base). More than 290 energy efficiency and renewable energy bills have been introduced thus far,including more than 140 that were introduced after the conference report on H.R. 6 wasfiled on July 27, 2005. For each bill listed in this report, a brief description and a summary of actionare given, including references to committee hearings and reports. Also, a selected list of hearingson renewable energy is included. This report will be updated periodically. It supplements thetracking of issues that appear in CRS Report RL33588 and CRS Report RL33599 ."
