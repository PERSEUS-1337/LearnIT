    "title": "A bill to amend Public Law 87-383 to reauthorize appropriations to promote the conservation of migratory waterfowl and to offset or prevent the serious loss of important wetland and other waterfowl habitat essential to the preservation of migratory waterfowl, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "Wetlands Loan Act of 2007 - Amends the Wetlands Loan Act to increase and extend funding for conservation of migratory waterfowl and habitat essential to the preservation of such waterfowl for FY2009-FY2018. Requires such appropriated funds to be treated as advances to the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, which shall be repaid to the Treasury in annual amounts that are equal to the funds accruing to such Fund attributable to the portion of the price of migratory bird hunting stamps sold that year in excess of $15 per stamp. Declares that in any year for which funds are not appropriated pursuant to this Act and no amount remains to be repaid to the Treasury, such excess amount shall be deposited into the Fund. Amends the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act to revise provisions concerning the price of stamps. Sets forth the price of each stamp for 2009 through 2015, 2016 through 2022, and 2023 and thereafter. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, to report to Congress on stamp price comparisons and the purchasing power of the revenue generated by the stamps. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the funds generated pursuant to this Act should be used for preserving and increasing waterfowl populations in accordance with the goals and objectives of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan and should supplement current conservation funding. (2) fee title acquisitions under this Act should be managed for public access in accordance with the requirements of any waterfowl production area designated as a component of the National Wildlife Refuge System under the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966. And (3) this Act should be implemented in a manner that helps private landowners achieve their long-term land use objectives in ways that enhance the conservation of wetlands and wildlife habitat."
