    "content": "Safe Hydration is an American Right in Energy Development Act of 2013 - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to require states, in order to obtain primary enforcement responsibility for a state underground injection control program, to prohibit the underground injection of fluids or propping agents pursuant to hydraulic fracturing operations related to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities unless the person proposing to conduct the hydraulic fracturing operations agrees to conduct testing and report data in accordance with this Act. Directs regulations under such Act for state underground injection control programs to require any person conducting such hydraulic fracturing operations to: (1) conduct testing of underground sources of drinking water in accordance with sampling and testing requirements described in this Act, and (2) report to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the results of such testing. Exempts hydraulic fracturing operations from such testing and reporting requirements if there is no accessible underground source of drinking water within a radius of one mile of the site where the operations occur. Requires the Administrator to establish and maintain a publicly accessible and searchable database of such results."
