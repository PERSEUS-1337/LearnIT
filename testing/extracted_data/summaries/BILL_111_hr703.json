Increases from 90 to 93 of a property's appraised value the cap on the principal obligation amount of a refinanced eligible insured mortgage. Repeals the prohibitions on: (1) second liens. And (2) payment of insurance benefits to a mortgagee in any case in which a mortgagor fails to make the first payment on a refinanced eligible mortgage. Reduces the annual premium for a refinanced eligible insured mortgage, and allows its further reduction or termination during the mortgage term. Repeals the entitlement of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the mortgagor of an eligible insured mortgage, upon any sale or disposition of the subject property, to 50 of any appreciation in the property's appraised value since the date that the mortgage was insured.
