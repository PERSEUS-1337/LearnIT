    "content": "Due to the substantial computational cost, training state-of-the-art deep neural networks for large-scale datasets often requires distributed training using multiple computation workers. However, by nature, workers need to frequently communicate gradients, causing severe bottlenecks, especially on lower bandwidth connections. A few methods have been proposed to compress gradient for efficient communication, but they either suffer a low compression ratio or significantly harm the resulting model accuracy, particularly when applied to convolutional neural networks. To address these issues, we propose a method to reduce the communication overhead of distributed deep learning. Our key observation is that gradient updates can be delayed until an unambiguous (high amplitude, low variance) gradient has been calculated. We also present an efficient algorithm to compute the variance and prove that it can be obtained with negligible additional cost. We experimentally show that our method can achieve very high compression ratio while maintaining the result model accuracy. We also analyze the efficiency using computation and communication cost models and provide the evidence that this method enables distributed deep learning for many scenarios with commodity environments. Deep neural networks are attracting attention because of their outstanding prediction power in many application fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. In addition, software frameworks are publicly available, making it easier to apply deep learning. However, their crucial drawback is the substantial computational cost on training. For example, it takes over a week to train ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset if using a single GPU. Such long training time limits the number of trials possible when creating models. Therefore, we must conduct distributed training using multiple computation workers (e.g., multiple GPUs in different nodes). However, by nature, workers need to frequently communicate gradients, which yields a severe bottleneck for scalability, especially when using lower bandwidth connections. For example, when using 1000BASE-T Ethernet, communication takes at least ten times longer than forward and backward computation for ResNet-50, making multiple nodes impractical. High performance interconnections such as InfiniBand and Omni-Path are an order of magnitude more expensive than commodity interconnections, which limits research and development of deep learning using large-scale datasets to a small number of researchers.Although several methods have been proposed to compress gradient for efficient communication, they either suffer a low compression ratio or significantly harm the resulting model accuracy, particularly when applied to convolutional neural networks. There are mainly two lines of research: quantization and sparsification. Quantization-based methods include 1-bit SGD BID9 and TernGrad (Wen et al., 2017) . Though they achieve small loss of accuracy by using at least one bit for each parameter, the compression ratio is limited. Sparsification-based methods include BID11 and QSGD (Alistarh et al., 2017) . While they can achieve high compression ratio, as we will see in our experiments, they harm the resulting model accuracy or suffer a low compression ratio, particularly when applied to convolutional neural networks.To address these issues, we propose a new gradient compression algorithm to reduce the communication overhead of distributed deep learning. The proposed method belongs to the sparsification approaches. Our key observation is that the variance of the gradient for each parameter point over iterations is a useful signal for compression. As almost all previous approaches of both sparsification and quantization only look at the magnitude of gradient, we believe that we are opening a new door for this field. In addition, we also show that our method can be combined with previous compression methods to further boost performance. We also present an efficient algorithm to compute the variance and prove that it can be obtained with negligible additional cost.We experimentally demonstrate that our method can achieve a high compression ratio while maintaining result model accuracy. We also analyze the efficiency using computation and communication cost models and provide evidence that our method enables distributed deep learning for many scenarios with commodity environments.Organization. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the definitions and notations used in this paper. Section 3 reviews related work in this field. Section 4 presents the proposed method. Section 5 analyzes performance. Section 6 shows our experimental results, and we conclude in Section 7. We proposed a novel method for gradient compression. Our method can reduce communication cost significantly with no or only slight accuracy degradation. Contributions of our work can be summarized in the following three points. First, we proposed a novel measurement of ambiguity (high variance, low amplitude) to determine when a gradient update is required. Second, we showed the application of this measurement as a threshold for updates significantly reduces update requirements, while providing comparable accuracy. Third, we demonstrated this method can be combined with other efficient gradient compression approaches to further reduce communication cost."
