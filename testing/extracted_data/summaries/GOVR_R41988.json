    "content": "In 2004, Congress added the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction to the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The deduction was intended to achieve a number of policy goals, including compensating for repeal of the extraterritorial income (ETI) export-subsidy provisions, supporting the domestic manufacturing sector, and reducing effective corporate tax rates. Under current law, qualified activities are eligible for a deduction equal to 9% of the lesser of taxable income derived from qualified production activities, or taxable income. Eligible income includes that derived from the production of property that was manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted within the United States. Electricity, natural gas, and potable water production is also eligible, as is film production. Domestic construction projects, as well as engineering and architectural services associated with such projects, also qualify. Certain oil- and gas-related activities also qualify for the deduction, but at a reduced rate of 6%. Overall, more than one-third of corporate taxable income qualifies for the deduction. In 2013, 66% of corporate claims of the Section 199 deduction were attributable to the manufacturing sector. Another 16% of the value of corporate claims came from the information sector, while 3% were attributable to the mining sector. Other large sectors of the economy, such as finance and insurance, as well as wholesale and retail trade, had few Section 199 claims, relative to their contributions toward economic activity. In practice, the Section 199 deduction reduces corporate tax rates for certain selected industries. Providing a tax break for certain industries can distort the allocation of capital in the economy, reducing economic efficiency and total economic output. Economic efficiency may be enhanced by repealing the Section 199 deduction and using the additional revenues to offset the cost of reducing corporate tax rates. Repealing the Section 199 deduction could allow for a revenue-neutral corporate tax rate reduction of an estimated 1.4 percentage points. For companies currently claiming the Section 199 deduction, repeal of the deduction in exchange for a reduced corporate tax rate could lead to increased effective tax rates. Under current law, activities eligible for the deduction receive a tax break equal to 3.15 percentage points. Further, the deduction can currently be claimed by pass-through entities, including S corporations and partnerships. If the Section 199 deduction were repealed for all businesses, but rate cuts were confined to the corporate sector, the result could be higher effective tax rates on pass-through entities. Repealing the Section 199 deduction only for the corporate tax could allow for a revenue-neutral corporate tax rate reduction of an estimated 1.0 percentage points. Recent tax reform proposals include repeal of the Section 199 deduction as part of base broadening, providing additional revenue to offset the revenue loss associated with rate reduction. Specifically, both the Tax Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 1) in the 113th Congress and the House Republican \"Better Way\" tax reform blueprint from 2016 include repeal of the Section 199 deduction."
