Reduces the employee wage and rent portions of the index for 2010 from 34 to 12 of the difference between the relative costs of employee wages and rents in each of the different fee schedule areas and the national average of such employee wages and rents. Reduces the same portions of the index for 2011 from 12 to 14 of such differences. Amends PPACA to repeal specified floors for frontier states: (1) on the area wage index for hospitals. (2) on the area wage adjustment factor for hospital outpatient department services. And (3) for the practice expense index for services furnished in such states."
