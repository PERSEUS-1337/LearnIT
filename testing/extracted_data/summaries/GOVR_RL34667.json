    "content": "This report provides a side-by-side comparison of three bills and two proposals, each of which addresses oil and gas development in the outer continental shelf (OCS). None of the bills has passed its respective chamber. One of the proposals, H.R. 6899, the \"Comprehensive American Energy Security and Taxpayer Protection Act,\" is expected to come to the House floor the week of September 15, 2008. The moratoria on oil and gas leasing in much of the OCS has become a major issue in Congress and also in the Presidential campaign. This report describes the background of OCS leasing and the various positions taken by proponents and opponents of leasing. It then compares the provisions of three bills that have been introduced with reported summaries of the House proposal and the Senate proposal, the \"New Energy Reform Act of 2008.\" On September 16, 2008, the House passed H.R. 6899 by a vote of 236-189 and defeated an alternative bill, H.R. 6709, by a vote of 191-226."
