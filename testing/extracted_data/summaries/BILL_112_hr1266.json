    "content": "Fraudulent Prescription Prevention Act of 2011 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to prohibit the Attorney General from registering a practitioner to dispense or conduct research with a schedule II or III controlled substance unless the practitioner agrees to comply with this Act's requirements. Requires a practitioner, at the time of prescribing such substances to submit to the Attorney General by means of a web portal: (1) the patient's name, date of birth, and address, (2) the date and time of the prescription, (3) the name and amount of the substance prescribed. (4) the practitioner's Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration number and contact information. And (5) the prescription pad number. Makes exceptions if the practitioner is prescribing a controlled substance in a medical emergency situation or does not have access to the web portal . Requires a practitioner to submit the same information before dispensing such a controlled substance, as well as whether the dispensing constitutes a refill of a prescription. Requires a practitioner who declines to dispense such a controlled substance to submit information that would have been required to be reported if the substance had been dispensed and any reason to suspect that the individual attempting to purchase the substance was acting pursuant to fraud. Directs the Attorney General to establish and maintain a web portal and database that allows a practitioner to submit such information and that communicates an alert to the practitioner if circumstances exist that indicate the patient or purchaser is attempting to unlawfully divert or misuse a controlled substance. Limits disclosure of database information."
