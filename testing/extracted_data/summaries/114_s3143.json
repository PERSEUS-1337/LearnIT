    "content": "Wage and Garnishment Equity Act of 2016 or the WAGE Act This bill amends the Consumer Credit Protection Act to define quot, assignmentquot. To exclude payroll deductions or preauthorized payment plans and any assignment applicable only to earnings already earned. The bill adjusts the maximum part of a person's aggregate disposable earnings for any workweek that is subject to garnishment or assignment. Such amount shall not exceed the lesser of: (1) 10 of earnings for an individual earning $1200 or less weekly , or (2) the amount by which the earnings exceed 80 times the federal minimum hourly wage in effect. No employer may take any adverse employment action against an employee because the employee's earnings have been subject to garnishment or assignment. The Department of Labor may provide the same exemption from maximum allowable garnishment requirements for state-regulated assignments as it does for state-regulated garnishments. The bill requires specified delays of garnishment pursuant to an order directed at an employer with fewer than 50 employees. Of the aggregate amount of an individual's funds in deposit accounts, $10,000 shall be exempt and immune from attachment or seizure for any judgment related to a debt."
