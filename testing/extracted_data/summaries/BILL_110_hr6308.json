And (2) define clearly any rating symbol and apply it consistently. Permits an NSRO to consider the following when assessing the risk that an investor in a security or money market instrument will not receive repayment in accordance with the terms of issuance: (1) additional credit factors that it has documented and disclosed. Or (2) credit factors that are unique to municipal securities that are not backed by the issuer's full faith and credit. Prohibits the SEC from imposing any requirement that prevents an NSRO from establishing ratings that are complementary to mandatory ratings and that are created to measure a discrete aspect of risk. Directs the SEC to establish performance measures, which may include transition and default rates in discrete asset classes, to consider when deciding whether to initiate a review concerning whether an NSRO has failed to adhere to its procedures and methodologies for issuing ratings. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to certain congressional committees on the treatment of different classes of bonds by the NSROs.

States that such a submission does not constitute a waiver of, or otherwise affect, any privilege or confidentiality protection to which the data or information is otherwise subject. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into an information-sharing agreement with states, NAIC, or other appropriate sources to provide for the receipt of any data and information such sources have already received or collected, or can efficiently receive or collect. Requires the Secretary to treat as confidential and privileged data or information obtained from any source that is entitled to confidential treatment under applicable state or federal law or regulations, or under any agreement to which the source is a party. Prohibits the Secretary from disclosing personally identifiable information received or collected under this Act.

And (3) potential impacts that entities providing such insurance and guarantees could have upon the overall domestic financial system under various scenarios of macro- and micro-economic stress.
