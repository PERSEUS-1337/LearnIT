    "title": "An act to amend and renumber Section 674 of, and to add Article 8.5 (commencing with Section 674) to Chapter 3 of Part 2 of Division 1 of, the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation.",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the annual assessment and collection of property taxes by each county, and provides for the state administration of the property tax by the State Board of Equalization. The California Constitution generally limits ad valorem taxes on real property to 1 of the full cash value of that property. For purposes of this limitation, \u201cfull cash value\u201d is defined as the assessor\u2019s valuation of real property as shown on the 1975\u201376 tax bill under \u201cfull cash value\u201d or, thereafter, the appraised value of that real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has occurred. Existing property tax law requires a transferee of real property or a manufactured home that is locally assessed to file a change in ownership statement with the assessor of the county in which the property or manufactured home is located, and also requires a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other legal entity to file a change in ownership statement with the board. Existing property tax law also includes various property tax exemptions as authorized or established by the California Constitution. This bill would prohibit an assessor or any person employed by the office of the county assessor from making decisions with regard to change in ownership, or with regard to property tax exemptions, except a homeowners\u2019 exemption claim, unless he or she is the holder of a valid assessment analyst certificate issued by the board. The bill would require the board to provide for the examination of applicants for a certificate and would authorize the board to contract with the Department of Human Resources to give the examinations. The bill would require prescribed annual training for certification, and would also provide for advanced certification. Failure to complete training as required would be grounds for revocation. The bill would also authorize the board to issue temporary certificates and interim certificates under prescribed circumstances. This bill would specify that its provisions are not to be construed to impede assessors from managing their staff resources efficiently regarding exemption applications and change in ownership documents, provided that noncertificated staff are not responsible for making exemption or change in ownership decisions. This bill would provide that its provisions only apply in those counties and cities and counties that have passed a resolution upon the recommendation of the assessor to require certification as described above."
