    "title": "AB 834",
    "content": "Existing law, the Political Reform Act of 1974, provides for the comprehensive regulation of campaign conduct, including requiring certain disclosures in advertisements made for campaign purposes. Existing law also prohibits an incumbent from sending a newsletter or other mass mailing at public expense. This bill would define a \u201cpublic advertisement\u201d as an advertisement that is paid for from the funds of a state or local public entity. This bill would prohibit a person or entity from disseminating, broadcasting, or otherwise publishing a public advertisement, as defined, within 90 days of an election if the advertisement features, as defined, a candidate who will appear on the ballot at that election. Existing law makes a willful violation of the Political Reform Act of 1974 a misdemeanor and subject offenders to criminal penalties. The bill would impose a state-mandated local program by creating additional crimes. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act\u2019s purposes upon a 23 vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements. This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act. Existing law, the Political Reform Act of 1974, provides for the comprehensive regulation of campaign financing, including requiring the reporting of campaign contributions and expenditures and imposing other reporting and recordkeeping requirements on campaign committees. The act provides that a payment made at the behest of a candidate is a contribution to that candidate, unless full and adequate consideration is received from the candidate or it is clear from the surrounding circumstances that the payment was made for purposes unrelated to his or her candidacy for elective office. This bill would make a nonsubstantive change to that payment provision."
