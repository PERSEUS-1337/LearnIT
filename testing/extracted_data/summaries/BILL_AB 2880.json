    "title": "AB 2880",
    "content": "The California Public Records Act requires a state or local agency, as defined, to make public records available for inspection, subject to certain exceptions. This bill would require a public agency to comply with a request to inspect or copy a public record that is protected by the federal Copyright Revision Act of 1976 unless the record is otherwise exempt from disclosure. Under existing law, contracts by state agencies for services rendered to the state are, with certain exceptions, of no effect unless and until approved by the Department of General Services. Existing law imposes various requirements with respect to contracts for services rendered to the state. Existing law requires the department to develop factors for state agencies to consider in deciding whether to sell or license their intellectual property. This bill would, for contracts entered into on or after January 1, 2017, require a state agency entering into a contract for services to consider the intellectual property rights of both the state and the contracting party unless the agency, prior to execution of the contract, obtains the consent of the department. Existing law exempts from the Administrative Procedure Act certain actions to maintain, develop, or prescribe processes, procedures, or policies by the Department of General Services that are required or authorized by the Legislature with respect to the general operations of the department or the awarding of state contracts. This bill would additionally exempt those actions taken with respect to the department\u2019s above-described duties relating to the management and development of state intellectual property, as provided."
