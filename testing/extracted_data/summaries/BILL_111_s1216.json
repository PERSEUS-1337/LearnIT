    "content": "Residential Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act - Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to require the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to publish the American National Standard for Single and Multiple Station Carbon Monoxide Alarms as a mandatory consumer product safety standard. Makes it unlawful for any manufacturer or distributor to import or distribute any new assembled or unassembled residential carbon monoxide detector unless it complies with the standard. Requires the CPSC to issue a final rule in its proceeding titled Portable Generators, including a requirement that portable generators incorporate an automatic shutoff feature if compliance with such a requirement is technologically feasible. Requires the CPSC to establish a grant program to provide assistance to states to carry out a carbon monoxide alarm program."
