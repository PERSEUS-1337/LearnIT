    "content": "The Posse Comitatus Act outlaws willful use of any part of the Army or Air Force to execute the law unless expressly authorized by the Constitution or an Act of Congress. Historysupplies the grist for an argument that the Constitution prohibits military involvement in civilianaffairs subject to only limited alterations by Congress or the President, but the courts do not appearto have ever accepted the argument unless violation of more explicit constitutional command couldalso be shown. The provision for express constitutional authorization when in fact the Constitutioncontains no such express authorizations has been explained alternatively as a meaningless politicalface saving device or as an unartful reference to the President's constitutional powers. The expressstatutory exceptions include the legislation which allows the President to use military force tosuppression insurrection, 10 U.S.C. 331-335, and sections which permit the Department of Defenseto provide federal, state and local police with information and equipment, 10 U.S.C. 371-381. Existing case law indicates that \"execution of the law\" in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act occurs (a) when the armed forces perform tasks which are assigned not to them but to an organ ofcivil government, or (b) when the armed forces perform tasks assigned to them solely for purposesof civilian government. Questions arise most often in the context of assistance to civilian police. At least in this context, the courts have held that, absent a recognized exception, the Posse ComitatusAct is violated, (1) when civilian law enforcement officials make \"direct active use\" of militaryinvestigators; or (2) when the use of the military \"pervades the activities\" of the civilian officials;or (3) when the military is used so as to subject \"citizens to the exercise of military power which wasregulatory, prescriptive, or compulsory in nature.\" The Act is not violated when the armed forcesconduct activities for a military purpose which have incidental benefits for civilian law enforcementofficials. The language of the Act mentions only the Army and the Air Force, but it is applicable to the Navy and Marines by virtue of administrative action and commands of other laws. The lawenforcement functions of the Coast Guard have been expressly authorized by act of Congress andconsequently cannot be said to be contrary to the Act. The Act has been applied to the NationalGuard when it is in federal service, to civilian employees of the armed forces, and to off-dutymilitary personnel. The Act is probably only applicable within the geographical confines of the United States, but the supplemental provisions of 10 U.S.C. 371-381 appear to apply world-wide. Finally, the Act isa criminal statute under which there has never been a prosecution. Although violations will on rareoccasions result in the exclusion of evidence, the dismissal of criminal charges, or a civil cause ofaction, as a practical matter compliance is ordinarily the result of military self-restraint.This reportappears in abridged form as CRS Report RS20590 , The Posse Comitatus Act: A Sketch . Abstract This is a brief summary of the Posse Comitatus Act and related provisions which govern the use of military personnel and equipment to execute civilian law."
