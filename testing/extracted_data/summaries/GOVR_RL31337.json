    "content": "The issue of missile defense cooperation with Japan intersects with several issues of directconcern to Congress, ranging from support for developing a capability to protect U.S. regionalforces, Asia-Pacific allies, and Taiwan, from Chinese short- and medium-range missiles, tocountering a possible future threat to U.S. territory from long-range missiles developed by NorthKorea. Japan's current participation in the U.S. ballistic missile defense (BMD) program dates fromAugust 1999, when the Japanese government agreed to conduct cooperative research on fourcomponents of the interceptor missile being developed for the then U.S. Navy Theater-Wide (NTW)anti-missile system--a sea-based \"upper tier\" (exo-atmospheric) capability against short- andmedium-range missiles up to 3,500 kilometers. In the spring of 2001, the Administration changed the context of the cooperative researcheffort when it reorganized and redirected the U.S. missile defense program to emphasize theemployment of specific technologies across the entire spectrum of missile defense challenges, butespecially to gain a limited, near-term capability to defeat missile attacks on U.S. territory by \"rogue\"states. The Pentagon redesignated the NTW program as the Sea-Based Midcourse System, with agoal of developing a capability for attacking missiles of all ranges in the initial or middle phases oftheir flight path. This change added to an already complex list of Japanese policy concerns, byputting Japan in the position of possibly cooperating in the development of technology that couldbecome part of an American national missile defense capability -- a step that many Japanese see astransgressing a constitutional ban on \"collective defense.\" Thus far, the Administration's program change has not deterred Japan from cooperativeresearch on missile defense, but the policy shift has unsettled Japanese leaders and created additionalpolitical obstacles to bilateral BMD cooperation. The new U.S. approach has been criticized in theJapanese press and the Diet (parliament), both because of the potential violation of the implied banon \"collective defense\" contained in Article 9 of Japan's U.S.-imposed \"Peace Constitution,\" and alsobecause the Bush initiative requires the United States to withdraw from the U.S.-RussianAnti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty, which Tokyo has long regarded as an important element ofstrategic stability. An integrated U.S.-Japan BMD capability aimed at protecting third countrieswould raise the same constitutional issues. Japan has not made a decision regarding the acquisition of a missile defense capability. Japanese policymakers and defense firms generally are enthusiastic about missile defensecooperation, but the political parties, the media, and the general public are split over the issue. Proponents view BMD cooperation as a means to counter a perceived North Korean missile threat,and perhaps a Chinese threat as well. Other Japanese are fearful of aggravating relations with Chinaor triggering an Asian missile race. Even groups in Japan favoring BMD cooperation are concernedabout the large costs associated with the still-unproven technology. The popular Koizumiadministration seems inclined to finesse the constitutional issue, if possible. Japan's future stancewill likely depend on regional developments and how the issue plays out in the currently unstablepolitical environment."
