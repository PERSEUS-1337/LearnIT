One set of questions addresses some of the primary characteristics of tax-exempt organizations, including whether they may participate in lobbying and election-related activities, and defines the terms \"tax-exempt,\" \"nonprofit (not-for-profit),\" and \"private foundation.\" Another group of questions provides general information on how to form a tax-exempt organization, what information must be disclosed to the IRS and the public, and how an organization might lose its tax-exempt status. The report ends with questions intended to help the reader find resources that provide information on specific organizations and additional information on tax-exempt organizations in general. This report summarizes information with respect to tax-exempt organizations. It should not be relied on for specific tax advice. Such advice should be sought directly from the IRS or qualified tax professionals."
