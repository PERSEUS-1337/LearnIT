    "content": "Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act - Amends the federal judicial code to include among the exceptions to US jurisdictional immunity of foreign states any statutory or common law tort claim arising out of an act of extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, terrorism, or the provision of material support or resources for such an act, or any claim for contribution or indemnity relating to a claim arising out of such an act. Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) impose liability on, and grant US district courts personal jurisdiction over, any person who aids, abets, provides material support or resources to, or conspires with a person who commits an act of international terrorism that injures a US national. (2) repeal provisions prohibiting civil actions against foreign states or foreign officials for damages related to acts of terrorism. And (3) extend from 4 to 15 years the limitation period for bringing an action for civil damages resulting from an act of international terrorism and allow previously time-barred cases that would have been timely filed under such extended limitation period to be refiled within 90 days of the enactment of this Act."
