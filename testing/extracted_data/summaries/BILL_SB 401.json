    "title": "SB 401",
    "content": "Existing law, the California Child Day Care Facilities Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of child day care facilities, as defined, and crisis nurseries by the State Department of Social Services. Existing law requires that the maximum licensed capacity for those facilities be based on 35 square feet of indoor activity space per child. This bill would exempt those facilities from the 35 square footage requirement if the facility is located in an office building."
