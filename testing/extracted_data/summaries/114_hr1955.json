    "title": "Great Lakes Nutrient Removal Assistance Act",
    "content": "Great Lakes Nutrient Removal Assistance Act This bill amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a program to provide grants to states in the Great Lakes System and municipalities in those states to install nutrient removal technologies at a municipal wastewater treatment facility that has a permitted design capacity to treat an annual average of at least 500,000 gallons of wastewater per day. The EPA must give priority to facilities at which nutrient removal technology installations would: (1) produce the greatest nutrient load reductions at points of discharge, (2) result in the greatest environmental benefits to the Great Lakes System, and (3) help meet the objectives related to nutrients outlined in Annex 4 of the 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement."
