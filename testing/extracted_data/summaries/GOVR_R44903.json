    "content": "Per the reconciliation instructions in the budget resolution for FY2017 (S.Con.Res. 3), the House passed its reconciliation bill, H.R. 1628\u2014the American Health Care Act (AHCA)\u2014with amendments on May 4, 2017. The House bill was received in the Senate on June 7, 2017, and the next day the Senate majority leader had it placed on the calendar, making it available for floor consideration. The Senate Budget Committee published on its website a \"discussion draft\" titled, \"The Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017\" (BCRA) on June 22, 2017, and subsequently updated the discussion draft on June 26, July 13, and July 20. The Senate's draft legislation is written in the form of an amendment in the nature of a substitute, meaning that it is intended to be considered by the Senate as an amendment to H.R. 1628, as passed by the House, and that all of the House-passed language would be stricken and the language of the BCRA would be inserted in its place. On July 19, 2017, the Senate Budget Committee posted the \"Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017\" (ORRA) on its website as another draft reconciliation bill. ORRA is largely based off the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015 (H.R. 3762), which was vetoed by President Obama on January 8, 2016, and returned to the House. ORRA would repeal several provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148, as amended), and it could restrict federal funding for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) and its affiliates and clinics for a period of one year. The bill also would appropriate (1) an additional $422 million for FY2017 to the Community Health Center Fund and (2) $750 million for each of FY2018 and FY2019 to award grants to states to address the substance abuse public health crisis or respond to urgent mental health needs. The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimate that ORRA would reduce federal deficits by $473 billion from FY2017 through FY2026, and they estimate that 17 million more people would be uninsured under ORRA than under current law in FY2018, with that figure growing to 32 million in CY2026. A number of the provisions in ORRA are also in the AHCA and/or BCRA. However, ORRA does not include the AHCA or BCRA provisions that would substitute the ACA's premium tax credit for premium tax credits with different eligibility rules and calculation requirements. ORRA also does not include the AHCA or BCRA provisions that would establish new programs and requirements that are not related to the ACA, for example, a new fund to provide funding to states for specified activities intended to improve access to health insurance and health care or provisions to convert Medicaid financing to a per capita cap model (i.e., per enrollee limits on federal payments to states) with a block grant option (i.e., a predetermined fixed amount of federal funding) for certain populations. This report provides summaries of each ORRA provision."
