    "title": "An act to\namend Section 19130 of the Government\nadd Section 89036.5 to the Education\nCode, relating to personal\nservice\nservices\ncontracts.",
    "content": "Existing law law, the State Civil Service Act, establishes standards for the use of personal services contracts by state agencies. Existing law The act provides that personal services contracting is permissible to achieve cost savings when certain conditions are met, including, but not limited to, that the contracting agency demonstrates that the proposed contract will result in actual overall cost savings to the state and that the contract will not cause the displacement of civil service employees. The act also authorizes state agencies to enter into personal services contracts for functions exempted from civil service. The California Constitution excludes the officers and employees of the California State University from the state civil service. This bill would make these provisions for the use of personal services contracts applicable to California State Universities. Existing law authorizes the trustees of the California State University to enter into agreements with any public or private agency, person, or institution for the furnishing of services, facilities, goods, supplies, or equipment, among others, and requires the trustees to prescribe policies and procedures for the acquisition of those services, facilities, materials, goods, supplies, or equipment. This bill would establish standards for the use of personal services contracts by the trustees of the California State University similar to those in the State Civil Service Act."
