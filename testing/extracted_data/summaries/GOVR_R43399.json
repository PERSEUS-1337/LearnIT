    "content": "In March 2013, President Obama notified Congress that his Administration would seek a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the European Union (EU). In addition to addressing tariffs and other trade restrictions, the negotiations seek to reduce regulatory barriers to transatlantic commerce. Among the barriers under discussion are those affecting motor vehicles. Although many automakers build and sell cars in both regions, they must comply with very different safety, fuel economy, and emissions standards, as well as different regulatory processes. TTIP negotiators are seeking to identify ways to narrow the regulatory differences, potentially reducing costs and spurring additional trade in vehicles. U.S. and EU automakers support this initiative, which they see as furthering economic and vehicle design trends already under way. The complexity of complying with different greenhouse gas emissions regulations is also a factor in the industry's support. This report looks at ways in which TTIP might lead to a convergence of motor vehicle regulatory regimes on both sides of the Atlantic. These regimes govern three distinct aspects of vehicle manufacturing and involve a number of U.S. and EU agencies. Safety. U.S. automakers self-certify that they are meeting U.S. vehicle standards. In Europe, vehicles must obtain \"type approval\" from a government before an automaker can bring out a new model. Emissions. U.S. and EU emissions regulations are administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the European Commission (EC), respectively. While U.S. and EC rules address a similar range of pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and non-methane organic oxides, allowable emissions levels in the EU are different from those in the United States\u2014and they are stricter in more than a dozen U.S. states than in the other states. The United States and the EU have similar \"type approval\" systems for new engine models. Fuel Efficiency. Auto manufacturers selling in the United States must meet the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards enforced by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Under the Obama Administration, greenhouse gases (GHG) in vehicle emissions are being regulated for the first time, making fuel economy standard-setting a joint venture between NHTSA and EPA. The EU does not directly set fuel economy standards, but it effectively does so by regulating greenhouse gas emissions of new vehicles. There are several different ways a TTIP agreement could promote convergence of automobile regulation, from harmonizing existing U.S. and EU rules to providing for mutual recognition of some or all automotive standards. If a TTIP agreement is reached, it will be subject to congressional approval. To the extent that such an agreement would require changes in motor vehicle regulatory processes or standards, it is possible that Congress will be asked to modify statutes that govern motor vehicle safety, emissions, and fuel economy."
