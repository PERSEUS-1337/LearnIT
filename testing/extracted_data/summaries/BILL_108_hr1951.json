    "content": "VA Medical Workforce Enhancement Act of 2003 - States that: (1) current collective bargaining requirements within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) shall not preclude the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and any labor organization representing VHA employees from entering into a collective bargaining agreement with respect to the numbers, types, and grades of employees, the number of patients assigned to physicians, physicians assistants, or nurses, and employee-to-patient ratios within any VHA medical facility, clinic, or organizational subdivision. And (2) nothing shall limit the right or ability of any labor organization representing such employees from engaging in collective bargaining with respect to VHA promotion processes. Provides that when a VHA registered nurse has accomplished the performance elements of promotion to the next higher grade, the lack of a specific type of educational degree shall not be an impediment to such promotion. Authorizes additional pay for Saturday VHA nursing duty. Directs the Secretary to carry out a program to develop nurse preceptors to act as mentors to newly hired registered nurses at Department of Veterans Affairs health care facilities."
