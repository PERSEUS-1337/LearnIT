    "content": "The annual Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of Energy (DOE), and several independent agencies. The DOE budget includes funding for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a separately organized agency within DOE. NNSA operates three programs: Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, which secures nuclear materials worldwide, conducts R&D into nonproliferation and verification, and operates the Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response Program; Naval Reactors, which \"is responsible for all U.S. Navy nuclear propulsion work\"; and Weapons Activities. The latter is the subject of this report. It operates the Stockpile Stewardship Program, which maintains the U.S. nuclear gravity bombs and missile warheads and has science and infrastructure programs that support that mission. (The Department of Defense [DOD] operates the bombers and missiles that would deliver nuclear weapons; it is funded in the Department of Defense appropriations bill.) The Armed Services Committees authorize funds for DOD and NNSA programs. The FY2016 request proposed moving counterterrorism programs from Weapons Activities to Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation. On a basis comparable to the FY2016 budget structure, the FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (H.R. 83/P.L. 113-235) provided $8,007.7 million for Weapons Activities. The FY2016 request was $8,846.9 million, a 10.5% increase over FY2015. The House Appropriations Committee recommended providing $8,713.0 million for FY2016. The House passed H.R. 2028, Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016, by a vote of 240-177 on May 1. The bill as passed by the House made no changes to the Weapons Activities section of the committee bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported the bill on May 21. It recommended providing $8,882.4 million. Congress provided 8,846.9 million for Weapons Activities in the omnibus appropriations bill for FY2016 (H.R. 2029). Weapons Activities has four main programs, each with a request of over $1 billion for FY2016, as follows. FY2015-enacted amounts included below are comparable to the FY2016 budget structure. Directed Stockpile Work works directly on nuclear weapons. It includes life extension programs, maintenance, and others. The FY2015-enacted amount was $2,797.2 million; the FY2016 request was $3,187.3 million, a 13.9% increase. H.R. 2028, as passed by the House, provided $3,354.3 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3,039.5 million. The omnibus appropriations bill provided $3,387.8 million. Research, Development, Test and Evaluation Programs, which advances the science, engineering, computation, and manufacturing that support Directed Stockpile Work. The FY2015-enacted amount was $1,766.2 million; the FY2016 request was $1,776.6 million, a 0.6% increase. H.R. 2028, as passed by the House, provided $1,774.2 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,766.3 million. The omnibus appropriations bill provided $1,818.5 million. Infrastructure and Safety (I&S), a budget category that NNSA proposed in its FY2016 request, includes operations of facilities, recapitalization, maintenance, safety operations, and other programs. The FY2015-enacted comparable amount was $1,386.7 million; the FY2016 request was $1,466.1 million, a 5.7% increase. The House Appropriations Committee recommended consolidating I&S into Infrastructure and Operations. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,466.1 million for I&S. The omnibus appropriations bill accepted the House budget structure and consolidated I&S into Infrastructure and Operations, as described next. Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities (RTBF) funds material recycle and recovery, recapitalization of facilities, and construction of facilities. Prior to FY2016, it also funded operations of the nuclear weapons complex. The FY2015-enacted amount was $2,033.4 million; the FY2016 request was $1,054.5 million, with the decrease due to transferring funds to I&S. The FY2015 comparable request for RTBF was $688.0 million, so on a comparable basis FY2016 RTBF increased by 53.3%. The House Appropriations Committee recommended consolidating funding for RTBF, Infrastructure and Safety, and Site Stewardship into a new category, Infrastructure and Operations (I&O), for which it recommended $2,228.2 million. H.R. 2028, as passed by the House, accepted this budget structure. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended keeping I&S and Site Stewardship as separately funded categories, and providing $1,021.1 million for I&O and $36.6 million for Site Stewardship. The omnibus appropriations bill accepted the consolidated funding structure, and provided $2,279.1 million for Infrastructure and Operations (I&O). Weapons Activities also includes several smaller programs, all of which are described in this report: Secure Transportation Asset, Site Stewardship, Defense Nuclear Security, Information Technology and Cybersecurity, and Legacy Contractor Pensions."
