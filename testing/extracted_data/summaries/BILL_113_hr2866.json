Permits issuance of such coins only between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017. Subjects all coin sales to specified surcharges, which shall be paid to the Treasury for the purposes of reducing the national debt. Directs the Secretary to ensure that: (1) minting and issuing such coins will not result in any net cost to the federal government. And (2) no funds, including surcharges, will be disbursed to Boys Town until the total cost of designing and issuing all authorized coins is recovered by the Treasury."
