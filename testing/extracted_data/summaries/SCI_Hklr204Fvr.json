    "content": "We propose the Fixed Grouping Layer (FGL); a novel feedforward layer designed to incorporate the inductive bias of structured smoothness into a deep learning model. FGL achieves this goal by connecting nodes across layers based on spatial similarity. The use of structured smoothness, as implemented by FGL, is motivated by applications to structured spatial data, which is, in turn, motivated by domain knowledge. The proposed model architecture outperforms conventional neural network architectures across a variety of simulated and real datasets with structured smoothness. The effectiveness of predictive models often depends on the choice of inductive bias, and the extent to which this inductive bias captures real-world structure. For instance, one example of such bias encoding leading to improved performance is convolution. In principle, convolutional weights could be learned directly from data. However, in practice, imposing this structure leads to improved performance when compared to fully connected models, and as a result, Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have enjoyed wide use for computer vision tasks (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) . Similarly, recurrent neural networks such as LSTMs are effective for text (Sundermeyer et al., 2012) , and certain graphical models are ideal for sentence segmentation and labeling (Lafferty et al., 2001) . Our work follows this philosophy. Specifically, we propose a feedforward layer for deep neural networks that is suitable for neuroimaging and potentially useful for other data where variables can be grouped due to underlying structure. Data with multiple input variables often exhibit some structure. For example, the El Nino dataset (Bay et al., 2000) consists of measurements by weather buoys in the ocean, and one expects that nearby buoys can be grouped together. Similarly, socio-economic data can often be grouped together by geographic proximity. Financial market data of individual stocks can be grouped together based on the industrial sector to which a company belongs. Along similar lines, brain parcellations are a well studied paradigm for capturing the structure of brain activity , often via statistical parcellation based on ward clustering (Ward Jr, 1963) . The result of ward clustering is a tree where leaf nodes represent voxels of the brain and interior nodes represent grouping of voxels into spatial clusters. Figure 1 visualizes the output of ward clustering at various granularities when applied to the human connectome project resting state brain data (Van Essen et al., 2012) . Contribitions: Our primary technical contribution is the Fixed Grouping Layer (FGL). FGL is designed to extract features within each group, and additionally guarantees that each output vector is only affected by the input vectors related to it by the specified grouping. We demonstrate the benefit of using FGL on simulated experiments and real neuroimaging data. We compare FGL against fully connected networks, convolutional neural networks, CoordConv (Liu et al., 2018) , and a closely related method proposed by Aydore et al. (2018) . We extensively evaluate the performance of FGL on simulated and real brain imaging data showing improved performance. In this work we propose a new layer architecture, the Fixed Grouping Layer (FGL), parameterized by a grouping of input variables. FGL explicitly extracts features within each input group. This is in contrast to convolution which extracts local features across the input, and fully connected networks which extract both global and local features. We demonstrate the benefit of using FGL on 5 real fMRI datasets of different sizes. Future work will involve the application of FGL to other tasks and application domains."
