Authorizes the Secretary to operate the United States Academy for Democracy and Civil-Military Relations (Academy). Requires instruction at the Academy to be provided to civilian and military personnel of Latin American and Caribbean countries through seminars, roundtable discussions, conferences, and a guest instructor program. Directs the Secretary to conduct a thorough screening of potential instructors and students at the Academy for commitment to and respect for democracy and human rights. Requires the Secretary to establish an advisory committee to provide advice on establishing and operating the Academy, as well as the content of its curriculum. Provides Academy funding. States that this Act does not affect the authority to conduct countermine programs at Fort Benning, Georgia, at the School of the Americas in response to a request from the Organization of American States. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on Academy achievements after two years of operation. Expresses the sense of the Congress that resources made available to operate the Academy should be commensurate with the total resources that were dedicated to the School of the Americas in FY 1996."
