    "content": "In the 109th Congress, companion bills have been introduced ( S. 1155 / H.R. 2470 ) that, if enacted, would establish a Commission on the Accountabilityand Review of Federal Agencies (CARFA). Either version of the proposed CARFA Act wouldrequire this 12-member commission to review certain federal agencies and programs to determineif any are duplicative , wasteful , inefficient , outdated , irrelevant , or failed . The House version wouldinclude within the commission's scope only non-defense, non-entitlement agencies and programs inthe executive branch, while the Senate version would include all executive branch agencies andprograms, including the Executive Office of the President. The commission would be required or,in some cases allowed, to recommend that any such programs and agencies be realigned oreliminated. The commission's recommendations would be packaged into an implementation bill thatwould receive expedited congressional consideration. Nearly identical provisions appeared in abudget process reform bill ( H.R. 2290 ) and a bill to offset costs from Hurricane Katrinaand Hurricane Rita ( S. 1928 ). In addition, nonbinding provisions in the FY2006 budgetresolution ( H.Con.Res. 95 ) called for enacting a CARFA-like commission. PresidentGeorge W. Bush said in his FY2006 budget that he would propose, as part of his President'sManagement Agenda (PMA), legislation authorizing him to propose \"results commissions,\" whichwould consider and revise Administration proposals to restructure and consolidate programs andagencies. Proposals approved by such a results commission and the President would be consideredby Congress under expedited procedures. The Administration suggested that the resultscommissions legislation would be similar to the CARFA proposal. Bills have been introduced( H.R. 3276 / S. 1399 ) that largely incorporated the Administration's draftlanguage. Proponents have argued that, if enacted, a CARFA could evaluate programs and agencies,use a successful model for congressional consideration of commission recommendations, andthereby eliminate or reform wasteful agencies and programs. The Bush Administration has suggestedthat a CARFA should use the Administration's Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART). Criticsmight likely contend that the legislation is too narrowly focused -- looking only at discretionary,non-defense programs (House version); that the commission should be equally balanced alongpartisan lines or less under the President's control; that expedited procedures undermine thedemocratic process; and that the decision making criteria are too subjective. This report summarizesthe legislation's history and provisions, discusses other review commission legislation, and highlightsperspectives about the CARFA proposal from the 108th Congress. Next, the report analyzes issuesthat may be of interest in the 109th Congress in the event that the CARFA legislation or similarproposals to establish a review commission are further considered. Finally, the report discussespotential success factors for commissions and potential alternatives or complements to acommission. A short version of this report is available ( CRS Report RS21980 , ProposedCommission on the Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies (CARFA): A Brief Overview ). This report will be updated as events warrant."
