Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development should consult with other heads of Federal agencies that own or hold properties appropriate for use as housing to determine whether to include such properties in the Community Partners Next Door program under NHA and other programs that make housing available for law enforcement officers, teachers, or fire fighters."
