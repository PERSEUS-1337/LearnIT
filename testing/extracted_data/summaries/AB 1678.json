    "title": "An act to amend Section 6228 of the Family Code, relating to domestic violence.",
    "content": "Existing law requires state and local law enforcement agencies to provide, without charging a fee, one copy of all domestic violence incident report face sheets and one copy of all domestic violence incident reports, or both, to a victim of domestic violence, as defined, or to his or her personal representative, as defined, upon request. This bill would also require state or local law enforcement agencies to provide a copy of those reports to a victim of sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, or abuse of an elder or a dependent adult, as defined. The bill would define \u201cvictim\u201d for these purposes to include a minor who is 12 years of age or older. The bill would require these provisions to apply to requests for reports made within 2 years from the date of completion of the sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, or abuse of an elder or a dependent adult incident report. This bill would also make technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions. By increasing the duties of local law enforcement agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
