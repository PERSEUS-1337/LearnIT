Revises requirements for the use of allocations to states from the Housing Trust Fund for low-income rental housing. Requires that all rental housing dwelling units be subject to legally binding commitments that ensure that the contribution toward rent by a resident family shall not exceed 30 of the family's adjusted income. Requires the HUD Secretary to credit certain amounts from the Housing Trust Fund to the Emergency Homeowners' Relief Fund for emergency mortgage assistance. Amends the Emergency Housing Act of 1975 to: (1) increase the maximum aggregate amount of insured emergency mortgage loans and advances. And (2) extend through FY2011 the program for insured loans and emergency mortgage relief payments made under the Act. Amends EESA to reduce the TARP authorization limit in order to offset the costs of loans, advances, insurance, and appropriations authorized under this Act."
