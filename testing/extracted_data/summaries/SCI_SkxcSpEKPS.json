    "content": "In the industrial field, the positron annihilation is not affected by complex environment, and the gamma-ray photon penetration is strong, so the nondestructive detection of industrial parts can be realized. Due to the poor image quality caused by gamma-ray photon scattering, attenuation and short sampling time in positron process, we propose the idea of combining deep learning to generate positron images with good quality and clear details by adversarial nets. The structure of the paper is as follows: firstly, we encode to get the hidden vectors of medical CT images based on transfer Learning, and use PCA to extract positron image features. Secondly, we construct a positron image memory based on attention mechanism as a whole input to the adversarial nets which uses medical hidden variables as a query. Finally, we train the whole model jointly and update the input parameters until convergence. Experiments have proved the possibility of generating rare positron images for industrial non-destructive testing using countermeasure networks, and good imaging results have been achieved. In recent years, with the advancement of science and technology, especially the rapid development of high-end manufacturing, in the field of industrial non-destructive testing, in many cases, it is necessary to perform defect detection without damaging or affecting the performance and internal structure of the device under test. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for corresponding detection devices. In complex industrial environments (such as aviation, internal combustion engines, chemical engineering, etc.), it is of great research significance to detect faults and defects in closed chambers. In this paper, the use of positron annihilation gamma photon imaging positron emission imaging technology for industrial nondestructive testing is studied. The occurrence of positron annihilation is not affected by factors such as high temperature, high pressure, corrosion, etc., so it can penetrate the dense metal material cavity, realize the undisturbed and non-destructive trace imaging of the detected object, and obtain the detected object after processing. Describe the image and perform a state analysis. Therefore, the quality of imaging technology directly affects the analysis of fault detection results. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) was first used in medical imaging. The principle is that when a radioactive positron nucleus decays, a proton in the nucleus is converted into a neutron, and a positron and a neutron are released. The positron will quickly combine with the electrons in the material in a very short time, causing a positron annihilation phenomenon, producing a pair of gamma photon pairs with opposite directions and energy of 511KeV. Photon pairs are collected, identified, processed, and finally reconstructed to obtain medical images. Commonly used PET reconstruction algorithms are analytic method (K, 2000) and statistical method (Shepp & Vardi, 2007) . The currently widely used algorithms are MLEM and OSEM. At present, PET technology has been widely used in the clinical diagnosis of human diseases. The advantages are quite obvious, the imaging quality is higher, and it shows great advantages in medical research. The principle of positron emission in industrial non-destructive fields is similar to medical imaging, but it has its own unique difficulties: the detection environment is more harsh, the sampling time is short, and at the same time, due to the phenomenon of scattering and attenuation of photons, industrial positron imaging is obtained. The image quality is even worse. Therefore, the reconstructed image needs to be further processed to obtain a higher quality image. In this paper, we propose adversarial networks of positron image memory module based on attention mechanism. Using medical images as basic data sets, introducing knowledge of migration learning, building memory module according to the contribution of detail features to images, a positron image generation network in the field of industrial non-destructive testing is obtained through joint training, thus achieving higher quality generation of industrial positron images. In summary, our main contributions in this paper are as follows: We are the first to advocate an idea of using Generative Adversarial Networks to enhance the detail of the positron image in the industrial non-destructive field, and realize the generation and processing of the scarce image data in the professional field. We use the medical CT image dataset as the basic training sample of the network framework, which is based on the idea of migration learning, and then extract the features of a small number of industrial non-destructively detected positron images, which can improve the details of the generated images, and make the network model have better applicability in the field of industrial non-destructive testing. We combine the attention-based mechanism in the professional domain image feature extraction. By constructing a memory module containing industrial positron image features, we can generate image generation in a specific domain, and finally conduct an industrial lossless positron image generation model. We train the whole network jointly, through the discriminant network of the antagonistic generation network, the front-end network was back-propagated, the input parameters were updated, and the model was optimized. Finally, the convergence was achieved and The Turing test was passed successfully. In this paper, we introduce an application of GAN in the field of nondestructive testing for specific industries. We combine the knowledge of transfer learning to make up the problem of insufficient data. The key point is to introduce attention mechanism to construct a positron image feature memory module, which can reuse image features under the condition of scarce data. At the same time, an attention loss function is added to the discriminative net to further improve the generator performance. Experiments show that compared with the start-of-the-art generation methods in deep learning, the model in our paper has an obvious improvement in the quality of industrial positron image generation. In the future, our focus is to further study the application of generative adversarial networks in industrial positron image processing, and to further improve the quality of domain images."
