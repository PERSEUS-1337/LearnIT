    "content": "Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2105 This bill amends the federal criminal code to prohibit human cloning for reproductive and research purposes. Specifically, the bill makes it a crime for any public or private person or entity to: perform, attempt to perform, or participate in an attempt to perform human cloning. Or ship, receive, or import a product of human cloning for any purpose. It defines human cloning as asexual reproduction by replacing a fertilized or unfertilized egg nucleus with a human somatic (body) cell nucleus to produce a living organism with a human or predominantly human genetic constitution. A person or entity convicted of a human cloning offense is subject to a fine, up to 10 years in prison, or both. A person or entity who profits from such offense is also subject to a civil penalty of at least $1,000,000. This bill does not restrict scientific research using nuclear transfer or other cloning techniques to produce molecules, DNA, cells other than human embryos, tissues, organs, plants, or animals other than humans."
