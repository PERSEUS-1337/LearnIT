Revises the definition of regulated transaction to exclude specified transactions involving drugs or products that the Attorney General determines are being diverted for illicit purposes. Places restrictions on the sale of list I and schedule V pseudoephedrine products. Requires a registrant of list I products to: (1) place the products where the customers do not have direct access to them. (2) maintain a sales logbook that identifies the products, purchasers, dates, and times of sales. And (3) not sell such a product to persons under age 18. Prohibits a registrant of schedule V products that do not require prescriptions from dispensing such a product to a prospective purchaser under age 18. Sets penalties for violations.
