    "content": "Violence between domestic partners is not a new phenomenon. Children who witness suchviolence, however, have increasingly become a concern of policymakers. Since 1999, several federalprograms and initiatives have been created to address the problems of children who witness domesticviolence, and several new initiatives were enacted in the 109th Congress. The Safe Start Initiative was authorized by legislation in 1999 ( P.L. 105-277 ) to prevent andreduce the effects of family and community violence on young children from birth to age six. In2000, Congress reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act and created the Safe Havens forChildren Pilot Program to provide supervised and safe visitation exchange of children by andbetween parents in situations involving domestic violence. In 2001, the Stop Family Violencepostage stamp was created, directing the U.S. Postal Service to issue a semi-postal stamp to allowthe public an opportunity to contribute toward domestic violence funding. Proceeds from the saleswere transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for domestic violenceprevention programs, specifically the Safe and Bright Futures for Children Program, and theDemonstration of Enhanced Services to Children and Youth Who Have Been Exposed to DomesticViolence. To date, proceeds from the stamp have generated $3.0 million. Furthermore, funds havebeen authorized under the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act to assist children exposedto domestic violence, if appropriations exceed $130 million in a fiscal year. To date, appropriationshave not exceeded that amount. The Greenbook Initiative is a federal multi-agency demonstration project that implementsthe suggested guidelines for policy and practice of the National Council of Juvenile and FamilyCourt Judges, and is designed to assist child welfare, domestic violence agencies, and family courtsin responding more effectively when domestic violence and child maltreatment occursimultaneously. Since FY2001, six communities have been funded through the federal GreenbookDemonstration Initiative. The impact on children of exposure to domestic violence was an issue in the 109th Congress. At the end of the first session, Congress passed the Violence Against Women and Department ofJustice Reauthorization Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-162 ), which contained a series of new initiatives. New programs would provide services to assist youth who have been victims of domestic and datingviolence, sexual assault, and stalking; support training and collaborative efforts of service providerswho assist families in which domestic violence and child maltreatment occur simultaneously; enablemiddle and high schools to train relevant school personnel to assist student victims of such violence,holding perpetrators accountable; and combat such violence on college campuses."
