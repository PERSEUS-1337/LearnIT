    "title": "AB 1922",
    "content": "Existing law prohibits a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy or endorsement from being issued by an insurer unless the insurer files a copy of the form or endorsement with a rating organization and 30 days have expired from the date the form or endorsement is received by the Insurance Commissioner from the rating organization without notice from the commissioner, unless the commissioner gives written approval of the form or the endorsement prior to that time. This bill would prohibit an ancillary agreement, as defined, to a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy from being issued by an insurer to a California employer, as defined, unless the insurer files a copy of the ancillary agreement with a rating organization and 30 days have expired from the date the ancillary agreement is received by the commissioner from the rating organization without notice from the commissioner unless the commissioner gives written approval of the ancillary agreement prior to that time. The prohibition would not apply to an ancillary agreement between an insurer and a California employer issued in conjunction with a workers\u2019 compensation policy or endorsement that contains a deductible obligation or retrospectively rated loss limitation and meets specified criteria. The bill would authorize an insurer to use such an ancillary agreement and would require an insurer to submit a copy of that ancillary agreement to the commissioner within 30 days of issuing the ancillary agreement. The bill would provide that the terms and conditions of a workers\u2019 compensation policy and any endorsements take precedence over the provisions contained in an ancillary agreement in the case of an inconsistency or conflict between the policy or endorsement and the ancillary agreement. The bill would make additional changes relating to collateral and security agreements, as defined. The changes made by the bill would apply to ancillary agreements issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2017. The bill would also make conforming changes. The changes made by the bill would apply only until January 1, 2022."
