    "title": "AB 236",
    "content": "Existing law requires a person who weighs, measures, or counts a commodity and issues a statement or memorandum of the weight, measure, or count that is used as the basis for either the purchase or sale of that commodity or charge for service, to obtain a license as a weighmaster from the Department of Food and Agriculture, and imposes a license fee and various other requirements on weighmasters. Existing law exempts specified persons from those provisions by establishing a list of persons who are not weighmasters. Existing law, until January 1, 2019, requires the department to require a recycler or junk dealer who is an applicant for a new weighmaster license or a renewal of a weighmaster license to furnish specified additional information on the application. This bill would add licensed pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers to the list of persons who are not weighmasters and would specify that pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers are exempt from the above-described provision applicable to a junk dealer or recycler who is an applicant for a weighmaster license."
