    "title": "An act to amend Section 4214 of the Public Resources Code, relating to fire prevention.",
    "content": "Existing law requires the State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection to adopt emergency regulations to establish a fire prevention fee in an amount not to exceed $150 to be charged on each habitable structure, as defined, on a parcel that is within a state responsibility area, as defined. Existing law requires the state board to adjust the fire prevention fee annually using prescribed methods, and requires the state board, until January 31, 2017, to submit a report to the Legislature every January 31 on the status and uses of the fund, containing specified information and recommendations. This bill would instead require the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to submit that report to the Legislature and the board, and would extend to January 31, 2021, the time until which the state board report is required to submit the report to the Legislature, and be submitted. The bill would additionally require that the report include specified information on each program, subprogram, and element for which the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection department uses money generated from that fire prevention fee, and other information regarding fund expenditures, as provided."
