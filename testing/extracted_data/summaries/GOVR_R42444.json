    "content": "Until its expiration at the end of December 2013, the temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08) program provided additional federal unemployment insurance benefits to eligible individuals who had exhausted all available benefits from their state Unemployment Compensation (UC) programs. Congress created the EUC08 program in 2008 and amended the original, authorizing law (P.L. 110-252) 11 times. No EUC08 benefits are currently available. The last extension of EUC08 under P.L. 112-240, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, authorized EUC08 benefits until the week ending on or before January 1, 2014 (i.e., December 28, 2013; or December 29, 2013, in New York State). Prior to program expiration, the potential duration of EUC08 benefits available to eligible individuals depended on state unemployment rates. Figure A-1 provides the sequence, availability, and total maximum duration of all unemployment benefits prior to the expiration of EUC08. This report summarizes the structure of EUC08 benefits available prior to program expiration at the end of calendar year 2013. It also provides the legislative history of the EUC08 program."
