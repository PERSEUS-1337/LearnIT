    "title": "To require the Secretary of Energy to implement country-of-origin disclosure requirements with respect to motor vehicle fuels, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "Country-of-Origin Labeling for Fuels Act - Directs the Secretary of Energy to study and report to Congress with recommendations for appropriate methods and standards for requiring: (1) motor vehicle fuel suppliers to disclose to the next person in the motor vehicle fuel supply chain information regarding each country in which the fuel or any of its components were extracted, refined, or otherwise processed. And (2) motor vehicle retailers to disclose this information to consumers. Requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations requiring disclosure of country-of-origin information by motor vehicle fuel suppliers and retailers in accordance with such recommendations. Prohibits such regulations, however, from requiring the listing of more than one country-of-origin for a fuel blend containing fuel 70 or more of which originated in a single country. Authorizes the Secretary to impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 on any person that knowingly violates such regulations."
