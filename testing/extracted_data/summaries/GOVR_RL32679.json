    "content": "The federal government operates two major student loan programs: the Federal FamilyEducation Loan (FFEL) program, authorized by Part B of Title IV of the Higher Education Act(HEA), and the William D. Ford Direct Loan (DL) program, authorized by Part D of Title IV of theHEA. These programs provide loans to undergraduate and graduate students and the parents ofundergraduate students to help them meet the costs of postsecondary education. Together, theseprograms provide more direct aid to support students' postsecondary educational pursuits than anyother source. In FY2003, they provided $45.8 billion in new loans to students and their parents. The HEA is being considered for reauthorization. This report discusses issues concerningthe FFEL and DL student loan programs that are likely to be considered during reauthorization. Issues that are expected to receive attention include borrower interest rates, loan fees,refinance opportunities, and annual and aggregate loan limits. Additionally, it is likely thatconsiderable attention will be devoted to promoting greater comparability between the loan termsand conditions made available to borrowers in the FFEL and DL programs. In general, helping students by enhancing their benefits is a goal upon which many can agree,but finding offsetting revenues is often a challenge. It is therefore likely that some effort will bemade to identify savings in the loan programs' mandatory spending that could be used to offset costsassociated with enhancements in borrower benefits, or that could be used to finance other studentaid expenditures. This report will be updated as events warrant."
