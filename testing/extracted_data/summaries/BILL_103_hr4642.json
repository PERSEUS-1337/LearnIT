Requires such standards to provide for the use of the most cost-efficient design and materials that are consistent with the historical values of the Square and suitable for inclusion in the Park. Prohibits such grant from being used to fund more than 66.6 percent of the costs of such restoration. Requires Federal funds, other than those authorized to be appropriated under this Act, that are appropriated for the purpose of restoring the Square, to be used to offset any funds made available to the National Park Service pursuant to this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1995. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter into an agreement with Philadelphia for the lease of the restored Square to the Service in an amount not to exceed one dollar per year. (2) acquire such Square or an interest in it by donation, (3) modify the Park's boundaries to include the Square. And (4) provide for the administration of the Square as part of the Park. Requires Philadelphia to provide, without cost to the Government, services for the Square with respect to electricity, natural gas, water and sewer, curbside garbage collection of bagged trash or receipt of hauled trash at a city collection point, and police services comparable to those provided in the surrounding community."
