    "content": "STRONG Budget Act of 2010 - Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to require a second, general sequestration within 15 days after the end of any session of Congress if, first, a particular sequestration occurs at that time under the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. Requires the general sequestration to equal 2 of the budget baseline for the fiscal year beginning on October 1 of the calendar year during which such sequestration occurs. Prohibits such sequestration order from reducing: (1) benefits payable under title II (OASDI) of the Social Security Act (SSA). (2) annuities payable to certain employees under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974. (3) benefits payable under any program administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or Special Benefits for Certain World War II Veterans (28-0401-0-1-701). (4) benefits payable under SSA title IV part A (TANF) relating to hospital insurance benefits for the aged and disabled, (5) payments for net interest. And (6) other specified federal retirement and disability accounts. Requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), within 14 days after the end of a session, to issue an annual deficit reduction report and, if the report requires a sequestration, to prepare and the President to issue a sequestration order reducing nonexempt accounts by enough to eliminate the deficit. Prohibits such reduction, however, from exceeding 2 of the total amount of such nonexempt accounts. Provides for: (1) suspension of such sequestration procedures if OMB determines that the federal budget is not in deficit. And (2) restoration of such procedures in the first fiscal year after OMB determines there is a deficit. Amends Rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives to prohibit legislation carrying an additional exemption to sequestrations under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act from being considered as passed or agreed to unless by a vote of at least three-fifths of the Members."
