    "content": "The foreign relations authorization process dovetails with the annual appropriation processfor the Department of State, foreign policy, and foreign assistance. Congress is required by law toauthorize the spending of appropriations for the State Department and foreign policy activities everytwo years. The last time Congress passed a stand-alone foreign relations authorization bill was inFY2003 ( P.L. 107-228 ). Foreign assistance authorization measures (such as authorization for the U.S. Agency forInternational Development, economic and military assistance to foreign countries, and internationalpopulation programs) typically have been merged into the State Department authorization legislationsince 1985. Since that time, Congress has not passed a stand-alone foreign assistance authorizationbill. On March 10, 2005, Senator Lugar introduced S. 600 . The bill includesappropriations for the Department of State, international broadcasting, the Peace Corps, and foreignassistance programs for FY2006 and FY2007. In early April, the Senate debated S. 600on the Senate floor. The measure is stalled for now with the introduction of numerous flooramendments. Congressman Christopher H. Smith introduced a foreign relations authorization bill( H.R. 2601 ) on May 24, 2005. The bill was marked up at the subcommittee and fullcommittee level in late May and early June. House floor action occurred the week of July 18th. The House and Senate legislation contain similar titles regarding authorization language forthe Department of State, international organizations, and international broadcasting; StateDepartment organization and personnel issues, and miscellaneous reporting requirements. S. 600 goes beyond H.R. 2601 on foreign assistance authorization andnumerous other foreign policy issues including avian flu, debt relief, global pathogen surveillance,safe water, and reconstruction and stabilization initiatives. Issues covered in H.R. 2601,but not significantly in S. 600 include democracy promotion, U.N. reform, strategic exportcontrols, missile and nuclear nonproliferation measures, and World Bank loans to Iran. This report will be updated as legislative action occurs.
