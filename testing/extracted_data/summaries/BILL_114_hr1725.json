Amends the Public Health Service Act to revise and reauthorize through FY2020 the controlled substance monitoring program, including to: allow grants to be used to maintain and operate existing state controlled substance monitoring programs, require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to redistribute any funds that are returned among the remaining grantees, require a state to provide HHS with aggregate data and other information to enable HHS to evaluate the success of the state's program, and expand the program to include any commonwealth or territory of the United States. Allows the Drug Enforcement Administration, HHS, a state Medicaid program, a state health department, or a state substance abuse agency receiving nonidentifiable information from a controlled substance monitoring database for research purposes to make that information available to other entities for research purposes. Requires a state receiving a grant to: (1) facilitate prescriber and dispenser use of the state's controlled substance monitoring system, and (2) educate prescribers and dispensers on the benefits of the system both to them and society."
