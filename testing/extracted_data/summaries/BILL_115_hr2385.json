    "content": "Tariff Inversion Jobs Act of 2017 This bill directs the US International Trade Commission to submit to Congress a report that: (1) identifies tariff inversions in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) that create an incentive for US companies to move production out of the United States, and (2) includes recommendations for measures that could be taken to eliminate such inversions. Tariff inversions occur when the duty rate for the final product is lower than the duty rate of the component parts. The bill amends the HTS to provide for the duty-free treatment of flat panel displays and main boards for televisions."
