    "content": "School Asthma Management Plan Act Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Department of Education (ED) to award grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to enable public elementary schools and secondary schools to: (1) develop and implement a school asthma management plan. And (2) purchase drugs and devices for emergency use that are approved or cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, including bronchodilators, spacers, and inhalers for students served by the school, as well as devices that measure pulmonary function or asthma education tools. Authorizes ED to award a grant to a local health or education department to carry out such activities upon determining that in such local area such department is the entity that would routinely carry out such activities. Requires ED to give priority in awarding grants to: (1) any LEA that will use grant funds to assist a public elementary school or secondary school that has a high burden of asthma, and (2) any department that proposes to carry out the grant activities at such a school. Requires grantees to: (1) find innovative ways to encourage rapid bidirectional communication between schools and students' physicians and students' adherence to asthma treatment, (2) ensure that they have on staff a nurse or individual who is trained to administer emergency asthma care, (3) ensure that all student asthma action plans include asthma triggers, both allergens and irritants, for the student. And (4) ensure that each school served under the grant reports asthma emergency events involving students to the state health department by school identifier."
