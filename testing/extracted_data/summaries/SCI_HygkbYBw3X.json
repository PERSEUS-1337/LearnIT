    "content": "In this paper, we introduce a novel method to interpret recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) at the cellular level. We propose a systematic pipeline for interpreting individual hidden state dynamics within the network using response characterization methods. The ranked contribution of individual cells to the network's output is computed by analyzing a set of interpretable metrics of their decoupled step and sinusoidal responses. As a result, our method is able to uniquely identify neurons with insightful dynamics, quantify relationships between dynamical properties and test accuracy through ablation analysis, and interpret the impact of network capacity on a network's dynamical distribution. Finally, we demonstrate generalizability and scalability of our method by evaluating a series of different benchmark sequential datasets. In this paper, we proposed a method for response characterization for LSTM networks to predict cell-contributions to the overall decision of a learned network on both the cell and network-level resolution. We further verified and validated our predictions by performing an ablation analysis to identify cell's which contribution heavily to the network's output decision with our simple response characterization method. The resulting method establishes a novel building block for interpreting LSTM networks. The LSTM network's dynamic-space is broad and cannot be fully captured by fundamental input sequences. However, our methodology demonstrates that practical sub-regions of dynamics are reachable by response metrics which we use to build a systematic testbench for LSTM interpretability. We have open-sourced our algorithm to encourage other researchers to further explore dynamics of LSTM cells and interpret the kinetics of their sequential models.In the future, we aim to extend our approach to even more data modalities and analyze the training phase of LSTMs to interpret the learning of the converged dynamics presented in this work.7 Acknowledgment"
