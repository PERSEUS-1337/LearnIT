Empowers the Secretary to order suspension of operations and cancel the lease if such a certification is not forthcoming within the deadline. Requires the Secretary to: (1) review blowout preventers, emergency shutoff systems, and other oil discharge prevention technology used for oil and gas drilling operations. And (2) revise as necessary regulations governing the use of such technology based upon such review."
