    "content": "The January 2, 2020, U.S. killing in Iraq of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) Commander Qasem Soleimani, generally regarded as one of the most powerful and important officials in Iran, has potentially dramatic implications for the United States. For Congress, it raises possible questions about U.S. policy in the Middle East, broader U.S. global strategy, U.S. relations with partners and allies, the authorization and legality of U.S. military action abroad, U.S. measures to protect its servicemembers and diplomatic personnel, and congressional oversight of these and related issues. This report provides background information in response to some frequently asked questions related to the strike and its aftermath, including Who was Qasem Soleimani and why did the U.S. military kill him? How have Iranians reacted? How have Iraqis reacted and how does this impact Iraqi policy and government formation? How might the strike and Iraqi reactions impact the U.S. military presence in Iraq and the U.S.-led counter-ISIS campaign (Operation Inherent Resolve)? How does the killing of Soleimani impact Israel and its security? What has been the European reaction? Under what authority did the U.S. military carry out the strike? How have Members of Congress responded legislatively or otherwise? What is the U.S. force posture in the region? How do recent regional developments align with broader U.S. strategy? The information contained in this report, which will be updated periodically as events warrant, is current as of January 13, 2020.
