    "content": "The 2005 round of military base realignments and closures (BRAC) is now underway. TheDefense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (Base Closure Act), as amended, establishesmandatory procedures to be followed throughout the BRAC process and identifies criteria to be usedin formulating BRAC recommendations. However, judicial review is unlikely to be available toremedy alleged failures to comply with the Base Closure Act's provisions. A synopsis of the relevantlaw regarding the availability of judicial review in this context is included below: The actions of the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) and the independent BRACCommission (Commission) are not considered to be \"final agency action,\" and thus cannot bejudicially reviewed pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Even if a court determined that the actions of the Secretary and the Commission were \"final agency action,\" the court would likely consider the case to fall under oneof two APA exceptions to judicial review: (1) when statutes preclude judicial review or (2) whenagency action is committed to agency discretion by law. The President's actions cannot be judicially reviewed under the APA, becausethe President is not an \"agency\" covered by the statute. A claim that the President exceeded his statutory authority under the BaseClosure Act has been held to be judicially unreviewable, because the Base Closure Act gives thePresident broad discretion in approving or disapproving BRACrecommendations. Thus, courts would likely allow the BRAC process to proceed even if the Department ofDefense, the Commission, or the President did not comply with the Base Closure Act's requirements. This report was prepared by [author name scrubbed], Law Clerk, under the general supervision of[author name scrubbed], Legislative Attorney. It will be updated as case developments warrant."
