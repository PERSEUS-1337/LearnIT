    "content": "The Jenkins Act requires out-of-state sellers of cigarettes to register and file a report with the states in which they sell cigarettes listing the name, address, and quantity of cigarettes sold to state residents. In the past, the states would use this information to collect taxes from the buyers directly. However, with the rise of Internet sales of cigarettes, compliance with the Jenkins Act was very low, and it was estimated that billions of dollars of state and local taxes went unpaid. In 2010, Congress passed the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act (PACT Act), which amends the Jenkins Act, to address this problem. The PACT Act requires remote retailers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco\u2014that is, retailers who sell without an in-person transaction with the buyer\u2014to pay the state and local taxes of the jurisdiction in which the buyer receives the goods. Three remote retailers have challenged the PACT Act in federal courts seeking to enjoin enforcement of the act, claiming that forcing remote sellers to pay state and local taxes violates due process. The Supreme Court held in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \"requires some definite link, some minimum connection, between a state and the person, property, or transaction it seeks to tax and that the income attributed to the State for tax purposes must be rationally related to values connected with the taxing State.\" In Red Earth LLC v. United States and Gordon v. Holder, the federal district courts for the Western District of New York and the District of Columbia, respectively, issued preliminary injunctions, concluding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in demonstrating that the PACT Act violates due process because it subjects the retailers to the taxing authority of foreign states regardless of whether they have the required minimum contacts with the taxing jurisdictions. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the Red Earth preliminary injunction, and the United States has appealed the preliminary injunction issued in Gordon to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In Musser's Inc. v. United States, the federal district court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania rejected the due process argument, concluding that because the PACT Act is federal legislation, the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, which applies to states, do not apply. The PACT Act, the Musser's court determined, is not different in principle from other federal statutes that incorporate state laws. In any event, the court determined, because the plaintiff took orders over the Internet, it had minimum contacts in the jurisdictions into which it shipped tobacco products. The Supreme Court stated in Quill: \"While Congress has plenary power to regulate commerce among the states and may thus authorize state actions that burden interstate commerce, it does not similarly have the power to authorize violations of the Due Process Clause.\" In Gordon, the district court for the District of Columbia characterized the issue as whether one sale into a taxing jurisdiction satisfied the due process requirement for minimum contacts, and concluded it did not. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in upholding the preliminary injunction in Red Earth, described the issue as a \"close question.\""
