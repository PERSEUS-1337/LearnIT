    "title": "Reading Research Dissemination and Implementation Act",
    "content": "Directs the SPT to submit to the Secretary of Education a plan that determines and identifies: (1) the extent to which current teacher preparation for both preservice and inservice training incorporates NRP findings, and how barriers to such incorporation can be changed to integrate such findings into programs to educate and certify teachers. (2) deficiencies in instructional materials, and how materials might be designed to correct deficiencies in ways that reflect NRP findings. (3) whether there are barriers in Federal and State policies that would preclude appropriate adoption of NRP findings. And (4) specific strategies for collaboration among businesses, public schools, teacher education programs, university and college administrators, and teacher-parent collaborations to guide and ensure that evidence-based instructional practices are implemented in teacher preparation, classroom instruction, and Federal and State policies. Directs the Secretary of Education to implement such plan."
