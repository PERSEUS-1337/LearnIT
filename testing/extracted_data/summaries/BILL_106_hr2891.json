    "content": "Competitive Access to Federal Buildings Act - Amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to authorize the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to: (1) implement policies for federally-owned buildings and structures for providing non-discriminatory access to such buildings and structures for the provision of telecommunications or information services by telecommunications carriers. And (2) advise the Federal Communications Commission on the development of such policies for commercial property. Prohibits a Federal agency from entering into a contract to rent or lease commercial property unless the property owner or operator permits such non-discriminatory access for a carrier that has obtained, where required, a Federal or State certificate of public convenience and necessity for the provision of such services and that seeks to provide such services to tenants. Allows such owner or operator to: (1) charge a reasonable fee for such access. And (2) impose other reasonable, non-discriminatory requirements in connection with such access. Prohibits a Federal agency from entering into a contract with an owner or operator unless such owner or operator agrees to resolve disputes regarding such access. Authorizes the waiver of this Act's prohibitions on a case-by-case basis: (1) by a Federal agency head when such agency would be unable to obtain any suitable space in that area. And (2) by the President for national security reasons. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Telecommunications and Information, to promulgate final rules to apply the requirements of this Act to all Federal buildings and structures."
