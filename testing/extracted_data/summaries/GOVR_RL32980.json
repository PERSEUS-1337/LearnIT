    "content": "Enforcement of child support often results in custodial parents and noncustodial parentsbeing in an adversarial relationship. Noncustodial parents often view it as an unbalancedrelationship, because custodial parents have access to a network of federal and state resources (e.g.,the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) agency and the welfare agency) that are not available to thenoncustodial parent. Pending welfare reauthorization legislation ( H.R. 240 and S. 667 )includes incentives for states to send more of the child support collected on behalf of custodialparents to the family itself, additional CSE enforcement tools, funding for marriage promotionprograms for low-income persons, and funding for programs designed to help noncustodial fathersmeet both their financial and emotional responsibilities to their children. Supporters of the welfarereauthorization legislation claim that its passage will result in more noncustodial parents paying childsupport. They contend that noncustodial parents who can afford to, but do not, pay child support willnot be able to escape their duty because of the strong enforcement apparatus, and that noncustodialparents who cannot afford to pay will be offered services that may improve their financial ability topay, as well as their willingness to pay. In situations in which noncustodial parents find themselves at loggerheads with custodialparents and the CSE system with respect to paternity and child support, some have encouraged legalservices providers to play a more \"balanced\" role. They maintain that providing legal services tononcustodial parents could result in child support payments becoming a more reliable source ofincome for custodial parents if noncustodial parents were provided better access to the legal systemand were satisfied that \"they had their day in court\" and thereby more amenable to paying childsupport. This report describes some of the child support issues faced by noncustodial parents anddiscusses areas in which legal services providers funded by the Legal Services Corporation (LSC)are authorized to support poor noncustodial parents. The LSC is a private, non-profit, federally funded corporation established by Congress toprovide financial support for civil legal assistance for persons unable to afford legal help. InFY2004, the LSC distributed $316.6 million of its $335.3 million appropriation in the form of grantsto 143 local legal services programs. Local programs provide legal assistance to individuals basedon locally determined priorities that meet local community conditions and needs. Thus, to a certainextent, it is necessary for noncustodial parents to advocate on their own behalf, that is, to make thecommunities in which they live aware of the problems that they face with regard to counteringunjustified allegations of paternity, obtaining fair child support orders, meeting their child supportobligations, getting child support orders modified when they have a change in financialcircumstances, seeking custody or visitation rights, and re-establishing family and community tiesafter incarceration. With only an estimated 20% of eligible clients receiving legal services (whenthey need such services), low-income noncustodial parents must now compete to be included asclients in a program that does not have the resources to serve all who are eligible for its services. This report will not be updated."
