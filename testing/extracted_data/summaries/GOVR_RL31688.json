    "content": "The 108th Congress will be faced early on with a number of pressing foreign affairs, defense, and trade issues. This report provides background information on the issues most likely to be takenup in the first session, analyzes the congressional role in shaping U.S. policy on these key issues, andlists CRS products that provide more detailed discussion and analysis. The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon dramatically altered the U.S. political environment, pushing issues of war and homeland security to the top of the policy agenda. Of particular concern to 108th Congress as it begins its first session will be the progress of theongoing war on terrorism, a possible war with Iraq, the unfolding crisis with North Korea, anddealing with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and missiles. Each of thesetopics receives particular attention in this report. This report also describes foreign policy tools that the 108th Congress will consider in dealing with a wide range of challenges affecting U.S. interests around the globe. It discusses major foreigneconomic and security assistance programs which Congress may consider funding, including theMillennium Challenge Account, global HIV/AIDS programs, humanitarian aid to Afghanistan,counter-terrorism activities in Southeast Asia and Africa, and possible reconstruction andhumanitarian assistance in Iraq. It examines how U.S. relations with NATO and policies towardcountries such as Iraq, Iran, North Korea, China, Russia, and Pakistan may affect U.S.counter-terrorism and non-proliferation efforts. Other issues covered include potential global flashpoints - such as the Israel-Palestinian conflict, China-Taiwan relations, and the Balkans - and U.S.concerns in Latin America, such as drug trafficking. A number of defense issues are likely to receive considerable attention in the 108th Congress, including managing defense related costs within budgetary constraints, guiding Department ofDefense (DOD) \"transformation\" initiatives, setting priorities on major weapons systems, andassessing whether the military is the proper size to meet the demands of current or anticipatedmissions. Other defense issues covered include whether to allow \"concurrent receipt\" of militaryretired pay and Veterans' Administration disability benefits, the appropriate role of DOD inhomeland security, and oversight of reforms in defense management and business operations. Congressional consideration of U.S. bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) with Chile and Singapore, and other trade issues are discussed in this report as well. The 108th Congress will likelymonitor U.S. negotiations on FTAs with Morocco, Central America, the South Africa CustomsUnion, Australia, and countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Its agendamay include WTO compliance issues, the re-authorization of the Export Administration Act, the FreeTrade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA), and the Doha Development Agenda.
