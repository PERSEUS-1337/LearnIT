    "title": "Hunting Heritage Protection Act",
    "content": "Directs the head of each Federal agency with authority to manage a natural resource or public lands on which such a resource depends to exercise that authority in a manner so as to support, promote, and enhance recreational hunting opportunities. Declares that Federal land management decisions and actions should result in no net loss of land area available for hunting opportunities on Federal public lands. Requires the heads of Federal agencies with authority to manage Federal public lands on which recreational hunting occurs to report annually to specified congressional committees on areas administered that have been closed during the previous year to recreational hunting and reasons for such closures and on areas that were open to such hunting to compensate for closed areas. Grants States the right to file civil actions in district courts in cases where Federal agencies fail to comply with State authority to manage or regulate fish and wildlife. Establishes a National Recreational Hunting Coordination Council to develop a recreational hunting and wildlife resource conservation plan for Federal public lands. Terminates the Council on the earlier of the date of submission of the final plan or three years after this Act's enactment date. Authorizes appropriations."
