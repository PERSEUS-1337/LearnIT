    "content": "Repeals provisions in the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001, that required the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to: (1) modify rules authorizing the operation of low-power FM radio stations to prescribe minimum distance separations for third-adjacent channels. (2) prohibit applicants who have engaged in the unlicensed operation of any station from obtaining a low-power FM license. And (3) conduct a program to test whether low-power FM radio stations will result in harmful interference to existing FM radio stations if minimum distance separations for third-adjacent channels are not required. Requires the FCC to modify its rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements between specified stations. Requires the FCC to retain rules that provide third-adjacent channel protection for full-power noncommercial FM stations that broadcast radio reading services via a subcarrier frequency from potential low-power FM station interference. Requires the FCC to retain its rules that provide third-adjacent channel protection for full-power FM stations that are licensed in significantly populated States with more than 3 million housing units and a population density greater than 1,000 people per square mile. Requires the FCC to: (1) evaluate the impact of translator licensing on low and full power radio stations. And (2) implement policies that promote opportunities for locally based low power radio stations while protecting full power stations from harmful interference from translator networks."
