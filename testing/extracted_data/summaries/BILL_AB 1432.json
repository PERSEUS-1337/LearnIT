    "title": "AB 1432",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the regulation and licensure of pilots for Monterey Bay and the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun by the Board of Pilot Commissioners for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun within the Transportation Agency. Existing law prescribes the rates of bar pilotage fees and other surcharges required to be charged by pilots and paid by vessels inward or outward bound through those bays. Existing law, until January 1, 2011, authorized the board to authorize a movement fee, to be paid as a navigation technology surcharge, in order to recover the pilots\u2019 costs for the purchase, lease, or maintenance of navigation software, hardware, and ancillary equipment purchased after November 5, 2008, and before January 1, 2011. This bill would, until January 1, 2021, authorize the board to authorize that fee, not to exceed a cumulative amount of $1,200,000, to be paid as a navigation technology surcharge, in order to recover the pilots\u2019 costs for that software, hardware, and ancillary equipment that is authorized by the board as reasonable and necessary on or after January 1, 2017."
