Those furnaces are the most common type of home heating appliance. While the scope of the report is limited to that one type of furnace, much of the discussion also applies to standards for other furnaces and to standards for residential central air conditioners and heat pumps. A 1987 statutory congressional directive set gas furnace standards for 1992 and directed the Department of Energy (DOE) to consider raising the standards in 1994 and 2007. DOE's responses were challenged in court twice (2005, 2007). The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) authorized DOE to set new standards for residential natural gas furnaces and certain other equipment. EISA Section 306 empowered DOE to set both a \"technical\" standard for manufacturers (a base national standard) and a regional \"installation\" standard for distributors and contractors. The regional standard concept aims to address geographic differences in heating needs. This law marked the first time that Congress authorized DOE to set regional standards. All other previous DOE energy efficiency standards for consumer products\u2014whether set by law or by DOE rule\u2014had only created a national technical standard for manufacturers. In that case, the compliance date served as a deadline only for manufacturers to have retooled their production lines, so that new equipment would comply with the new energy efficiency criteria. As the inventory of \"old\" equipment became exhausted, the \"new\" equipment from manufacturers would gradually replace it in the supply chain. Ultimately, the equipment distributors and residential installers at the end of the supply chain would have only the new equipment available to them. In contrast, the DOE-proposed regional gas furnace standard would have set the same compliance date for both manufacturers and installers. This would effectively move the scheduled implementation date down the supply chain from manufacturers, and thereby accelerate the change-over requirement date and shorten the \"sell-through\" adjustment period for furnace distributors and contractors. In another departure from past practice, EISA Section 308 specified that DOE could employ a direct final rule (DFR) process to implement the new regional standards. This is another policy innovation that had not been used previously in the appliance standard-making process. The DFR process\u2014which relies upon a preliminary consensus agreement among industry and energy efficiency groups\u2014differs from the \"traditional\" notice-and-comment process that had been used in all previous DOE rulemakings for consumer product energy efficiency standards. The two innovations\u2014regional standards and the DFR process\u2014led to new uncertainties and implementation design issues which, in late 2011, prompted an industry court challenge. In April 2014, the court adopted a negotiated settlement that directs DOE to reformulate the gas furnace rulemaking and directs that standards for air conditioners and heat pumps begin in 2015 and 2016. The final rule for gas furnaces had been set for May 2013\u2014but the new, revised rule is not expected to take effect before 2021 or 2022. In October 2014, gas industry groups raised the issue of separating gas furnace product classes in the revised rulemaking. One report suggests that the court-adopted settlement which directs DOE to \"reformulate\" the residential gas furnace standard could influence the development of several other energy efficiency standards processes that are underway."
