    "content": "At the beginning of the 109th Congress, both the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structure, affecting the coverage of the FY2006 appropriations bills. As a result, the appropriations subcommittees that previously oversaw the Departments of Transportation and the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President, and Independent Agencies now also oversee the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, and (in the case of the House, but not the Senate) the District of Columbia. The Bush Administration requested $126.1 billion for these agencies for FY2006, a slight decrease from the comparable figure of $127.7 billion for FY2005 (after a 0.83% across-the-board rescission that was included in the FY2005 Omnibus Appropriations Act, P.L. 108-447). The House-passed version of H.R. 3058, the FY2006 Departments of Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development, The Judiciary, District of Columbia, and Independent Agencies appropriations bill, provided $140.0 billion for FY2006, $6.5 billion (5%) over comparable FY2005 enacted levels and $9.7 billion (7%) over the Administration's request. The House did not support most of the Administration's requested changes, while providing significant increases for aviation, highway and transit programs, Amtrak, rental subsidies for the poor, and housing for Native Americans. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 3058 provided $142.0 billion. The Senate Committee also did not support most of the Administration's requested changes, while also providing significant increases for several programs. The bill included provisions that would restrict outsourcing of federal work and ease restrictions on U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The conference version of H.R. 3058 was passed by Congress on November 18, 2005; the President signed the bill into law on November 30, 2005 (P.L. 109-115). The bill provided $137.6 billion in net budgetary resources, less than either the House or Senate versions, but $4.1 billion (3%) more than the FY2005 enacted level and $7.3 billion (6%) more than the Administration requested. Conferees did not include provisions passed by both chambers easing restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba. Conferees added language prohibiting the use of funds in this bill for projects using eminent domain to acquire land for private development. In a subsequent bill, Congress enacted a one percent across-the-board rescission of non-emergency FY2006 discretionary funding, and provided almost $15 billion in supplemental funding to the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, and the General Services Administration to respond to the consequences of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. This report will not be updated."
