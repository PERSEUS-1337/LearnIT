Limits the amount recoverable and attorney's fees with respect to standards development activity engaged in by an SDO. States that an SDO may, not later than 90 days after commencing activity for the purpose of developing or promulgating voluntary consensus standards or 90 days after enactment of the Standards Development Advancement Act of 2002, whichever is later, file simultaneously with the Attorney General and the Commission a written notification disclosing: (1) the name and principal place of business of the SDO. And (2) documents showing the nature and scope of such activity. Allows an SDO to file additional disclosure notifications as appropriate to extend protections under this Act to standards development activities that are not covered by, or that have changed significantly since, the initial filing. Includes standards development activity within notice, disclosure, and withdrawal from notification requirements of the Act."
