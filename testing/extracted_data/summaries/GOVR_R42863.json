    "content": "The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006 (Perkins IV; P.L. 109-270) supports the development of academic and career and technical skills among secondary education students and postsecondary education students who elect to enroll in career and technical education (CTE) programs, sometimes referred to as vocational education programs. Perkins IV was authorized through FY2012, which ended on September 30, 2012. The authorization was extended through FY2013 under the General Education Provisions Act, although the act continues to receive appropriations in FY2014. The U.S. Department of Education issued its blueprint for reauthorization in April 2012. This report provides a summary of Perkins IV. The largest program authorized under Perkins IV is the Basic State Grants program. This program provides formula grants to states to develop, implement, and improve CTE programs, services, and activities. The formula awards proportionally larger grants to states with larger populations that are in the age range traditionally enrolled in high school or within two years of high school graduation and to states with a lower than average per capita income. Incorporated in the formula are certain features that guarantee minimum funding levels. These features are a FY1998 hold harmless and a minimum equal to 0.5% of the total amount available for state grants. Each state is able to decide how much of its federal funds will be dedicated to secondary education and how much to postsecondary education. Once this decision is made, funds must generally be distributed to the local secondary and postsecondary education providers through formulas defined by Perkins IV or the state. Approximately 12.5 million students enrolled in CTE courses during the 2009-2010 academic year (most recent data available). These courses may or may not be funded with Perkins IV funds. Two key requirements for receiving funds under the Basic State Grants program are offering CTE programs of study and compliance with accountability requirements. Secondary and postsecondary education providers must adopt the appropriate elements of at least one state-approved CTE program of study. Programs of study incorporate secondary and postsecondary education elements into a coordinated, nonduplicative progression of courses leading to an industry-recognized credential, certificate, or degree. Perkins IV also requires that states and secondary and postsecondary education providers meet targets on statutorily defined performance measures or face sanctions. Perkins IV also authorizes additional programs: Tech Prep, national programs, Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Career and Technical Institutions (TCPCTI), and Occupational and Employment Information. Of these, only national programs and TCPCTI received funding in FY2011-FY2014."
