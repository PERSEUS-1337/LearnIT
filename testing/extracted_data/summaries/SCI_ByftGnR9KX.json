    "content": "Conversational machine comprehension requires a deep understanding of the conversation history. To enable traditional, single-turn models to encode the history comprehensively, we introduce Flow, a mechanism that can incorporate intermediate representations generated during the process of answering previous questions, through an alternating parallel processing structure. Compared to shallow approaches that concatenate previous questions/answers as input, Flow integrates the latent semantics of the conversation history more deeply. Our model, FlowQA, shows superior performance on two recently proposed conversational challenges (+7.2% F1 on CoQA and +4.0% on QuAC). The effectiveness of Flow also shows in other tasks. By reducing sequential instruction understanding to conversational machine comprehension, FlowQA outperforms the best models on all three domains in SCONE, with +1.8% to +4.4% improvement in accuracy. Q3 We presented a novel FLOW component for conversational machine comprehension. By applying FLOW to a state-of-the-art machine comprehension model, our model encodes the conversation history more comprehensively, and thus yields better performance. When evaluated on two recently proposed conversational challenge datasets and three domains of a sequential instruction understanding task (through reduction), FLOWQA outperforms existing models.While our approach provides a substantial performance gain, there is still room for improvement. In the future, we would like to investigate more efficient and fine-grained ways to model the conversation flow, as well as methods that enable machines to engage more active and natural conversational behaviors, such as asking clarification questions."
