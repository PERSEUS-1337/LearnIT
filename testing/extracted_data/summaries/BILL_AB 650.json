    "title": "AB 650",
    "content": "Existing law requires every city or county to adopt an ordinance or resolution in regard to taxicab transportation service and requires each city or county to provide for a policy for entry into the business of providing taxicab transportation service, establishment or registration of rates for the provision of taxicab transportation service, and a mandatory controlled substance and alcohol testing certification program for drivers, as specified. This bill would make those provisions inapplicable to a city or county, other than the City and County of San Francisco, on the date upon which the Director of Finance notifies the Speaker of the Assembly and the President pro Tempore of the Senate of the completion of a state reorganization of transportation duties from the Public Utilities Commission to other agencies, if taxicab transportation services are included in the reorganization. The bill would require taxicab transportation services and taxicab drivers to be subject to rules or regulations adopted by cities and counties as they existed on July 1, 2016, except for requirements specified in the bill that would apply to cities and counties, including charter cities and counties, other than the City and County of San Francisco. By imposing new duties on local governments, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would declare that its provisions are a matter of statewide concern and not a municipal affair. The bill would declare the intent of the Legislature that, among other things, regulation of taxicab transportation services shall be modernized and moved to one state agency. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City and County of San Francisco. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
