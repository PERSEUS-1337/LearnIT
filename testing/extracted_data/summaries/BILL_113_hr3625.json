    "content": "Declares that termination liability costs for the International Space Station (ISS), the Space Launch System, and the Orion crew capsule shall be provided only pursuant to this Act. Prohibits the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) from reserving funds from amounts appropriated for a covered program, and instructs the Administrator to direct prime contractors not to reserve funds for potential termination liability costs respecting such a program. Declares that it is the intent of Congress that funds authorized to be appropriated for covered programs be applied in meeting established technical goals and schedule milestones. Declares void and unenforceable any provision in a prime contract entered into before enactment of this Act that provides for the payment of termination liability costs through any other means than as provided in this Act. Bars the Administrator from initiating termination of a prime contract on a covered program for the convenience of the government unless it is authorized or required by a law enacted after this Act's enactment. Requires notice to specified congressional committees before initiating termination of a prime contract for cause. Requires the Administrator to notify Congress if an authorization of appropriations is necessary in advance of a proposed program termination because sufficient unobligated appropriations are not available in the appropriations account funding the contract."
