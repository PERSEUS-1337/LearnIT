    "content": "The federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 provides for workforce investment activities, including activities in which states may participate. Existing law contains various programs for job training and employment investment, including work incentive programs, as specified, and establishes local workforce investment boards to perform duties related to the implementation and coordination of local workforce investment activities. Existing law requires local workforce investment boards to spend a minimum percentage of specified funds for adults and dislocated workers on federally identified workforce training programs and allows the boards to leverage specified funds to meet the funding requirements, as specified. Existing law authorizes a credit of up to 10 of that funding minimum for leveraged funds, which include Pell Grants and employment training panel grants. This bill would expand the types of services to which leveraged funds may be applied to include supportive services and would expand the types of leveraged funds that may be applied to the 10 credit, described above, to include specified federal, local, state, and private funds. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."
