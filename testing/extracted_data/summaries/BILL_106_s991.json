And (2) the shipment transport, or possession in interstate or foreign commerce of a firearm or ammunition, or the receipt of any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, by a person who has committed an act of violent juvenile delinquency. Specifies that: (1) what constitutes an adjudication of an act of violent juvenile delinquency shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held. And (2) any State conviction or adjudication of such an act that has been expunged or set aside, or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored, shall not be considered a conviction or adjudication of an act of violent juvenile delinquency for purposes of the Act. Amends the Act to set penalties for: (1) straw purchases of firearms. (2) possession by a juvenile of a handgun or ammunition in violation of Act provisions regarding transfer to a person, whom the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to believe is a juvenile, of a handgun or ammunition suitable for use only in a handgun, and, during the same course of conduct, violating provisions regarding possession of a firearm in a school zone, with intent to carry or otherwise possess, discharge, or otherwise use the handgun or ammunition in the commission of a violent felony. And (3) persons other than juveniles who knowingly violate provisions of the Act regarding the transfer to a person, whom the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to believe is a juvenile, of a handgun or ammunition suitable for use only in a handgun, knowing or having reasonable cause to know that another will carry or otherwise possess, discharge, or use the firearm in the commission of a violent felony. Tightens restrictions under the Act on temporary transfers of a handgun or ammunition to, and possession or use by, a juvenile. Makes current exemptions regarding such transfers applicable only if the juvenile's possession and use of a handgun or ammunition are in accordance with State and local law and if specified other conditions apply."
