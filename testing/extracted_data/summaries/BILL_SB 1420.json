    "title": "SB 1420",
    "content": "Existing federal law, the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990, which is administered by the State Department of Education in California, requires that a state plan include requirements that specified child care providers receive minimum health and safety training relating to, among other things, the prevention and control of infectious diseases and the handling and storage of hazardous materials in order to receiving funding for child care. Existing law, the California Child Day Care Facilities Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of child day care facilities by the State Department of Social Services. Existing law, the Child Care and Development Services Act, administered by the State Department of Education, requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to administer child care and development programs that offer a full range of services for eligible children from infancy to 13 years of age, including, among others, resource and referral programs, alternative payment programs, and family child care home education networks. This bill would, effective July 1, 2017, require a caregiver, as defined, to attend a one-time, two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to the child care profession, and on how to identify and avoid those risks. The bill would require the State Department of Education, in consultation with the State Department of Public Health and child care caregivers, to develop the curriculum for the training, which is required to include, among other things, a discussion of specified risks, including chemical and biological hazards. The bill would also require the department to contract with an entity to provide the occupational health and safety training and to compensate a caregiver for his or her time for attending the training. Existing law provides that each school district governing board has general control of, and responsibility for, all aspects of the interscholastic athletic policies, programs, and activities in its district, as specified. Existing law authorizes school district governing boards to enter into associations or consortia with other school district governing boards for the purpose of governing regional or statewide interscholastic athletic programs, as specified. Existing law prohibits voluntary interscholastic athletic associations from discriminating against, or denying the benefits of any program to, any person on the basis of specified personal characteristics. Existing law also prohibits voluntary interscholastic athletic associations from denying a school from participation in interscholastic athletic activities because of the religious tenets of the school. This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to these provisions."
