    "content": "Sportsmen's Bill of Rights Act of 1997- Requires Federal public land to be open to access and for use for fishing and hunting if: (1) the responsible State agency in which Federal public land is located limits access to and use of the land as part of wildlife management by the State. Or (2) the Federal agency responsible for Federal public land limits access and use for national security or for reasons related to specific statutory requirements regarding the management and use of the land, including public safety. Amends the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to cooperate with the Secretary of the Interior of Puerto Rico in the conduct of wildlife-restoration projects. Prohibits the amount of funding made available to the Secretary for expenses in the administration and execution of wildlife-restoration projects and the Migratory Bird Conservation Act from being made available to replace funding that is: (1) authorized for any other expense under the Secretary's jurisdiction. And (2) decreased under any other provision of law. Amends the Federal Aid in Fish Restoration Act to prohibit the amount of funding made available to the Secretary for fish restoration and management projects from being used to replace funding that is authorized and decreased as above. Prohibits a Federal agency's action that may significantly diminish opportunities or access to engage in fishing or hunting on Federal public land from being effective until the agency prepares a detailed statement evaluating the effect of such action. Provides for judicial review of such action. Entitles a person interested in fishing or hunting to intervene as a matter of right in a civil action brought under any other Federal law relating to the use of Federal public land, under specified conditions. Bars the court from granting the relief sought unless the plaintiff shows that the interest intended to be advanced by the other Federal law clearly outweighs the interest of protecting access to, and use of, Federal public land for fishing and hunting. Allows an individual licensed by a State to fish or hunt or an organization representing such individual's interests to bring a civil action in a US district court to seek declaratory or injunctive relief regarding the implementation of this Act, including a declaration that a civil action brought by a person may significantly disrupt or eliminate opportunities for fishing or hunting and an injunction against the prosecution of the civil action. Reaffirms the primacy of State authority in regulating the taking of fish and wildlife on such State's land, including Federal public land, stating that a Federal agency's taking authority in such regard shall be no greater than that of a private landowner."
