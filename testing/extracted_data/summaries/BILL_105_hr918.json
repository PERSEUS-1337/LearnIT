    "content": "Infrastructure Improvement Act of 1997 - Directs the Federal Communications Commission to conduct competitive bidding for licenses and permits for portions of the public electromagnetic spectrum allocated for commercial use that become available for licenses and construction during FY 1998 through 2002 and that result in specified proceeds. Requires such proceeds to be deposited into the Infrastructure Improvement Trust Fund established by this Act. Makes such funds available to the Secretary of Transportation to be apportioned among the States during FY 1998 through 2002 based on the percentage of estimated tax payments attributable to highway users in a State paid into the Highway Trust Fund for the latest fiscal year. Permits such funds to be used only for the construction and maintenance of State highways. Allows a State to be eligible for such funds only if it submits annually to the Secretary a plan describing its use of such funds. Requires a Federal share of 80 percent of the total cost of a project or activity conducted using funds apportioned under this Act."
