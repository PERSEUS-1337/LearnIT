    "title": "AB 1072",
    "content": "Existing law generally provides for the regulation of insurers by the Department of Insurance pursuant to laws set forth in the Insurance Code. Existing law authorizes the Insurance Commissioner to make certain examinations, investigations, and prosecutions and, upon making a determination of the existence of certain conduct, conditions, or grounds, to issue orders reasonably necessary to correct, eliminate, or remedy the conduct, conditions, or grounds. Existing law exempts from the requirements set forth in the Insurance Code firemen\u2019s, policemen\u2019s, and peace officers\u2019 benefit and relief associations that comply with specified criteria, including, among other things, a requirement that the membership consist solely of peace officers, members of police or fire departments, and emergency medical personnel employed by fire departments, as specified. Existing law prohibits an association from operating or doing business in the state without a certificate of authority. This bill would require every association that holds a certificate of authority and that issues long-term disability or long-term care policies or contracts, as specified, to submit to the commissioner the opinion, as specified, of a qualified actuary as to whether the reserves and related actuarial items that support the policies or contracts issued are expected to be adequate to satisfy contractual provisions, are based on reasonable assumptions, and are based on specified actuarial standards. The bill would also require an association seeking a certificate of authority to file an opinion that meets specified requirements and that establishes that it would have adequate resources to provide benefits, as specified, as required to satisfy its proposed contractual obligations. The bill would recognize that information submitted by a company pursuant to those provisions and in the possession or control of the department as proprietary and containing trade secrets. The bill would require that information to be confidential and privileged, exempt from disclosure by the commissioner pursuant to the California Public Records Act, and not subject to subpoena or discovery from the commissioner or admissible into evidence in a private civil action if obtained from the commissioner. The bill would require the commissioner to notify the association of the deficiencies in the filing if the association fails to provide an opinion and supporting memoranda to the commissioner that meets the requirements of the bill, as specified. The bill would require an association that self-funds all or part of the benefits to include specified disclosure language in all contracts that are not regulated by the department and in certificates evidencing coverage under those contracts. The bill would also require the commissioner, if he or she determines that the laws governing these associations are inadequate to protect the interests of the members of the associations, to develop and deliver recommendations to the Assembly Committee on Insurance and the Senate Committee on Insurance regarding changes in the law necessary to protect the interests of members of the associations. The provisions of the bill would remain in effect only until December 31, 2018, and as of that date would be repealed. Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest. This bill would make legislative findings to that effect."
