    "title": "An act to amend Section\n566 of the Penal Code, relating to branded containers.\n1464 of, and to add Title 14 (commencing with Section 14400) to Part 4 of, the Penal Code, relating to peace officers, and making an appropriation therefor.",
    "content": "Existing law generally requires local agencies to provide each newly hired police officer and deputy sheriff with a pistol and other specified equipment. This bill would require the Board of State and Community Corrections to develop a grant program to make funds available to local law enforcement entities to purchase body-worn cameras and related data storage and equipment, and to hire personnel necessary to operate a local body-worn camera program. The bill would create the Body-worn Camera Fund, that would continuously appropriate funds to the board for those purposes. Existing law creates the State Penalty Fund into which moneys collected by the courts from the imposition of fines, forfeitures, or penalties on criminal offenses are deposited. Once a month, certain percentages of money in that fund are transferred into other funds, including, among others, the Driver Training Penalty Assessment Fund. This bill would delete the transfer requirement for the Driver Training Penalty Assessment Fund and instead require a transfer to the Body-worn Camera Fund. By transferring general fund moneys into a continuously appropriated fund, this bill would make an appropriation. Existing law makes it a felony for an unauthorized person, as defined, to possess, or use, or to obliterate or destroy the brand registration upon, containers, including milk cases, cabinets, or other dairy equipment, which have a value in excess of $950. This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to this provision."
