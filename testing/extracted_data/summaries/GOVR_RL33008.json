    "content": "Executions declined through the 1950s and 1960s and ceased after 1967, pending definitiveSupreme Court decisions. This interval ended only after States altered their laws in response to the1972 Supreme Court decision in Furman v. Georgia , a 5-4 decision deciding that the death penalty,as imposed under existing law, constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighthand Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. In Furman, the Court ruled that the deathpenalty was arbitrarily and capriciously applied under existing law based on the unlimited discretionaccorded to sentencing authorities in capital trials. In response, States began to revise their statutesto modify the discretion given to sentencing authorities. These statutes went untested until the Courtdecided Gregg v. Georgia in 1976 in which it found in a 7-2 decision, that the death penalty did notper se violate the Eighth Amendment. The Gregg decision allowed States to establish the deathpenalty under guidelines that excluded the arbitrariness of sentencing in capital cases. As a result,statutory safeguards were developed to make sentencing more just and fair. Some of the changesincluded (1) in death penalty cases, the determination of guilt or innocence must be decidedseparately from hearings in which sentences of life imprisonment or death are decided; (2) the courtmust consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances in relationship to the crime and thedefendant; and (3) the death sentence must be subject to review by the highest State court of appealsto make sure that the penalty is in proportion to the seriousness or gravity of the offense and isimposed even-handedly under State law. Like the statutory safeguards, the capital cases decided bythe Court in the 2004-5 term also reflect its sentiment that if there is going to be a death penalty, theprocess must be fair. The Supreme Court abolished the practice of executing mentally retarded persons in Atkinsv. Virginia and juveniles who commit a capital crime while under the age of 18 in Roper v. Simmons . The Court ruled that these executions were prohibited on Eighth Amendment \"cruel and unusualpunishment\" grounds. The Court expanded its doctrine on the \"ineffective assistance of counsel\"in setting aside the death sentence for the petitioner in Rompilla v. Beard because his lawyers failedto search files on his past convictions for mitigating evidence in spite of their conscientious effortswhich led them to believe that it would be a waste of time. However, the Court determined in Bellv. Thompson that the scheduling of an execution was reasonable and the actions of the Court ofAppeals were an abuse of discretion, although the case was remanded for an ineffective assistanceof counsel hearing by the Court of Appeals while acting upon an honest belief that its previous rulinghad been decided erroneously. Also, the Court's decision in Miller-El v. Dretke reflected anaffirmation of its condemnation of racial discrimination in the use of peremptory challenges."
