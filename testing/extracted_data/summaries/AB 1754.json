    "title": "An act to add and repeal Article 7 (commencing with Section 13967) to Chapter 5 of Part 4 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, relating to crime victims.",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the compensation of victims and derivative victims of specified types of crimes by the California Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board from the Restitution Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, for specified losses suffered as a result of those crimes. Existing law sets forth eligibility requirements and specified limits on the amount of compensation the board may award, and requires applications for compensation to be verified under penalty of perjury. This bill would create the San Diego County Elder or Dependent Adult Financial Abuse Crime Victim Compensation Pilot Program and would authorize the board, upon appropriation by the Legislature before January 1, 2019, to provide victims of elder or dependent adult financial abuse compensation to reimburse costs for financial counseling, mental health counseling, or supportive services, as specified, if the crime occurred in the County of San Diego. The bill would limit compensation pursuant to this authorization to $3,000 per person and an aggregate total of $1,000,000. The bill would exclude a derivative victim from eligibility for compensation if the only crime the victim suffered was elder or dependent adult financial abuse. The bill would authorize the pilot program to operate until January 1, 2020. The bill would require the board to report specified information related to the pilot program to the Legislature and Governor on or before July 1, 2020. By expanding the scope of the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2021. This bill would make related legislative findings and declarations, including findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute enacting a pilot program in the County of San Diego. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
