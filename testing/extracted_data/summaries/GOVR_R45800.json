    "content": "During the 20 th century, Congress passed several laws that established a framework for federal historic preservation activities. The most comprehensive of these statutes is the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA; P.L. 89-665). NHPA created a grant program for state historic preservation, established the federal National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the procedures by which historic properties are placed on the Register, funded the National Trust for Historic Preservation (NTHP), established the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), and designated a process for federal agencies to follow when their projects may affect a historic property (known as the Section 106 process). Congress also has amended and expanded NHPA multiple times since its passage, most recently in 2016. In addition, Congress often considers bills to designate specific properties or areas as historically important, under various designations. These designations include national monuments, national historical parks, national historic sites, national historic landmarks, and properties listed on the NRHP, to name a few. Such historic designations may bring few management changes to a site or may involve significant changes, depending on the individual designating laws and/or general authorities that may apply to a type of designation. Some historic designations are applied to federally owned lands (including lands already under federal administration and those that the designating law may authorize for federal acquisition), but many federal designations are conferred on lands that remain nonfederally owned and managed. Because of these various legislative and oversight activities, historic preservation is of perennial interest to Congress. For example, some Members of Congress support proposals to eliminate a federal government role in financing historic preservation programs, leaving such programs to be sustained by other levels of government or by private support. Others state that a federal role in supporting historic preservation should be maintained or expanded. In particular, lawmakers and administrations pay significant attention to funding levels for various historic preservation programs that are subject to the annual appropriations process. The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) is the primary source of funding for federal preservation. Appropriations for the HPF totaled $118.7 million in FY2020 ( P.L. 116-94 ), a nearly 16% increase from the FY2019 appropriation (excluding emergency supplemental funding) and a roughly $86 million increase over the FY2020 Administration request. For FY2021, the Trump Administration requests a roughly 66% reduction in funding for the HPF compared with FY2020 levels. This request includes no fiscal support for many of the federal grant programs available to states, tribes, local governments, and nonprofit organizations for historic preservation."
