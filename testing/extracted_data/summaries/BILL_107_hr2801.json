    "content": "Prescription Drug Affordability Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that, in the case of an individual who has attained Social Security retirement age, there shall be allowed a tax credit equal to 80 percent of the amount paid by the taxpayer for any prescribed drug the individual uses. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000 to repeal certain drug reimportation provisions and authority for the importation of a prohibited drug required for emergency medical care. Permits a person who meets applicable legal requirements to be an importer of drugs to import certain Food and Drug Administration-approved new drugs, which are neither adulterated nor misbranded, and which require a prescription, if the person submits an drug import application and the Secretary approves the application. Prohibits the Secretary from taking any action under the FDCA with respect to the interstate sale of a prescription drug through an Internet site, if the sale was made in compliance with the FDCA and with applicable State laws, and accurate information regarding compliance with the FDCA and such State laws is posted on the site."
