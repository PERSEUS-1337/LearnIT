    "content": "Caring for Children Act - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities to develop: (1) distance learning child care training technology infrastructures. And (2) model technology-based training courses for child care providers and child care workers, to be provided through distance learning programs made available through the infrastructure. Requires, to the maximum extent possible, that such grants be awarded in regions with the fewest training opportunities for child care providers. Directs the Secretary to establish a demonstration program of competitive grants to States to help them provide funds to encourage the establishment and operation of small business employer-operated child care programs. Requires a State to give priority for such assistance to applicants that desire to form a consortium to provide child care in an area where such care is not generally available or accessible. Allows such consortia to include businesses, nonprofit agencies or organizations, local governments, or other appropriate entities."
