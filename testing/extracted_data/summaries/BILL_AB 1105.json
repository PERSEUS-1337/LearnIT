    "title": "AB 1105",
    "content": "Existing law defines unfair competition to include an unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice, unfair, deceptive, untrue, or misleading advertising, and any false representations to the public. Existing law, as amended by Proposition 64 at the November 2, 2004, statewide general election, authorizes an action for relief from this prohibited conduct to be brought by, among others, a person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition. Existing law also authorizes an action for relief from this prohibited conduct and for civil penalties to be brought by a city attorney of a city having a population in excess of 750,000. This bill would expand this authorization to allow actions for relief and civil penalties by city attorneys of cities having a population in excess of 250,000, as provided. The Subdivision Map Act and local ordinances authorize or require, under specified circumstances, the furnishing of specified types of security with respect to the performance of various acts or agreements subject to the act. Existing law, until January 1, 2016, also sets forth the specific procedures imposed on a local agency for the complete or partial release of a performance security furnished by a subdivider. This bill would delete the repeal of the provisions relating to the procedures for releasing a performance security, thereby extending the operation of these provisions indefinitely and imposing a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
