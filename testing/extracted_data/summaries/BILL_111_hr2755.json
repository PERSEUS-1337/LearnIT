    "content": "High Quality Teaching Act of 2009 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to award competitive five-year grants to up to 250 local educational agencies (LEAs) to recruit, support, and retain highly qualified and effective teachers through participation in the Targeted High Need Initiative program of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. Gives priority to LEAs that have: (1) the highest number of disadvantaged students. (2) the highest number of schools identified for school improvement, corrective action, or restructuring. And (3) the lowest number of teachers certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. Requires LEAs to use such grants to: (1) partner with institutions of higher education or other appropriate entities in conducting grant activities. (2) provide teachers participating in the Targeted High Need Initiative program with training, mentoring, and technological resources. (3) cover the assessment fee for teachers who apply for certification by such Board and agree to teach at the participating school for at least three years after their certification. (4) provide specified monetary awards to teachers and their sponsoring schools after completion of the Targeted High Need Initiative program. And (5) conduct an independent evaluation of such program's affect on teaching quality and student performance."
