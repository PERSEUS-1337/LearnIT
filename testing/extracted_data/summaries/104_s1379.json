Revises procedural guidelines for: (1) debt validation, (2) legal actions by debt collectors. And (3) limitations on damages, including repeal of the allowance of up to $1,000 in additional damages. Provides that this Act: (1) supersedes any State law creating a private right of action against a debt collector.

And (3) does not establish any liability or penalty for violation of State law unless such violation also constitutes a violation under this Act."
