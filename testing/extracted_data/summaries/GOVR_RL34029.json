    "content": "Haiti's poverty is massive and deep. Over half the population (54%) of 8.2 million people live in extreme poverty, living on less than $1 a day; 76% live on less than $2 a day. Poverty and hunger among the rural population is even more widespread. In order to reach Haiti's goal of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger by 2015, its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would have to grow 3.5% per year, a goal Haiti is not considered likely to achieve. In the past 40 years, Haiti's per capita real GDP has declined by 30%. Therefore economic growth, even if greater than population growth, is not expected to be enough to reduce Haiti's endemic poverty. Since Haiti's 2006 elections, the new government and international donors are shifting from a short-term program to carry Haiti through a transition period to a long-term program to help reduce poverty in Haiti. Haiti and its multilateral and bilateral donors developed an international aid strategy to address Haiti's short-term needs in between the collapse of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's government and the installation of a new, elected government. Through the Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF) international donors pledged $1.2 billion from 2004 to 2006, and $750 million more through September 2007. The ICF places priority needs and projects into four broad \"axes\": political governance and national dialogue; economic governance and institutional development; economic recovery; and access to basic services, with a strategy, priority objectives, and monitoring indicators for each. Building on drafts created by the interim government (2004-2006), President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val's Administration produced an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) for the years 2007-2009. This plan calls for actions to be taken within a macroeconomic framework focusing on three goals: maintain macroeconomic stability; target actions to reduce poverty; and create conditions conducive to continuous and sustainable growth driven by private initiative. International donors are assisting Haiti in developing a long-term Poverty Reduction Plan to build on and succeed the Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF). An important part of this strategy is developing the final plan through a participatory process, with the goals of ensuring that the interests of Haiti's most disadvantaged population are taken into account and that democratic and governance processes are strengthened. The PRS is to be completed by July 2007, and implemented beginning in October 2007. The U.S. Agency for International Development's 2007-2009 programs are based on the objectives, strategy, and monitoring indicators established under the ICF. Some critics say that the PRS process does not allow adequate country input, uses limited development analysis, and should include discussion of alternative policies and other aspects of development policy. Enormous political, technical, and institutional challenges must be overcome before Poverty Reduction objectives can be achieved. The figures in this report put international efforts into the context of Haitian poverty, drawing a statistical portrait to convey the extent of the poverty and obstacles that must be overcome in order for sustainable development to occur in Haiti. This report will not be updated."
