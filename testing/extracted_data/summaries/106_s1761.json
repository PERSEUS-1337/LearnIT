    "content": "Requires the Secretary to develop and publish criteria to determine which projects would qualify and have the highest priority for financing. Requires such criteria to address at a minimum: (1) how the project relates to the near-and long-term water demands and supplies in the study area, including how the project would affect the need for development of new or expanded water supplies, (2) the relative amount of water to be conserved. (3) whether the project would provide operational efficiency improvements or achieve water, energy, or economic savings at a rate of acre feet of water or kilowatt energy saved per dollar expended on construction of the project. And (4) if the project proponents have met the following project requirements. Requires a project sponsor seeking Federal funding under this program to: (1) provide a report that includes an analysis showing how the project would reduce, postpone, or eliminate development of new or expanded water supplies, and a description of conservation measures to be taken, (2) provide a project plan. And (3) sign a cost-sharing agreement with the Secretary that commits the non-Federal project sponsor to annual funding of its proportionate share of the project's construction costs. Requires the Secretary to determine: (1) that the project sponsor is financially capable of funding the project's non-Federal share of the project's costs. And (2) within one year after the date the project is submitted for approval, whether a project meets the criteria. Permits project sponsors to contract with the Secretary to prepare such reports. Authorizes the Secretary, through specified projects that meet the review criteria and project requirements, to conduct or participate in funding engineering work, infrastructure construction and improvements for conserving and transporting raw water. Limits: (1) the non-Federal share of the costs of any such activity to 50 percent. And (2) payments by the State to 40 percent of such costs. Permits the remainder of the non-Federal share to include in-kind contributions of goods and services, and funds previously spent on feasibility and engineering studies. Authorizes appropriations."
