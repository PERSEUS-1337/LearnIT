    "title": "To allow for enforcement of State disclosure laws and access to courts for covered Holocaust-era insurance policy claims.",
    "content": "Holocaust Insurance Accountability Act of 2010 - Declares that no executive agreement between the United States and any foreign country shall invalidate or preempt any state law creating a cause of action against an insurer or related company based upon a claim arising out of or related to a covered insurance policy that: (1) was in effect at any time after January 30, 1933, and before December 31, 1945. And (2) was issued to a policyholder domiciled in any area occupied or controlled by Nazi Germany. Deems any state law enacted as of March 1, 1998, which requires an insurer doing business in that state to disclose information regarding such a covered policy to be effective upon its enactment. Authorizes the President to waive application of this Act upon: (1) a determination that the executive agreement is vital to US national security interests. And (2) presentation of a report by the President to certain congressional committees explaining the reasons for such determination. Prohibits a court from dismissing a claim that is brought under a state law within 10 years after enactment of this Act on the ground that the claim is barred under any statute of limitations. Declares this Act applicable to any claim brought under state law before, on, or after enactment of this Act including: (1) any claim dismissed on the ground of executive preemption before the date of the enactment of this Act. And (2) any claim that is deemed released as a result of the settlement of a class action entered into before enactment of this Act if the claimant did not receive any payment pursuant to the settlement."
