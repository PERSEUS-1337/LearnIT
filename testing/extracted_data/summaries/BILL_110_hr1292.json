    "content": "Repeals P. L. 107-243 . Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) Congress should vote on a new authorization for use of force resolution that reflects the current Iraq situation, abandons the Bush Doctrine of preemption and unilateralism, and realigns US policy with its long-held priorities of diplomacy, deterrence, and containment. (2) the United States should establish a quick-reaction US military force with an over-the-horizon presence in the region. (3) the United States should intensify diplomatic relations to support the difficult internal steps that the government of Iraq should take to promote national reconciliation. (4) the United States should increase efforts to engage all neighboring countries and the League of Arab States in promoting Iraq's stability. (5) the United States should continue to provide humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in Iraq. (6) the United States should redirect diplomatic, economic, and military support to Afghanistan. And (7) the United States should aggressively pursue Osama Bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations that continue to pose an imminent threat to the United States."
