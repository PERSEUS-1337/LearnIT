    "content": "Indonesia's economy continues to struggle against the lasting effects of the 1997-1998Asian financial crisis and thepolitical instability that resulted. Indonesia was one of the hardest hit economies in Asia; real GDP fell by 13.2 %in 1998. Indonesian-U.S. commercial tieswere sharply diminished as well, caused in part by declining Indonesia living standards and a loss of foreign investorconfidence in Indonesia (due largely topolitical instability). The Indonesian economy has improved over the past few years, however, recent activities ofterrorist elements in Indonesia and the rise ofseparatist movements threaten to undermine further an already fragile economy. This report will be updated asevents warrant."
