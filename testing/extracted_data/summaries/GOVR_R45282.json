    "content": "Division G of Title II of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) extended U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authority to collect fees from the pesticide industry for the maintenance and evaluation of pesticide registrations under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA; 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.) until the end of FY2018. Two types of industry-paid fees supplement annual appropriations from the General Fund to support EPA's pesticide regulatory program. Without the extension, the authority to collect maintenance fees would have expired at the end of FY2017 under the Pesticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of 2012 (PRIA 3; P.L. 112-177). Maintenance fees are paid by pesticide registrants to retain existing pesticide registrations, which govern the terms and conditions for lawful pesticide distribution and use. Additionally, without the extension, PRIA 3 would have gradually phased out the authority to collect registration service fees by the end of FY2019. Registration service fees are paid by applicants who seek EPA review of applications associated with pesticide registrations (e.g., new registrations, amendments to existing registrations). If these fee authorities are not reauthorized or extended after FY2018, pursuant to PRIA 3, the authority to collect maintenance fees would expire and the authority to collect registration service fees would be phased out by the end of FY2019. Since FY2004, total maintenance fees collected by EPA have ranged from $21.4 million to $28.7 million per fiscal year and total registration service fees have ranged from $10.6 million to $18.6 million per fiscal year. Maintenance and registration service fees collected each fiscal year have provided approximately one-fourth of the total appropriation for EPA's pesticide program activities. In the 115th Congress, the House-passed H.R. 1029, the Pesticide Registration Enhancement Act of 2017, and the Senate amendment to H.R. 1029, the Pesticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of 2018, would reauthorize the collection of maintenance fees until the end of FY2023 and registration service fees until the end of FY2025. The amount that EPA may collect in registration service fees would be reduced by 40% for FY2024 and 70% for FY2025 in a phase out. Both the House and Senate versions of H.R. 1029 would increase the cap on annual maintenance fees per registrant by 12% and the aggregate for all maintenance fees from $27.8 million per fiscal year to an average amount of $31.0 million per fiscal year. Both the House and Senate versions of H.R. 1029 would revise registration service fee amounts for different actions the applicant may request the agency to conduct and certain time frames in which EPA is required to complete review of a requested action. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 would require EPA to implement without revision two final rules promulgated during the previous administration before October 1, 2021. The two EPA rules address standards for the protection of agricultural workers from pesticide exposures and the certification of applicators that use restricted use pesticides. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 would also direct the U.S. Government Accountability Office to publish a report on the use of designated representatives and their effect on the availability of pesticide application and hazard information. On June 21, 2018, the House passed H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, which includes a provision that would enact House-passed H.R. 1029. The Senate amendment to H.R. 2, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, does not include a similar provision. On July 18, 2018, the House requested a conference with the Senate to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of H.R. 2."
