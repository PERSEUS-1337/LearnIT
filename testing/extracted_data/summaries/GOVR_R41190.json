    "content": "The Sixth Amendment entitles an accused in a criminal prosecution to \"Assistance of Counsel for his defense.\" This right to counsel implies a right to \"effective assistance.\" Effective assistance has dimensions of both breadth and depth: breadth in the sense of what considerations beyond those immediately at issue in the prosecution should be taken into account, so-called collateral consequences; depth in the sense of what professional standards pertain. In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that \"ineffective assistance\" standards require informing a noncitizen defendant on possible deportation when advising on whether to accept a guilty plea. Forced removal through deportation is a civil proceeding separate and apart from criminal prosecution. The test for deficient representation for Sixth Amendment purposes is two-pronged. First, was the attorney's performance reasonable under prevailing professional norms? Second, was the defendant prejudiced by the attorney's shortcomings? As to the first prong, the Padilla Court emphasized the unique nature of deportation. Criminal courts do not decide whether to deport a noncitizen defendant; rather, federal immigration authorities do. Nevertheless, the Court recognized that deportation can have enormous repercussions for a noncitizen and the noncitizen's family. The Court further observed that Congress curtailed the historic, though indirect, ability of criminal judges to forestall a convict's deportation, at the same time it dramatically expanded the range of crimes that can lead to deportation. The Court cited the hardship of deportation and its increasingly automatic application in prelude to discussing whether Padilla's attorney fell short of prevailing practice. The lawyer had volunteered that Padilla did not have to worry about deportation in considering whether to plead guilty to marijuana trafficking because he had legally resided in the United States for over 40 years. Yet it was not the volunteering of mistaken advice that was critical to the Court. According to the Court, silence was not an adequate option. Instead, professional norms, as reflected in standards of the American Bar Association, criminal defense organizations, and the like, pointed to an affirmative duty to inform on the risk of deportation. How far must an attorney go in advising a defendant? The five-Justice majority found immigration law to be \"succinct, clear, and explicit\" in Padilla's case, and held that in this circumstance defense counsel must correctly advise on the high likelihood of deportation. In less straightforward cases, the majority opined, it might suffice to advise that the pending charges carried a risk of deportation. The two concurring Justices found immigration law to be so complex that defense counsel need only warn of a general risk of deportation in all cases and suggest that the defendant see a specialist for further advice. Deportation is commonly a risk for noncitizen criminal defendants, but there are other possible immigration consequences of a criminal conviction. Also, all defendants can face other collateral consequences, from loss of a business license to loss of the right to vote to loss of certain public benefits. A number of factors might bear on a defendant's decision to plead guilty, but the Padilla Court carefully limited its holding to advice on deportation. Also left open by Padilla is guidance on when failing to advise on deportation is sufficiently prejudicial to a defendant to warrant nullifying a guilty plea. The Court remanded this issue to lower courts for further consideration."
