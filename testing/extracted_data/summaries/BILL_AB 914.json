    "title": "AB 914",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the Department of Transportation and local authorities, with respect to highways under their respective jurisdictions, to authorize or permit exclusive or preferential use of highway lanes for high-occupancy vehicles (HOVs). Existing law authorizes the development and implementation of a value-pricing program consisting of high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes in various corridors under certain circumstances, pursuant to which vehicles that do not meet the vehicle occupancy requirements for use of an HOV lane may use the lane upon payment of a toll. This bill would authorize the San Bernardino County Transportation Commission to conduct, administer, and operate a value-pricing program, that may include HOT lanes or other toll facilities in the Interstate Highway Routes 10 and 15 in the County of San Bernardino and, with the agreement of affected transportation agencies, specified extensions and connections into the Counties of Los Angeles and Riverside. The bill would require the toll revenues to be spent for specified transportation purposes and would authorize the commission to issue revenue bonds payable from toll revenues. The bill would require the commission to report to the Legislative Analyst on specified matters within 3 years of commencement of revenue collection from the value-pricing program. The bill would enact other related provisions. This bill would become operative only if AB 194 is also enacted and becomes operative on or before January 1, 2016."
