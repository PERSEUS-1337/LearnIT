    "content": "This report provides background on the theory and application of tax policy as it relates tothe energy sector, particularly with respect to the theory of market failure in the energy sector andsuggested policy remedies. Economic theory suggests that producers of energy-related minerals be taxed no differentlythan non-mineral producers: Exploration and development costs and other investments in a deposit(including geological and geophysical costs and delay rentals) should be capitalized. In general,competitive mineral producers subject to a pure income tax would not exploit resources as fast(compared with the rate of exploitation under the present system of subsidies). Over the longer term,depletion of fossil fuels and mineral resources leads to higher real energy prices, which wouldeventually promote the optimal amount of investment in energy efficiency and alternative fuelssupply. Under principles of neutrality of tax policy, there is no purely economic rationale for energytaxes or tax subsidies to (1) raise revenues; (2) conserve energy (with one exception); (3) promotealternative fuels; (4) compensate for any extra market risk; or (5) promote, as an industrial policy,specific industries such as the fossil fuels industry. However, even under a pure income tax,economic efficiency suggests a system of energy taxes (in addition to the income taxes) to correctfor any environmental externalities caused by the production, importation, and use of each fuel, andenergy taxes in the form of user charges for benefits received, such as the highway trust fund. In thecase of energy conservation, market failures in the use of energy in rental housing provide anefficiency rationale for the current gross income exclusion for conservation subsidies provided byelectric utilities. There are other market failures in energy use that suggest efficiency standards,energy labeling, or government-provided information, but not necessarily tax subsidies. Tax subsidies for domestic oil production tend to stimulate domestic supply of petroleum andreduce demand for petroleum imports. This may enhance national and economic security in the shortrun, but it might damage national and economic security in the long run as domestic energy resourcesare depleted faster than they otherwise would be. The economically efficient policy to reduce importdependence would impose a tax (or tariff) on imported petroleum based on the per-barrel estimateof these costs (the so-called oil import \"premium\"). The problem of vulnerability to embargoes andprice shocks, which relates to dependence on imported oil from the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries (OPEC) and other potentially unstable or unfriendly foreign countries, is moreeffectively addressed in a policy of stockpiling oil, as is being done with the Strategic PetroleumReserve. In terms of environmental protection and management, energy taxes can be a cost-effectiveand efficient market-based instrument, and they are economically superior to the command andcontrol approach. In sum, energy taxes are generally distortional (except to correct for externalities,or when imposed as user fees for benefits received) and regressive, and may have adversemacroeconomic consequences, particularly sizeable taxes on energy production or oil imports."
