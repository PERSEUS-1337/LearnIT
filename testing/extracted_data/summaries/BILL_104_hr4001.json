    "content": "Liberian Peace and Democracy Act - Declares that the governments of Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, and Guinea have, through the provision of assistance to Liberian factions, contributed to the violence in Liberia since the civil war erupted there in 1989. Imposes certain visa, economic, and defense export sanctions against such countries. Authorizes the President to waive such sanctions if such countries halt their assistance to Liberian factions, or such measures would not be in the US national interest. Urges the President to take certain measures to bring Liberian war criminals to justice. Directs the President to instruct all US Government officials engaged in official contacts with the governments of Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, and Guinea to raise on a regular basis the issue of extraditing to the United States all persons in such countries sought by the Department of Justice for crimes committed in the United States.
