    "content": "Employee Welfare Benefit Equity Act of 2001 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the limited deductibility of employer contributions to welfare benefit funds, to revise the exception from such treatment for a single plan with ten or more employers. Adds to current requirements for a ten-or-more employer plan that the plan must: (1) meet specified nondiscrimination requirements with respect to all benefits the plan provides. (2) receive a favorable determination from the Secretary of the Treasury that the plan is a voluntary employees' beneficiary association meeting certain criteria. And (3) provide no severance pay benefit. Defines an experience-related plan, to which such exception does not apply , as a plan which determines contributions by individual employers on the basis of actual gain or loss experience. Excludes from experience-related plans guaranteed benefit plans funded with insurance contracts or otherwise determinable and payable to a participant without reference to, or limitation by, the amount of contributions to the plan attributable to any contributing employer. Requires the taxpayer to apply for and receive a determination by the Secretary of the Treasury that a collective bargaining agreement is bona fide and the welfare benefits provided under it were the subject of good faith bargaining before a qualified asset account may be unlimited under an employee pay-all plan. Declares that a welfare benefit fund meeting all applicable requirements shall not be treated as a tax shelter or corporate tax shelter. Prescribes an excise tax equal to 100 percent of all contributions to a funded welfare benefit plan that is terminated prematurely, that is, within six years after the first contribution to the fund which benefits any highly compensated employee."
