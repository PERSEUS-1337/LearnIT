    "content": "The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust is becoming a critical component of the U.S.response to humanitarian foodemergencies in Africa, Iraq, and elsewhere. The Trust, as presently constituted, was enacted in the 1998 AfricaSeeds of Hope Act (P.L. 105-385). It replacedthe Food Security Commodity Reserve established in 1996 and its predecessor the Food Security Wheat Reserveof 1980. The Trust is a reserve of up to 4million metric tons of wheat, corn, sorghum and rice that can be used to help fulfill P.L. 480 food aid commitmentsto developing countries under twoconditions: (1) to meet unanticipated emergency needs in developing countries, or (2) when U.S. domestic suppliesare short. The Trust can also hold funds. Administration proposals to reduce food aid's reliance on surplus commodities and anticipated demand foremergency food aid have focused renewed attentionon the Emerson Trust, which has been used four times in FY2002 and FY2003 to meet unanticipated food needsin Africa and Iraq. About 1.1 million metrictons of wheat remain in the Trust. As the Trust is drawn down, reimbursement and replenishment of the Trust forcommodities released become importantissues. This report will be updated as developments occur."
