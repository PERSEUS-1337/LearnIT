    "title": "To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to change the classification of employers and employees for services providers.",
    "content": "This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish a test for determining if a service provider should be classified as an independent contractor rather than as an employee for tax purposes. If the requirements of the test are met, the provider may not be treated as an employee, the recipient or any payor may not be treated as an employer, and compensation for the service may not be treated as paid or received with respect to employment. The factors of the test include: the relationship between the parties, the place of business or ownership of the equipment. And the services are performed under a written contract that meets certain requirements . The bill also sets forth: (1) reporting requirements for service recipients who meet the requirements of the test, and (2) procedures for the reclassification of employment status by the Internal Revenue Service."
