    "content": "The economic prosperity of the 1990s fueled a drive to increase the levels of employment-based immigration. Both the Congress and the Federal Reserve Board then expressed concern that a scarcity of labor could curtail the pace of economic growth. A primary response was to increase the supply of foreign temporary professional workers through FY2003. When the H-1B annual numerical limits reverted to 65,000 in FY2005, that limit was reached on the first day. The FY2006 limit was reached before the fiscal year began. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that the FY2008 H-1B cap was reached within the first two days it accepted petitions\u2014April 2-3, 2007. The 106th Congress temporarily raised the number of H-1B visas for three years. The 107th Congress enacted provisions that allow H-1B workers to remain if their employers petitioned for them to become legal permanent residents. A provision in P.L. 108-447 exempted up to 20,000 aliens holding a master's or higher degree from the cap on H-1B visas. It also established a fraud-prevention-and-detection fee on petitioners. Provisions on H-1B visas also were part of Chile and Singapore Free Trade Agreements (P.L. 108-77 and P.L. 108-78). The median annual compensation of the newly arriving H-1B nonimmigrants dropped from $50,000 in FY2001 to $44,803 in FY2003, but climbed back to $50,000 in FY2005. Most H-1B new arrivals had earned a bachelor's degree or its equivalent (42.5%). More than one-third (39.3%) had master's degrees, and 17.1% had either professional degrees or doctorates. In FY2005, 45.3% of H-1B new arrivals were employed in computer-related fields, followed by educators (11.2%), architects, engineers and surveyors (11.1%), and administrative specializations (9.5%). India was the leading country of origin, comprising 49.0% of all new arrivals in FY2005. China followed with 9.16%, and Canada was third (3.6%). Those opposing any further increases or easing of admissions requirements assert that there is no compelling evidence of a labor shortage in these professional areas that cannot be met by newly graduating students and retraining the existing U.S. work force. They argue further that the education of U.S. students and training of U.S. workers should be prioritized instead of fostering a reliance on foreign workers. Proponents of current H-1B levels assert that H-1B workers are essential if the United States is to remain globally competitive. Some proponents argue that employers should be free to hire the best people for the jobs, maintaining that market forces should regulate H-1B visas, not an arbitrary ceiling. In the 110th Congress, the comprehensive immigration reform legislation (S. 1639) stalled in the Senate on June 28, 2007. S. 1639 would increase the annual cap to 115,000 (and potentially to 180,000 in future years). S. 1639 also draws on the labor market protections proposed in S. 1035, the H-1B and L-1 Visa Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act of 2007. Other H-1B bills include S. 1038/H.R. 1930, H.R. 1758, S. 31, S. 1397, S. 1092, S. 1351, H.R. 2538, and H.R. 3194. This report tracks legislative activity and will be updated as needed."
