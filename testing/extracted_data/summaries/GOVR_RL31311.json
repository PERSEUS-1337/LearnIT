    "content": "The annual Foreign Operations appropriations bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which Congress reviews the U.S. foreign aid budget and influences executive branch foreign policymaking generally. It contains the largest share -- about two-thirds -- of total U.S. internationalaffairs spending. President Bush requested $16.45 billion (amended on September 3, 2002) for FY2003 Foreign Operations, an amount 7% higher than regular FY2002 appropriations, but slightly less than enactedFY2002 foreign aid appropriations when amounts ($1.2 billion) allocated from two supplementalappropriations are included. Combined with funds provided in the regular appropriation ( P.L.107-115 ), enacted Foreign Operations spending for FY2002 totaled $16.54 billion. The FY2003 Foreign Operations proposal increased bilateral U.S. development assistance by $348 million (+13%), including an additional $230 million, or nearly one-half more for globalHIV/AIDS programs. Other major additions in the FY2003 budget included 15% more for the PeaceCorps, 17% more for the Andean Counternarcotics Initiative, 22% more for contributions tomultilateral development banks, and 11% more for military assistance, primarily to support countriesfacing terrorist threats. Overall, the FY2003 request included $4 billion in aid for \"front-line\" statesin the war on terrorism. In a few areas, the President's request cut spending: Export-Import Bankappropriations would fall by nearly one-quarter while assistance to Eastern Europe would drop by20%. The 107th Congress adjourned before completing action on Foreign Operations and 10 other funding measures. On February 13, Congress agreed to a $16.3 billion Foreign Operations measure( H.J.Res. 2 ; P.L. 108-7 ). As enacted, Foreign Operations is about $150 million lessthan requested and $125 million and $250 million less than bills recommended earlier by the Senateand House, respectively. The conference agreement further provides for an across-the-boardrescission of 0.65% of all discretionary budget authority in the bill. This reduces total ForeignOperations funding to roughly $16.18 billion. (Note: This report does not discuss or include $7.48billion in Foreign Operations funding approved in P.L. 108-11 , the Iraq War Supplemental.) Key Foreign Operations issues that attracted considerable debate included: size and composition of aid to help combat terrorism, including an FY2002 supplemental; development aid fundingpriorities, especially the adequacy of U.S. support for international HIV/AIDS programs andproposed reductions for other global health programs; funding for family planning programs andeligibility of the U.N. Population Fund; and assistance to Colombia, especially proposals to expandaid beyond counter-narcotics to a broader counter-terrorism focus. Key Policy Staff"
