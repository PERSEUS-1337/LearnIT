    "content": "The United States Territories\u00e2\u0080\u0094American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and the U. S. Virgin Islands\u00e2\u0080\u0094all receive federal funding for their roads and highways. The Territories' treatment under the Federal-Aid Highway Program (FAHP), however, differs significantly from that of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Prior to 1970 most of the road construction and maintenance activity was financed and carried out by the territorial governments. In 1970, Congress established the Territorial Highway Program (THP) in the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-605). The Act authorized the Department of Transportation (DOT) to assist each of the three territories, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa (the Northern Mariana Islands were added to the program in 1978), in a program for the construction and improvement of a system of arterial highways to be designated by each territory's Governor. DOT was also directed to provide technical assistance to each territory to assist in the creation of an appropriate agency to administer the program. During the more than 30 years the program has existed the THP's enacting language (23 U.S.C. 215) has basically remained the same but the level of financing varied with each reauthorization. Program funding varied from a low of $4.5 million annually, in FY1970-FY1973 to a high of $36.2 million in FY2003. Some funding from other program sources has also gone to the territories. The Emergency Relief Program, the High Priority Project Program, and certain safety programs have provided funding for territorial highways over the years. The arguments generally made in support of federal aid to the territories, including highway aid, are usually framed in terms of the transportation and development needs of the territories and the benefits the territories provide to the United States. The arguments against expanded territorial eligibility under federal-aid highway programs are framed by the territories' exemption from the taxes that support the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund (HTF), the implications of the territories limited land area, and their non-state status. As reauthorization of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century (TEA-21) ( P.L. 105-178 ), Congress may address a number of options concerning federal highway funding for the territories. The overall issue for the territories is the appropriate extent of their participation in the FAHP. The options range from elimination of the THP to expanding territorial participation in FAHP programs to equal that of the states. Elimination of the THP appears unlikely given the federal commitments to economic development of the territories. On the other hand, the fact that the territories do not pay the taxes that provide revenue to the HTF will probably preclude them from full participation in HTF programs. The Bush Administration proposal, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act (SAFETEA)( H.R. 2088 ), would make a number of changes in the THP and retain its authorization at the TEA21 annual level of $36.4 million. This report will be updated as warranted by events."
