Of this amount, the Administration requested $9.8 billion for military construction and family housing in the base budget, and $0.6 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations funds. House and Senate negotiations on the annual National Defense Authorization Act, which authorizes funding for military construction projects for the Department of Defense, concluded early in November 2017. The final bill, H.R. 2810, passed the House on November 14, 2017, and the Senate on November 16, 2017. The final legislation was sent to the President for his signature on November 30, 2017, and was signed two weeks later, on December 12, 2017. The FY2018 NDAA (P.L. 115-91) authorizes for appropriations $10.7 billion for military construction, family housing, and base realignment and closure (BRAC) activities, or roughly $309 million more than the President's Budget Request (PBR). Military construction appropriations are provided in the annual Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, one of 12 appropriations bills Congress considers on an annual basis. The legislation funds military construction activities for the active and reserve components, as well as military family housing, U.S. contributions to NATO, and BRAC actions. In the House, the FY2018 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 2998), was first reported by the Committee on Appropriations on June 22, 2017, and subsequently combined with three additional appropriations bills in H.R. 3219, which passed the House on July 27, 2017. This bill, in turn, was consolidated into a larger appropriations omnibus (H.R. 3354) that passed the House on September 14, 2017. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported its version of the FY2018 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (S. 1557) was reported by the Committee on Appropriations on July 13, 2017. In lieu of passing any of the 12 appropriations acts, on September 8, 2017, Congress passed and the President signed H.R. 601 (P.L. 115-56), the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018, and Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017. Division D of H.R. 601 was extended four times through March 23, 2018, by allowing the government continued to operate for the first six months of the fiscal year under continuing resolutions. During this period, Congress enacted several measures that provided military construction funding outside of the routine appropriations process in response to new requests by the Administration. Division B of H.R. 1370 (P.L. 115-96), the \"Department of Defense Missile Defeat and Defense Enhancements Appropriations Act, 2018\" (known as the missile amendment), provided $200 million in military construction funds to carry out construction of a missile field in Alaska in response to provocative actions by North Korea. A second supplemental, Division B of H.R. 1892 (P.L. 115-123, Title X), provided $721 million in hurricane relief military construction funding in areas struck hardest by disasters along U.S. Southeastern and Gulf coastlines. On March 23, 2018, Congress passed and the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (H.R. 1625, P.L. 115-141). Division J. of the act provides $10.1 billion in base and $750 million for Overseas Contingency Operations funding, a combined total of $10.8 billion. These appropriated amounts represent 4% more than the Administration requested for military construction funds in FY2018 ($10.4 billion), and 33% more than the FY2017 enacted levels ($8.1 billion)."
