    "title": "AB 1215",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the Department of Technology, within the Government Operations Agency, headed by the Director of Technology, who is also known as the State Chief Information Officer. The department is responsible for the approval and oversight of information technology projects in state government by, among other things, consulting with agencies during initial project planning to ensure that project proposals are based on well-defined programmatic needs and consider feasible alternatives to address the identified needs and benefits consistent with statewide strategies, policies, and procedures. This bill would enact the California Open Data Act and create the position of the Chief Data Officer, who would be appointed by, and serve at the pleasure of, the Governor, and report to the Secretary of Government Operations. This bill would require the Chief Data Officer to establish the California Open Data Standard, as specified, and require state agencies to make public data, as defined, available on an Internet Web portal pursuant to that standard. This bill would authorize a local government to adopt that standard. This bill would require the Chief Data Officer to create a Data Working Group, composed of data coordinators from specific state agencies and 2 individuals with expertise in open data information technology, who are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of, the Chief Data Officer. This bill would further require each state agency, on or before July 1, 2016, to submit a strategic plan and a strategic enterprise application plan, as specified, to the Chief Data Officer and to post the reports on the Internet Web portal. This bill would also require specified legal policies for public data to be posted on the Internet Web portal. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations relating to this act. Existing law requires, with specified exceptions, that all meetings of state and local government entities be open and public and that all persons be permitted to attend and participate. Existing law also requires that public records be open to inspection at all times during the office hours of a state or local government entity and that every person has a right to inspect any public record, except as specifically provided. This bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to strengthen the state\u2019s commitment to an open and transparent government."
