The law was enacted to improve absentee registration and voting for this group of voters and to consolidate existing laws. Since 1942, a number of federal laws have been enacted to assist these voters: the Soldier Voting Act of 1942 (P.L. 77-712, amended in 1944), the Federal Voting Assistance Act of 1955 (P.L. 84-296), the Overseas Citizens Voting Rights Act of 1975 (P.L. 94-203; both the 1955 and 1975 laws were amended in 1978 to improve procedures), and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986. The law is administered by the Secretary of Defense, who delegates that responsibility to the director of the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) at the Department of Defense (DOD). Improvements to UOCAVA were necessary as the result of controversy surrounding ballots received in Florida from uniformed services and overseas voters in the 2000 presidential election. Both the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2002 (P.L. 107-107) and the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-252) included provisions concerning uniformed services and overseas voting. The Ronald W. Reagan Defense Authorization Act for FY2005 (P.L. 108-375) amended UOCAVA as well, and the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for FY2007 (P.L. 109-364) extended a DOD program to assist UOCAVA voters. In the 111th Congress, a major revision of UOCAVA was completed when President Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY2010 (P.L. 111-84) on October 28, 2009. It included an amendment (S.Amdt. 1764) that contained the provisions of S. 1415, the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act (the MOVE Act). In July 2014, the Election Assistance Commission issued its Election Administration and Voting Survey report that included data on UOCAVA as well as domestic registration and voting in the 2014 election cycle. The biennial UOCAVA report is mandated by the Help America Vote Act and had previously been issued separately from the general survey report. According to the results, ballots were transmitted to UOCAVA voters by election officials in all 50 states and four of the territories, but more than half of all ballots were sent from California, Florida, New York, and Washington. The rate of ballots returned for counting was slightly lower than in the midterm election of 2010, and substantially lower than in the presidential election of 2012. States counted 94.6% of the ballots that were returned. The Overseas Vote Foundation released the results of its 2014 post-election survey in February 2015. Overall, 74% of those who requested an absentee ballot received it and 23% did not (slightly more than 2% did not know or remember whether a ballot was received). Two bills introduced in the 114th Congress would amend UOCAVA. These include H.R. 12 which is primarily related to other voting issues; and S. 2814, a version of the FY2017 NDAA bill introduced \"by request\" but that did not advance. In addition, a provision in the House-passed NDAA bill (H.R. 4909) would continue some UOCAVA reporting requirements, despite terminating some unrelated reports. In the 113th Congress, the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration held a hearing on S. 1728 on January 29, 2014, and reported the bill with an amendment in the nature of a substitute on April 10, 2014. It would have required states to report statistics on the number of absentee ballots sent to UOCAVA voters before the election, established online voter registration and updating for uniformed services voters, and made an absentee ballot request valid for the entire two-year federal election cycle. The legislation did not advance."
