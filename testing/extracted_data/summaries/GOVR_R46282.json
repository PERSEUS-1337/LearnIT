    "content": "The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have presented a new challenge for the United States as servicemembers returned from combat with serious injuries that may have been fatal in previous conflicts. These servicemembers require ongoing personal care services, which are often provided by family members and loved ones. In recognition of this significant challenge, Congress enacted the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-163 ), which required the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish specific supports for caregivers of veterans. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), within VA, offers caregiver support through two programs that were established by the act: a Program of General Caregiver Support Services ( general caregivers program ); and a Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers ( family caregiver s program ). The general caregivers program offers a basic level of support, such as education and training, to caregivers of veterans of all eras enrolled in VA health care. The family caregivers program offers comprehensive supports, such as health care benefits and a monthly stipend, to caregivers of veterans who were seriously injured in the line of duty on or after September 11, 2001 (post-9/11 veterans). VA refers to these two programs collectively as the Caregiver Support Program. The general caregivers program does not have an application or eligibility determination process. The limited services provided under this program are, generally, available to all caregivers of veterans enrolled in VA health care. Veterans and caregivers who apply for the family caregivers program undergo a multistep eligibility determination process that includes an initial assessment, education, training, and an in-home assessment. VA determines both administrative and clinical eligibility of veterans and caregivers. Caregivers who are eligible and designated as a family caregiver receive a unique suite of comprehensive services and benefits to help them provide care to the veteran. The VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018 (VA MISSION Act; P.L. 115-182 , as amended) required VA to expand eligibility for the family caregivers program to caregivers of veterans of all eras. Expansion is being implemented in two phases, as required by the VA MISSION Act. Veterans who were seriously injured in the line of duty before May 7, 1975, are to become eligible first. Two years later, veterans who served and were injured in the line of duty between May 7, 1975, and September 11, 2001, are to become eligible for the program. This expansion, which has yet to go into effect, is expected to generate a large increase in enrollment and may lead to changes to the underlying structure of the family caregivers program due to a large increase in the number of eligible individuals. Unlike the population currently eligible for the program, this newly eligible population comprises older individuals who may have different disabling conditions that require personal care assistance, which may present a challenge to eligibility determination based on an injury in the line of duty. Eligibility expansion is contingent on the implementation and certification of a functioning information technology (IT) system required to fully support the program. The VA MISSION Act required that VA complete certification of a system by October 1, 2019. VA did not meet that deadline and has not yet certified an IT system. VA published a proposed rule to implement the changes required under the VA MISSION Act on March 6, 2020. The public comment period for the proposed rule ends on May 5, 2020. This report provides an overview of the VA Caregiver Support Program, including eligibility criteria that veterans and caregivers must meet to qualify for both the family caregivers program and the general caregivers program; a catalogue of the services and benefits provided under the two programs; and current issues related to implementation of modifications under the VA MISSION Act. The Appendix provides background on the program evolution and a legislative history of the program."
