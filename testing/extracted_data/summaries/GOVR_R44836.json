    "content": "The 115th Congress continues to consider many issues related to the two major components of the unemployment insurance (UI) system: Unemployment Compensation (UC) and Extended Benefits (EB). This report begins with a brief overview of the UI programs that may provide benefits to eligible unemployed workers. It provides information on legislation enacted in the 115th Congress related to UI programs. In addition, this report includes short summaries of legislative proposals introduced in the 115th Congress as a well as UI proposals included in the President's budget for FY2019. President Trump signed H.J.Res. 42 on March 30, 2017 (P.L. 115-17). This Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution negated 20 C.F.R. Part 620. This now-negated rule had set out the circumstances under which states were allowed to prospectively drug test UC claimants based upon the prevalence of drug testing in the occupations in which they were seeking employment. Additionally, President Trump signed P.L. 115-123, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, on February 9, 2018. Among other provisions, P.L. 115-123 includes two types of UI provisions: (1) codification of Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessments (RESEAs) for UI beneficiaries, including funding and other requirements; and (2) a deferral of outstanding interest on federal UI loans for the U.S. Virgin Islands. President Trump signed P.L. 115-254, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, on October 5, 2018. Among its many provisions, this law temporarily extends the duration of Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) for an additional 26 weeks (up to 52 weeks total) for persons who were unemployed in Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin as a direct result of the 2017 Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria disasters. This report also describes UI legislation proposed in the 115th Congress that addresses the following: Rehiring UI beneficiaries and exhaustees\u2014H.R. 3702 and H.R. 4470 Vouchers and demonstration projects\u2014H.R. 1091 Additional UI benefits for certain energy workers\u2014S. 987 and H.R. 3314 Drug Testing\u2014H.R. 3330 Unemployment Compensation for Ex-Servicemembers (UCX)\u2014H.R. 2861 For information on the expired Emergency Unemployment Compensation 2008 (EUC08) program, which provided additional unemployment benefits from July 2008 to December 2013, see CRS Report R42444, Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08): Status of Benefits Prior to Expiration.
