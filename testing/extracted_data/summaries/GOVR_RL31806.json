    "content": "The Interior and related agencies appropriations bill includes funds for the Department of the Interior (DOI), except for the Bureau of Reclamation, and for some agencies or programs withinthree other departments -- Agriculture, Energy, and Health and Human Services. It also fundsnumerous smaller related agencies. President Bush's FY2004 budget for Interior and related agencies totaled $19.89 billion, $220.5million (1%) less than enacted for FY2003 ($20.11 billion). On July 17, 2003, the House passed H.R. 2691 (268-152) containing a total of $19.60 billion for Interior and relatedagencies for FY2004. On September 23, 2003, the Senate passed its version of H.R. 2691 with a total of $20.01 billion. A conference report was filed on October 28, 2003, and agreedto by the House (216-205) on October 30 and approved by the Senate (87-2) on November 3, 2003. The bill was signed into law on November 10, 2003 ( P.L. 108-108 ). The final FY2004 appropriation provided $20.01 billion for the Department of Interior andRelated agencies, which reflected two across-the-board cuts: a 0.646% cut in the Interiorappropriations statute ( P.L.108-108 ), and a 0.59% cut in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of2004 ( P.L. 108-199 ). The FY2004 enacted level is slightly less than enacted for FY2003 (less than 1% lower). It is essentially the same as the amount approved by the Senate (less than 1% higher), and higher thanthe House-passed total (2% higher) and the President's request (less than 1% higher). Theappropriate levels of funding for wildland firefighting and land acquisition were among the majorissues debated. The FY2004 law contained $2.76 billion for wildland fire fighting by the ForestService and the Department of the Interior, approximately 13% less than the total enacted forFY2003. For land acquisition (and state assistance) by the four major federal land managementagencies, the law contained $263.4 million, 36% less than enacted for FY2003. Many controversial issues arose during consideration of the FY2004 Interior and relatedagencies appropriations bill, and were addressed by conferees. The FY2004 law (1) continued theautomatic renewal of expiring grazing permits and leases for FY2004 -- FY2008; (2) extended theRecreational Fee Demonstration Program; (3) modified procedures for seeking judicial review oftimber sales in Alaska, primarily in the Tongass National Forest; (4) capped funds for competitivesourcing efforts of agencies and required documentation on the initiative; and (5) led to a stay of acourt decision requiring an accounting of Indian trust funds and trust asset transactions since 1887. The law dropped language barring funds from being used (1) to implement changes to regulationsof the Bureau of Land Management on Recordable Disclaimers of Interest in Land, (2) for theKlamath Fishery Management Council, and (3) for Outer Continental Shelf leasing activities in theNorth Aleutian Basin planning area, which includes Bristol Bay, Alaska.
