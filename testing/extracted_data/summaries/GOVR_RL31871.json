    "content": "In the immediate aftermath of the coalition victory in Iraq, U.S. policymakers face a number of decisions regarding security and government in post-war Iraq. While there are significantdifferences between the Iraq situation and other post-war experiences, observations and \"lessonslearned\" from such experiences might be relevant. This report will discuss six security andgovernance issues raised by previous experiences, with particular reference to U.S. post-World WarII occupation experiences and also peacekeeping experiences in the Balkans and Afghanistan. It maybe updated as new issues arise for which assessments of previous experiences might be useful. Previous experience suggests three key decisions on security in post-war Iraq which policymakers must take. These are: (1) what security tasks must be performed, (2) who shouldperform them, and (3) how large should an occupation military force be, and how long should itremain? Many tasks must be performed in order to guarantee the security of citizens and propertyin the post-conflict environment, several of which require \"constabulary\" forces, i.e., thosepossessing both military and policing skills. In previous major U.S. occupations, U.S. soldiersinitially performed most policing tasks, turning them over to indigenous police as the situationallowed. In the 1990s, peacekeepers increasingly assumed policing functions as the need toguarantee security for property and citizens in the aftermath of conflict became apparent. Manyanalysts have argued that policing functions are not appropriate for U.S. forces, as they can erodewarfighting and many also believe that appropriately trained civilian police are often preferable. The lack of such personnel, however, has been a problem in current peacekeeping operations. Thesize of an occupation force, and the length of time that it should remain in place during anoccupation government depends on many factors, including in particular the tasks it undertakes andthe cooperation it receives from Iraqis. Policymakers must also decide what type of assistance to provide Iraq in creating a new government and supporting institutions to fill the power vacuum left by the fall of the Husseingovernment. Three issues are: (1) who should form a post-war government for Iraq, (2) what arethe possibilities of and means to achieving democracy in Iraq, and (3) how long is a peacebuildingpresence necessary? While the U.S. government has taken charge of the formation of a new Iraqigovernment, with the intent of encouraging the creation of democratic institutions and practices,some analysts believe that the possibilities for creating a viable and democratic Iraqi governmentwould be enhanced if the United Nations were to assume that role. Some senior U.S. officials hadcontemplated an occupation of some two years, which some experience suggests may be inadequateto create stable institutions. Studies of past peacekeeping experiences point to the special need forconsiderable attention to building capacities to assure the rule of law, conducting elections at anappropriate time, and possibly providing for interim powersharing arrangements. Some have alsoadvocated creating or supporting channels for political participation by civic society and localgroups."
