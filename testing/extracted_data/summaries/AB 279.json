    "title": "An act to amend Sections 19551.1 and 19551.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation.",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes, until January 1, 2019, a city that has entered into a reciprocal agreement, as defined, with the Franchise Tax Board to exchange tax information, as provided. Existing law requires, until January 1, 2019, upon the request of the Franchise Tax Board, each city that assesses a city business tax or requires a city business license to annually submit to the board specified information relating to the administration of the city\u2019s business tax program. Existing law defines the term \u201ccity\u201d to include, among others, a city and county. Existing law limits the collection and use of this information and provides that any unauthorized use of this information is punishable as a misdemeanor. This bill would expand these provisions to additionally apply to a county. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
