Annually with the President's budget request for each fiscal year through FY2022, an implementation plan based on such strategy. A plan for expanding, within five years, the Visa Security Program in a risk-based manner, and a plan for deploying the Pre-Adjudicated Threat Recognition and Intelligence Operations Team program, to at least 50 US diplomatic and consular posts that issue visas. And a plan for expanding participation in trusted traveler programs. CBP shall increase the numbers of CBP officers and Agriculture Specialists for each of FY2017-FY2018. The bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish within CBP the Immigration Cooperation Program, under which CBP may cooperate with foreign authorities, air carriers, and security employees at foreign airports to identify persons who may be inadmissible to the United States or otherwise pose a risk to US security. The Government Accountability Office shall review and report on the adequacy and appropriateness of the security screening process for each US nonimmigrant visa category."
