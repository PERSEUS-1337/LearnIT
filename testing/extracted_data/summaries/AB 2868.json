    "title": "An act to add Sections 2838.2 and 2838.3 to the Public Utilities Code, relating to energy.",
    "content": "Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to determine appropriate targets, if any, for each load-serving entity to procure viable and cost-effective energy storage systems to be achieved by December 31, 2020. This bill would require the PUC, in consultation with the State Air Resources Board and the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, to direct the state\u2019s 3 largest electrical corporations to file applications for programs and investments to accelerate widespread deployment of distributed energy storage systems, as defined. The bill would authorize the PUC to approve, or modify and approve, programs and investments in distributed energy storage systems, as provided, and would require the PUC to prioritize those programs and investments that provide distributed energy storage systems to public sector and low-income customers. Because a violation of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the PUC implementing these requirements would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
