    "content": "In 2007, the Supreme Court rendered one of its most important environmental decisions. In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Court held 5-4 that greenhouse gases (GHGs), widely viewed as contributing to climate change, constitute \"air pollutants\" as that phrase is used in the Clean Air Act (CAA). As a result, said the Court, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had improperly denied a petition seeking CAA regulation of GHG emissions from new motor vehicles by citing, among other reasons, the agency's lack of authority over such emissions. This report offers a chronology of major federal agency actions, mainly by EPA, that involve GHGs or climate change and that occurred after Massachusetts v. EPA. Most of the listed actions trace directly or indirectly back to the decision. Examples include EPA's \"endangerment finding\" for GHG emissions from new motor vehicles; the resulting EPA standards (issued on multiple occasions) for GHG emissions from new motor vehicles; EPA's proposal of performance standards (again on separate occasions) for CO2 emissions from new, and modified or reconstructed, fossil fuel-fired power plants; and EPA's proposal of emission guidelines for CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired power plants. Several listed EPA actions, taken on the agency's view that regulation of GHG emissions from new motor vehicles triggers new source review of GHG stationary sources, are now either void or will have to be limited slightly in scope, owing to the 2014 decision of the Supreme Court in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA. A few agency actions were included in the report solely because of their relevance to climate change and their post-Massachusetts occurrence\u2014that is, they were not legally compelled by Massachusetts v. EPA or EPA actions tracing back to that decision. Examples include EPA's responses to California's request for a waiver of CAA preemption allowing that state to set its own limits for GHG emissions from new motor vehicles; OMB's \"social cost of carbon\" dollar amount to be used in agency cost-benefit analyses; the Council on Environmental Quality's draft guidance on how climate change is to be considered in environmental impact statements; and EPA's monitoring rule for GHG emissions. More analytical treatment of the government actions in this report may be found in other CRS reports listed in footnote 16 herein."
