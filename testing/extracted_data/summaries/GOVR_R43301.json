    "content": "Many federally funded programs that assist unemployed workers are co-located and coordinated through state and locally run American Job Centers (AJCs; also known as One-Stop Career Centers). The specific set of benefits and services available to a worker through the AJC network varies by the worker's characteristics and reason for unemployment. Unemployment insurance (UI) is a federal-state system and mandatory AJC partner. UI benefits are available to workers who have involuntarily lost their jobs and have demonstrated a required level of labor force attachment. UI provides weekly cash payments to replace a portion of the eligible workers' earnings, up to a statewide maximum. Eligibility and benefit levels vary by state, though most states offer up to 26 weeks of state-financed UI benefits through each state's Unemployment Compensation (UC) program. Certain economic conditions may extend the duration of UI benefits through the permanent Extended Benefit (EB) program. To assist workers in obtaining employment, AJCs coordinate a number of programs that provide career services and training benefits. These efforts include both broadly available programs and targeted programs. Unlike UI benefits, which are mandatory entitlements, these employment and training programs are subject to funding caps. The primary AJC partner programs can generally be characterized as follows: Grants with a national scope support employment and training activities in all states. The activities supported by each grant vary. Some programs are available to all jobseekers while others limit eligibility based on a jobseeker's reason for unemployment or personal characteristics. Competitive grants support more targeted employment and training services. These grants may not have a presence in all states. Other partner programs are mandatory AJC partners that indirectly support employment and training activities or support employment and training activities among other functions. This report is limited to mandatory AJC partners under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014. Some federally funded programs with employment and training components are not AJC partners and some AJC partners have primary purposes other than employment. As such, the group of programs discussed in this report may vary from other reviews of federal workforce programs and should not be considered conclusive nor exhaustive."
