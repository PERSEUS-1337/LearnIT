Gradient Boosting Trees, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression are typically used for classification tasks on tabular data. The recent work of Super Characters method using two-dimensional word embeddings achieved state-of-the-art results in text classification tasks, showcasing the promise of this new approach. In this paper, we propose the SuperTML method, which borrows the idea of Super Characters method and two-dimensional embeddings to address the problem of classification on tabular data. For each input of tabular data, the features are first projected into two-dimensional embeddings like an image, and then this image is fed into fine-tuned ImageNet CNN models for classification. Experimental results have shown that the proposed SuperTML method have achieved state-of-the-art results on both large and small datasets. In data science, data is categorized into structured data and unstructured data. Structured data is also known as tabular data, and the terms will be used interchangeably. Anthony Goldbloom, the founder and CEO of Kaggle observed that winning techniques have been divided by whether the data was structured or unstructured BID12 . Currently, DNN models are widely applied for usage on unstructured data such as image, speech, and text. According to Anthony, \"When the data is unstructured, its definitely CNNs and RNNs that are carrying the day\" BID12 . The successful CNN model in the ImageNet competition BID8 has outperformed human for image classification task by ResNet BID6 since 2015.On the other side of the spectrum, machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, have been used to process structured data. According to a recent survey of 14,000 data scientists by Kaggle (2017) , a subdivision of structured data known as relational data is reported as the most popular type of data in industry, with at least 65% working daily with relational data. Regarding structured data competitions, Anthony says that currently XGBoost is winning practically every competition in the structured data category BID4 . XGBoost BID2 is one popular package implementing the Gradient Boosting method.Recent research has tried using one-dimensional embedding and implementing RNNs or one-dimensional CNNs to address the TML (Tabular Machine Learning) tasks, or tasks that deal with structured data processing BID7 BID11 , and also categorical embedding for tabular data with categorical features BID5 . However, this reliance upon onedimensional embeddings may soon come to change. Recent NLP research has shown that the two-dimensional embedding of the Super Characters method BID9 is capable of achieving state-of-the-art results on large dataset benchmarks. The Super Characters method is a two-step method that was initially designed for text classification problems. In the first step, the characters of the input text are drawn onto a blank image. In the second step, the image is fed into two-dimensional CNN models for classification. The two-dimensional CNN models are trained by fine-tuning from pretrained models on large image dataset, e.g. ImageNet.In this paper, we propose the SuperTML method, which borrows the concept of the Super Characters method to address TML problems. For each input, tabular features are first projected onto a two-dimensional embedding and fed into fine-tuned two-dimensional CNN models for classification. The proposed SuperTML method handles the categorical type and missing values in tabular data automatically, without need for explicit conversion into numerical type values. The proposed SuperTML method borrows the idea of twodimensional embedding from Super Characters and transfers the knowledge learned from computer vision to the structured tabular data. Experimental results shows that the proposed SuperTML method has achieved state-of-the-art results on both large and small tabular dataset."
