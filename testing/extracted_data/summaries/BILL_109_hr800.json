Requires pending actions to be dismissed. Excludes actions: (1) brought against a person who has been convicted of transferring a firearm knowing that it would be used to commit a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime, by a party directly harmed by such crime. (2) brought against a seller for negligent entrustment or negligence per se. (3) in which a manufacturer or seller of a firearm knowingly violated a state or federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the firearm, if the violation was a proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought. (4) for breach of contract or warranty in connection with the purchase of the firearm. Or (5) for death, physical injuries, or property damage resulting directly from a defect in design or manufacture of the firearm when used as intended or in a reasonably foreseeable manner, except that if the discharge was caused by a volitional act that constituted a criminal offense, such act shall be considered the sole proximate cause of any resulting death, personal injury, or property damage."
