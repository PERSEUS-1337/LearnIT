Directs the FBI to develop grant criteria, including: (1) the number of unsolved crimes awaiting DNA analysis. And (2) the development of a comprehensive plan to collect and analyze DNA evidence. Sets forth award conditions regarding quality assurance standards, DNA sample and analysis availability, and a 15 percent matching requirement."
