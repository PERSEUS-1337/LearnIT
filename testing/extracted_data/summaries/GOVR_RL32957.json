    "content": "For decades, Congress has enacted laws authorizing generic promotion programs for anumber of farm products to increase overall demand and consumption of the agricultural product. These generic promotion programs, commonly known as \"check-off\" programs, are funded throughthe payment of mandatory assessments imposed on the amount of product that a covered party sells,produces, or imports. Some producers have opposed the use of generic advertisements and havebrought First Amendment challenges in court. Generally, these parties claim that they should notbe required to pay for advertisements (i.e., speech ) with which they disagree. The Supreme Court has ruled on the constitutionality of check-off programs three times inthe last eight years, the most recent of which occurred in May 2005. The Court's first two attemptsat addressing First Amendment challenges to check-off programs resulted in contrasting outcomesand some confusion for lower courts. In Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Association , the SupremeCourt's third and most recent decision concerning a check-off program (beef), the Court ruled thatthe generic advertising under the program was the government's own speech, and was therefore notsusceptible to the First Amendment challenge before it. The Supreme Court's decision was basedon grounds that had not been previously addressed by the Court in the earlier check-off cases andmay have far-reaching effects. For example, three circuit court rulings that invalidated othercheck-off programs have already been vacated by the Court for reconsideration in light of Johanns . This report begins with a brief introduction to check-off programs and then describes manyof the First Amendment principles that have been discussed in check-off cases. Next is an analysisof the first two challenges that reached the Supreme Court, as well as a brief discussion ofsubsequent lower court decisions. This report concludes with a discussion of Johanns v. LivestockMarketing Association and its possible implications for check-off programs. This report will beupdated as warranted."
