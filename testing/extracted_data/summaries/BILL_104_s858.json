N. officials or employees, unless the President certifies to appropriate congressional committees that the Director of Central Intelligence has implemented specified requirements agreed to and implemented by the United Nations for protecting such intelligence.

Requires the President to report at least quarterly to specified congressional committees on the types and volume of intelligence provided to the United Nations, including the purposes for which it was provided, as well as any unauthorized intelligence disclosures that become known."
