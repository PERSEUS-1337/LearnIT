    "title": "AB 1864",
    "content": "Existing law states that the Legislature finds and declares that sudden infant death syndrome, as defined, is the leading cause of death for children under age one. Existing law requires the coroner to, among other things, perform an autopsy, within 24 hours or as soon thereafter as feasible, in any case where an infant has died suddenly and unexpectedly. This bill would define \u201csudden unexplained death in childhood\u201d as the sudden death of a child one year of age or older but under 18 years of age that is unexplained by the history of the child and for which a thorough postmortem examination fails to demonstrate an adequate cause of death. The bill would require the coroner to notify the parent or responsible adult of a child within that definition about the importance of taking tissue samples. The bill would also exempt the coroner from liability for damages in a civil action for any act or omission done in compliance with these provisions. The bill would make other, nonsubstantive, changes. By expanding the duties of a local agency, this bill would create a state-mandated local program. This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 27491.41 of the Government Code, proposed by SB 1189, to be operative only if SB 1189 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
