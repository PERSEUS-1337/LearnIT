Containment and mitigation efforts by U.S. federal, state, and local governments have been undertaken to \"flatten the curve\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, to slow the widespread transmission that could overwhelm the nation's health care system. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act, P.L. 116-136 ) was enacted on March 27, 2020. It is the third comprehensive law enacted in 2020 to address the pandemic. In addition to a number of broad health care provisions, the CARES Act provides additional supplemental appropriations to support federal response efforts and authorizes a number of economic stimulus measures, among other things. This report describes the majority of health-related sections in Division A, Title III, of the CARES Act, \"Supporting America's Health Care System in the Fight Against the Coronavirus.\" Relevant background is provided for context. Specifically, this report describes provisions regarding, among other things, the following: The availability of medical countermeasures (MCMs)\u00e2\u0080\u0094drugs, tests, treatments, medical devices, and supplies such as personal protective equipment (PPE)\u00e2\u0080\u0094including research and development; product regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS); and other supply chain matters. The health workforce, including telehealth programs, the rural health care system, and the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS). Additional workforce provisions described in this report include reauthorization and extension of appropriations for existing HHS health workforce programs, and liability limitation. Provisions addressed at the Medicare and Medicaid programs and on private health insurance plans that temporarily require, or increase payment for, telehealth services and specified services related to COVID-19 testing, diagnosis, or treatment. A newly established FDA authority for over-the-counter (OTC) drug review. This report does not address education or labor provisions in Subtitle B or C in Part IV of Title III, or provisions in Subtitle E of Part IV of Title III, \"Health and Human Services Extenders,\" which are described in other CRS reports. The report also does not include Division B of the act, which provides emergency supplemental appropriations for the COVID-19 response. The Appendix catalogues deadlines, effective dates, and reporting requirements for provisions described in the report. This report is intended to reflect the CARES Act at enactment (i.e., March 27, 2020). It does not track the law's implementation or funding and will not be updated."
