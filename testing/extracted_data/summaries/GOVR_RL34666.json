    "content": "Every year Congress appropriates billions of dollars for the Science and Technology Program of the Department of Defense. Besides deciding on how much money to appropriate, Congress must also decide on how best to allocate those resources. Over the last ten years, the Science and Technology program has grown to historic levels in inflation-adjusted dollars. However, the funding increases appear to have peaked. In light of growing federal budget deficits, Congress may re-examine its investments in DOD's S&T program. Before doing that, it might be helpful to understand how the budget increases of the last ten years have been allocated. That is the purpose of this report. Between FY1998 and FY2007, the annual budget of the Department of Defense (DOD) Science and Technology (S&T) program grew from $7.7 billion to $12.8 billion. The cumulative increase, in constant FY2009 dollars, was $22.5 billion. The increase was distributed broadly across the S&T program. In constant dollars, the S&T budget of all departments (Army, Navy, and Air Force) and all defense agencies increased (except that of the Missile Defense Agency). While there was some variation in the distribution, no single department, agency, budget activity or program predominated. Of the three budget activities that make up the S&T program\u2014basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development\u2014basic research increased the least. The increase in basic research varied widely between departments and agencies. Army, Navy, and Air Force advanced technology development, and Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) applied research received the highest increases. Considering individual program elements, the Army's Combat Vehicle and Advanced Automotive Technology advanced technology development program received the single largest increase in constant dollars ($1.7 billion FY2009 dollars). The mission area that attracted the greatest increases was countering weapons of mass destruction. Four of the eleven S&T program elements that received the highest increases were related to this mission. This report will not be updated."
