    "title": "An act to amend Section 25503.6 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to alcoholic beverages.",
    "content": "Existing law, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, authorizes a beer manufacturer, the holder of a winegrower\u2019s license, a distilled spirits rectifier, a distilled spirits manufacturer, or a distilled spirits manufacturer\u2019s agent to purchase advertising space and time from, or on behalf of, an on-sale retail licensee subject to specified conditions, including that the advertising space or time is purchased only in connection with the events to be held on the premises of the exposition park, stadium, or arena owned by the on-sale licensee. Existing law makes a violation of these provisions a crime. This bill would change that specified condition to also allow the advertising space or time to be purchased in connection with the events to be held on those premises leased by the on-sale licensee. By changing the definition of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
