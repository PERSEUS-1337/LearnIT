    "content": "Otay Mountain Wilderness Act of 1998 - Designates specified public lands in the California Desert District of the Bureau of Land Management as the Otay Mountain Wilderness. Recognizes that, because of the Wilderness Area's proximity to the US-Mexican international border, drug interdiction, border operations, and wildland fire management operations need to continue so long as they are conducted in accordance with the Wilderness Act and any conditions the Secretary of the Interior considers appropriate. Declares that such designation is not intended to lead to the creation of protective buffer zones around the Wilderness."
