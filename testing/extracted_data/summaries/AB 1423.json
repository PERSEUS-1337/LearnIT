    "title": "An act to add Section 2604 to the Penal Code, relating to medical treatment of prisoners.",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the designation and selection of health care surrogates, and for the manner of making health care decisions for patients without surrogates. Existing law prohibits the administration of psychiatric medication to an inmate in state prison on a nonemergency basis without the inmate\u2019s informed consent, unless certain conditions are satisfied, including, among other things, that a psychiatrist determines that the inmate is gravely disabled and does not have the capacity to refuse treatment with psychiatric medication. Existing law authorizes a physician to administer psychiatric medication to a prison inmate in specified emergency situations. This bill would, except as provided, establish a process for a licensed physician or dentist to file a petition with the Office of Administrative Hearings to request that an administrative law judge make a determination as to a patient\u2019s capacity to give informed consent or make a health care decision, and request appointment of a surrogate decisionmaker, if the patient is an adult housed in state prison, the physician or dentist is unable to obtain informed consent from the inmate patient because the physician or dentist determines that the inmate patient appears to lack capacity to provide informed consent or make a health care decision, and there is no person with legal authority to provide informed consent for, or make decisions concerning the health care of, the inmate patient. The bill would require the petition to contain specified information, including, among other things, the inmate patient\u2019s current physical condition and a description of the health care conditions currently afflicting the inmate patient. This bill would require that the petition be served on the inmate patient and his or her counsel, and filed with the office, as provided. The bill would also require that the inmate patient be provided with counsel and a written notice advising him or her of, among other things, the inmate patient\u2019s right to be present at the hearing. Except as specified, the bill would require that the inmate patient be provided with a hearing before an administrative law judge within 30 days of the date of filing the petition. In case of an emergency, as defined, the bill would authorize the inmate patient\u2019s physician or dentist to administer a medical intervention that requires informed consent prior to the date of the administrative hearing and would require that counsel for the inmate patient be notified by the physician or dentist. The bill would require the administrative law judge to determine and provide a written order and findings setting forth whether there has been clear and convincing evidence that, among other things, the inmate patient lacks capacity to give informed consent or make a health care decision. If the findings required by these provisions are made, the bill would require the administrative law judge to appoint a surrogate decisionmaker for health care for the inmate patient, as provided, which would be valid for one year and would be valid at any state correctional facility within California. The bill would also provide for a process to renew the appointment of the surrogate decisionmaker. The bill would authorize the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to adopt regulations as necessary to carry out these provisions."
