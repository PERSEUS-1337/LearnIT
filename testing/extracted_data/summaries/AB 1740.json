    "content": "Existing law authorizes certain internship and fellowship programs in state government. This bill would establish the California Law Fellowship Program for the purpose of offering licensed attorneys and other qualifying law school graduates limited-term placements in public sector positions within state government as California Law Fellows, and encouraging each participant fellow to seek permanent public-sector employment at the conclusion of his or her fellowship, as specified. Existing law, commonly known as the Code of Ethics, prohibits a Member of the Legislature or an employee of either house of the Legislature from receiving or agreeing to receive, directly or indirectly, any compensation, reward, or gift from any source except the State of California for any service, advice, assistance, or other matter related to the legislative process, except for specified circumstances. This bill would provide that the services of a participant in the California Law Fellowship Program Fellow are not compensation, a reward, or a gift to a Member of the Legislature for purposes of the so-called Code of Ethics. The bill would also provide that a participant in the program is not an employee of either house of the Legislature for purposes of the Code of Ethics. Existing law designates the Capitol Area Plan approved by the Director of General Services as the official state master plan for development in the City of Sacramento\u2019s central city area. Existing law requires the plan to be used as a guide for the location of state buildings and other facilities in the metropolitan area. Existing law governs the lease or sale of real property covered by the plan that is owned by the state and not under the jurisdiction of any other state agency. This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to those lease and sale provisions."
