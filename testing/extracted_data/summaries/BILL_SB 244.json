    "title": "SB 244",
    "content": "The Mobilehome Residency Law authorizes the management of a mobilehome park to, until January 1, 2016, file a petition for an order to enjoin a continuing or recurring violation of a reasonable rule or regulation of the mobilehome park within the limited jurisdiction of the superior court of the county in which the mobilehome community is located. Existing law, until January 1, 2016, treats these actions for injunctive relief as a limited civil case. This bill would extend the operation of these provisions indefinitely."
