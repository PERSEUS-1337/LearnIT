    "title": "AB 869",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes a public transportation agency to adopt and enforce an ordinance to impose and enforce civil administrative penalties for fare evasion or other passenger misconduct, other than by minors, on or in a transit facility or vehicle in lieu of the criminal penalties otherwise applicable, with specified administrative procedures for the imposition and enforcement of the administrative penalties, including an initial review and opportunity for a subsequent administrative hearing. This bill would provide that a person who fails to pay the administrative penalty when due or successfully complete the administrative process to dismiss the notice of fare evasion or passenger misconduct conduct violation may be subject to those criminal penalties. The bill would require the notice of fare evasion or passenger misconduct conduct violation to contain a printed statement that the person may be charged with an infraction or misdemeanor if the administrative penalty is not paid when due or dismissed pursuant to these provisions. The bill would also require the processing agency to dismiss the original notice of fare evasion or passenger conduct violation and make no further attempts to collect the administrative penalty if the person is charged with an infraction or misdemeanor after failing to pay the administrative penalty or successfully complete the civil administrative process. The bill would require the processing agency to personally serve the person charged with an infraction or misdemeanor with a new notice of fare evasion or passenger conduct violation that sets forth the criminal violation. Because the bill would expand the scope of an existing crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
