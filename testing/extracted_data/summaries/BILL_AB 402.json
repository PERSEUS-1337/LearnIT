    "title": "AB 402",
    "content": "The Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganization Act of 2000 governs the procedures for the formation and change of organization of cities and special districts. Existing law permits a city or district to provide extended services, as defined, outside its jurisdictional boundaries only if it first requests and receives written approval from the local agency formation commission in the affected county. Under existing law, the commission may authorize a city or district to provide new or extended services outside both its jurisdictional boundaries and its sphere of influence under specified circumstances, including when responding to an impending threat to the public health or safety of the residents in the affected territory where specified requirements are met. This bill would revise the circumstances under which the commission may authorize a city or district to provide new or extended services. This bill would additionally establish a pilot program, until January 1, 2021, for the Napa and San Bernardino commissions that would permit those commissions to authorize a city or district to provide new or extended services outside both its jurisdictional boundaries and its sphere of influence under specified circumstances. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Napa and San Bernardino commissions. This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 56133 of the Government Code proposed by SB 239 that would become operative if this bill and SB 239 are both enacted and this bill is enacted last."
