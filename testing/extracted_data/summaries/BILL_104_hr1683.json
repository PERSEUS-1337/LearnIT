    "content": "Public Employee Pension Plan Liability Act of 1995 - Permits a participant or beneficiary under a public employee pension plan to bring a civil action against the plan to: (1) recover benefits due him or her under the plan's terms, to enforce his or her rights, or to clarify his or her rights to future benefits. (2) enjoin any act or practice which violates the plan's terms. Or (3) obtain other appropriate equitable relief to enforce such terms or redress violations of them. Allows a plaintiff, in most instances, to prevail in such an action by proving the case by a preponderance of the evidence. Requires proof by clear and convincing evidence, however, if the action involves a plan under which changes in employer contributions are subject to review by a qualified review board. Grants State courts and US district courts concurrent jurisdiction of such actions. Precribes the general requirements for a qualified review board. States that in general this Act applies to any public employee pension plan, with specified exceptions."
