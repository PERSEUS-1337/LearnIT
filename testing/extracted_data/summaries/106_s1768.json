    "title": "Social Security Surplus Preservation and Debt Reduction Act",
    "content": "Makes it out of order in the Senate to consider a concurrent budget resolution that sets forth a deficit for any fiscal year. Makes such point of order inapplicable if the deficit for a fiscal year results solely from the enactment of social security reform legislation or provisions designated as emergency requirements. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the congressional budget resolution for FY 2000 provides a sound framework for allocating resources to Medicare to modernize Medicare benefits, improve the solvency of the program, and improve coverage of prescription drugs."
