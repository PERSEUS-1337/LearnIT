Directs the Administrator to publish data on storage at: (1) major market centers, and (2) the regions reported in specified weekly and monthly inventory data. Directs the Administrator to work with the states participating in SHOPP to develop a comparable program to collect data on wood pellets, firewood, and other biomass. Directs the Secretary of Energy to lead federal and state emergency response efforts regarding propane supply emergencies in any state or region characterized by either sudden increases in consumer prices for propane, or propane supply shortages that threaten public safety or livestock safety. Amends the Propane Education and Research Act of 1996 to direct the Propane Education and Research Council to develop for propane distributors and consumers training programs on strategies to mitigate negative effects of future propane price spikes. Directs the Secretary to study the effectiveness and feasibility of establishing propane storage facilities operated separately from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Authorizes the Secretary to submit to Congress and the President a plan describing such regional propane reserve. Amends the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to include within the storage facility loan program funding for propane storage and handling facilities used for drying and heating. Directs the Comptroller General (GAO) to study facilities appurtenant to propane pipelines that are not subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to determine: (1) whether the nonjurisdictional nature of the facilities is injurious to shippers or consumers. And (2) whether the facilities can be placed under FERC jurisdiction or, if not, whether changes in law to place them under FERC jurisdiction are in the public interest."
