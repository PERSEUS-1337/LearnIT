    "content": "Ultrasound Informed Consent Act This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require abortion providers, before a woman gives informed consent to any part of an abortion: (1) perform an obstetric ultrasound on the pregnant woman. (2) provide a simultaneous explanation of what the ultrasound is depicting. (3) display the ultrasound images so the woman may view them, andnbsp. (4) provide a complete medical description of the images, including the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, cardiac activity if present and visible, and the presence of external members and internal organs if present and viewable. The bill establishes civil penalties for violations. It prohibits construing this bill to require a woman to view the images or penalizing the provider or the woman if the woman declines to look at the images."
