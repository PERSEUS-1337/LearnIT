    "content": "Iraq's agricultural sector represents a small but vital component of Iraq's economy. Over the past several decades agriculture's role in the economy has been heavily influenced by Iraq'sinvolvement in military conflicts, particularly the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, the 1991 Gulf War, andthe 2003 Iraq War, and by varying degrees of government effort to promote and/or controlagricultural production. Rapid population growth coupled with limited arable land and a general stagnation in agricultural productivity has steadily increased dependence on imports to meet domestic food needssince the mid-1960s. Prior to the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq was a major trading partner with the U.S. Iraqbenefitted from substantial USDA agricultural export credit during the 1980s to purchase largequantities of U.S. agricultural commodities. By the mid-1980s Iraq was the major destination forU.S. rice exports. Iraq was also an important purchaser of U.S. wheat, corn, soymeal, and cotton. After the 1991 Gulf War, U.S. agricultural export credit to Iraq was ended and USDA was left with$2 billion in unpaid credit. U.S. agricultural trade with Iraq remained negligible through 2002. Present-day Iraqi agriculture and trade have been heavily shaped by the 1990 U.N. sanctions and the Iraqi government's response to them. From 1991 to 1996, prior to the startup of the U.N.'sOil-For-Food program (OFFP), Iraq's agricultural imports averaged $958 million or less than halfof the pre-war level. Under the OFFP, the value of Iraq's agricultural imports rebounded to average$1.5 billion (during the 1997-2002 period). In early 2003, just prior to the U.S. -- Iraq War, the country's agricultural sector remained beset by the legacy of past mis-management, unresolved disputes over land and water rights, and thelingering effects of a severe drought during 1999-2001. Clearly, Iraq will be dependent on importsfor fully meeting domestic food demand for several years to come. In the near term, food aidshipments are likely to play a major role in determining the share of Iraq's agricultural imports, andmay influence the evolution of future commercial imports. This report is an extension of CRS Report RS21516 , \"Iraq's Agriculture: Background and Status.\" It provides a brief description of Iraq's agro-climatic setting and the history of agriculturalpolicy, production, and trade leading up to the period just prior to the 2003 Gulf War; it reviewsissues likely to affect the long-term outlook for Iraq's agricultural production and trade; and itprovides several tables of historical data relevant to understanding the evolution of Iraq's agriculturalproduction and trade. This report will be updated as events warrant. For detailed discussion on thestatus of humanitarian aid efforts, see CRS Report RL31833 , Iraq: Recent Developments inHumanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance . For discussion on the U.N. Oil-For-Food Programand trade during the decade of the 1990s see CRS Report RL30472 , Iraq: Oil-For-Food Program,International Sanctions, and Illicit Trade ."
