Requires the scholarship recipient to agree to residency training in a primary care specialty and a five-year post-graduate period of service in a health professional shortage area. Requires that preference be given in award of scholarships to applicants enrolled in: (1) an accelerated track family-medicine program , or (2) a program that includes clinical training in rural or underserved urban communities.
