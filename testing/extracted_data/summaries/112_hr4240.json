    "content": "Ambassador James R. Lilley and Congressman Stephen J. Solarz North Korea Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2012 - Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should: (1) continue to seek cooperation from foreign governments to allow the United States to process North Korean refugees overseas for US resettlement, (2) urge China to halt its forcible repatriation of North Koreans, and (3) allow the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) access to North Koreans inside China to determine whether such North Koreans are refugees requiring protection. Amends the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 to authorize appropriations through FY2017: (1) for grants that promote democracy, human rights, and a market economy in North Korea, (2) to increase the availability of non-government controlled information inside North Korea, and (3) for organizations or persons that provide humanitarian assistance to North Koreans who are outside of North Korea. Extends through 2017 the annual congressional reporting requirement for: (1) the Secretary of State to report on activities to increase the availability of non-government controlled information inside North Korea, (2) the Special Envoy for North Korean human rights issues to report on human rights related activities, (3) the Secretary and Administrator of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to report on US humanitarian assistance inside North Korea and to North Koreans outside of North Korea, and (4) the Secretary and the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to report on the number of North Koreans seeking refugee status or political asylum in the United States. Directs the Broadcasting Board of Governors to report to Congress regarding US broadcasting to North Korea and the extent to which the Board has achieved the goal of 12-hour-per-day broadcasting to North Korea."
