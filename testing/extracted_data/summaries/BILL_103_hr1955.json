    "content": "International Whaling Moratorium Enforcement Act of 1993 - Directs the President to certify to the Congress each country that has not completely ceased whaling operations which are not authorized and specifically approved by the International Whaling Commission or which otherwise diminish the effectiveness of any conservation program under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. Deems that certification to be a certification under specified provisions of the Fishermen's Protective Act, requiring the application of related provisions, including those prohibiting the importation of fish and wildlife products from the offending country. Mandates such a ban on fish and fish products. Authorizes additional economic sanctions if the fish and fish products ban is insufficient to stop such whaling."
