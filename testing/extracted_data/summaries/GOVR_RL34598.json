    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides benefits to veterans who meet certain eligibility rules. Benefits to veterans range from disability compensation and pensions to hospital and medical care. The VA provides these benefits through three major operating units: the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA). The VHA is primarily a direct service provider of primary care, specialized care, and related medical and social support services to veterans through the nation's largest integrated health care system. On February 4, 2008, the President submitted his FY2009 budget proposal to Congress. The Administration requested a total of $39.2 billion (excluding collections) for VHA. This is a 5.3% increase (or $2.0 billion) over the FY2008 enacted level. Including total available resources (including medical collections) the Administration's budget would have provided $41.1 billion for VHA. On March 7, 2008, the House (H.Con.Res. 312) and Senate (S.Con.Res. 70) reported their respective budget resolutions. After negotiations between the House and Senate, the House agreed to an amended version of S.Con.Res. 70 (Conference Report; H.Rept. 110-659). The conference agreement provided $48.2 billion for FY2009 for discretionary veterans' programs, including medical care, and provided $45.1 billion in mandatory funding for veterans programs. On June 24, the House Appropriations Committee marked up the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill (H.R. 6599; H.Rept. 110-775) for FY2009. On August 1, the House passed H.R. 6599. The House-passed measure provided $40.8 billion (excluding collections) for VHA. On July 17, 2008, the Senate Appropriations Committee marked up its version of the FY2009 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations bill (S. 3301; S.Rept. 110-428). The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $41.1 billion (excluding collections) for VHA for FY2009. On September 30, the President signed the H.R. 2638, the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009, into law as P.L. 110-329. This act included the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2009. In total H.R. 2638 provides a total of $40.9 billion (excluding collections) for VHA. P.L. 110-329 does not include bill language authorizing fee increases as requested by the Administration's budget proposal for the VHA for FY2009. P.L. 110-329 has provided additional funding to increase Priority Group 8 enrollment in FY2009, and to increase the mileage reimbursement rate to 41.5 cents per mile. With the passage of H.R. 2638 (P.L. 110-329), the appropriation process for funding VHA for FY2009 was completed by Congress. This report will not be updated."
