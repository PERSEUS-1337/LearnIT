    "content": "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill in the past included funding for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), most of the Department of Energy (DOE), and a number of independent agencies. After the budget request for FY2006 was submitted in February 2005, both the House and the Senate Appropriations Committees reorganized their subcommittee structure and with it the content of the various appropriations bills to be introduced. In the case of Energy and Water Development, the only changes were the consolidation of DOE programs that had previously been funded by the Interior and Related Agencies bill. When these programs are included, the requested amount for FY2006 Energy and Water Development totals $29.75 billion. For FY2005, $30.17 billion was appropriated for comparable programs. On May 18, 2005, the House Appropriations Committee reported out H.R. 2419 (H.Rept. 109-86), with a total appropriation of $29.75 billion, including the programs formerly funded in the Interior and Related Agencies bill. The House passed the bill May 24. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported out its version of H.R. 2419 on June 16 (S.Rept. 109-84), and the Senate passed it June 30. The Senate bill totaled $31.245 billion. On November 7, 2005, the House-Senate Conference on H.R. 2419 agreed to a bill funding Energy and Water Development programs at $30.49 billion (H.Rept. 109-275). The House approved the conference report November 9, and the Senate November 14. President Bush signed the bill November 19 (P.L. 109-103). Key budgetary issues involving these programs include: \u2014 the effects of performance-based budgeting and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on Army Corps of Engineers priorities, and limiting the reprogramming of funds from one Corps project to another and restricting the use of multiyear contracts (Title I); \u2014 support of major ecosystem restoration initiatives, such as Florida Everglades (Title I) and California \"Bay-Delta\" (CALFED) (Title II); \u2014 funding for the proposed national nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada (Title III: Nuclear Waste Disposal); \u2014 funding for developing nuclear warheads, in light of congressional action last year to cut funding for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator and for a \"Modern Pit Facility\" to build nuclear weapons components (Title III: Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Stewardship); and \u2014 plans to reduce the time necessary to prepare the Nevada Test Site to resume nuclear weapons testing (Title III: Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Stewardship). This report will be updated as events warrant."
