    "title": "To amend title 49, United States Code, to permit air carriers to meet and discuss their schedules in order to reduce flight delays, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "Amends Federal aviation law to authorize an air carrier to file with the Attorney General a request for: (1) authority to discuss with one or more other air carriers or foreign air carriers agreements or cooperative arrangements limiting flights at an airport during a time period when scheduled air transportation exceeds airport capacity. And (2) approval of such agreements or cooperative arrangements with respect to such limits on interstate air transportation. Directs the Attorney General, notwithstanding US antitrust laws, to approve such requests if: (1) such discussions and resulting agreements are not adverse to the public interest. (2) they will facilitate voluntary adjustments in air carrier schedules that could lead to a substantial reduction in travel delays and improvement of air transportation service to the public. (3) they will not substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly. And (4) reduction in delays cannot be achieved by any other immediately available means. Authorizes the Attorney General to: (1) approve such agreements and cooperative arrangements only if each air carrier or foreign air carrier providing service or seeking to provide service to an airport under such an agreement or cooperative arrangement has agreed to it. And (2) impose any terms or conditions on any approved agreement that are needed to protect the public interest and to protect air service to an airport that has less than .25 percent of the total annual boardings in the United States . Prohibits participants in approved discussions from: (1) discussing or entering into agreements regarding rates, fares, charges, or in-flight services. Or (2) discussing particular city pairs, or submitting to other air carriers or foreign air carriers information on their proposed service or schedules in a fashion that indicates the involvement of city pairs."
