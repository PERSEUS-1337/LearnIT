    "title": "AB 1872",
    "content": "Existing law establishes categories of peace officers with varying powers and authority to make arrests and carry firearms. Under existing law, in certain counties, a deputy sheriff, who is employed to perform duties exclusively or initially relating to custodial assignments with responsibilities for maintaining the operations of county custodial facilities, is a peace officer whose authority extends to any place in the state only while engaged in the performance of the duties of his or her employment and for the purpose of carrying out the primary function of employment relating to his or her custodial assignments, or when performing other law enforcement duties directed by his or her employing agency during a local state of emergency. This bill would include deputy sheriffs in the County of Merced within that definition of peace officers, as specified. Under existing law, the University of California is established, under the administration of the Regents of the University of California, as one of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. The University of California provides instruction to students at campuses in Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. This bill would appropriate $1,315,000 from the General Fund to the Regents of the University of California, for allocation to the University of California, Merced, for various public safety purposes."
