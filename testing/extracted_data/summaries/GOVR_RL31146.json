    "content": "In the midst an economic downturn, colleges and universities in the United States are finding themselves confronting economic difficulties. Foreign students have historically been an important source of revenue for colleges and universities because unlike many of their native counterparts, foreign students frequently do not receive financial aid from the university\u2014particularly at the undergraduate level. Despite the financial justifications for admitting large numbers of foreign students, critics of foreign student admissions generally raise two objections. The first objection is that foreign students are potentially displacing United States citizens at top-tier institutions, thereby putting the United States labor force at a competitive disadvantage. The second objection is that foreign students could potentially constitute a security risk. The tension over whether to legislate foreign student admissions levels is part of a broader set of competing policy agendas surrounding economic development and national security. Foreign students sit at the nexus of these competing policies due to their linkage to both the emerging labor force and their historical ties to security-based vulnerabilities. Thus, a potential issue for the 111th Congress is whether foreign student visas should be numerically limited, or if they should remain uncapped. Additionally, Congress may need to consider whether it should legislate programs that either promote or deter additional admissions of foreign students to the United States. All nonimmigrant students are issued visas from one of three categories, and are monitored and tracked by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The three visa categories used by foreign students are F visas for academic study; M visas for vocational study; and J visas for cultural exchange. The numbers admitted have more than doubled over the past two decades. In FY1979, the total number of foreign student and cultural exchange visas issued by DOS consular officers was 224,030 and comprised 4% of all nonimmigrant visas issued. In FY2008, DOS issued 767,266 visas to F, J, and M nonimmigrants, making up 11.6% of all nonimmigrant visas issued. The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) aims to manage the tracking and monitoring of foreign students. Participation in the SEVIS program is now mandatory for all higher education institutions enrolling foreign students. A diverse set of issues related to foreign students, including foreign student funding and English-language competency, has raised concerns with some universities, advocacy groups, and other observers. Additionally, legislation introduced in previous Congresses have focused on attracting more students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Thus, it is likely that similar legislation will be introduced in the 111th Congress. This report will be updated as necessary."
