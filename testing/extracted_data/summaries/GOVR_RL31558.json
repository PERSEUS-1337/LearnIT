    "content": "In international trade, the term most-favored-nation (MFN) treatment has a meaning atvariance with what it appears to mean: the expression means equal -- rather than exclusivelyfavorable -- treatment and is often used interchangeably with \"nondiscriminatory.\" To make thisdistinction clearer and avoid a possibly misleading interpretation of the most-favored-nation term,legislation was enacted in 1998 to replace it in U.S. law with the term \"normal trade relations,\" orNTR. In this report, both terms are used interchangeably with \"nondiscriminatory.\" The UnitedStates accords general MFN treatment as a matter of international obligation as well statutory policyto all trading partners; however, MFN tariff treatment of several countries has been suspended underspecific legislation. Virtually all such suspensions, initially applied to 21 countries or politicalentities, took place under the mandate of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951, and twomore under country-specific legislation. MFN tariff treatment of countries suspended under the 1951law can be restored and maintained in effect for one-year periods by using the procedure providedunder Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 for such restoration to \"nonmarket economy\" (NME)countries. Under this procedure, an NME country needs to conclude with the United States a tradeagreement containing a reciprocal MFN clause, and be in compliance with the criteria of theJackson-Vanik (J-V) freedom-of-emigration provision of that act. The two countries whose MFNstatus was suspended by country-specific legislation could -- and did -- have it restored byPresidential action under conditions specified in the suspending law. Trade agreements with NME countries must be approved by joint resolution, and aretriennially self-renewable, but their renewal is also subject to Presidential confirmation. To maintainin force the compliance with the J-V criteria (and the MFN status), such compliance must be eitherdetermined semiannually, or waived annually, by the Secretary of State, and such determinations orwaivers are annually subject to possible disapproval by joint resolution. Repeated past legislativeaction to disapprove some waivers, particularly those for China, has been unsuccessful and NTRtreatment contingent on a waiver has invariably remained in effect. Permanent restoration of NTRstatus of any country generally requires specific legislation. Of the 29 countries, today's successors of countries or areas originally subject to the 1951suspension, 15 had their permanent NTR status restored by specific legislation (five directly and tenafter a period of conditional restoration under the Jackson-Vanik amendment), one (Poland) by thePresident under then existing statutory authority, and one (East Germany) administratively throughunification with West Germany. The status of seven of them is still temporary, subject to thedetermination of full-compliance with the Jackson-Vanik amendment, and of three of them underthe Jackson-Vanik waiver provision. Two countries (Cuba, and North Korea) are denied NTR statusaltogether. The NTR status of two countries, suspended by individual legislation, has been restoredpermanently by Presidential action as authorized by the suspending legislation. This report will be updated as warranted."
