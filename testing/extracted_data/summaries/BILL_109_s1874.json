Establishes as the legal standard for defendant liability under the Act direct participation with specific intent to commit the alleged tort. Requires courts to decline jurisdiction over an alien tort claim if: (1) the alien claimant has not exhausted adequate and available remedies in the place where the alleged tort occurred.
