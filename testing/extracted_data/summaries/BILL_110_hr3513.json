    "content": "Copper Salmon Wilderness Act of 2008 - Amends the Oregon Wilderness Act of 1984 to designate certain lands in Siskiyou National Forest as the Copper Salmon Wilderness. Allows the Secretary of Agriculture, if the boundary of the Copper Salmon Wilderness shares a border with a road, to only establish an offset that is not more than 150 feet from the centerline of the road. Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate specified segments of the North and South Forks of the Elk River in Oregon as wild or scenic rivers. Prohibits anything in this Act from being construed as diminishing any right of any Indian tribe. Directs the Secretary to seek to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Coquille Indian tribe regarding access to the Copper Salmon Wilderness to conduct historical and cultural activities. Designates certain National Forest System land in Oregon, which is administered as part of the Siskiyou National Forest, as a potential wilderness area for eventual inclusion in the Copper Salmon Wilderness. Requires the Secretary to manage the potential wilderness area as wilderness until it is designated as wilderness. Authorizes, for the purposes of implementing a specified planned ecological restoration, the use of motorized equipment and mechanized transport in the potential wilderness area. Declares that the potential wilderness area shall be designated as wilderness on the earlier of: (1) the date on which the Secretary publishes in the Federal Register the notice that the conditions in the area that are incompatible with the Wilderness Act have been removed. And (2) the date that is ten years after the enactment of this Act. Requires the potential wilderness area upon its designation as wilderness to be incorporated into the Copper Salmon Wilderness."
