    "title": "An act to add Sections 638.50, 638.51, 638.52, and 638.53 to the Penal Code, relating to privacy.",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes the Attorney General or a district attorney to make a written application to a judge of a superior court for an order permitting the interception of wire communication and electronic communication, as defined. Existing law permits an application to be made informally and granted orally if an emergency situation exists, and other factors are present. Existing law conditions the granting of an oral approval on the filing of a written application by midnight of the second full court day after the oral approval is made. Existing law prohibits a communication interception from lasting for longer than 30 days. Existing law permits an extension of the original order, not to exceed 30 days, upon a showing that there is continued probable cause that the information sought is likely to be obtained under the extension. This bill would prohibit a person, other than a provider of electronic or wire communication service for specified purposes, from installing or using a pen register or a trap and trace device, as defined. The bill would authorize a peace officer to make a written application to a magistrate for an order permitting the installation and use of a pen register or a trap and trace device. The bill would require the magistrate to enter an ex parte order authorizing the installation and use of a pen register or a trap and trace device only in specified circumstances and would permit the magistrate to question the peace officer pertaining to the need for the information. The bill would also permit an application to be made informally and granted orally if an emergency situation exists, and other factors are present. The bill would condition the grant of an oral approval on the filing of a written application by midnight of the second full court day after the pen register or trap and trace device is installed. The bill would prohibit the installation and use of a pen register or trap and trace device for longer than 60 days. The bill would permit an extension of the original order, not to exceed 60 days, upon a showing that there is continued probable cause that the information sought is likely to be obtained under the extension. The bill would clarify that any location information obtained by a pen register or a track and trace device is limited to the information that can be determined from the telephone number. The bill would make the prohibited installation or use of a pen register or a trap and trace device punishable by a fine not exceeding $2,500, or by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding 1 year, or by imprisonment in state prison for offenders with specified prior convictions, or by both that fine and imprisonment. By creating a new crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
