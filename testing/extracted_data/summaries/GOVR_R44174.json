    "content": "Apprenticeship is a job training strategy that combines on-the-job training with related instruction, typically provided in a classroom setting. This report answers frequently asked questions about apprenticeship and the federal activities that support this training approach. This Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) report focuses on the Registered Apprenticeship system, through which the U.S. Department of Labor (or a recognized state apprenticeship agency) certifies a program as meeting federal requirements related to duration, intensity, and benefit to the apprentice. Historically, the federal role in apprenticeship has primarily involved regulation and oversight. In recent years, federal funds have been made available to support the development and expansion of apprenticeship programs. There are also several established federal funding streams in which apprenticeship is an allowable, but not required, use of funds."
