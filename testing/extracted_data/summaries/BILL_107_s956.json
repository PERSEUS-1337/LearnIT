    "content": "Child Passenger Safety Act - Requires the Secretary of Transportation, if by October 1 of years beginning in 2004 a State has not enacted a child safety restraint law, to transfer specified percentages of Federal-aid highway funds from specified State apportionments to the apportionment for highway safety, to be used to implement a statewide comprehensive child and other passenger protection education program. Requires such a program to include instruction concerning proper seating positions for children in air bag equipped motor vehicles and instruction designed to increase the proper use of child restraint systems. Defines a child safety restraint law as one that prohibits driving a motor vehicle if a passenger under age 16 is not properly secured by a safety belt, unless the passenger is under age nine and is properly secured in a child safety seat."
