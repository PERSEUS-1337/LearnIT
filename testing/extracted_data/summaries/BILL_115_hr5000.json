    "content": "Free to Fly Act The bill modifies definitions relating to aviation to permit a foreign air carrier to own US domestic air routes. The foreign carrier may establish US-based subsidiaries for such purpose. All foreign-owed air carriers that obtain a certificate to fly domestic routes may only hire US citizens or nationals, or permanent legal residents. The Department of Transportation (DOT) may issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity to a foreign air carrier with a board of directors that is comprised of more than 49 non-US citizens. The bill expands the scope of the President's review of DOT actions involving foreign air carriers. The Department of Defense may waive citizenship requirements for certain foreign air carriers participating in the civil reserve air fleet."
