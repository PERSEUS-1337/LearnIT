    "content": "Amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to repeal provisions concerning presidential authority to review certain proposed mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers (transactions) of US entities by foreign entities. Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to authorize the President to undertake an investigation to determine the effects on national or homeland security of transactions which could result in foreign control of persons engaged in interstate commerce in the United States. Requires the President to first conduct a review of the proposed transaction to determine whether an investigation is warranted. Requires, with respect to any investigation conducted, the Director of National Intelligence to create a report consolidating the intelligence findings, assessments, and concerns of each of the relevant members of the intelligence community. Requires the President to conduct a mandatory investigation in any instance in which an entity controlled by or acting on behalf of a foreign government seeks to engage in any transaction which would result in control of a person engaged in interstate commerce in the United States. Establishes the Committee for Secure Commerce to act as the President's designee in the conduct of such investigations. Authorizes the President to suspend or prohibit a transaction if he finds that: (1) there is credible evidence to believe that the foreign interest exercising control might take action that threatens the national or homeland security. And (2) provisions of law other than the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act do not provide adequate and appropriate authority to protect the national or homeland security. States that the President's actions and findings shall not be subject to judicial review. Requires reports from the President to Congress: (1) each time an investigation is completed, and (2) quarterly on each transaction being reviewed."
