    "content": "Foreign temporary workers, also known as guest workers, have long performed legal agricultural labor in the United States through different temporary worker programs. Today, agricultural guest workers may perform farm work of a temporary or seasonal nature through the H-2A visa program. Bringing in H-2A workers is a multi-agency process involving the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the U.S. Department of State (DOS). As a first step, interested employers must apply to DOL for a certification that (1) there are not sufficient U.S. workers who are qualified and available to perform the work; and (2) the employment of foreign workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. Among the H-2A labor certification requirements, employers must pay the highest of several wage rates and must provide workers with housing, transportation, and other benefits. The H-2A program is not subject to a numerical limit. Over the years, both growers and labor advocates have criticized the program. Growers complain that it is administratively cumbersome, expensive, and ineffective in meeting their labor needs. Labor advocates argue that the H-2A program provides too few protections for workers. The House Judiciary Committee and the Senate have acted on separate bills that would establish new temporary agricultural worker visas to replace the H-2A visa. The House Judiciary Committee ordered reported the Agricultural Guest Worker Act (H.R. 1773) and the Senate passed the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744). While the new visa programs proposed in these bills are different, they share some similarities that distinguish them from the H-2A program. For example, unlike the H-2A visa, the new visas would not be limited to temporary or seasonal work, would not require prospective employers to apply to DOL for labor certification or to meet all existing certification requirements, and would provide for at-will employment by agricultural workers. H.R. 1773 would establish an H-2C agricultural worker visa. After undertaking to recruit U.S. workers, a prospective H-2C employer would file a petition with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) containing attestations concerning U.S. worker recruitment, worker benefits and wages, and other issues. With respect to wages, an employer petitioning for H-2C workers would have to pay the greater of the prevailing wage rate or the applicable minimum wage. The H-2C program would have a numerical cap of 500,000, subject to adjustment by USDA. S. 744, a comprehensive immigration reform bill that addresses a wide range of immigration issues, would create a W-3 visa for contract agricultural workers and a W-4 visa for at-will agricultural workers. A prospective W-3 or W-4 employer would have to engage in U.S. worker recruitment. To import a W-3 or W-4 worker, an employer would submit a petition to DHS containing specified attestations, including attestations about contracts, U.S. worker recruitment, and compliance with other employer requirements. Required wages would be defined based on six standard agricultural occupational classifications, with certain wages specified and others to be determined by USDA, in consultation with DOL. W-3 and W-4 visas would be capped initially at 112,333 total visas per year, with provisions for USDA, in consultation with DOL, to adjust these caps and to set visa limits for later years. In addition to establishing new agricultural worker visas, both the House and the Senate proposals would enable certain unauthorized aliens to obtain legal temporary or permanent immigration status in the United States."
