    "content": "Social Security's special minimum benefit provision, also known as the Special Minimum Primary Insurance Amount (PIA), is an alternative benefit formula that increases benefits paid to workers who had low earnings for many years, and to their dependents and survivors. The Special Minimum PIA is based on the number of years a person has worked, whereas the standard benefit formula is based on a worker's average lifetime earnings. The worker receives the higher of the two benefits. However, the Special Minimum PIA has virtually no effect on the benefits paid to today's new retirees. Under current law, it grows with price levels, whereas the standard benefit is linked to wages. Because wages generally grow faster than prices, the Special Minimum PIA affects fewer beneficiaries every year. In 2017, about 39,347 of the 62 million Social Security recipients qualified for the minimum benefit. Beneficiaries who received higher benefits due to the provision had an average increase to monthly benefits of about $46 in June 2013. The Social Security Administration (SSA) estimates that the provision will have no effect on workers turning 62 in 2019 or later. Some recent proposals would redesign the minimum benefit. This renewed interest has been sparked by Social Security proposals that would reduce the regular benefit and by concern over poverty rates among beneficiaries who had low wages throughout their careers. However, some have suggested to allow the minimum benefit to phase out, arguing that the provision does not accurately target the working poor, and that there are other programs that are more appropriate for supplementing the incomes of low-income, low-asset people. Increases in Social Security benefits targeted at lifetime low earners could be implemented in various ways. For example, a new minimum benefit provision could be introduced, the standard benefit could be increased for people who worked for many years at low earnings, or a fixed-dollar benefit could be introduced. Similar provisions could also be introduced through other programs, such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI)."
