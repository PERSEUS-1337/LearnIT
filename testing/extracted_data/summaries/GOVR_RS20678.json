    "content": "Hate crime legislation (S. 625/H.R. 1343), comparable to a measure whichpassed the Senateas an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (but which was dropped prior topassage), has been introduced with a substantialnumber of cosponsors in both the House and Senate. It outlaws hate crimes, establishes a system of JusticeDepartment and grant program assistance, andinstructs the Sentencing Commission to examine adult recruitment of juveniles to commit hate crimes. It has beenreported out of committee unchanged in theSenate, S.Rept. 107-147 (2002). An alternative (H.R. 74), more sweeping in its criminal provisions and moremodest in its grant provisions, has alsobeen proposed. In both alternatives, the newly established federal offenses take two forms and are based on Congress'legislative authority under the commerce clause, thelegislative sections of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendment. One species outlaws hate crimescommitted on the basis of race, color, religion,national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or disability under various commerce clause circumstances and appearsconsistent with the Supreme Court'spronouncements in Lopez and Morrison. The other forbids hate crimes committed on thebasis of race, color, religion or national origin. Although its claim toCongressional authority seems strongest when based on the Thirteenth Amendment and proscribing violencecommitted on the basis of race, its hold appearsotherwise more tenuous. This report is an abridged version of CRS Report RL30681(pdf), Hate Crimes: Summary of Selected Proposalsand Congressional Authority, stripped of the footnotes,authorities, and appendices of that report; for additional related information, see also CRS Report 98-300, Hate Crime Legislation: An Update."
