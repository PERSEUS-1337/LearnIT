Or (2) assisting or permitting by contract such persons or entities in gathering such information for such purpose. Allows locally-developed exceptions to such consent requirements. Allows SEAs and LEAs to use certain ESEA funds to enhance parental involvement in areas affecting children's in-school privacy."
