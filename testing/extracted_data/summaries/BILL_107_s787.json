Prohibits a person from entering, or aiding or abetting any attempt to enter, into the US customs territory any diamond directly from a country that is subject to a similar UN Security Council resolution, or that: (1) is not a signatory to an international agreement that establishes a certification system for exports and imports of rough diamonds, (2) that has not unilaterally implemented such a system. Or (3) that is not a cooperating country .

Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should engage in negotiations to conclude an international agreement to eliminate trade in conflict diamonds as soon as possible. Declares that the overall negotiating objective of the United States is to establish an effective global certification system covering the major exporting and importing countries of rough diamonds that will eliminate trade in conflict diamonds."
