Directs the SBA to develop procedures to ensure that assistance is provided for projects that have the greatest potential for creating new jobs in areas experiencing terminations or reductions due to reductions in defense spending or for preventing job loss by small business employees, and that have substantial potential for stimulating new economic activity in communities most impacted by reductions in defense spending. Increases the amount authorized for the Small Business Development Company loan program.
