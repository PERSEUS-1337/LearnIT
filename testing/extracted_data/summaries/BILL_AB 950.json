    "title": "AB 950",
    "content": "Existing law allows an immediate family member or a law enforcement officer to request a court to issue a gun violence restraining order to enjoin a person from owning or possessing a firearm or ammunition for a period of one year upon a showing that the person poses a significant danger of personal injury to himself, herself, or another and that a gun violence restraining order is necessary to prevent that injury. Existing law requires a person who is subject to a gun violence restraining order to surrender his or her firearms and ammunition immediately upon request of any law enforcement officer. If no request is made, existing law requires the person to surrender his or her firearms or ammunition to a local law enforcement agency or to sell his or her firearms or ammunition to a licensed firearms dealer within 24 hours. Existing law allows any person who is prohibited from owning or possessing a firearm to transfer his or her firearms to a licensed firearms dealer for the duration of the prohibition. This bill would allow a person who is subject to a gun violence restraining order to transfer his or her firearms or ammunition to a licensed firearms dealer for the duration of the prohibition. If the firearms or ammunition have been surrendered to a law enforcement agency, the bill would entitle the owner to have them transferred to a licensed firearms dealer. The bill would additionally provide for the transfer of ammunition to a licensed firearms dealer by any person who is prohibited from owning or possessing ammunition. By imposing additional duties on local law enforcement, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing law allows a city, county, or city and county to impose a charge relating to the seizure, impounding, storage, or release of a firearm, which may not exceed the actual costs incurred for expenses directly related to taking possession of a firearm, storing the firearm, and surrendering possession of the firearm to a licensed firearm dealer or to the owner. This bill would extend the authority to impose this charge for the above specified activities in regard to ammunition. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
