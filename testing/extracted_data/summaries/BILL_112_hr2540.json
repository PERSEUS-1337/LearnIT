    "content": "Voter Protection Hotline Act of 2011 - Directs the Attorney General (AG) to establish and operate a toll-free telephone service, using a telephone number accessible throughout the United States using easily identifiable numerals, through which individuals may: (1) obtain information on voting in elections for federal office, including how to register to vote, the hours of operation of polling places, and how to obtain absentee ballots. And (2) report problems encountered in registering to vote or voting, including incidences of voter intimidation or suppression. Requires the AG to: (1) appoint individuals to a Voter Hotline Task Force, giving special consideration to individuals representing civil rights organizations, for ongoing analysis and assessment of the telephone service's operation. And (2) submit a report to Congress each odd-numbered year concerning voter intimidation or suppression reports made to the hotline and assessing the availability of the service to all US households with telephone service."
