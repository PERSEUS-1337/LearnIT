    "title": "An act to amend Section 600 of the Harbors and Navigation Code, relating to vessels.\nAn act to amend Sections 667.1, 667.5, and 1170.125 of the Penal Code, relating to violent felonies.",
    "content": "Existing law, as amended by Proposition 21 as approved by the voters at the March 7, 2000, statewide primary election and by Proposition 83 of the November 7, 2006, statewide general election, classifies certain felonies as violent felonies for purposes of various provisions of the Penal Code. Existing law imposes an additional one-year term for a felony and a 3-year term for a violent felony for each prior separate prison term served for a violent felony. Existing law, as added by Proposition 184, adopted November 8, 1994, and amended by Proposition 36, adopted November 6, 2012, commonly known as the Three Strikes Law, also imposes additional years of imprisonment in state prison on a person who commits a violent felony and has been convicted of, or who has a prior conviction for, a violent felony. The Legislature may amend the above-specified initiative statutes by a statute passed in each house by a 23 vote. This bill would additionally define human trafficking as a violent felony subject to the enhanced term of imprisonment. Because this bill would increase penalties for a violation of human trafficking crimes, it would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. Existing law regulates the operation of watercraft, as defined, in the waterways of the state. Existing law defines a \u201cwatercraft\u201d for purposes of those provisions to mean any boat, ship, barge, craft, or floating thing designed for navigation in the water. This bill would make nonsubstantive changes in that definition of watercraft."
