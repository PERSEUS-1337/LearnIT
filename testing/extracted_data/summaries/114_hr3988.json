    "content": "Military and Veterans Education Protection Act This bill amends title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require proprietary institutions of higher education to derive at least 10 of their revenue from sources other than federal educational assistance, or risk becoming ineligible for title IV funding. Federal educational assistance includes title IV federal student aid and federal educational assistance for military personnel and veterans. Currently, this so-called 9010 rule requires proprietary institutions to derive at least 10 of their revenue from sources other than title IV federal student aid, but it allows federal educational assistance for military personnel and veterans to count toward the 10."
