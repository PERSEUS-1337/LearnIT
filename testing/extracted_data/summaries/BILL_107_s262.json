    "content": "Teaching Excellence in America's Classrooms and Homerooms Act (TEACH) - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to provide financial assistance to the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NB) for: (1) helping States and local school districts provide fee support to teachers seeking NB certification. And (2) outreach and educational activities directly related to teachers' awareness and pursuit of such certification, with priority for districts in which there are a significant number of low-performing schools, or with low teacher participation rates in the NB certification process, or serving special populations. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) exclude from gross income any financial benefit, including incentive payment, received solely by reason of the successful completion by an eligible teacher of the requirements for NB advanced certification. And (2) make a two-percent floor on miscellaneous itemized deductions inapplicable to qualified NB advanced certification expenses of elementary and secondary school teachers."
