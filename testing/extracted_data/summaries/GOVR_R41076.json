    "content": "Domestic food assistance programs typically make up a large portion of federal spending for needy households during economic downturns. The need for, participation in, and the costs of these programs\u2014like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp program)\u2014have grown dramatically. In response to the recent downturn, the Administration and Congress have taken major steps to change food assistance program policies to open up program access and to increase federal funding. Most important, SNAP benefits have been increased across the board and eligibility rules have been substantially loosened. The Administration's FY2011 budget proposes to continue funding for most of these steps. This report will be updated to reflect action on the FY2011 budget and significant changes in participation and spending figures."
