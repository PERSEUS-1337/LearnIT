    "title": "An act to amend Section 22513 of, and to add Section 22513.1 to, the Vehicle Code, relating to vehicles.",
    "content": "Existing law makes it a misdemeanor for the owner or operator of a tow truck to stop at the scene of an accident or near a disabled vehicle for the purpose of soliciting an engagement for towing services, either directly or indirectly, or to furnish any towing services, unless summoned to the scene, requested to stop, or flagged down by the owner or operator of a disabled vehicle, or requested to perform the service by a law enforcement officer or public agency pursuant to that agency\u2019s procedures. This bill would, subject to exceptions, apply those provisions to a towing company. The bill would also require, in addition to being summoned to the scene or requested to stop by the owner or operator of a disabled vehicle, that the towing company or the owner or operator of the tow truck possess specified information in writing prior to arriving at the scene, or obtain specified information prior to leaving the scene, and would require that information to be made available to law enforcement, upon request, from the time the tow truck appears at the scene until the time the vehicle is towed and released to a third party. The bill would provide that a writing for this purpose includes an electronic record. Existing law also makes it a misdemeanor for the owner or operator of a tow truck to move any vehicle from a highway, street, or public property without the express authorization of the owner or operator of the vehicle or a law enforcement officer or public agency pursuant to that agency\u2019s procedures, when the vehicle has been left unattended or when there is an injury as the result of an accident. This bill would recast, and subject to exceptions, apply those provisions to a towing company. The bill would delete the requirement for the express authorization of the owner or operator of the vehicle. The bill would require the towing company or the owner or operator of the tow truck to obtain specified information and to make that information available to law enforcement, upon request, from the time the vehicle is attached to or loaded on to the tow truck until the time the vehicle is towed and released to a third party. The bill would, subject to exceptions, and if the vehicle owner or operator is present, also require the towing company or the owner or operator of the tow truck to furnish the vehicle\u2019s owner or operator with a written itemized estimate of all charges and services to be performed. Prior to removing the vehicle, the towing company or the owner or operator of the tow truck would be required to obtain the vehicle owner or operator\u2019s signature on the itemized estimate, and to furnish a copy to the person who signed the estimate, as specified. The bill would require a towing company or the owner or operator of a tow truck to maintain specified documents for 3 years and to make those documents available for inspection and copying within 48 hours of a written request by specified law enforcement and prosecutorial entities. The bill would also require a business taking possession of a vehicle from a tow truck to document specified information, to maintain those documents for 3 years, and to make those documents available for inspection and copying within 48 hours of a written request by any officer or agent of a police department, sheriff\u2019s department, the Department of the California Highway Patrol, the Attorney General\u2019s office, the Bureau of Automotive Repair, a district attorney\u2019s office, or a city attorney\u2019s office. The bill would provide, except for those provisions described in paragraph (1) above, that a willful violation of these requirements is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not exceeding $2,500, or imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding 3 months, or both imprisonment and that fine. By creating new crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
