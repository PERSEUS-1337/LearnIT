Requires the Secretary: (1) when awarding grants and contracts under programs designed to increase the number of allied health professionals, to give preference to assisting entities in expanding or establishing programs to increase the number of individuals trained as medical laboratory personne. And (2) to issue public service announcements that promote medical laboratory personnel careers. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Service Administration (HRSA) and in collaboration with the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to make grants for training to increase the number of cytotechnologists available for cervical cancer screening. Provides for giving emphasis in the training of allied heath professionals, for which Federal payments may be provided under a cooperative agreement or grant from the Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, to the training of medical laboratory personnel in disciplines in which more personnel are needed."
