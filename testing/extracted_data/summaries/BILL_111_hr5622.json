Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the penalties on corporations for: (1) underpayment of tax involving an undisclosed foreign financial asset located in a tax haven country. (2) reportable transaction understatements involving transactions in a tax haven country. And (3) fraud, tax evasion, or false statements involving transactions in a tax haven country. Grants a preference in the award of federal contracts to contractors who have not engaged in outsourcing.
