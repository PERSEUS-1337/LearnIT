Existing law requires the driver to be seated in the driver\u2019s seat, monitoring the safe operation of the autonomous vehicle, and capable of taking over immediate manual control of the autonomous vehicle in the event of an autonomous technology failure or other emergency. Existing law requires, as part of an application by the manufacturer to the Department of Motor Vehicles, a certification that the autonomous vehicle allows the operator, as defined, to take control in multiple manners, including, without limitation, through the use of the brake, the accelerator pedal, or the steering wheel, as specified, and a certification that the autonomous vehicle\u2019s autonomous technology meets Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Existing law provides that federal regulations promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shall supersede these provisions when found to be in conflict with any other state law or regulation. This bill would, notwithstanding those provisions, until January 1, 2018, require the Department of Motor Vehicles and the Department of the California Highway Patrol to conduct a pilot project in conjunction with one or more manufacturers of autonomous vehicles to test the safety and feasibility of operating autonomous vehicles on public roads. The bill would require the Department of Motor Vehicles to select 3 counties in which to conduct the pilot project and to contract with local law enforcement agencies to participate in the pilot project in each county. The bill would require the Department of Motor Vehicles to report the results of the pilot project to the Legislature on or before July 1, 2018. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2019. This bill would authorize, notwithstanding the above requirements, the operation of an autonomous vehicle without a driver in the vehicle or an autonomous vehicle not equipped with a brake pedal, accelerator pedal, or steering wheel on public roads for testing and operation purposes if all other requirements of the above provisions are met and the operator of the autonomous vehicle is capable of taking immediate control of the vehicle in the event of an autonomous technology failure or other emergency. The bill would require the department to adopt conforming regulations no later than July 1, 2018. The bill would require the department to submit a report on the results of the testing and operation of these autonomous vehicles to the Legislature, as specified."
