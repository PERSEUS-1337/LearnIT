    "content": "Training generative adversarial networks is unstable in high-dimensions as the true data distribution tends to be concentrated in a small fraction of the ambient space. The discriminator is then quickly able to classify nearly all generated samples as fake, leaving the generator without meaningful gradients and causing it to deteriorate after a point in training. In this work, we propose training a single generator simultaneously against an array of discriminators, each of which looks at a different random low-dimensional projection of the data. Individual discriminators, now provided with restricted views of the input, are unable to reject generated samples perfectly and continue to provide meaningful gradients to the generator throughout training.   Meanwhile, the generator learns to produce samples consistent with the full data distribution to satisfy all discriminators simultaneously. We  demonstrate the practical utility of this approach experimentally, and show that it is able to produce image samples with higher quality than traditional training with a single discriminator. Generative adversarial networks (GANs), introduced by BID12 , endow neural networks with the ability to express distributional outputs. The framework includes a generator network that is tasked with producing samples from some target distribution, given as input a (typically low dimensional) noise vector drawn from a simple known distribution, and possibly conditional side information. The generator learns to generate such samples, not by directly looking at the data, but through adversarial training with a discriminator network that seeks to differentiate real data from those generated by the generator. To satisfy the objective of \"fooling\" the discriminator, the generator eventually learns to produce samples with statistics that match those of real data.In regression tasks where the true output is ambiguous, GANs provide a means to simply produce an output that is plausible (with a single sample), or to explicitly model that ambiguity (through multiple samples). In the latter case, they provide an attractive alternative to fitting distributions to parametric forms during training, and employing expensive sampling techniques at the test time. In particular, conditional variants of GANs have shown to be useful for tasks such as in-painting BID7 , and super-resolution BID16 . Recently, BID13 demonstrated that GANs can be used to produce plausible mappings between a variety of domains-including sketches and photographs, maps and aerial views, segmentation masks and images, etc. GANs have also found uses as a means of un-supervised learning, with latent noise vectors and hidden-layer activations of the discriminators proving to be useful features for various tasks BID7 .Despite their success, training GANs to generate high-dimensional data (such as large images) is challenging. Adversarial training between the generator and discriminator involves optimizing a min-max objective. This is typically carried out by gradient-based updates to both networks, and the generator is prone to divergence and mode-collapse as the discriminator begins to successfully distinguish real data from generated samples with high confidence. Researchers have tried to address this instability and train better generators Figure 1 : Overview of our approach. We train a single generator against an array of discriminators, each of which receives lower-dimensional projections-chosen randomly prior to training-as input. Individually, these discriminators are unable to perfectly separate real and generated samples, and thus provide stable gradients to the generator throughout training. In turn, by trying to fool all the discriminators simultaneously, the generator learns to match the true full data distribution. through several techniques . BID8 proposed generating an image by explicitly factorizing the task into a sequence of conditional generations of levels of a Laplacian pyramid, while demonstrated that specific architecture choices and parameter settings led to higher-quality samples. Other techniques include providing additional supervision BID20 , adding noise to the discriminator input BID0 , as well as modifying or adding regularization to the training objective functions BID18 BID1 BID23 .We propose a different approach to address this instability, where the generator is trained against an array of discriminators, each of which looks at a different, randomly-chosen, low-dimensional projection of the data. Each discriminator is unable to perfectly separate real and generated samples since it only gets a partial view of these samples. At the same time, to satisfy its objective of fooling all discriminators, the generator learns to match the true full data distribution. We describe a realization of this approach for training image generators, and discuss the intuition behind why we expect this training to be stable-i.e., the gradients to the generator to be meaningful throughout training-and consistent-i.e., for the generator to learn to match the full real data distribution. Despite its simplicity, we find this approach to be surprisingly effective in practice. We demonstrate this efficacy by using it to train generators on standard image datasets, and find that these produce higher-quality samples than generators trained against a single discriminator. In this paper, we proposed a new framework to training GANs for high-dimensional outputs. Our approach employs multiple discriminators on random low-dimensional projections of the data to stabilize training, with enough projections to ensure that the generator learns the true data distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that this approaches leads to more stable training, with generators continuing to improve for longer to ultimately produce higher-quality samples. Source code and trained models for our implementation is available at the project page [anonymized for review].In our current framework, the number of discriminators is limited by computational cost. In future work, we plan to investigate training with a much larger set of discriminators, employing only a small subset of them at each iteration, or every set of iterations. We are also interested in using multiple discriminators with modified and regularized objectives (e.g., BID18 BID1 BID23 ). Such modifications are complementary to our approach, and deploying them together will likely be beneficial."
