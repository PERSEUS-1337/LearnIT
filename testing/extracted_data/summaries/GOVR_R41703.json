    "content": "FY2011 funding levels were not enacted in the 111th Congress. Thus, the debate over FY2011 appropriations continued into the 112th Congress and FY2011 spending proposals became a key focal point in the budget debates between the now-Republican-controlled House of Representatives and the Obama Administration. This report was originally intended to facilitate comparison of three key spending proposals for FY2011\u2014the Administration's budget request, H.R. 1, and S.Amdt. 149 to H.R. 1\u2014to FY2010 enacted funding levels. It has been updated to include the enacted FY2011 appropriations in P.L. 112-10. The report begins with a brief analysis of how each proposal could be expected to impact the federal budget deficit. The bulk of the report consists of a funding table that details the recommended discretionary appropriations in these proposals, by subcommittee and bill title, and compares the enacted FY2010 and enacted FY2011 appropriations. More detailed analysis of individual appropriations measures can be found at CRS.gov. This is the final update of this report."
