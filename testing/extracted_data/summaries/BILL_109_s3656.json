    "content": "HIV Prevention for Youth Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that sexually active young people who live in a country where HIV infection is spreading through the general population, rather than being confined to specific populations should be: (1) considered at high risk of contracting HIV infection. And (2) provided with the knowledge, skill-building programs, and tools to protect themselves from HIV infection. Amends the United States Leadership Against HIVAIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 to define abstinence-until-marriage programs as programs that place the highest priority on encouraging unmarried individuals to abstain from sexual activity, which if practiced 100 correctly and consistently is the only certain way to protect against exposure to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Reserves at least 33 of the Act's appropriations for FY2006-FY2008 for prevention of the sexual transmission of HIV . Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to include within the activities for which HIVAIDS assistance is available preventive intervention education for sexually active young people who live in a country experiencing a generalized HIV epidemic. Defines generalized epidemic as a country where: (1) HIV infection is spreading through the general population, rather than being confined to specific populations, such as sex workers and their clients, injecting drug users, and men who have sex with men. And (2) the HIV infection rate among people between the ages of 15 and 49 exceeds 1."
