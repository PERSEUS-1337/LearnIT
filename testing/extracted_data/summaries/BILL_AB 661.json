    "title": "AB 661",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes the board of supervisors to adopt, by resolution, a fee of up to $10 for each recording of a real estate instrument, paper, or notice required or permitted by law to be recorded, except as specified. Existing law defines the term \u201creal estate instrument\u201d to exclude a deed, instrument, or writing recorded in connection with a transfer subject to a documentary transfer tax. This bill would recast this latter exclusion from a \u201creal estate instrument\u201d as a statement that the above-described fee does not apply to any real estate instrument, paper, or notice accompanied by a declaration stating that the transfer is subject to a documentary transfer tax, is recorded concurrently with a transfer subject to a documentary transfer tax, or is presented for recording within the same business day as, and is related to the recording of, a transfer subject to a documentary transfer tax."
