    "content": "\"Lame duck\" sessions of Congress take place whenever one Congress meets after its successor is elected but before the term of the current Congress ends. Their primary purpose is to complete action on legislation. They have also been used to prevent recess appointments and pocket vetoes, to consider motions of censure or impeachment, to keep Congress assembled on a standby basis, or to approve nominations (Senate only). In recent years, most lame duck sessions have focused on program authorizations, trade-related measures, appropriations, and the budget. From 1940 to 2016, there were 21 lame duck sessions. Seven followed an election that switched the majority party in one or both chambers. That is, the party that controlled the House or Senate during the lame duck session did not retain its majority into the next Congress. These sessions occurred in 1948, 1954, 1980, 1994, 2006, 2010, and 2014. Three lame duck sessions between 1940 and 2016 followed a majority-changing midterm election during a President's first term of office. In each of these sessions (1954, 1994, 2010), the same party had controlled the White House, House, and Senate prior to the election. This report provides additional information on the 1954, 1994, and 2010 lame duck sessions. The most recent lame duck session, which commenced on November 13, 2018, is not included in the data presented."
