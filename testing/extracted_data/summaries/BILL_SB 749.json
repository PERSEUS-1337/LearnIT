    "title": "SB 749",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of home health agencies by the State Department of Public Health. Existing law requires all private or public organizations that provide or arrange for skilled nursing services to patients in the home to obtain a home health agency license. Existing law, the California Hospice Licensure Act of 1990 , provides for the licensure and regulation by the State Department of Public Health of persons or agencies that provide hospice services to persons, and the families of persons, who are experiencing the last phases of life due to a terminal disease. The act prohibits a person, political subdivision of the state, or other governmental agency from establishing or operating a hospice without first obtaining a license. Existing federal law also provides for the certification of hospice care for purposes of Medicare reimbursement. Existing law exempts a hospice program certified in accordance with federal Medicare hospice conditions of participation from the requirement to obtain a license pursuant to the act, but provides that the program is subject to home health agency licensure unless it elects to apply for hospice licensure. This bill instead would exempt a licensed home health agency from the requirement to obtain a license to provide hospice services if the hospice program is certified in accordance with federal Medicare hospice conditions of participation or is in the process of obtaining that certification. The bill would also make conforming changes. Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to establish a trustline registry for trustline providers who meet prescribed requirements. Existing law defines a trustline provider as a person 18 years of age or older who provides child care, supervision, or in-home educational or counseling services, and who is not required to be licensed as a child day care facility. Existing law prohibits an employment agency from making a referral of a child care provider unless the child care provider is a trustline applicant or registered child care provider. This bill would make a technical, nonsubstantive change to a provision related to the trustline registry."
