    "title": "R43850",
    "content": "The federal Medicaid statute and accompanying regulations include provisions that states can apply to certain program beneficiaries with respect to out-of-pocket cost-sharing, including premiums that may be required on a monthly or quarterly basis, enrollment fees that may be applied on an annual or semiannual basis, and point-of-service cost-sharing (e.g., a co-payment to a Medicaid participating provider for a specific covered service received). To implement these options, states must submit Medicaid state plan amendments (SPAs) detailing these provisions to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for approval. This report provides an overview of these federal authorities and includes some state-specific examples."
