And (2) aliens for whom certain documentation requirements have been waived by the Attorney General or the Secretary of State. Requires airport implementation of such system by a specified date. Requires the Attorney General to report on the feasibility of implementing an automated entry-exit control system that would include land border and seaport arrivals and departures. Provides for increased numbers of full-time Immigration and Naturalization and Customs inspectors at US land borders, with such inspectors to be equally assigned to the northern and southern borders."
