    "content": "Small Business Lending and Credit Availability Act of 1993 - Amends the Small Business Act to direct the Small Business Administration (SBA) to participate in loans to small businesses located in States in which one or more insured depository institutions have been closed due to inability to meet depositor demands. Directs the SBA to guarantee 90 percent of any such loan for amounts between $200,000 and $500,000, and 95 percent of any such loan for amounts less than $200,000. Prohibits the SBA from collecting a guarantee fee from the lending institution or the borrower for such loan participation during the first two years of such participation, with a one percent fee permitted for the third through fifth years. Authorizes lenders to retain one-half of any fee so collected in order to encourage lenders to provide loans to small businesses located in areas of failed depository institutions. Limits the loan participation program to five years."
