    "content": "Approaches to continual learning aim to successfully learn a set of related tasks that arrive in an online manner. Recently, several frameworks have been developed which enable deep learning to be deployed in this learning scenario. A key modelling decision is to what extent the architecture should be shared across tasks. On the one hand, separately modelling each task avoids catastrophic forgetting but it does not support transfer learning and leads to large models. On the other hand, rigidly specifying a shared component and a task-specific part enables task transfer and limits the model size, but it is vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting and restricts the form of task-transfer that can occur. Ideally, the network should adaptively identify which parts of the network to share in a data driven way. Here we introduce such an approach called Continual Learning with Adaptive Weights (CLAW), which is based on probabilistic modelling and variational inference. Experiments show that CLAW achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks in terms of overall continual learning performance, as measured by classification accuracy, and in terms of addressing catastrophic forgetting. Continual learning (CL), sometimes called lifelong or incremental learning, refers to an online framework where the knowledge acquired from learning tasks in the past is kept and accumulated so that it can be reused in the present and future. Data belonging to different tasks could potentially be non i.i.d. (Schlimmer & Fisher, 1986; Sutton & Whitehead, 1993; Ring, 1997; Schmidhuber, 2013; Nguyen et al., 2018; Schmidhuber, 2018) . A continual learner must be able to learn a new task, crucially, without forgetting previous tasks (Ring, 1995; Srivastava et al., 2013; Serra et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2019) . In addition, CL frameworks should continually adapt to any domain shift occurring across tasks. The learning updates must be incremental -i.e, the model is updated at each task only using the new data and the old model, without access to all previous data (from earlier tasks) -due to speed, security and privacy constraints. A compromise must be found between adapting to new tasks and enforcing stability to preserve knowledge from previous tasks. Excessive adaptation could lead to inadvertent forgetting of how to perform earlier tasks. Indeed, catastrophic forgetting is one of the main pathologies in continual learning (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989; Ratcliff, 1990; Robins, 1993; French, 1999; Pape et al., 2011; Goodfellow et al., 2014a; Achille et al., 2018; Diaz-Rodriguez et al., 2018; Zeno et al., 2018; Ahn et al., 2019; Parisi et al., 2019; Pfulb & Gepperth, 2019; Rajasegaran et al., 2019) . Many approaches to continual learning employ an architecture which is divided a priori into (i) a slowly evolving, global part; and (ii) a quickly evolving, task-specific, local part. This is one way to enable multi-task transfer whilst mitigating catastrophic forgetting, which has proven to be effective (Rusu et al., 2016b; Fernando et al., 2017; Yoon et al., 2018) , albeit with limitations. Specifying a priori the shared global, and task-specific local parts in the architecture restricts flexibility. As more complex and heterogeneous tasks are considered, one would like a more flexible, data-driven approach to determine the appropriate amount of sharing across tasks. Here, we aim at automating the architecture adaptation process so that each neuron of the network can either be kept intact, i.e. acting as global, or adapted to the new task locally. Our proposed variational inference framework is flexible enough to learn the range within which the adaptation parameters can vary. We introduce for each neuron one binary parameter controlling whether or not to adapt, and two parameters to control the magnitude of adaptation. All parameters are learnt via variational inference. We introduce our framework as an expansion of the variational continual learning algorithm (Nguyen et al., 2018) , whose variational and sequential Bayesian nature makes it convenient for our modelling and architecture adaptation procedure. Our modelling ideas can also be applied to other continual learning frameworks, see the Appendix for a brief discussion. We highlight the following contributions: (1) A modelling framework which flexibly automates the adaptation of local and global parts of the (multi-task) continual architecture. This optimizes the tradeoff between mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving task transfer. (2) A probabilistic variational inference algorithm which supports incremental updates with adaptively learned parameters. ( 3) The ability to combine our modelling and inference approaches without any significant augmentation of the architecture (no new neurons are needed). (4) State-of-the-art results in six experiments on five datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in terms of overall accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting. We introduced a continual learning framework which learns how to adapt its architecture from the tasks and data at hand, based on variational inference. Rather than rigidly dividing the architecture into shared and task-specific parts, our approach adapts the contributions of each neuron. We achieve The impact of learning previous tasks on a specific task (the last task) is inspected and used as a proxy for evaluating forward transfer. This is performed by evaluating the relative performance achieved on a unique task after learning a varying number of previous tasks. This means that the value at x-axis = 1 refers to the learning accuracy of the last task after having learnt solely one task (only itself), the value at 2 refers to the learning accuracy of the last task after having learnt two tasks (an additional previous task), etc. Overall, CLAW achieves state-of-the-art results in 4 out of the 5 experiments (at par in the fifth) in terms of avoiding negative transfer. Best viewed in colour. that without having to expand the architecture with new layers or new neurons. Results of six different experiments on five datasets demonstrate the strong empirical performance of the introduced framework, in terms of the average overall continual learning accuracy and forward transfer, and also in terms of effectively alleviating catastrophic forgetting."
