    "content": "One of the most crucial and difficult tasks in peacekeeping and related stability operations is creating a secure and stable environment, both for the foreign peacekeepers and for the indigenouspopulation. During the past decade, the United States and the international community have triedvarious approaches to providing that security. Most of these approaches have included the use ofUnited Nations International Civilian Police (UNCIVPOL), whose forces are contributed on a caseby case basis by U.N. Member states. (While other countries usually contribute police personnelfrom their own national forces, the United States contracts those it contributes through a privatecorporation.) In a few cases, such as Afghanistan and Iraq at this time, coalition and U.S. militaryforces, and not the United Nations, train and work with indigenous police forces to provide security. Despite continuing improvements over the past decade, the current system has several drawbacks. UNCIVPOL has been unable to provide an adequate number of well-trained policemenfor individual operations and to deploy them rapidly. Their police forces experience a lack ofconsistency in the type and levels of training and a shortage of needed skills. Military forces, on theother hand, are usually not trained to deal effectively with police situations. These deficiencies leadto three gaps that impede the establishment of law and order, particularly those cases where not allparties to the conflict are dedicated to peace or where criminal networks have taken root. The firstis the deployment gap, when international police are not available as quickly as needed. The secondis the enforcement gap, where those deployed lack necessary skills, in particular combined militaryand policing \"constabulary\" skills, as well as investigative and intelligence-gathering skills to dealwith organized crime. The third is the institution gap, where competent judicial and penal personnelare needed to provide follow-up services to police work. Policymakers have long recognized these problems. In February 2000, the Clinton Administration sought to remedy them through Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 71's broadpolicy reforms and guidelines. Although it did not allocate or request the necessary resources foreffective implementation, the Bush Administration is implementing some provisions. In August2000, the U.N. Brahimi Panel report proposed several remedies to improve the U.N. civilian policesystem, as did another report by contributing nations. Some are being implemented. Three pending bills would address policing and related capabilities for peacekeeping and stability operations. H.R. 1414 would establish a rapidly deployable U.N. civilianpolice corps. H.R. 2616 calls for NATO to establish a security component to be usedin post-conflict reconstruction environments and a U.S. police reserve for use in internationaloperations. S. 2127 provides for the United States to develop a corps of rapidlydeployable personnel, of which rule of law personnel may be a part. Related options recommendedby experts include improving training, increasing international constabulary capabilities, anddeveloping a \"stability force\" to supplement police with judicial and prison personnel. This reportmay be updated if warranted."
