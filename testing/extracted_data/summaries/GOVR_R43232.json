    "content": "Fighting HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria globally is a priority for Congress. The 108th and 110th Congresses enacted two pieces of legislation that have shaped U.S. responses to these diseases: P.L. 108-25, the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (Leadership Act), and P.L. 110-293, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 (Lantos-Hyde Act). The Leadership Act authorized $15 billion to be spent from FY2004 through FY2008 on fighting HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. The Lantos-Hyde Act amended the Leadership Act to authorize $48 billion for fighting the three diseases from FY2009 through FY2013. The Leadership Act (and the legislation that it amends) is the primary vehicle through which U.S. global assistance for fighting these diseases is authorized. The Lantos-Hyde Act mostly amends the Leadership Act, though it amends some other acts, such as the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and includes some stand-alone authorities. The Leadership Act and the Lantos-Hyde Act (primarily through amendments to the Leadership Act) created frameworks for how the funds should be spent, established program goals and targets, and established coordinating offices for managing government-wide responses. The Leadership Act required the President to establish the Coordinator of the United States Government Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally (known as the Global AIDS Coordinator) at the Department of State. Congress appropriates the bulk of global HIV/AIDS funds to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, which leads the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The Global AIDS Coordinator distributes the majority of these funds to U.S. federal agencies and departments and multilateral groups like the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Lantos-Hyde Act amended the Leadership Act to establish the Coordinator of the United States Government Activities to Combat Malaria Globally (known as the Malaria Coordinator) at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to oversee implementation of related efforts by USAID and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some authorities within these Acts are enduring, such as those that created the Global AIDS and Malaria Coordinator positions (Leadership Act, as amended) and permitted U.S. participation in advance market commitments for vaccine development (Lantos-Hyde Act). Other authorities, however, are set to expire, such as language authorizing funding for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs. This report explains which authorities within the Leadership and Lantos-Hyde Acts are set to expire and which are permanent. Table A-1 in the Appendix A offers a side-by-side comparison of the Leadership Act in its original form and the Lantos-Hyde Act, which amends the Leadership Act and other legislation. A third column explains which sections are set to expire and summarizes language in S. 1545 and H.R. 3177 that amend the Leadership Act, as amended. The Leadership Act, as amended and Lantos-Hyde Act include comprehensive reporting requirements. Table A-2 in the Appendix A lists the reporting requirements and describes the extent to which the Administration has complied with the requirements. Rather than revisit some of the contentious issues that dominated debate when crafting the Lantos-Hyde Act, House and Senate Members introduced legislation (H.R. 3177 and S. 1545) that is narrowly aimed at key priorities: enhancing oversight of U.S. global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs; authorizing appropriations for the Global Fund through FY2018; and allocating a portion of HIV/AIDS funds for orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) and for HIV/AIDS treatment and care. Table B-1 in Appendix B summarizes key amendments in the bills, entitled the PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Act."
