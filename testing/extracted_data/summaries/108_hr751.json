    "content": "Responsible Off-Road Vehicle Enforcement and Response Act - Amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to impose a fine of up to the greater of $10,000 or an amount equal to the cost to the United States of any improvement, protection, or rehabilitation work on public lands rendered necessary for damages to such lands resulting from violation of any regulation or other requirement regarding use of a vehicle over such lands. Makes such a violation not resulting in death a Class B misdemeanor. Directs that any moneys received by the United States from such a fine be used to: (1) cover administrative, legal, and related expenses. (2) cover the costs of any improvement, protection, or rehabilitation work on public lands. And (3) increase public awareness of regulations and other requirements regarding recreational use of vehicles on public lands. Amends Federal law to set forth similar provisions regarding vehicle violations in National Forest lands."
