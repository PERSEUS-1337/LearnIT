    "content": "Veterans Education Enhancement Act of 2016 This bill revises the fee that is deducted from a veteran's education entitlement under the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Post-911 educational assistance program from a monthly to a prorated fee for: (1) certain license and certification tests, and (2) national tests. The Veterans' Advisory Committee on Education is extended through December 31, 2021. The VA shall, in consultation with state approving agencies, prescribe training requirements for a school certifying official (SCO) employed by a covered educational institution offering approved veterans education courses. The VA may disapprove any course of education offered by a covered educational institution that does not ensure that an SCO meets such requirements. The bill extends the applicability of provisions requiring rounding down, and delays the applicability of provisions requiring rounding up, of veterans educational assistance increases for: (1) the All-Volunteer Force, and (2) survivors and dependents. The VA shall reduce the monthly housing stipend on a pro rata basis for a student who reduces his or her course load, effective for a month that begins on or after August 1, 2017. A reporting fee paid by the VA to an educational institution or joint apprenticeship training committee with respect to an institution that has 75 or more enrollees may not be used for or merged with amounts available for the general fund of the educational institution or joint apprenticeship training committee."
