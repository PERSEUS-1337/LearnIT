    "content": "A variety of benefits may be available to unemployed workers to provide them with income support during a spell of unemployment. When eligible workers lose their jobs, the Unemployment Compensation (UC) program may provide income support through the payment of UC benefits. Many workers who have exhausted their rights to regular UC benefits may have their unemployment insurance benefits extended for up to 13 additional weeks through the temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08) program. In addition, the Extended Benefit (EB) program may extend UC benefits at the state level if certain economic situations within the state exist. This report briefly summarizes the UC program, its authorization, appropriations, benefit determination, and funding. For a comprehensive summary of all income support programs available to unemployed workers, consult CRS Report RL33362, Unemployment Insurance: Available Unemployment Benefits and Legislative Activity, by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]."
