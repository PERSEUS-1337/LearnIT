    "content": "Sports Agent Responsibility and Trust Act - Prohibits an agent from: (1) directly or indirectly recruiting or soliciting a student athlete to enter into an agency contract by giving false or misleading information or making a false promise or representation or by providing anything of value to the athlete before entering into such a contract. (2) entering into an agency contract with a student athlete without providing the required disclosure document. Or (3) predating or postdating an agency contract. Requires an agent, in conjunction with the signing of an agency contract, to provide to the athlete a separate disclosure document that includes notice that if the athlete signs the contract he or she may lose eligibility to compete as a student athlete in that sport. Requires the student athlete to sign such document before signing the agency contract. Treats a violation of this Act as an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Authorizes civil actions by State attorneys general under specified circumstances. Requires the agent and the athlete, within 72 hours after entering into an agency contract or before the next athletic event in which the athlete may participate, whichever occurs first, to provide notice to the educational institution that the athlete has entered into an agency contract. Grants an educational institution a right of action against an agent for damages caused by such agent's failure to provide such notice. Expresses the sense of Congress that States should enact the Uniform Athlete Agents Act of 2000 drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws to protect student athletes and the integrity of amateur sports from unscrupulous sports agents."
