    "content": "Assisting Family Farmers through Insurance Reform Measures Act or the AFFIRM Act This bill amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to require the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to reduce federal crop insurance payments and disclose details regarding subsidies. The bill prohibits premium subsidies: (1) for additional coverage for any person or legal entity that has an average adjusted gross income that exceeds $250,000, (2) that exceed $40,000 per year for any person or legal entity, or (3) for policies that are based on the actual market price of an agricultural commodity at the time of harvest. The bill establishes an annual cap on total reimbursements for administrative and operating costs of crop insurance providers that begins at $900 million for 2015 and is adjusted for inflation in each subsequent year. The overall rate of return for insurance providers is capped at 8.9. The bill eliminates a requirement that any renegotiated Standard Insurance Agreement (SRA) be budget-neutral. USDA must annually disclose to the public specified details regarding the recipients and amounts of federal crop insurance subsidies."
