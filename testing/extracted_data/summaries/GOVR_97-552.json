    "content": "The \"discharge rule\" of the House of Representatives allows a measure to come to the floor for consideration even if the committee of referral does not report it and the leadership does not schedule it. To initiate this action, a majority of House Members must first sign a petition for that purpose. After a petition has garnered 218 signatures, a motion to discharge may then be offered on the floor\u2014but only after at least seven legislative days and only on a second or fourth Monday of a month. The rule allows for two main methods of action: (1) The committee of referral may be discharged from a measure that has been before it for 30 legislative days or more; or (2) the Committee on Rules may be discharged from a special rule for considering such a measure if the rule has been before the committee for at least seven legislative days. If a measure dealing with raising or spending money reaches the floor through the first method of action, it is considered in the Committee of the Whole, as if under an open rule. Other measures reaching the floor through this method of action are considered in the House under the one-hour rule, with the previous question in order. Under the second method of action, if the House takes up a measure under a special rule from which the Committee on Rules has been discharged, it is considered under the terms provided by the special rule. Under either method of action, the layover periods required by the discharge rule permit the Committee on Rules to preempt the discharge attempt, and recover control of the floor agenda, by securing House adoption of an alternative special rule for considering the measure."
