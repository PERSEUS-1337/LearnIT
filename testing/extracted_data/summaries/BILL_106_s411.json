    "content": "Clone Pager Authorization Act of 1999 - Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize the use of a clone pager in appropriate Federal investigative or law enforcement circumstances. Directs a provider of clone pagers, upon request of a Government attorney or law enforcement officer authorized to use such a device, to furnish to such attorney or officer all information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the use of such pager unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference with the paging services provided. Amends provisions regarding the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices to cover the use of clone pagers. Authorizes any US attorney or authorized State investigative or law enforcement officer to apply for the use of a clone pager. Directs the court to enter into an ex parte order authorizing the installation and use of a clone pager if the court finds probable cause to believe that information relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation will be obtained. Limits such order to 30 days, with extensions for good cause shown. Requires the applicant to report to the issuing court the number of pager messages acquired through the use of the clone pager during such period. Requires: (1) the nondisclosure of the existence of an order authorizing clone pager use during the period covered by the order. And (2) after such period, notification to the party whose messages were acquired that an order authorizing such use was issued by such court."
