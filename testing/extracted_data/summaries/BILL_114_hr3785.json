    "content": "Correcting Hurtful and Alienating Names in Government Expression (CHANGE) Act This bill prohibits an executive agency from using the following terms in any rule, regulation, interpretation, publication, other document, display, or sign issued by the agency except to the extent that the term is used in quoting or reproducing text written by a source other than an officer or employee of the agency: alien when used to refer to an individual who is not a US citizen or national, and illegal alien when used to refer to an individual who is unlawfully present in the United States or who lacks a lawful US immigration status. In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of various US administrative bureaus and agencies, the term foreign national in federal law means any individual other than an individual who: (1) is a US citizen. Or (2) though not a US citizen, owes permanent allegiance to the United States. Any reference in any federal statute, rule, regulation, executive order, publication, or other US document to the term: alien when used to refer to an individual who is not a US citizen or national is deemed to refer to the term foreign national, and illegal alien when used to refer to an individual who is unlawfully present in the United States or who lacks a lawful US immigration status is deemed to refer to the term undocumented foreign national. Conforming amendments are made to specified Acts."
