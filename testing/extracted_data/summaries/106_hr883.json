(2) the Secretary has reported to Congress on the lands' natural resources and the impact that the inclusion would have on existing and future uses of such lands. And (3) such nomination is specifically authorized by a law. Authorizes the President to submit proposals for legislation authorizing such a nomination after publication of the Secretary's finding. Requires the Secretary to object to the inclusion of any property in the United States on the list of World Heritage in Danger unless the Secretary: (1) has reported to Congress on the necessity for such inclusion, the natural resources associated with the property, and the impact such inclusion would have on existing and future uses of such property. And (2) is specifically authorized to assent to the inclusion by a joint resolution of Congress enacted after the report is submitted.

Prohibits any Federal official from nominating any lands in the United States for designation as a Biosphere Reserve under the Man and Biosphere Program of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. Provides that any such designation before enactment of this Act shall not have any force or effect, unless the Biosphere Reserve: (1) is specifically authorized by a law enacted after enactment of this Act and before December 31, 2003, (2) consists solely of federally owned lands. And (3) is subject to a management plan that specifically ensures that the designation does not adversely affect State or local government revenue, including for public education programs, and that specifically ensures that the use of intermixed or adjacent non-Federal property is not limited or restricted as a result of that designation. Directs the Secretary of State to report annually to specified congressional committees information on the management of each Biosphere Reserve within the United States. Prohibits any Federal official from nominating, classifying, or designating any Federal land located within the United States for a special or restricted use under any international agreement for conserving, preserving, or protecting the terrestrial or marine environment, flora, or fauna unless specifically authorized by law, but authorizes the Secretary to submit proposals for authorizing legislation.
