Or (2) intentionally damaging or destroying the property of a facility because that facility provides reproductive health services. Subjects violators to specified penalties or civil remedies, except that a parent or legal guardian or a minor shall not be subject to such a penalty or remedy insofar as such activities are directed exclusively at that minor.

Specifies that in any such action: (1) the court may award appropriate relief and compensatory and punitive damages for each person aggrieved by the violation. And (2) with respect to compensatory damages, the aggrieved person may elect, at any time before the rendering of final judgment, to recover an award of statutory damages in the amount of $5,000 per violation in lieu of actual damages. Authorizes the court to award reasonable fees for attorneys and expert witnesses to the prevailing party, other than the United States.

And (2) the Congress does not intend this Act to provide the exclusive remedies with respect to the conduct prohibited by it, nor to preempt State legislation that may provide such remedies."
