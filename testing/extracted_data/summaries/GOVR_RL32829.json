    "content": "The second session of the 109th Congress is expected to face an extensive trade agendaconsisting of a wide range of issues. In some respects these issues are distinct, each with its ownpolicy and economic implications. In other respects the issues are interrelated. They have emergedfrom common sets of domestic political, foreign policy, and economic factors and affect or areaffected by the concerns of Members of Congress, of other policymakers and of many interestgroups. These issues and how policymakers deal with them will define overall U.S. trade policy. During the first session, the 109th Congress dealt with a number of critical trade issues. TheBush Administration requested and received a two-year extension of its trade promotion authority. The Congress also debated U.S. participation in the World Trade Organization (WTO) as itconsidered, but did not pass, a congressional resolution to withdraw from the WTO. In addition, theAdministration sent and the Congress passed legislation to implement a free trade agreement withfive Central American countries plus the Dominican Republic, the DR-CAFTA, and passedimplementing legislation for a free trade agreement with Bahrain. Furthermore, the 109th Congressrepealed two trade programs that had been declared illegal by the WTO. During the second session,the 109th Congress may be called on to debate more free trade agreements, trade relations with China,and tariff preferences for developing countries, among other issues. The Congress might alsocontinue to monitor the Doha Development Agenda negotiations proceeding in the WTO. Each issue or set of trade issues bears its own implications as Members of Congress weighthe merits and disadvantages. In most cases, the 109th Congress will be considering and debatingeach issue separately. However, the trade issues as a whole have implications for a wider debate onU.S. trade policy. As the 109th Congress addresses these issues, its decisions will have implicationsfor key questions that help define U.S. trade policy in the long-term. This report will generally cover the trade issues as they unfold. However, it will not tracklegislation per se. The report will be updated as events warrant."
