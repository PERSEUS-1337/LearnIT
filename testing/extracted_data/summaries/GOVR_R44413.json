    "content": "The Department of Energy's (DOE's) nonproliferation and national security programs provide technical capabilities to support U.S. efforts to \"prevent, counter, respond\" to the proliferation of nuclear weapons worldwide, including by both states and non-state actors. These programs are administered by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semi-autonomous agency established within DOE in 2000. NNSA is responsible for maintaining the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, providing nuclear fuel to the Navy, nuclear and radiological emergency response, and nonproliferation. NNSA recently reorganized the Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, which is funded under the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN) account. This report addresses the programs in the NNSA's DNN account, appropriated by the Energy and Water appropriations bill. The FY2020 Consolidated Appropriations bill ( P.L. 116-94) funded the NNSA DNN accounts at $2.164 billion. The FY2021 request for DNN appropriations was $2.031 billion. The proposal would include unobligated prior year balances. The reduction continues an earlier trend to reduce prior-year carryover balances. According to the budget justi fication, the decrease of 6.2% from the FY2020-enacted level is due to \"completion of funding for contractual termination\" of the mixed-oxide fuel (MOX) project at the Savannah River Site."
