    "content": "In order to choose a neural network architecture that will be effective for a particular modeling problem, one must understand the limitations imposed by each of the potential options. These limitations are typically described in terms of information theoretic bounds, or by comparing the relative complexity needed to approximate example functions between different architectures. In this paper, we examine the topological constraints that the architecture of a neural network imposes on the level sets of all the functions that it is able to approximate. This approach is novel for both the nature of the limitations and the fact that they are independent of network depth for a broad family of activation functions. Neural networks have become the model of choice in a variety of machine learning applications, due to their flexibility and generality. However, selecting network architectures and other hyperparameters is typically a matter of trial and error. To make the choice of neural network architecture more straightforward, we need to understand the limits of each architecture, both in terms of what kinds of functions any given network architecture can approximate and how those limitations impact its ability to learn functions within those limits.A number of papers (3; 6; 11; 13) have shown that neural networks with a single hidden layer are a universal approximator, i.e. that they can approximate any continuous function on a compact domain to arbitrary accuracy if the hidden layer is allowed to have an arbitrarily high dimension. In practice, however, the neural networks that have proved most effective tend to have a large number of relatively low-dimensional hidden layers. This raises the question of whether neural networks with an arbitrary number of hidden layers of bounded dimension are also a universal approximator.In this paper we demonstrate a fairly general limitation on functions that can be approximated with the L \u221e norm on compact subsets of a Euclidean input space by layered, fully-connected feedforward neural networks of arbitrary depth and activation functions from a broad family including sigmoids and ReLus, but with layer widths bounded by the dimension of the input space. By a layered network, we mean that hidden nodes are grouped into successive layers and each node is only connected to nodes in the previous layer and the next layer. The constraints on the functions are defined in terms of topological properties of the level sets in the input space.This analysis is not meant to suggest that deep networks are worse than shallow networks, but rather to better understand how and why they will perform differently on different data sets. In fact, these limitations may be part of the reason deep nets have proven more effective on datasets whose structures are compatible with these limitations.By a level set, we mean the set of all points in the input space that the model maps to a given value in the output space. For classification models, a level set is just a decision boundary for a particular cutoff. For regression problems, level sets don't have a common interpretation.The main result of the paper, Theorem 1, states that the deep, skinny neural network architectures described above cannot approximate any function with a level set that is bounded in the input space. This can be rephrased as saying that for every function that can be approximated, every level set must be unbounded, extending off to infinity.While a number of recent papers have made impressive progress in understanding the limitations of different neural network architectures, this result is notable because it is independent of the number of layers in the network, and because the limitations are defined in terms of a very simple topological property. Topological tools have recently been employed to study the properties of data sets within the field known as Topological Data Analysis (9), but this paper exploits topological ideas to examine the topology of the models themselves. By demonstrating topological constraints on a widely used family of models, we suggest that there is further potential to apply topological ideas to understand the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms and methodologies across machine learning.After discussing the context and related work in Section 2, we introduce the basic definitions and notation in Section 3, then state the main Theorem and outline the proof in Section 4. The detailed proof is presented in Sections 5 and 6. We present experimental results that demonstrate the constraints in Section 7, then in Section 8 we present conclusions from this work. In this paper, we describe topological limitations on the types of functions that can be approximated by deep, skinny neural networks, independent of the number of hidden layers. We prove the result using standard set theoretic topology, then present examples that visually demonstrate the result."
