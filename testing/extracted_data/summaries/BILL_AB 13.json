    "title": "AB 13",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as one of the segments of public higher education in the state. Existing law generally requires community college districts to charge a tuition fee to nonresident students, but exempts specified community college students from paying that nonresident tuition fee. This bill would additionally exempt nonresident students living in California and enrolled at a community college college, as specified, who are covered individuals, as defined in a specified federal statute, using, or are intending to use, Federal GI Bill education benefits, as specified, to cover the costs associated with enrollment as a community college student. This bill would authorize community college districts to report students exempted from nonresident tuition under this bill as resident full-time equivalent students for purposes of calculating apportionments to those districts. To the extent that this bill would place additional requirements on community college districts regarding the provision of postsecondary education benefits to certain students, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."
