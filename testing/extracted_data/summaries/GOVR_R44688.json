    "content": "The manner in which staff are integrated and utilized within an organization may reflect the missions and priorities of that organization. In Congress, staff work for Members of Congress in personal, committee, and leadership offices, and are involved with every facet of congressional activity. Activities might include supporting a Member's representational, legislative, leadership, or administrative responsibilities as they arise in those settings. House and Senate staff activities may be of particular interest as one Congress comes to a close, and another Congress integrates new Members and staff in support of addressing its constitutional and representational responsibilities. Interest in staff issues may also arise when considering committee funding or appropriations for the legislative branch. CRS has several products about congressional staff, listed below, that provide information about staff roles and data over time about the number of staff, pay levels, and time in specific positions in Member office and committee settings. Congressional clients may contact the authors of the individual reports for additional information."
