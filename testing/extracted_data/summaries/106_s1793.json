Details mandatory NRC considerations. Amends the Federal Power Act to permit an electric utility that owns a nuclear power facility in whole or in part to petition the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), for an order approving rates and charges in connection with wholesale transmission or sale of electricity to ensure collection of revenues necessary to ensure adequate funding to satisfy its decommissioning obligations. Provides that in such petition proceeding any nuclear decommissioning assurance determination made under this Act shall be conclusive. Permits a utility whose request has been denied to seek judicial review."
