(2) accepting an immediate moratorium on debt service payments and accrual of interest on the debt owed by such country. (3) encouraging each country to ensure that the national HIVAIDS strategic plan is fully funded, with a significant proportion of the savings from the debt cancellation to be used for HIVAIDS response and other health priorities, and HIVAIDS and infectious disease control strategies are based upon best practices, including prevention, care, treatment, orphan response, and accessibility to affordable drugs and social and health infrastructure. And (4) using their reserve accounts or net income to offset debt cancellation costs. Directs the Secretary to instruct the US Executive Directors at the World Bank and the IMF to oppose any of their programs that would include user fees for primary education or primary health care, including prevention and treatment efforts for HIVAIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and infant, child, and maternal well-being.
