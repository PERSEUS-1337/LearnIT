    "content": "Now expired, Section 1207 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2006 (P.L. 109-163) provided authority for the Department of Defense (DOD) to transfer to the State Department up to $100 million per fiscal year in defense articles, services, training or other support for reconstruction, stabilization, and security activities in foreign countries. From FY2006 through FY2010, Section 1207 funded $445.2 million in projects in 23 countries on a bilateral basis and in five countries on a multilateral basis (including one also funded bilaterally). Section 1207 authority expired on September 30, 2010, at the end of FY2010. Under Section 1207, the Secretary of Defense was authorized to \"provide services to, and transfer defense articles and funds to, the Secretary of State for the purpose of facilitating the provision by the Secretary of State of reconstruction, security, or stabilization assistance to a foreign country.\" Congress capped the value of these services, articles, and funds at $100 million. Congress never intended Section 1207 to be a permanent authority. Congressional authorizers and appropriators expressed in several documents that Section 1207 authority was temporary, and indicated that such funding is better provided under the State Department budget. This report provides background and data on Section 1207 authority and funding that may be useful for possible debate in the 112th Congress regarding the appropriate roles and funding mechanisms for DOD, the State Department, and other U.S. agencies in conflict prevention, management, and resolution, and in stabilization and reconstruction operations. It also may serve as background for possible consideration of the Obama Administration proposal for a joint State-DOD Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF), as some of the GSCF's proposed uses overlap with Section 1207 purposes. This report will not be updated."
