Applies this change as though it had taken effect on August 15, 2008. Relieves a manufacturer from the requirement to test or certify a product regarding lead content if the manufacturer has tested and certifies each component of the product.

Requires the CPSC to waive any civil penalty for a good faith first violation of a prohibition under the Act. Requires the CPSC to develop, publish, and distribute a guide to assist small enterprises in complying with the requirements of the Consumer Product Safety Act and other Acts enforced by the CPSC."
