    "content": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown remarkable success as a framework for training models to produce realistic-looking data. In this work, we propose a Recurrent GAN (RGAN) and Recurrent Conditional GAN (RCGAN) to produce realistic real-valued multi-dimensional time series, with an emphasis on their application to medical data. RGANs make use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in the generator and the discriminator. In the case of RCGANs, both of these RNNs are conditioned on auxiliary information. We demonstrate our models in a set of toy datasets, where we show visually and quantitatively (using sample likelihood and maximum mean discrepancy) that they can successfully generate realistic time-series. We also describe novel evaluation methods for GANs, where we generate a synthetic labelled training dataset, and evaluate on a real test set the performance of a model trained on the synthetic data, and vice-versa. We illustrate with these metrics that RCGANs can generate time-series data useful for supervised training, with only minor degradation in performance on real test data. This is demonstrated on digit classification from \u2018serialised\u2019 MNIST and by training an early warning system on a medical dataset of 17,000 patients from an intensive care unit. We further discuss and analyse the privacy concerns that may arise when using RCGANs to generate realistic synthetic medical time series data, and demonstrate results from differentially private training of the RCGAN. Access to data is one of the bottlenecks in the development of machine learning solutions to domainspecific problems. The availability of standard datasets (with associated tasks) has helped to advance the capabilities of learning systems in multiple tasks. However, progress appears to lag in other fields, such as medicine. It is tempting to suggest that tasks in medicine are simply harder -the data more complex, more noisy, the prediction problems less clearly defined. Regardless of this, the dearth of data accessible to researchers hinders model comparisons, reproducibility and ultimately scientific progress. However, due to the highly sensitive nature of medical data, its access is typically highly controlled, or require involved and likely imperfect de-identification. The motivation for this work is therefore to exploit and develop the framework of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate realistic synthetic medical data. This data could be shared and published without privacy concerns, or even used to augment or enrich similar datasets collected in different or smaller cohorts of patients. Moreover, building a system capable of synthesizing realistic medical data implies modelling the processes that generates such information, and therefore it can represent the first step towards developing a new approach for creating predictive systems in medical environments.Beyond the utility to the machine learning research community, such a tool stands to benefit the medical community for use in training simulators. In this work, we focus on synthesising real-valued time-series data as from an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In ICUs, doctors have to make snap decisions under time pressure, where they cannot afford to hesitate. It is already standard in medical training to use simulations to train doctors, but these simulations often rely on hand-engineered rules and physical props. Thus, a model capable of generating diverse and realistic ICU situations could have an immediate application, especially when given the ability to condition on underlying 'states' of the patient.The success of GANs in generating realistic-looking images BID29 BID20 BID12 BID30 suggests their applicability for this task, however limited work has exploited them for generating time-series data. In addition, evaluation of GANs remains a largely-unsolved problem, with researchers often relying on visual evaluation of generated examples, an approach which is both impractical and inappropriate for multi-dimensional medical time series. For example BID35 ) present a method to use convolutional GANs specifically designed to generate video sequences, and the results were visually evaluated with Amazon Mechanical Turk. In BID25 , authors present a method for voice synthesis based on dilated convolutions, which is also evaluated by humans. This voice synthesis model has been very recently improved by introducing an RNN-based network that generates the spectrogram of the signal BID32 .The primary contributions of this work are:1. Demonstration of a method to generate multivariate real-valued sequences using adversarial training and recurrent neural networks.2. Showing novel approaches for evaluating GANs.3. Generating synthetic medical time series data.4. Empirical privacy analysis of both GANs and differential private GANs. We have described, trained and evaluated a recurrent GAN architecture for generating real-valued sequential data, which we call RGAN. We have additionally developed a conditional variant (RCGAN) to generate synthetic datasets, consisting of real-valued time-series data with associated labels. As this task poses new challenges, we have presented novel solutions to deal with evaluation and questions of privacy. By generating labelled training data -by conditioning on the labels and generating the corresponding samples, we can evaluate the quality of the model using the 'TSTR technique', where we train a model on the synthetic data, and evaluate it on a real, held-out test set. We have demonstrated this approach using 'serialised' multivariate MNIST, and on a dataset of real ICU patients, where models trained on the synthetic dataset achieved performance at times comparable to that of the real data. In domains such as medicine, where privacy concerns hinder the sharing of data, this implies that with refinement of these techniques, models could be developed on synthetic data that are still valuable for real tasks. This could enable the development of synthetic 'benchmarking' datasets for medicine (or other sensitive domains), of the kind which have enabled great progress in other areas. We have additionally illustrated that such a synthetic dataset does not pose a major privacy concern or constitute a data leak for the original sensitive training data, and that for stricter privacy guarantees, differential privacy can be used in training the RCGAN with some loss to performance. : Data from three real eICU patients (purple, blue, gold) of the first five hours after admission. Noise from N (0, \u03c3 2 e ) for \u03c3 e = 0.1\u03c3 has been added to protect privacy, where \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the true data (for that variable). We compare the data at its original sampling resolution with downsampled to one measurement every 15 minutes (the setting used in this paper) and 30 minutes. High-frequency fluctuations are lost through downsampling, but general trends and some variability are preserved in the 15 minute case. These patients were selected randomly from the set of patients with minimal missing data during the time period and so are representative of the cohort used to generate the training data. : Three random samples from the generator trained on eICU data. These samples are from the synthetic datasets used in the TSTR experiments in section 5.1. The generator produces data in [\u22121, 1], so to obtain medically relevant values, the inverse of the scaling transformation used on the training data has been applied. This transformation was to scale each variable at each time-point independently to the range [\u22121, 1]. An unusually high value (likely an artefact) in the mean arterial pressure at 135 minutes after admission is responsible for the apparent downward spike in the generated data. A scaling transformation T is applied to the real data (independently for each variable at each timepoint), and the synthetic data is as produced by the generator. , and zooming in. The synthetic data consists of the generated datasets from all five replicates of the TSTR experiment in eICU described in section 5.1 with TSTR results reported in Table 2a . The real data is the training set for those expeirments. between synthetic and real data. The synthetic data is that used in the TSTR experiments (five replicates) in section 5.1."
