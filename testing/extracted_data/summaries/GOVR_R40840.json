    "content": "On May 11, 2009, President Obama requested $4.474 billion for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) FY2010 budget. This amount was $109 million (2.5%) more than the FY2009 enacted appropriation of $4.365 billion. Administration priorities for the NOAA budget included satellite programs, climate research, endangered species recovery, and fisheries management. On June 18, 2009, the House passed H.R. 2847 to fund the Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) for FY2010. The House included $4.603 billion for NOAA, which was $238 million (5.5%) more than the FY2009 appropriation and $129 million (2.9%) more than the FY2010 request. On June 25, 2009, the Senate passed the CJS appropriations bill for FY2010 (H.R. 2847) and recommended $4.773 billion for NOAA. This represented an increase of $408 million (9.3%) over the FY2009 enacted funding level, an increase of $299 million (6.7%) over the amount requested by the Administration, and an increase of $170 million (3.7%) over the amount passed by the House. On December 16, 2009, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-117), which provides NOAA with $4.737 billion for FY2010. This represents an increase of 8.5% compared to the FY2009 enacted level and an increase of 5.9% over the Administration's request. On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5). The amounts appropriated by Congress in the ARRA are in addition to the funding appropriated in the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-8). ARRA provided NOAA with $830 million for a variety of activities such as restoring habitat, constructing and maintaining facilities, constructing a research vessel, supporting the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, and other projects. The ARRA funding is not included in comparing FY2010 requested, passed, and recommended levels with FY2009 enacted appropriations because ARRA funds are available in both FY2009 and FY2010."
