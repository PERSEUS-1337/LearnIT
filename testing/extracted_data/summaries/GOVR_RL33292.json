    "content": "On July 18, 2005, President Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announcedthe creation of a \"global partnership,\" which would include \"full\" civil nuclear cooperation betweenthe United States and India. This is at odds with nearly three decades of U.S. nonproliferation policyand practice. President Bush promised India he would persuade Congress to amend the pertinentlaws to approve the agreement, as well as persuade U.S. allies to create an exception to multilateralNuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) guidelines for India. India committed to, among other things,separating its civilian nuclear facilities from its military nuclear facilities, declaring civilian facilitiesto the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and placing them under IAEA safeguards, andsigning an Additional Protocol. See CRS Report RL33016 , U.S. Nuclear Cooperation With India:Issues for Congress , by [author name scrubbed], for further details on the agreement. The separation plan announced by Prime Minister Singh and President Bush on March 2,2006, and further elaborated on May 11, 2006, would place 8 power reactors under inspection,bringing the total up to 14 out of a possible 22 under inspection. Several fuel fabrication and spentfuel storage facilities were declared, as well as 3 heavy water plants that were described as\"safeguards-irrelevant.\" The plan excludes from international inspection 8 indigenous powerreactors, enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing facilities (except as currently safeguarded), militaryproduction reactors and other military nuclear plants and 3 heavy water plants. Administrationofficials have defended the separation plan as credible and defensible because it covers more thanjust a token number of Indian facilities, provides for safeguards in perpetuity, and includes upstreamand downstream facilities. U.S. officials acknowledge the importance of a credible separation plan to ensuring that theUnited States complies with its Article I obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty(NPT) -- to not in any way assist a nuclear weapons program in a non-nuclear weapon state. Foralmost 30 years, the U.S. legal standard has been that only nuclear safeguards on all nuclear activitiesin a state provides adequate assurances. The Administration is apparently asking Congress to backa lower level of assurance by proposing that the separation plan take the place of comprehensivesafeguards. Congress is likely to consider this issue as well as others when the Administration eventuallysubmits its cooperation agreement with India for approval by both chambers. P.L. 109-401 , signedon December 18, 2006, provides waivers for a nuclear cooperation agreement with India fromrelevant Atomic Energy Act provisions, and requires detailed information on the separation plan andresultant safeguards. This report, which will be updated as necessary, provides background onIndia's nuclear fuel cycle, a discussion of various issues involved in separating civilian and militarynuclear facilities and potential concerns for Congress as it considers whether the United States hasadequate assurances that its nuclear cooperation does not assist, encourage, or induce India's nuclearweapons development, production, or proliferation."
