    "title": "AB 2821",
    "content": "Existing law establishes various housing programs directed by the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), including special housing programs to provide housing assistance for persons with developmental and physical disabilities and persons with mental health disorders. Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. This bill would require HCD to, on or before October 1, 2017, establish the Housing for a Healthy California Program and on or before April 1, 2018, and every year thereafter, subject to appropriation by the Legislature, award grants on a competitive basis to eligible grant applicants based on guidelines that HCD would draft, as prescribed, and other requirements. The bill would provide that an applicant is eligible for a grant under the program if the applicant meets specified requirements, including that the applicant identify a source of funding, as specified, agree to contribute funding for interim and long-term rental assistance, and agree to collect and report data, as specified. The bill would require an applicant awarded a grant to use the funds for specified purposes, including long-term rental assistance and interim housing. The bill would provide that a county resident is eligible to receive assistance pursuant to a grant awarded under the program if he or she meets specified requirements, including that the person is homeless, is a Medi-Cal beneficiary, is eligible for Supplemental Security Income, is eligible to receive certain services, and is likely to improve his or her health with supportive services. The bill would provide that the program shall be funded upon appropriation by the Legislature. The bill would also authorize HCD, for purposes of implementing these provisions, to enter into exclusive or nonexclusive contracts on a bid or negotiated basis, exempt from specified small business procurement, personal service, and public contracting provisions, and exempt from the review or approval of any division of the Department of General Services. The bill would exempt the program guidelines created by the department from requirements prescribed for administrative regulations. The bill would require HCD to analyze data collected pursuant to the program, as specified, and by October 1, 2019, and subsequently as the program may be funded, to report program data to certain legislative committees, as specified. The bill would condition implementation of these provisions upon an appropriation provided for this purpose."
