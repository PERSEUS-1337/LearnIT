    "content": "The electric power industry is in the process of transformation. The electricity infrastructure of the United States is aging; uncertainty exists around how to modernize the grid, and what technologies and fuels will be used to produce electricity in the future. Unresolved questions are arising about market structure, potential cyber and physical security threats, and continuing interest in harnessing low carbon sources of electricity. Concerns about reliability and electricity prices are being affected by new environmental regulations, and the rising availability of natural gas for the production of electric power. On September 7, 2016, the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Energy and Power subcommittee (E&P subcommittee) made efforts to re-evaluate the relevance of the Federal Power Act (FPA) in the context of a changing electricity industry, with a hearing on historical perspectives of the act. The FPA has been the primary vehicle that Congress has used to modify national policies affecting the U.S. electricity industry. It will be the most likely vehicle for Congress to consider in initiating new policies for the modernization of this industry. In 1935, Congress passed the Public Utility Act (PUA) seeking to end the abuses of market power evident at that time. Title II of the PUA created the Federal Power Act. Part I of the FPA addressed licensing of nonfederal hydropower projects on navigable waters. Part II of the FPA addressed the regulation of electric utilities engaged in interstate commerce, delineating federal and state jurisdiction, respectively, with respect to wholesale and retail sales. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC's) regulatory authority derives from the FPA. Electric utilities were originally vertically integrated companies responsible for power generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity to end-use customers. Congress began to move the electric power industry towards competition with the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT92; P.L. 102-486). In 1996, the Commission exercised its authority under the FPA, issuing two regulations intended to inaugurate an open and efficient marketplace for electric power. A few years later, FERC took the next step encouraging the formation of independent regional transmission organizations (RTOs) in Order No. 2000. In RTO regions, electricity utilities were restructured, shifting power generation from a rate-regulated to a competitive regime, with FERC regulating the transmission of power. Under restructuring, states continued to regulate distribution. RTO electricity markets provide about 60% of power nationwide supplied to distribution utilities. A number of conceptual, structural, and policy issues have emerged with RTO operations and energy markets. Some RTOs are being confronted with concerns over whether there will be adequate levels of competitive generation to participate in the markets, and sufficient future capacity in the marketplace. FERC has been involved in recent court proceedings to ensure that state actions to incentivize new power plant construction do not unduly inhibit competitive price formation in RTO markets. Other concerns involve the use of market power and price manipulation. FERC was tasked by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) with prohibiting \"any entity\" from using \"manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance\" in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or electric energy in transactions subject to FERC jurisdiction. The 2000-2001Western energy crisis showed that electricity markets are susceptible to market manipulation. RTO markets have enabled a variety of products and services, including derivatives and other tools for market participants, ostensibly to reduce risks from volatile prices. Regulating such products and services still faces a number of issues. FERC continues to refine its approach to these and other wholesale electricity market issues. But the emergence and of new technologies and energy conservation schemes will likely bring new pressures to change how the electricity industry operates. As the electricity markets continue to evolve, Congress may examine whether changes to the FPA are necessary to ensure the economic and reliable operation of the U.S. electricity system."
