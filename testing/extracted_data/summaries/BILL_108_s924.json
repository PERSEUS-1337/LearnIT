    "content": "Directs the Secretary of the Interior to accept from the Newtok Native Corporation a conveyance, by limited warranty deed, of certain Alaskan lands previously conveyed to Newtok if such Corporation expresses an intent to enter into a land exchange with the United States within 180 days of enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to also accept a relinquishment of irrevocable prioritized selections from Newtok for those validly selected lands not yet conveyed to Newtok. Requires the Secretary, in exchange for the lands from Newtok, to convey to Newtok the surface and subsurface estate of specified Federal lands. States that such conveyance shall be by interim conveyance. Declares that land conveyed to Newtok under this Act shall be deemed to have been conveyed under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), except that specified provisions of ANCSA concerning patents and lands in the National Wildlife Refuge System shall not apply to such lands. States that, consistent with the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980, such lands shall not be considered part of the Yukon National Wildlife Refuge. Includes the Newtok lands conveyed to the United States in the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, except that residents of the village of Newtok, Alaska, shall retain access rights guaranteed under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act for subsistence fishing, hunting, and gathering. Entitles the Calista Corporation to an equivalent acreage of in-lieu subsurface entitlement for the relinquished Newtok selections to the extent that Calista subsurface rights are affected by this Act. Directs that such entitlement shall come from subsurface lands already selected by Calista, but which have not yet been conveyed. Permits Calista to make an additional in lieu selection from lands within the region but outside any conservation system unit if such action is necessary to equalize the acreage."
