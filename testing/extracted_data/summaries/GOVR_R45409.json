    "content": "Quantum information science (QIS) combines elements of mathematics, computer science, engineering, and physical sciences, and has the potential to provide capabilities far beyond what is possible with the most advanced technologies available today. Although much of the press coverage of QIS has been devoted to quantum computing, there is more to QIS. Many experts divide QIS technologies into three application areas: Sensing and metrology, Communications, and Computing and simulation. The government's interest in QIS dates back at least to the mid-1990s, when the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Department of Defense (DOD) held their first workshops on the topic. QIS is first mentioned in the FY2008 budget of what is now the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program and has been a component of the program since then. Today, QIS is a component of the National Strategic Computing Initiative (Presidential Executive Order 13702), which was established in 2015. Most recently, in September 2018, the National Science and Technology Council issued the National Strategic Overview for Quantum Information Science. The policy opportunities identified in this strategic overview include\u2014 choosing a science-first approach to QIS, creating a \"quantum-smart\" workforce, deepening engagement with the quantum industry, providing critical infrastructure, maintaining national security and economic growth, and advancing international cooperation. The United States is not alone in increasing investment in QIS R&D. This research is also being pursued at major research centers worldwide, with China and the European Union having the largest foreign QIS programs. Further, even without explicit QIS initiatives, many other countries, including Russia, Germany, and Austria, are making strides in QIS research and development (R&D). The Senate has introduced three bills in the 115th Congress (S. 3143, S. 2998, and S. 3673) and the House has introduced one bill in the 115th Congress (H.R. 6227) related to QIS. These bills would establish a federal program to accelerate U.S. QIS R&D, create a National Quantum Coordination Office within OSTP, establish a Defense Quantum Information Consortium, and require the Secretary of Energy to carry out quantum information science research. The House has held three hearings related to QIS. Issues discussed in these hearings included a comparison of U.S. and international QIS R&D, and how to effectively train a QIS-knowledgeable workforce; China's investment in leading-edge technologies, including QIS, and concerns that China may be closing the gap with the United States in advanced technology R&D; and an overview of quantum computers. This report provides an overview of QIS technologies: sensing and metrology, communications, and computing and simulation. It also includes examples of existing and potential future applications; brief summaries of funding and selected R&D initiatives in the United States and elsewhere around the world; a description of U.S. congressional activity; and a discussion of related policy considerations."
