    "content": "On November 20, 2004, the House and Senate approved the conference agreement on the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( H.R. 4818 , H.Rept. 108-792 ), whichcombined nine annual appropriations bills into one measure. The President signed H.R.4818 into law ( P.L. 108-447 ) on December 8, 2004. Division A of the act provides theU.S. Department of Agriculture and Related Agencies with $85.28 billion in budget authority forFY2005, which is $1.3 billion below FY2004 and $2.0-$2.3 billion above the FY2005 House-passed( H.R. 4766 ) and Senate-reported ( S. 2803 ) bills, and the Administration'sFY2005 request. An estimated $66.4 billion, or nearly 80%, of the total FY2005 spending in Division A is for mandatory USDA programs, primarily farm commodity support programs and various nutritionprograms. The mandatory total for FY2005 is $1.45 billion below FY2004, mainly becauseimproved farm commodity prices have required reduced spending for farm commodity supportauthorized by the 2002 farm bill. FY2005 mandatory spending is approximately $2 billion above therecommendations of the House, Senate, and the Administration, mainly because of a revision innutrition program funding needs subsequent to these recommendations. For all discretionary programs, USDA and related agencies receive $16.98 billion for FY2005, before taking into account the effect of a 0.8% across-the-board rescission on all discretionaryaccounts required by P.L. 108-447 . Discretionary spending is the category over which appropriatorshave direct control in annual spending bills. The pre-rescission discretionary total is about $140million above the enacted FY2004 level and the FY2005 House level, $210 million above the Senatelevel, and $413 million above the Administration request. Once it is applied, the rescission likelywill bring FY2005 spending close to the FY2004 and House level of $16.84 billion. In order to meet an FY2005 discretionary allocation that was close to the FY2004 enacted level, appropriators, as in past years, placed limitations on authorized levels of spending in the 2002 farmbill for various mandatory conservation, rural development, and research programs. P.L. 108-447 reduced authorized FY2005 mandatory spending levels for these programs by a total of about $1.2billion, and applied those savings toward meeting the discretionary allocation. Among the provisions that were deleted by conferees in the final law were a Senate provision that would have relaxed licensing rules for businesses seeking to travel to Cuba to promote and sellagricultural products; and a House provision that would have prohibited FDA from enforcing thecurrent law that bans importation of prescriptions drugs by parties other than drug companies.
