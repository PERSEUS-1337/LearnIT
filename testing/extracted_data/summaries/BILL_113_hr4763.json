Considers an industry to exist if there is in the United States substantial investment in licensing activities that leads to the adoption and development of articles that incorporate the patent, copyright, trademark, mask work, or design of protected articles. Prohibits a complainant alleging a violation from relying upon activities by its licensees unless the license leads to such adoption and development. Prescribes requirements with respect to US International Trade Commission investigations of alleged violations."
