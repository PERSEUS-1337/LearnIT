    "title": "SB 1239",
    "content": "Existing law establishes a motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program that is administered by the Department of Consumer Affairs. The smog check program requires inspection of motor vehicles upon initial registration, biennially upon renewal of registration, upon transfer of ownership, and in certain other circumstances. Existing law exempts specified vehicles from being inspected biennially upon renewal of registration, including, among others, all motor vehicles manufactured prior to the 1976 model year. This bill, until January 1, 2019, would also exempt from the biennial smog check inspections all motor vehicles manufactured after the 1976 1975 model year but prior to the 1981 model year if the owner submits proof that the motor vehicle is insured as a collector motor vehicle."
