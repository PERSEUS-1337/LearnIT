    "content": "Terrorist use of chemical agents has been a noted concern, highlighted after the Tokyo Sarin gas attacks of 1995. The events of September 11, 2001, increased Congressional attention towardsreducing the vulnerability of the United States to such attacks. High-threat chemical agents, whichinclude chemical weapons and some toxic industrial chemicals, are normally organized by militaryplanners into four groups: nerve agents, blister agents, choking agents, and blood agents. While therelative military threat posed by the various chemical types has varied over time, use of thesechemicals against civilian targets is viewed as a low probability, high consequence event. High-threat chemical agents, depending on the type of agent used, cause a variety of symptoms in their victims. Some cause death by interfering with the nervous system. Some inhibit breathingand lead to asphyxiation. Others have caustic effects on contact. As a result, chemical attacktreatment may be complicated by the need to identify at least the type of chemical used. Differencesin treatment protocols for the various high-threat agents may also strain the resources of the publichealth system, especially in the case of mass casualties. Additionally, chemical agents trapped onthe body or clothes of victims may place first responders and medical professionals at risk. Protection from and detection of chemical agents is an area of much concern. The range of protection and detection equipment available to first responders has led to questions regardingequipment standardization and state and local preparedness. Whether terrorist groups are capable of using chemical agents as weapons of mass destruction is unclear. Some have asserted that the volumes of chemicals required to cause mass casualtieswould make that scenario unlikely. They claim that chemical terrorism is more likely to be smallin scale. Others have suggested that there has been an increase in terrorist interest regardingchemical agents, and that this interest could lead to their use in terrorist attacks. Current policies seek to reduce the proliferation of chemicals that could be transformed into chemical weapons, prevent unrestricted access to large amounts of toxic chemicals, provide federalassistance to locations that are affected by chemical terrorism, and support research and developmentactivities. It is expected that the Department of Homeland Security will take a major role in federalpolicy efforts. Additional measures suggested for addressing potential chemical terrorism vulnerabilities include further restricting domestic access to precursor chemicals and technologies required tomanufacture high-threat chemical agents; directing continued research and development intoselective, sensitive chemical agent detectors; implementing air monitoring equipment to detectchemical releases in, for example, public transportation or urban spaces; and overseeing furtherresearch into protective equipment, prophylaxis, and treatment against high-threat chemicals. Thisreport will be updated as circumstances warrant."
