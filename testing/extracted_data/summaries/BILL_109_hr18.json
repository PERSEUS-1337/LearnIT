Prohibits the Secretary from obligating any funds appropriated to the Fund in a fiscal year until the Secretary has deposited a matching amount provided by non-federal interests of at least 35 percent for a project. Makes each authority responsible for providing the required non-federal amount. Directs the Secretary to credit the appropriate authority with the value of all prior compatible expenditures by non-federal interests made after January 1, 2000. Authorizes appropriations. Terminates this Act ten years after the enactment date."
