Redefines genocide for such purposes to cover an alien who has ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in conduct outside the United States that would, if committed in the United States or by a US national, be genocide . Redefines severe violations of religious freedom with respect to the inadmissibility and removability of a foreign government official to cover an alien who, while serving as a foreign government official, was responsible for or directly carried out at any time severe violations of religious freedom . Eliminates the bar to the admission of such person's spouse or children. Prohibits the waiver of inadmissibility and temporary admission of such aliens.
