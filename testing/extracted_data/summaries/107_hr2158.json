    "content": "Aircraft Clean Air Act of 2001 - Authorizes crew members or passengers that experience an aircraft air quality incident which results in their reporting a symptom consistent with exposure to neurotoxins or asphyxiants to file a request with the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for: (1) the aircraft's mechanical and maintenance records. (2) the filtration media used in the aircraft's air supply system. And (3) the chemical constituents of products used in the maintenance, operation, or treatment of such aircraft to which a crew member or passenger may have been directly exposed. Sets forth a civil penalty for the failure of an air carrier to produce such records, media, or information. Directs the Administrator of the FAA to award a grant for an aeromedical research study to determine what cabin altitude must be maintained to provide sufficient oxygen to ensure that the short- and long-term health of 95 percent of a representative sample of cabin crew and passengers is not adversely affected."
