    "content": "The spread of H5N1 avian influenza (\"flu\"), and the human deaths it has caused, raise concern that the virus could morph and cause a global human pandemic. Congress has provided specific funding for pandemic flu preparedness since FY2004, including $6.1 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY2006. These funds bolster related activities to prepare for public health threats, and to control seasonal flu. This report discusses appropriations for pandemic flu, primarily to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and will be updated as needed."
