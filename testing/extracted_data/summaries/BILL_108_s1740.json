    "content": "Anthrax Victims Fund Fairness Act of 2003 - Amends the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 to provide compensation for victims of a terrorist-related laboratory-confirmed anthrax infection in the United States during the period beginning on September 13, 2001, through November 30, 2001, on the same basis as compensation is provided to victims of the terrorist-related aircraft crashes on September 11, 2001. States that a claimant under this Act waives the right to file a civil action in any Federal or State court for damages sustained in the incident, except against a knowing participant in any conspiracy to commit any terrorist act. Exempts from such waiver any civil action to recover a collateral source obligation based on contract."
