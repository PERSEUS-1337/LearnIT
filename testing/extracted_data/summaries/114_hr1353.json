A drug is provided this extended exclusivity period if it is approved for a new indication or use, or the drug has been reformulated or redesigned to: promote greater patient adherence to an approved treatment regime, reduce the public health risks associated with the drug, reduce side effects or adverse events, provide benefits to the health-care system, or provide other comparable patient benefits."
