    "title": "AB 2165",
    "content": "Existing law makes it a crime for any person in this state to manufacture, import into the state for sale, keep for sale, offer or expose for sale, give, or lend an unsafe handgun. Under existing law, this prohibition does not apply to the sale or purchase of a handgun if the handgun is sold to, or purchased by, a police department, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, or any federal law enforcement agency, among other entities. This bill would also make the above prohibition inapplicable to the sale or purchase of a handgun if the handgun is sold to, or purchased by, specified entities or sworn members of those entities who have satisfactorily completed the firearms portion of a training course prescribed by the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training. The bill would prohibit a licensed firearms dealer from processing the sale or transfer of an unsafe handgun between a person who has obtained an unsafe handgun pursuant to this exemption and a person who is not exempt. This bill would require a person, with exceptions, who obtains an unsafe handgun pursuant to this exemption to, when leaving the handgun in an unattended vehicle, as defined, lock the handgun in the vehicle\u2019s trunk or lock the handgun in a locked container, as defined, and place the container out of plain view. The bill would make a violation of this provision an infraction punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
