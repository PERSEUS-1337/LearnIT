    "content": "Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to reduce the rate of pay otherwise applicable to Members of Congress for any month, during a Congress, by the Member's missed vote percentage for the most recent month before such month if the individual missed votes because of campaigning for election to another office. Applies this requirement to a vote taken in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union unless the Member of the House of Representatives did not engage in any campaign-related activity on the date of the vote. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer from the general fund of the Treasury to a specified mandatory account to reduce the public debt the difference between the aggregate amount expended for pay of Members of Congress for the fiscal year and the aggregate amount that would have been expended but for the reduction in pay."
