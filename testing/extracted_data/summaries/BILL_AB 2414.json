    "title": "AB 2414",
    "content": "Existing law, the Local Health Care District Law, authorizes the organization and incorporation of local health care districts and specifies the powers of those districts, including, among other things, the power to establish, maintain, and operate, or provide assistance in the operation of, one or more health facilities or health services, including, but not limited to, outpatient programs, services, and facilities, retirement programs, services, and facilities, chemical dependency programs, services, and facilities. Or other health care programs, services, and facilities and activities at any location within or without the district for the benefit of the district and the people served by the district. This bill would authorize the expansion of the Desert Healthcare District to include the eastern Coachella Valley region by requiring the district to submit a resolution of application to the Riverside County Local Agency Formation Commission to initiate proceedings to expand the district. The bill would require the commission to order the expansion of the district subject to a vote of the registered voters residing within the territory to be annexed at an election following the completion of those proceedings. The bill would require the Board of Supervisors of the County of Riverside, upon direction by the commission, to place approval of district expansion on the ballot at the next countywide election following the completion of commission proceedings, including a public hearing. The bill would provide for expansion of the district upon voter approval, if a funding source sufficient to support the operations of the expanded district is, if required, approved, as specified. The bill would require the district to pay for election costs, as specified. By imposing new duties on the County of Riverside, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. This bill would require the board of directors of the district, following expansion, to adopt a resolution to increase the number of members of the district\u2019s board of directors from 5 to 7, and to appoint 2 members who are residents of the territory annexed by the district to fill the vacant positions, as specified. Following the expansion of the board of directors, the bill would require the board of directors to adopt a resolution to divide the Desert Healthcare District into voting districts for the purpose of electing members of the board of directors from and by the electors of those voting districts beginning with the next district election after January 1, 2020, as specified. This bill would state the intent of the Legislature that the Desert Healthcare District maximize the use of its assets to provide direct health services to individuals within the district, as specified. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Coachella Valley region of Riverside County. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
