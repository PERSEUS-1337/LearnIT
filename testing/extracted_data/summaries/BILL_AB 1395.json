    "title": "AB 1395",
    "content": "Existing law makes it a felony or a misdemeanor to engage in money laundering, defined as conducting a transaction involving a monetary instrument of specified value through a financial institution with the specific intent to promote or facilitate criminal activity. Existing law defines criminal activity for these purposes as any criminal offense punishable as a felony. This bill would expand the definition of criminal activity for purposes of money laundering to include various offenses punishable as misdemeanors that are related to illegal lotteries and gaming. By expanding the definition of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
