    "title": "AB 2609",
    "content": "Existing law prohibits various specified advertising practices, including, among others, the placement by an educational travel organization, as defined, or use of any misleading or untruthful advertising or statements or making of a substantial misrepresentation in conducting an educational travel program. Under existing law, the violation of any of these prohibitions is a misdemeanor. This bill would require an educational conference organization, as defined, that provides materials related to an educational conference, as defined, directly to a school or school employee for purposes of distribution to a student to include specified disclosures with the materials, to provide those disclosures to the school and specified school employees, and to provide the materials in a sealed envelope or other packaging addressed to the parent or legal guardian of the student. As a violation of these provisions would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
