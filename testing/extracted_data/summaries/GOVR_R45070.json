    "content": "The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) regulates robocalls. A robocall, also known as \"voice broadcasting,\" is any telephone call that delivers a prerecorded message using an automatic (computerized) telephone dialing system, more commonly referred to as an automatic dialer or \"autodialer.\" Robocalls are popular with many industry groups, such as real estate, telemarketing, and direct sales companies. The majority of companies who use robocalling are legitimate businesses, but some are not. Those illegitimate businesses may not just be annoying consumers\u2014they may also be trying to defraud them. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regularly cite \"unwanted and illegal robocalls\" as their number-one complaint category. The FTC received more than 1.9 million complaints filed in the first five months of 2017 and about 5.3 million in 2016. The FCC has stated that it gets more than 200,000 complaints about unwanted telemarketing calls each year. These statistics, as well as complaints to congressional offices, have spurred Congress to hold hearings and introduce legislation on the issue in an effort to protect consumers. Congressional policymakers have proposed a number of changes to existing law and regulations to address the problem of illegal robocalls under the TCA, many of which are intended to defraud. These changes would, for example, expand the definition of what a robocall is, increase penalties for illegal spoofing, and improve protection of seniors from robocall scams. As yet, none of these proposals has become law. On August 19, 2016, a 60-day Robocall \"Strike Force\" convened, culminating in the testing of a Do Not Originate (DNO) Registry to stop unwanted calls from reaching customers. The intent of the registry is to block fraudulent calls before they can reach a consumer. With the FCC's permission, the Strike Force performed a trial of this concept. The trial was considered a success by the Strike Force and the FCC, reducing calls associated with one particular scam by about 90% in the third quarter of 2016. In November 2017, the FCC promulgated rules on the creation and use of the DNO Registry. The new rules explicitly allow service providers to block calls from two categories of number: (1) numbers that the subscriber has asked to be blocked, such as \"in-bound only\" numbers (numbers that should not ever originate a call), and (2) unassigned numbers, as the use of such a number indicates that the calling party is intending to defraud a consumer. Notwithstanding the efforts above, based on their long history, scammers appear determined to continue their attempts to defraud consumers. Robocalls make these efforts easier. The FTC asserts that law enforcement on its own cannot completely solve the problem of robocalls. Technological solutions, including robust call-blocking technology, likely will also be required. The DNO Registry, a technology solution that has been proven to significantly decrease robocalls, is supported by most stakeholders, but concerns remain with legitimate telemarketers who fear it may negatively impact them. The FCC intended to address these concerns in 2018. The impacts of the FTC initiatives on fraudulent robocalls, and the resulting impacts in the telemarketing industry, may continue to be oversight issues for Congress. In the 115th Congress, three hearings have been held, and 13 bills aimed at curtailing robocalls and protecting consumers have been introduced. Most of these bills are focused on the larger issue of spoofing, as well as curtailing robocalls for debt collection and politically oriented messages; two bills are aimed at protecting seniors from predatory robocalls intended to defraud them."
