    "content": "Saving Federal Dollars Through Better Use of Government Purchase and Travel Cards Act of 2016 This bill requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop a strategy to expand the use of data analytics in managing government purchase and travel charge card programs for the purpose of: identifying questionable transactions and developing enhanced tools and methods for agency use in identifying questionable transactions and recovering improper payments. Identifying potential opportunities for agencies to further leverage administrative process streamlining and cost reduction from purchase and travel card use. Developing a set of purchase and travel card metrics and benchmarks for high risk activities to assist agency purchase and travel card management and oversight activities. And developing a plan to create a library of analytics tools and data sources for use by agencies. The OMB must issue guidance on improving information sharing by government agencies, including by: (1) requiring relevant officials to identify and communicate information about high-risk activities. (2) requiring appropriate agency officials to review the reports issued by charge card-issuing banks on questionable transaction activity and suspicious timing or amounts of cash withdrawals or advances. And (3) providing for the appropriate sharing of information related to potential questionable transactions, fraud schemes, and high risk activities with GSA's Office of Charge Card Management and appropriate federal officials. The GSA and the OMB must establish a purchase and travel charge card data management group to develop and share best practices. The GSA shall report on further potential savings opportunities for government agencies under the federal charge card programs."
