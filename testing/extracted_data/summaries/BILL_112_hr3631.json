Directs the Administrator to give priority to grant applications that best: (1) preserve capabilities needed to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk to the United States, (2) preserve core capabilities developed through previous UASI grant allocations. (3) align with strategies and principles of the National Preparedness Goal, including the promotion of national preparedness. And (4) support capabilities that enhance regional catastrophic planning that could be used nationally through mutual aid agreements. Prohibits any one applicant from receiving more than 7 of the total amount authorized for such grant program."
