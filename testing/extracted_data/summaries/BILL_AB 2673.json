    "title": "AB 2673",
    "content": "Existing sales and use tax laws impose a tax on retailers measured by the gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property sold at retail in this state or on the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property purchased from a retailer for storage, use, or other consumption in this state. Existing law provides various exemptions from the taxes imposed by those laws. This bill, on and after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2030, would exempt from those taxes the gross receipts from the sale of, and the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of, hydrogen refueling station equipment, as defined, purchased by a recipient of a grant pursuant to the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program for the development of hydrogen refueling stations. The Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law authorizes counties and cities to impose local sales and use taxes in conformity with the Sales and Use Tax Law, and existing law authorizes districts, as specified, to impose transactions and use taxes in accordance with the Transactions and Use Tax Law, which generally conforms to the Sales and Use Tax Law. Amendments to state sales and use taxes are incorporated into these laws. Section 2230 of the Revenue and Taxation Code provides that the state will reimburse counties and cities for revenue losses caused by the enactment of sales and use tax exemptions. This bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2230 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse any local agencies for sales and use tax revenues lost by them pursuant to this bill. The Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law allow various credits against the taxes imposed by those laws. This bill would allow to a grant recipient described above a credit against those taxes for the taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, and before January 1, 2017, for an amount equal to the sum of the sales tax reimbursements or use taxes previously paid by a grant recipient for hydrogen refueling station equipment during the period from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2017, as provided. The bill would repeal these provisions as of December 1, 2017. This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."
