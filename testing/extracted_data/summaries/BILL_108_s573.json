Directs the Secretary to: (1) directly or through grants or contracts, establish a public education program to increase awareness about organ donation and the need to provide for an adequate rate of donations.

Authorizes the Secretary to make: (1) peer reviewed grants or contracts to public and nonprofit private entities for studies and demonstration projects to increase organ donation and recovery rates, including living donation. And (2) grants to States for organ donor awareness, public education and outreach activities, and programs designed to increase the number of organ donors within the State, including living donors.
