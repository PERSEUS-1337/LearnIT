    "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) is a factor in the nation's discussion about national energy security. As the largest single consumer of fuel in the United States, DOD has the potential to make important contributions to the national effort to reduce the use of and reliance on fossil fuel. Aviation fuel makes up the largest portion of fossil fuel consumed by DOD and therefore represents the area of greatest potential energy savings. This report examines DOD's use of aviation fuel and possibilities to reduce that use by examining related issues and presenting options Congress may choose to consider. Reducing DOD's consumption of aviation fuel could by itself significantly reduce the department's overall reliance on fossil fuel. In Fiscal Year 2005, DOD consumed roughly 125 million barrels of oil\u2014approximately 1.2% of the nation's total. About 74% of that was used to power mobility vehicles\u2014Air Force aircraft, Navy ships, and Army ground vehicles. Over half (roughly 52% ) was aviation fuel. (Note: aviation fuel is also used in \"non-aircraft\" systems such as tanks and generators in order to reduce logistics requirements on the battlefield. There are several ways in which DOD can reduce its use of fossil-based aviation fuel. Each has advantages and disadvantages and no single option provides the perfect solution. Advanced technologies, such as synthetic fuels, offer potential alternatives but further development and study are required before DOD can employ them on a large scale. DOD can also take measures to decrease its use of fuel. Possible options include upgrading aircraft engines and modifying operational procedures. Many of these measures, however, are costly and must compete for funding with other operational priorities. Congress also recognizes that DOD has a role to play in the nation's quest for alternative energy sources. Language contained in the FY2007 Defense Authorization and Appropriations Acts requires DOD to report to Congress on their actions to reduce consumption of fossil fuel, increase the energy efficiency of their weapon platforms, and explore the use of synthetic fuel made from coal. Additional proposed legislation would require DOD to further study coal as a fuel source and would remove certain DOD contracting restrictions viewed as a potential obstacle to synthetic fuel development. DOD has publically expressed its intention to devote resources to this issue; Air Force leadership has stated a goal of using domestically produced synthetic fuel for half of its domestic aviation fuel by 2016. At the present time, however, DOD does not seem to have a comprehensive long-term energy strategy or centralized leadership focused on energy issues for the department. This may affect the department's ability to achieve its long-term energy goals. This report will not be updated."
