    "content": "Credit unions, banks and thrifts (savings associations) are subject to numerous safety, soundness, and consumer protection laws and regulations. Since 2001, both the banking/thrift and the credit union industries have worked with Congress to develop legislative proposals that would reduce existing regulatory requirements and what are seen as the burdens compliance enforcement places on depository financial institutions. During the 109th Congress, legislation was enacted (P.L. 109-351; 120 Stat. 1966) that provided some of the changes sought by the industries. The statute reduced regulatory requirements for all types of depository financial institutions. Both the banking/thrift and credit union industries remain interested in the regulatory relief provisions excluded from the law. Current legislation, the Credit Union, Bank, and Thrift Regulatory Relief Act of 2008 (H.R. 6312), would provide additional steps towards obtaining the package of regulatory relief originally sought. The legislation moved quickly through the House. H.R. 6312 was introduced on June 19, 2008, and on June 24, 2008, the bill was considered under suspension of the rules and passed by the House. On June 25, 2008, the legislation was referred to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. This report will be updated as developments warrant."
