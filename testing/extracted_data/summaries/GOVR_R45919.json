    "content": "Ground electronic warfare (EW) is a group of programs directed by the Army and Marine Corp which are designed to effect ground forces use of the electromagnetic spectrum. The U.S. military has several ground EW programs that are used for different missions. These programs can broadly be categorized into counter-improvised explosive device (C-IED) systems, counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS), and communications and radar jammers. Over the past several years, senior leaders in the Army and Marine Corps have testified about the need to improve EW capabilities. Role of EW in Ground Operations EW is a component of modern warfare, particularly in response to threats posed by potential adversaries such as Russia and China. EW refers to operations that use the electromagnetic spectrum (i.e., the \"airwaves\") to detect, listen to, jam, and deceive (or \"spoof\") enemy radars, radio communication systems, data links, and other electronic systems. EW also refers to operations that defend against enemy attempts to do the same. Ground EW programs have gained importance in an era of \"great power competition.\" Countries like Russia and China have developed so-called anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) systems, some of which are designed to prevent U.S. military access to radio and satellite communications, and to deny the use of radars for artillery and air defense operations. Ground Forces EW Programs This report focuses on three categories of unclassified EW programs in the Army and Marine Corps, along with their respective programs and systems: C ounter -IED : the Thor and Duke Version III systems. C ounter -UAS : the Batelle Drone Defender, Blighter Counter-UAS system, the Mobile Expeditionary High Energy Laser, the Marine Air Defense Integrated System (MADIS), and the Compact Laser Weapons System (CLaWS). C ommunications and radar jammers : the EW Tactical Vehicle (EWTV), the EW Planning and Management Tool (EWPMT), the Communication Emitter Sensing and Attacking System II (CESAS II), and the Mobile EW Support System (MEWSS). Potential Oversight Issues for Congress Congress has continually shown interest in EW, and the decisions it makes regarding EW could affect future military capabilities and funding requirements. In particular, EW programs pose several potential issues for Congress: Is DOD's proposed mix of ground EW capabilities and investments appropriate? How do the Army and Marine Corps transition emerging technologies from demonstrations into programs, and are these programs funded adequately? What role might emerging technologies have in shaping current EW plans and programs?"
