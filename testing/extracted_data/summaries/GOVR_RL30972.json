    "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines brownfields as abandoned, idled, orunder-used industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicatedby real or perceived environmental contamination. The brownfields program was establishedadministratively by EPA under the aegis of the Superfund program; without explicit authority forit in the law, it has been financed by the Superfund appropriation. The program provides financialand technical assistance to help communities restore less seriously contaminated sites that have thepotential for economic development. A combination of potential environmental, economic andsocial benefits gives this program broad support among governments, environmentalists, developers,and communities. The program began in 1993 and has grown to include 398 brownfields assessment grants(most for $200,000 over 2 years); 151 grants of up to $350,000 (up to $1 million beginning inFY2001) to establish revolving loan funds to help finance the actual cleanups; 47 job training grants;and 28 Brownfields Showcase Communities where technical and financial assistance from 20participating federal agencies is being coordinated with state, local and non-governmental efforts. EPA also addressed some liability and cleanup issues affecting brownfields by changing itshazardous waste site tracking system, and issuing guidance clarifying the situations where it will notbring enforcement actions against brownfield property owners. FY1997 was the first year brownfields became a separate budgetary line item, at $37.7million. For FY2000 the appropriation was $91.7 million, in FY2001 the appropriation was $91.6million, and in FY2002 it is $97.7 million The 106th Congress extended the brownfields cleanup tax incentive to December 31, 2003,and expanded it to make all brownfields certified by a state environmental agency eligible for thetax break. The provision allows the costs of redeveloping brownfields to be deducted in the currentyear rather than being capitalized over a period of years. The administration favors making theprovision permanent. Congress passed H.R. 2869 on December 20, 2001, and the President signed iton January 11 ( P.L. 107-118 ). The act provides statutory authority to the brownfields program,authorizes funding at $250 million per year, and protects certain property owners from Superfundliability. Ten other bills have also been introduced. This report provides background on the issue (including state voluntary cleanup programs),surveys the Environmental Protection Agency's current program, and reviews congressional action,including a description of the new law. The report will be updated as events dictate. For additionalinformation on legislative activity, see CRS Issue Brief IB10078, Superfund and Brownfields in the107th Congress."
