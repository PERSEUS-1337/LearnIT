    "content": "Health Care Regulator Accountability Act - Amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to prohibit the federal government from making any health care plan available to Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), or any other federal executive agency employees responsible for the administration of the Act except a health plan created under it or offered through an American Health Benefit Exchange. Prohibits the Secretary of HHS, the IRS Director, and the head of any other agency involved in promulgating rules or regulations to carry out or to enforce PPACA, or any amendments made by it, from obligating or expending, in any fiscal year, more than 90 of the funds made available for the salaries and expenses of their offices unless those regulations are promulgated and take effect before the fiscal year's close. Requires rescission of any amounts which remain precluded from obligation or expenditure on that last day of the fiscal year."
