Specifies that: (1) a hearing to consider final approval of a proposed settlement may not be held earlier than 120 days after such notice is served. (2) a class member may refuse to comply with, and may choose not to be bound by, a settlement agreement or consent decree in such a lawsuit if the class member resides in a State whose attorney general has not been provided such notice. And (3) any court order certifying a class or approving a proposed settlement in a class action and any written opinions concerning such court orders and decrees shall be made available for publication in official court reporters and electronic legal databases. Directs any court with jurisdiction over a class action in which the plaintiff is a class to require that: (1) any written notice provided to the class through the mail or publication in printed media contain a short summary written in plain, easily understood language describing the subject matter of the class action, the legal consequences of joining such action, and specified other information. And (2) any notice provided through television or radio to inform the class of its rights to be excluded from a class action or a proposed settlement indicate and explain in plain, easily understood language the individuals that may potentially become class members and that the failure of individuals to exercise their right to be excluded will result in the individual's inclusion in the class action."
