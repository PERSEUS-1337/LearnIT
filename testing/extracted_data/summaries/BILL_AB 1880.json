    "title": "AB 1880",
    "content": "Existing law requires the Department of General Services to provide planning, acquisition, construction, and maintenance of state buildings and property, and maintain a statewide property inventory of all real property held by the state. This bill would authorize the Director of General Services to revert a specified parcel of state real property to the City of San Buenaventura pursuant to these provisions. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City of San Buenaventura. Under existing law, the meetings of school district governing boards are subject to the provisions of the Ralph M. Brown Act, which generally requires that the meetings of the governing boards of local agencies be open to the public with proper notice given, permit the recording of those meetings, prohibit legislative bodies from taking action by secret ballot and set forth other specific requirements for the conduct of those meetings. Existing law exempts the meetings of specified schoolsite councils and committees from the Ralph M. Brown Act and the Bagley-Keen Open Meeting Act, but still requires properly noticed public meetings with posted agendas. This bill would delete obsolete statutory references from this provision and would correct references to certain parent advisory committees that fall within this exemption. The bill would also make nonsubstantive changes."
