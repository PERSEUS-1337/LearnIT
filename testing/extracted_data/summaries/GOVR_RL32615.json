    "content": "Pakistan is a strategically important country and home to one of the world's largest Muslimpopulations. In October 1999, Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff Gen. Pervez Musharraf replaced PrimeMinister Nawaz Sharif in a bloodless coup. Following the military overthrow of an electedgovernment, Islamabad faced considerable international opprobrium and was subjected to automaticcoup-related U.S. sanctions. The September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States andMusharraf's ensuing withdrawal of support for the Afghan Taliban regime, however, had the effectof greatly reducing Pakistan's international isolation. Congress temporarily removed restrictions,and large-scale U.S. aid to the country resumed, in late 2001. The United States views Pakistan asa vital ally in the international anti-terrorism coalition. The Bush Administration refrains fromexpressing any significant public criticisms of Pakistan's internal political practices, while stillasserting that the strengthening of civilian political institutions in Islamabad is \"a requirement forthe development of a stable, moderate Islamic state.\" While top-tier U.S. emphases in the region after September 2001 remain combating religiousextremism and ending illicit weapons proliferation, the United States expresses a strong interest inthe improvement of Pakistan's human rights situation, especially as regards the restoration andstrengthening of democratic institutions. There is a debate among analysts over the exigency of thisissue. Some observers urge patience, contending that a \"true\" democratic system will require timeand that \"military-guided\" governance is required in an unstable setting and to deter extremistpolitical influences. Others argue that Pakistan's underdeveloped democracy and rule of law arethemselves a central cause of the country's instability. October 2002 general elections nominally fulfilled President Musharraf's promise to restorethe National Assembly that was dissolved after his extra-constitutional seizure of power. Apro-military alliance won a plurality of seats while a coalition of Islamist parties made a surprisinglystrong showing. Yet subsequent developments -- including an agreement between Musharraf andthe Islamist opposition to bring controversial constitutional changes before Parliament, a brokenpromise from Musharraf to resign his military commission before 2005, and widespread accusationsof rigging in August 2005 municipal elections -- have fueled concerns that Pakistan's civiliandemocratic institutions are being weakened. National and provincial level elections are to take placein 2007. The 9/11 Commission Report called Musharraf's government the \"best hope\" for stability inPakistan and Afghanistan, and recommended the provision of long-term and comprehensive supportto Pakistan so long as its government remains committed to combating extremism and to a policyof \"enlightened moderation.\" In passing the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ), Congress broadly endorsed this recommendation and sought to encouragePakistan's transition to full democracy. The act also extended the President's authority to waivecoup-related sanctions on Pakistan through FY2006.
