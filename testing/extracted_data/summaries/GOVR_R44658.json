    "content": "This report is part of a suite of reports that discuss appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2017. It specifically discusses appropriations for the components of DHS included in the fourth title of the homeland security appropriations bill\u2014in past years, this has comprised U.S. Citizenship and Naturalization Services, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, the Science and Technology Directorate, and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO). In FY2017, the Administration proposed moving the Domestic Nuclear Detection office into a new Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives Office, along with several other parts of DHS. Congress has labeled this title of the bill in recent years as \"Research and Development, Training, and Services.\" The report provides an overview of the Administration's FY2017 request for these components, and the appropriations proposed by the Senate and House appropriations committees in response. Rather than limiting the scope of its review to the fourth title of the bills, the report includes information on provisions throughout the bills and report that directly affect these components. Research and Development, Training, and Services is the second smallest of the four titles that carry the bulk of the funding in the bill. The Administration requested $1.63 billion for these components in FY2017, $133 million (8.9%) more than was provided for FY2016. The amount requested for these components is 3.4% of the Administration's $47.7 billion request for net discretionary budget authority and disaster relief funding for DHS. Contributing to the increase in the request was its proposal to consolidate several parts of DHS funded in other titles with DNDO into a new Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives Office, funded in Title IV. Senate Appropriations Committee-reported S. 3001 would have provided the components included in this title $1.50 billion in net discretionary budget authority. This would have been $132 million (8.1%) less than requested, and less than $1 million (<0.1%) more than was provided in FY2016. House Appropriations Committee-reported H.R. 5634 would have provided the components included in this title $1.63 billion in net discretionary budget authority. This would have been $1 million (0.1%) more than requested, and $134 million (9.0%) more than was provided in FY2016. On September 29, 2016, the President signed into law P.L. 114-223, which contained a continuing resolution that funds the government at the same rate of operations as FY2016, minus 0.496% through December 9, 2017. A second continuing resolution was signed into law on December 10, 2016 (P.L. 114-254), funding the government at the same rate of operations as FY2016, minus 0.1901%, through April 28, 2017. For details on the continuing resolution and its impact on DHS, see CRS Report R44621, Department of Homeland Security Appropriations: FY2017, which also includes additional information on the broader subject of FY2017 funding for DHS as well as links to analytical overviews and details regarding components in other titles. This report will be updated once the annual appropriations process for DHS for FY2017 is concluded."
