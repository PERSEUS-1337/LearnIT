    "content": "The Congressional Review Act (CRA) establishes expedited procedures for Congress to disapprove regulations issued by Federal agencies. Disapproval under these procedures requires enactment of a joint resolution that has a specified text and is submitted within 60 days (excluding recesses) after Congress receives the regulation. For these disapproval resolutions, the act provides expedited procedures for Senate consideration and to clear the measure for Presidential action. If the resolution becomes law, the rule not only becomes of no force and effect, but is treated as if it had never taken effect, and the issuing agency may issue no \"substantially similar\" rule without subsequent authorization by law. If vetoed, a disapproval resolution can become law only if Congress overrides the veto. For regulations submitted 60 or fewer session days before a sine die adjournment, however, the CRA provides a further 60-day period for submitting disapproval regulations, starting on the 15th session day of the next session. Interest has arisen in using the CRA in this way in the 111th Congress to disapprove regulations issued late in the Bush Administration. Using the CRA in this way for numerous regulations, however, could consume large amounts of floor time. The question has accordingly been raised whether the CRA permits multiple disapproval resolutions to be \"bundled,\" or consolidated into a single measure. Congress could always overturn regulations through a consolidated measure under its general legislative powers. Even if such a consolidated measure was submitted during the required time period, however, it would not have the text required by the CRA, which permits the statement only of a single disapproval. If enacted, as a result, it would not have the special effects for which the act provides. A consolidated measure, nevertheless, could include provisions specifying that the component disapproval provisions have the same effects as if they were separate disapproval resolutions enacted pursuant to the CRA. Any consolidated measure also would not be eligible for the expedited procedures provided in the CRA. In the Senate, as a result, its approval might be possible only by constructing it to include provisions that could attract sufficient support to invoke cloture. If the Senate could dispose of some disapprovals in this way, moreover, it might be able to deal with others through individual disapproval resolutions under the expedited procedure, especially by persistent use of its provisions for limiting debate by majority vote. In the House, a special rule could limit debate and amendment of a consolidated measure. Alternatively, a single special rule might provide for limited and consolidated debate on a group of individual disapproval resolutions. House rules protecting the motion to recommit would require final action on each resolution to be separate. If each chamber agreed to some disapprovals in a consolidated measure and others in separate resolutions under the CRA, the two chambers would have to resolve differences between the consolidated measures under their general rules. Either chamber might also provide for routine passage, when received, of any separate disapproval resolution of the other that corresponded to a provision in its own consolidated measure. The House might provide for this treatment of Senate disapproval resolutions, through a provision in its special rule for considering its consolidated measure, more easily than could the Senate for those of the House. No update of this report is planned."
