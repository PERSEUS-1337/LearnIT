    "content": "Smallpox, which kills approximately 30% of its victims, is estimated to have killedbetween 300 and 500 millionpeople in the twentieth century before the World Health Organization's successful eradication program. Thesmallpox vaccine is effective at preventingsmallpox but has a higher complication rate than any other currently used vaccine. The terrorist attacks of 2001have increased fears that smallpox might beused as a weapon of terror. Smallpox has several properties that might make it desirable by terrorists, such ascontagiousness and high lethality. These factorsand its limited availability also make it difficult for a terrorist to use. Most experts agree that it is very unlikely thatsmallpox will be used as a weapon, but thehigh consequences of a successful attack have prompted exploration of methods to counter this threat.
