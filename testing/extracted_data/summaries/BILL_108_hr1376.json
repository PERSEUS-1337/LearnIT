And (2) the debt cancellation under such Initiative not be conditioned on any agreement by an impoverished country to implement or comply with policies that deepen poverty or degrade the environment, or that implement user fees on primary education or primary health care, increase the cost to consumers with incomes of less than $2.00 per day for access to clean drinking water, or that undermine internationally recognized worker rights. Makes ineligible for debt relief any country that: (1) supports international terrorism, (2) engages in gross violations of internationally recognized human rights. Or (3) has been designated as a Tier 3 nation pursuant to the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 for its failure to cooperate on international trafficking in persons prevention efforts. Conditions debt cancellation upon the country's agreeing to ensure that the financial benefits of such debt relief are applied to programs to combat poverty and to redress environmental degradation. Amends certain Federal laws to prohibit the provision of foreign assistance or the transfer of certain weapons and technology to countries that fail to cooperate with the United States on efforts to combat international terrorism. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on options to expand debt relief to non-HIPC countries."
