    "content": "Most of the civilian federal workforce is covered by one of two retirement systems: (1) the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) for individuals hired before 1984 or (2) the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) for individuals hired in 1984 or later. FERS annuities are fully funded by the sum of employee and employer contributions and interest earned by the Treasury bonds held by the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF). The federal government makes supplemental payments into the CSRDF on behalf of employees covered by the CSRS because employee and agency contributions and interest earnings do not meet the full cost of the benefits earned by employees covered by that system. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in its FY2020 Budget, estimated that in FY2019, obligations from the CSRDF would total $88.4 billion, of which $87.9 billion will represent annuity payments to retirees and survivors. Other outlays consist of refunds, payments to estates, and administrative expenses. Obligations from the fund are projected to increase by 3.7% to $91.7 billion in FY2020, of which $91.3 billion will represent annuity payments. OPM estimated that receipts to the CSRDF from all sources would be $104.4 billion in FY2019 and $108.8 billion in FY2020. The year-end balance of the CSRDF was projected to increase from $915.3 billion at the end of FY2018 to $931.4 billion at the end of FY2019. According to the most recent reporting from the Office of Personnel Management, the total annual income of the CSRDF will increase from $124.9 billion in FY2018 to an estimated $151.0 billion in FY2025 and to $759.9 billion in FY2090. The total expenses of the fund are projected to rise more slowly, increasing from $85.8 billion in FY2018 to an estimated $104.9 billion in FY2025 and to $506.6 billion in FY2090. Consequently, the assets held by the CSRDF also are projected to increase steadily, rising from $947.8 billion in FY2018 to an estimated $1.2 trillion in FY2025 and $10.6 trillion in FY2090. Expenditures from the CSRDF currently are about 40% as large as federal expenditures for the salaries and wages paid to federal employees. Pension expenditures are projected to decline relative to the government's wage and salary expenses, beginning around FY2020. By FY2090, the expenditures of the CSRDF are estimated to be only about 32% as large as the government's expenditures for wage and salary payments to employees. Because CSRS retirement benefits have never been fully funded by employer and employee contributions, the CSRDF has an unfunded liability. The total unfunded liability of the CSRDF was $968.1 billion in FY2017. According to actuarial estimates, the unfunded liability of the CSRDF has already peaked, will steadily decline, and is projected to be eliminated by FY2085. Actuarial estimates indicate that the unfunded liability of the CSRS does not pose a threat to the solvency of the trust fund. There is no point over the next 80 years at which the assets of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund are projected to run out."
