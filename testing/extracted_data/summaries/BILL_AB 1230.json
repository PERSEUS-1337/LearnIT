    "title": "AB 1230",
    "content": "Existing law provides various programs to expand access to persons with disabilities and promote compliance with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Existing law establishes the Capital Access Loan Program, which is administered by the California Pollution Control Financing Authority (authority) to assist small businesses to finance the costs of complying with environmental mandates and the remediation of contamination on their properties. This bill would establish the California Americans with Disabilities Act Small Business Capital Access Loan Program within the Capital Access Loan Program, to create a self-sustaining program to provide loans to assist small businesses in financing the costs of projects that alter or retrofit existing small business facilities, meeting specified criteria, to comply with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. This bill would authorize the authority to administer the program, including adopting regulations, and controlling funds appropriated for the program, as specified. This bill would establish the California Americans with Disabilities Act Small Business Capital Access Loan Program Fund, as a continuously appropriated fund, and require the authority to use the fund for all its purposes. This bill would also transfer $10,000,000 from the General Fund to the California Americans with Disabilities Act Small Business Capital Access Loan Program Fund."
