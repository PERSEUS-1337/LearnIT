    "title": "AB 509",
    "content": "Existing law, the California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009, provides, among other things, for student protections and regulatory oversight of private postsecondary institutions in the state. The act is enforced by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education within the Department of Consumer Affairs. The act exempts an institution from its provisions, if any of a list of specific criteria are met. This bill would exempt from the provisions of the act a bona fide organization, association, or council that offers preapprenticeship training programs on behalf of one or more labor-management apprenticeship programs that are approved by the Division of Apprenticeship Standards if the organization, association, or council satisfies specified requirements."
