    "content": "Promoting Care for the Frail Elderly Act of 2002 - Amends part C (MedicareChoice) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to revise the risk adjustment methodology applicable to payments to MedicareChoice organizations offering, whether directly or under a contract, specialized programs for frail elderly or at-risk beneficiaries to take into account variations in costs incurred by such organizations. Provides for interim continuation of the following until the revised risk adjustment methodology required above is implemented by the Secretary: (1) blended rate for specialized programs for frail elderly and at-risk Medicare beneficiaries residing in institutions. And (2) payment methodologies for Medicare demonstration programs for specialized programs for frail elderly or at-risk beneficiaries. Directs the Secretary to establish a five-year demonstration program to develop and evaluate: (1) payment models that pay appropriately for specialized MedicareChoice plans that exclusively serve, or serve a disproportionate number of, frail elderly or at-risk beneficiaries. And (2) clinical models that improve outcomes. Requires the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MEDPAC) to study and report to Congress and the Secretary on the feasibility and advisability of establishing a frailty adjustment to the MedicareChoice risk adjustment methodology that ensures that an appropriate level of payment is made to MedicareChoice plans that serve a disproportionate number of frail or at-risk beneficiaries."
