    "content": "This report provides a list of selected health-related programs and activities under specified titles of the Social Security Act (SSA), including the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant (Title V), General Provisions, Peer Review, and Administrative Simplification (Title XI), Medicare (Title XVIII), Medicaid (Title XIX), and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP; Title XXI); the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148, as amended); as well as selected provisions from the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) that are scheduled to terminate during the first session of the 114th Congress (i.e., by December 31, 2015). This report includes only those health care-related expiring provisions for which congressional action would be needed to extend the application of a provision once the expiration date is reached, and it does not include demonstration projects or pilot programs. Although the Congressional Research Service (CRS) has attempted to be comprehensive, CRS cannot guarantee that every relevant provision is included here. The report defines what constitutes an expiring provision, clarifies which issues do not meet the definition of an expiring provision, lists the legislative history of each of the programs and policies that are due to expire before the end of the first session of the 114th Congress, and includes future deadlines, when applicable, for those programs and policies. The historical legislative actions that created, modified, or extended the expiring provisions covered in this report are also summarized. Expiring provisions are organized by SSA section, ACA section, or PHSA title and section, as appropriate. The last part of the report includes provisions with expiration dates in 2013 that were not extended in any subsequent legislation. The main body of the text also includes a number of provisions that expired in 2014."
