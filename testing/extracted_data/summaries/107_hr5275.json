    "content": "External Regulation of the Department of Energy Act - Eliminates Department of Energy (DOE) regulatory or enforcement authority at any nonmilitary DOE energy laboratory in connection with responsibilities for nuclear safety and for occupational safety and health that are granted under this Act to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Authorizes the NRC to regulate through licensing and certification both the DOE and DOE contractors. Holds a contractor operating a DOE nonmilitary energy laboratory harmless from facility decommissioning costs or from any violation of NRC decommissioning requirements if such violation results from DOE failure to authorize or fund decommissioning activities. States OSHA and the NRC both share regulatory and enforcement responsibilities regarding a hazard at a nonmilitary DOE energy laboratory that presents a risk of occupational exposure and contains both a radiological and non-radiological component."
