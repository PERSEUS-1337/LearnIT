    "title": "SB 687",
    "content": "The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 establishes the State Air Resources Board as the state agency responsible for monitoring and regulating sources emitting greenhouse gases. The act requires the state board to adopt regulations to require the reporting and verification of statewide greenhouse gas emissions and to monitor and enforce compliance with this program. The act requires the state board to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit, as defined, to be achieved by 2020, equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990. The state board is required to adopt rules and regulations in an open public process to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective greenhouse gas emission reductions. The act authorizes the state board to adopt market-based compliance mechanisms, as defined, meeting specified requirements. Existing law requires the state board to complete a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, as defined, in the state. Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including gas corporations. Existing law requires the commission to adopt policies and programs that promote the in-state production and distribution of biomethane, as defined, that facilitate the development of a variety of sources of in-state biomethane. Existing law requires the commission to adopt pipeline access rules that ensure that each gas corporation provides nondiscriminatory open access to its gas pipeline system to any party for the purposes of physically interconnecting with the gas pipeline system and effectuating the delivery of gas. The Warren-Alquist State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Act establishes the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission and requires it to prepare an integrated energy policy report on or before November 1, 2003, and every 2 years thereafter. The act requires the report to contain an overview of major energy trends and issues facing the state, including, but not limited to, supply, demand, pricing, reliability, efficiency, and impacts on public health and safety, the economy, resources, and the environment. Existing law requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to hold public hearings to identify impediments that limit procurement of biomethane in California, including, but not limited to, impediments to interconnection and to offer solutions to those impediments as part of the integrated energy policy report. This bill would require the state board, on or before June 30, 2016, 2017, in consultation with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission and the Public Utilities Commission, to adopt a carbon-based renewable gas standard, as defined and specified, that requires all gas sellers, as defined, to provide specified percentages of renewable gas meeting certain deliverability requirements, to retail end-use customers for use in California, that increases over specified compliance periods. The bill would authorize the state board to waive enforcement of the renewable gas standard upon certain showings being made by a gas seller. The bill would require the state board, on or before January 1, 2017, to issue an analysis of the lifecycle emissions of greenhouse gases and reductions for different biogas types and end uses. The bill would require the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to provide the state board and the Legislature with an assessment of specified matter pertaining to renewable gas by January 1, 2018."
