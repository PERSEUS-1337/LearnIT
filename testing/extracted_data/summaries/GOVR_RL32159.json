    "content": "This report is intended for Members and staff assisting grant seekers in districts and states and covers writing proposals for both government and private foundation grants. In preparation for writing a proposal, the report first discusses preliminary information gathering and preparation, developing ideas for the proposal, gathering community support, identifying funding resources, and seeking preliminary review of the proposal and support of relevant administrative officials. The second section of the report covers the actual writing of the proposal, from outlining of project goals, stating the purpose and objectives of the proposal, explaining the program methods to solve the stated problem, and how the results of the project will be evaluated, to long-term project planning, and, finally, developing the proposal budget. The last section of the report provides a listing of free grants-writing websites, including guidelines from the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance and the Foundation Center's \"Introduction to Proposal Writing.\" Related CRS reports are CRS Report RL34035, Grants Work in a Congressional Office, by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed], and CRS Report RL34012, Resources for Grantseekers, by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed].
