    "content": "As the largest and one of the most influential countries in Latin America, Brazil has emergedas a leading voice for developing countries in setting regional and multilateral trade agendas. TheUnited States and Brazil have cultivated a constructive relationship in pursuit of their respectiveefforts to promote trade liberalization, including attempting to broker a compromise with theEuropean Union in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha Round and forming bilateralworking groups on trade (and other) issues. Still, they approach trade policy quite differently, areat odds over how to proceed regionally with the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), and shareconcerns over specific trade policies and practices. Brazil's trade strategy can be explained only in part by economic incentives. Its \"tradepreferences\" also reflect deeply embedded macroeconomic, industrial, and foreign policies. WhereasU.S. trade strategy emphasizes the negotiation of comprehensive trade agreements on multiple fronts,Brazil is focused primarily on market access issues as they pertain to its economic dominance inSouth America. Brazil exercises this priority in all trade arenas, such as pursuing changes toagricultural policies in the WTO, expanding the Southern Common Market (Mercosul) in SouthAmerica, and resisting the FTAA for lack of a balance conducive to Brazilian interests. Brazil has a modern, diversified economy in which services account for 53% of GDP,followed by industry and manufacturing at 37%, and agriculture at 9%. Agribusiness (commodityand processed goods) account for some 30% of GDP, explaining Brazil's emphasis on agriculturalpolicies in trade negotiations. Brazil is the world's largest producer of sugar cane, oranges, andcoffee, and the second largest of soybean, beef, poultry, and corn. It is also a major producer of steel,aircraft, automobiles, and auto parts, yet surprisingly, a relatively small trader by world standards. The United States is Brazil's largest single-country trading partner. Brazil is critical of U.S. trade policies such as the Byrd Amendment (repealed, but programin effect until October 1, 2007), which directs duties from trade remedy cases to affected industries,the administration of trade remedy rules, and what it considers to be discriminatory treatment in theU.S. expansion of free trade agreements in Latin America. It also objects to product-specific barrierssuch as tariff rate quotas on sugar, orange juice, ethanol, and tobacco; subsidies for cotton, ethanol,and soybeans; and prolonged antidumping orders on steel and orange juice. U.S. concerns focus onBrazil's comparatively high tariff structure, especially on industrial goods, Mercosul's commonexternal tariff program, and Brazil's refusal to address issues of critical importance to the UnitedStates such as services trade, intellectual property rights, government procurement, and investment. Despite these differences, both countries recognize the potential for important gains to be hadfrom mutually acceptable trade liberalization at all levels. As a developing country with anopportunity for considerable growth in both exports and imports, however, Brazil may have the mostto gain from addressing both foreign barriers to its trade, and unilaterally opening its economyfurther."
