    "content": "Every year, communities in the United States are affected by disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanoes, floods, wildfires, and winter storms. After a disaster, when a region turns its attention to rebuilding, one of the greatest challenges often involves properly managing disaster-related debris. Disaster debris typically includes soils and sediments, vegetation (trees, limbs, shrubs), municipal solid waste (common household garbage, personal belongings), construction and demolition debris (in some instances, entire residential structures and all their contents), vehicles, food waste, \"white goods\" (refrigerators, freezers, air conditioners), and household hazardous waste(cleaning agents, pesticides, pool chemicals). Each type of waste may contain or be contaminated with toxic or hazardous constituents. In the short term, debris removal is necessary to facilitate the recovery of a geographic area. In the long term, the methods by which these wastes are managed requires proper consideration to ensure that their management (e.g., by landfilling) will not pose future threats to human health or the environment. Under a number of different conditions and authorities, several agencies may provide debris removal assistance to communities affected by a disaster. For example, under certain conditions, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides funding for disaster debris removal and/or approves direct federal assistance to certain entities that do not have the capability to respond to a disaster. Also, under certain conditions, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may assist communities with debris removal activities. For example, the Corps may perform right-of-way clearance, curbside waste pickup, private property debris removal, and property demolition, and EPA may help coordinate the collection and management of contaminated debris and household hazardous wastes. This report focuses on the requirements applicable to disaster debris management and the challenges that communities face when attempting to manage it both quickly and safely. This report also provides an overview of the types of support provided by FEMA, the Corps, and EPA with respect to disaster debris removal. A discussion of the programs or statutory authorities under which that support may be provided is beyond the scope of this report. There are a number of conditions under which federal agencies may support communities with disaster debris removal. With respect to FEMA's involvement in debris removal assistance, this report focuses on support that may be provided after the President declares the incident to involve a \"major disaster\" under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act, P.L. 93-288, as amended)."
