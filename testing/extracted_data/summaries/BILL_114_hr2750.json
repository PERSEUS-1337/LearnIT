    "content": "Improved Security Vetting for Aviation Workers Act of 2015 This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 todirect the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), by December 31, 2015, in coordination with the DHS Assistant Secretary for Policy, to request from the Director of National Intelligence access to additional data from the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment data and any or other terrorism-related information to improve the effectiveness of TSA's credential vetting program for individuals with unescorted access to sensitive areas of airports. The TSA, by the same deadline, shall: issue guidance for Transportation Security Inspectors to review annually airport badging office procedures for applicants seeking access to sensitive airport areas, including a comprehensive review of applicants' Criminal History Records Check and work authorization documentation during the course of an inspection. Issue guidance to airports requiring that all federalized airport badging authorities place an expiration date on airport credentials commensurate with the period of time during which an individual is lawfully authorized to work in the United States. And review the denial of credentials owing to an applicants's lawful status in order to identify airports with specific weaknesses and coordinate with them to address such weaknesses. The TSA may conduct a Rap Back Service pilot program, in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), to determine the feasibility of full implementation of a service through which the TSA would be notified of a change in status of an individual holding a valid credential granting unescorted access to sensitive airport areas across eligible TSA-regulated populations. Certain pilot program procedures are prescribed regarding notification only of a change with respect to a disqualifying offense under the credential vetting program. The TSA, within 60 days after enactment of this Act, shall report to Congress on the status of plans to conduct the Rap Back Service pilot program."
