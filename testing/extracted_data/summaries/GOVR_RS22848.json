    "content": "On May 29, 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a rule intended to establish control over the use and misuse of intergovernmental transfers in financing the states' shares of Medicaid costs. The rule clarifies the types of intergovernmental transfers of funds allowable for financing a portion of Medicaid costs, imposes a limit on Medicaid reimbursements for government-owned hospitals and other institutional providers, and requires certain providers to retain all of their Medicaid reimbursements. In addition, the rule would establish documentation requirements to substantiate that a governmental entity is making a certified public expenditure (CPE) when contributing to the state share of Medicaid. The rule has raised considerable concern among states and health care providers that its impact on Medicaid services, providers, and beneficiaries could be severe. In response, Congress placed a moratorium on the implementation of its provisions. The moratorium was recently extended until April 1, 2009. Further, in May of 2008, a federal judge ruled, in a lawsuit brought by a coalition of provider groups, that the rule was \"improperly promulgated\" and vacated the rule, and remanded the matter back to the agency. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5) includes a Sense of the Congress that the Secretary of Health and Human Services should not promulgate a final rule on cost limits on public providers."
