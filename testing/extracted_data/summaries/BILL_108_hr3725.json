    "content": "Egyptian Counterterrorism and Political Reform Act - Prohibits military assistance to Egypt unless the President determines and certifies to Congress that it is in the national security interests to provide assistance for a given fiscal year. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) funds that would have been provided for military assistance should be given in the form of economic support fund assistance and not used by the armed forces of Egypt. (2) the President should certify the establishment of procedures to ensure access by the Comptroller General to appropriate financial information in order to review the use of these funds. And (3) the agreement among the United States, Egypt, and Israel to decrease the overall amount of US foreign assistance for both countries should continue."
