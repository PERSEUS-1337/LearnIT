    "content": "This report describes actions taken by the Administration and Congress to provide FY2017 appropriations for the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) accounts. It also provides an overview of FY2016 appropriations for agencies and bureaus funded as part of annual CJS appropriations. Division B of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113), provided $66.000 billion for CJS, which included $9.246 billion for the Department of Commerce, $29.090 billion for the Department of Justice (DOJ), $26.754 billion for the science agencies, and $910 million for the related agencies (e.g., the Legal Service Corporation and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative). For FY2017, the Obama Administration requested a total of $67.573 billion for CJS, which included $9.728 billion for the Department of Commerce, $29.828 billion for DOJ, $26.995 billion for the science agencies, and $1.022 billion for the related agencies. The Obama Administration proposed supplementing discretionary appropriations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) with $763 million and $400 million, respectively, in new one-time mandatory funding. On April 21, 2016, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported their FY2017 CJS appropriations bill (S. 2837). The bill would have provided a total of $66.309 billion for CJS, including $9.316 billion for the Department of Commerce, $29.246 billion for the Department of Justice, $26.821 billion for the science agencies, and $925 million for the related agencies. On June 7, 2016, the House Committee on Appropriations reported their FY2017 CJS appropriations bill (H.R. 5393). The bill would have provided a total of $66.296 billion for CJS, including $9.051 billion for the Department of Commerce, $29.437 billion for the Department of Justice, $26.920 billion for the science agencies, and $887 million for the related agencies. On May 5, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31). The act provides a total of $66.360 billion (which includes $109 million in emergency funding) for CJS. Under the act, the Department of Commerce receives $9.237 billion, the Department of Justice receives $28.962 billion, the science agencies receive $27.240 billion, and the related agencies receive $921 million. Over the past 10 fiscal years, nominal appropriations for CJS have experienced annual increases and decreases. CJS appropriations increased from FY2007 to FY2010, but generally declined from FY2010 to FY2013. Nominal appropriations for CJS were relatively flat in FY2014 and FY2015. CJS appropriations increased again by approximately $4 billion from FY2015 to FY2016, largely due to Congress increasing the discretionary budget cap in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-74). Increases in CJS appropriations in FY2009 and FY2010 were largely the result of Congress appropriating more funding for Commerce to support the 2010 decennial census. Although subsequent decreases in appropriations for Commerce account for much of the overall decrease in CJS appropriations between FY2010 and FY2013, cuts in funding for DOJ and NASA and sequestration in FY2013 also contributed to the decrease. The exception the trend of decreasing appropriations from FY2010 to FY2013 was the NSF. The NSF's appropriations generally increased each fiscal year since FY2007. Appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice and for NASA have generally increased each fiscal year since FY2013."
