    "title": "SB 997",
    "content": "Existing law prohibits the acknowledgment of an instrument from being taken unless the officer taking it has \u201csatisfactory evidence\u201d that the person making the acknowledgment is the individual who is described in and who executed the instrument. Under existing law, \u201csatisfactory evidence\u201d means the absence of information, evidence, or other circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the person making the acknowledgment is not the individual he or she claims to be and, among other things, he or she presents a specified document that is either current or issued within 5 years that contains a photograph and description of the person named on it, the signature of the person, and a serial or other identifying number, as provided. This bill would add an identification card issued by a federally recognized tribal government to the list of documents acceptable for identification purposes. This bill would also incorporate changes to Section 1185 of the Civil Code proposed by both this bill and AB 2566, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and this bill is enacted last."
