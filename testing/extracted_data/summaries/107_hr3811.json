    "content": "Health Information Independence Act of 2001 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to extend certain food nutrition labeling requirements to dietary supplements. Requires nutrition labels to include the relationship of a nutrient to the prevention, treatment or cure of a disease. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to solicit Independent Scientific Reviewers from the university community to review, evaluate, and make recommendations on a particular nutrient-disease association, based on the scientific evidence available. Excludes health claims only if they are unsupported by credible scientific evidence and no disclaimer could eliminate potentially misleading connotations. Makes recommendations of Reviewers binding on the Secretary and reviewable only by the US Court of Appeals for D. C. Requires costs of this program to be offset against the operating budget of the Department of Health and Human Services."
