    "content": "Real Interstate Driver Equity Act of 2001 - Amends Federal transportation law to prohibit a State or political subdivision or an interstate agency of two or more States from enacting or enforcing any law, rule, or regulation requiring a license or fee on account of the fact that a motor vehicle is providing pre-arranged ground transportation service, if the motor carrier providing such service: (1) meets all applicable registration and vehicle and intrastate passenger licensing requirements. And (2) is providing such service, including intermediate stops in another State without taking on new passengers, pursuant to a contract for interstate and intrastate passenger travel. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed as: (1) subjecting taxicab service to Federal regulation. (2) prohibiting or restricting an airport, train, or bus terminal operator from contracting to provide preferential access or facilities to one or more providers of pre-arranged ground transportation service. Or (3) restricting the right of a State to require, in a nondiscriminatory manner, an individual operating a vehicle providing prearranged ground transportation service originating in the State to have submitted to pre-licensing drug testing or a criminal background investigation in the operator's domicile State, by the State in which the operator is licensed to provide the service, or by the motor carrier providing it, as a condition of providing such service."
