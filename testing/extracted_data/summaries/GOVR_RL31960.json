    "content": "Four and a half months after announcing his decision to vaccinate military personnel and front-line civilian health workers against smallpox, President George W. Bush, on April 30, 2003, signedthe Smallpox Emergency Personnel Protection Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-20 ). Under the new law, thefederal government will provide -- to eligible individuals (or their survivors), for covered injuries-- payment for related medical care, lost employment income, and death benefits. Compensation had emerged as a major obstacle to the successful implementation of the Administration's smallpox vaccination program. Worker groups, public health experts, and otherscited the lack of a clear and comprehensive compensation program as a primary reason for the lowerthan expected volunteer vaccination rate among health care workers. The enacted legislation is modeled after the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program. It provides for compensation of individuals injured by vaccinations given as part of a countermeasureplan declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in preparation for potential hostileactivities involving the smallpox virus. This report will be updated as warranted."
