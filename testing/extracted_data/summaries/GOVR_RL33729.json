    "content": "Reports issued by committees of the 109th Congress, the White House, federal offices of Inspector General, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), among others, concluded that the losses caused by Hurricane Katrina were due, in part, to deficiencies such as questionable leadership decisions and capabilities, organizational failures, overwhelmed preparation and communication systems, and inadequate statutory authorities. As a result, the 109th Congress revised federal emergency management policies vested in the President; reorganized the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); and enhanced and clarified the mission, functions, and authorities of the agency, as well as those of its parent, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Six statutes enacted by the 109th Congress are notable in that they contain changes that apply to future federal emergency management actions. These public laws include the following: Title VI of P.L. 109-295 (H.R. 5441), the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, referred to in this report as the Post-Katrina Act; Sections of P.L. 109-347 (H.R. 4954), the Security and Accountability for Every Port Act of 2005, known as the SAFE Port Act; P.L. 109-308 (H.R. 3858), the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006; P.L. 109-63 (H.R. 3650), the Federal Judiciary Emergency Special Sessions Act of 2005; P.L. 109-67 (H.R. 3668), the Student Grant Hurricane and Disaster Relief Act; and Sections of P.L. 109-364 (H.R. 5122), the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007. Most of these statutes contain relatively few changes to federal authorities related to emergencies and disasters. The Post-Katrina Act, however, contains many changes that will have long-term consequences for FEMA and other federal entities. That statute reorganizes FEMA, expands its statutory authority, and imposes new conditions and requirements on the operations of the agency. The Administration will implement these new authorities through the FY2008 appropriations legislation. The oversight plans of committees with jurisdiction indicate that Members of the 110th Congress will evaluate the steps taken by the leadership of FEMA to carry out the expanded legislative mandate. In addition, Members will continue to debate legislation pertaining to the recovery of Gulf Coast states. For example, H.R. 1144 would waive disaster assistance cost share requirements for the states affected by the hurricanes. This report will be updated as developments warrant."
