    "title": "An act to amend Sections 1027 and 1369 of the Penal Code, and to add Section 7233 to the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to state hospitals.",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the State Department of State Hospitals for the administration of state hospitals and provides for the involuntary confinement of certain individuals in those state hospitals, including a defendant who has been found mentally incompetent to stand trial or who has been found to be insane at the time he or she committed the crime. Existing law requires a court, when a defendant pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, or if there is a question as to the defendant\u2019s mental competence, to appoint a specified number of psychiatrists or psychologists to examine the defendant. This bill would require the State Department of State Hospitals to establish, within the department, a pool of psychiatrists and psychologists with forensic skills, and would require the department to create evaluation panels from the pool of psychiatrists and psychologists, as specified. The bill would require the court to order an evaluation panel to evaluate a defendant who pleads not guilty by reason of insanity or who may be mentally incompetent. The bill would also make conforming changes."
