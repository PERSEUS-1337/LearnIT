    "content": "Savings for Seniors Act of 2017 This bill amends title II (OASDI) of the Social Security Act to establish in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund a Social Security Surplus Protection Account. The Managing Trustee of the Social Security trust funds must: (1) transfer annual Social Security surpluses to the account. And (2) may not invest the balance in the account until a law takes effect after FY2017 that authorizes, for amounts in the trust fund, an investment vehicle other than US obligations resulting in the transfer of trust fund assets to the general fund of the Treasury. The bill establishes in the executive branch a commission to study the most effective vehicles for investment of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund other than investments in the form of US obligations."
