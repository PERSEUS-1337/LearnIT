Amends Federal law to require the President's annual budget to contain a separate listing of administrative costs for direct loans and loan guarantees on a cash accounting basis and an appendix of such costs by program, by agency, and for the Government. Establishes maximum permissible subsidy rates for each credit reform program account. Reduces such rates from 40 percent for FY 1995 to five percent by FY 1999."
