    "content": "Children's Electronic Access Safety Enhancement (CEASE) Act - Requires providers of Internet content management services (providers) to notify local educational agencies or other authorities responsible for schools (LEAs), or libraries, of the providers' policies regarding collection, use, and disclosure of information from or about children under age 19 whose Internet use will be covered by such services, before entering into a contract or other agreement to provide such services to or for an elementary or secondary school or a library, and before implementing any later material modifications of such policies. Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to treat noncompliance with these requirements as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Allows LEAs or libraries to terminate such contracts or agreements with providers who fail to comply with these requirements. Requires a school or library to provide reasonable notice of its provider's policy to students' parents or library patrons. Prohibits providers from collecting personal information from or about a child who is a school student or library patron. Requires providers, if they do collect such information, to: (1) promptly notify the LEA and appropriate State officials, or the library, and the FTC. And (2) treat the information in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) if the child is under 12, and in accordance with FTC regulations if the child is over 12. Requires the LEA or library to notify a parent or guardian of the child of receipt of such notice. Amends COPPA to treat providers as operators."
