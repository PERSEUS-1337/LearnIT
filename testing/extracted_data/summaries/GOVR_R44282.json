    "content": "The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program makes federal funds available to eligible metropolitan areas, states, and local community-based organizations to assist with health care costs and support services for individuals and families affected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program reports that in 2014 it served 512,214 low-income people with HIV/AIDS in the United States, 25.4% of whom were uninsured and 64.2% of whom were living at or below 100% of the federal poverty level. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Its statutory authority is Title XXVI of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, originally enacted in 1990 and composed of four major parts and several other components. Part A provides grants to urban areas and mid-sized cities. Part B provides grants to states and territories; it also provides funds for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP). Part C provides early intervention grants to public and private nonprofit entities. Part D provides grants to public and private nonprofit entities for family-centered care for women, infants, children, and youth with HIV/AIDS. The other components under Part F include the AIDS Dental Reimbursement (ADR) Program, the Community-Based Dental Partnership Program, the AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETCs), the Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) Program, and the Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI). In October 2009, the 111th Congress passed and President Obama signed the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-87), which reauthorized the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program through September 30, 2013. The program's authority is currently expired, but Congress continues to appropriate funds for the program. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended) contains general provisions to increase access to health insurance; therefore, the ACA has the potential to increase coverage for people living with HIV/AIDS. For example, ACA includes prohibitions on the cancellation of coverage by an insurer due to a preexisting condition, elimination of lifetime caps on insurance benefits and annual limits on coverage, and eligibility for tax subsidies to help low- and middle-income individuals purchase coverage from a health insurance exchange. ACA phases out the Medicare Part D \"doughnut hole\" (i.e., payment gap) for HIV/AIDS individuals who are Medicare eligible, which should increase coverage of HIV/AIDS drugs. Finally, the ACA permits states to broaden Medicaid eligibility to include non-elderly adults. There could be a significant impact on Ryan White ADAP clients in states that expand their Medicaid program; specifically, about half of ADAP clients would be Medicaid-eligible in expansion states, and the remainder would likely be eligible for premium subsidies to purchase health coverage on the exchange. The long-range impact of ACA on the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program\u2014in which HIV care and treatment services provided under Ryan White are replaced by access to such services through health insurance coverage via ACA\u2014remains to be determined. Prior to the ACA's implementation, many Ryan White patients were insured and used Ryan White funds to pay premiums and cost sharing, and this need for funds is likely to remain as some Ryan White patients transition to private insurance. In states that decide not to participate in the Medicaid expansion, the need for the full range of Ryan White services would remain. However, even if all states decide to cover the new Medicaid-eligible group, there will be gaps that the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program could continue to fill, such as coverage of those individuals with HIV/AIDS who are undocumented immigrants, and training of health providers in HIV-related care. In addition, Ryan White provides dental care and support services, such as medical transportation, that may not be provided under Medicaid or private health insurance. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program serves a public health role by keeping people in treatment and thereby decreasing the risk of transmitting HIV to others. Funding for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program in FY2016, provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (H.R. 2029, P.L. 114-113), is $2.323 billion. For FY2017, the Obama Administration requests $2.298 billion in budget authority and $34 million via a PHS transfer for the SPNS program, resulting in an FY2017 total of $2.332 billion for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. The $9 million increase over FY2016 is for a new SPNS initiative to expand screening for and treatment of hepatitis C in people living with HIV. The FY2017 budget request again proposes a consolidation of Part C and Part D, which was proposed in the FY2015 and FY2016 budget requests and rejected by Congress."
