    "content": "The annual Foreign Operations appropriations bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which Congress reviews the U.S. foreign aid budget and influences executive branch foreign policymaking generally. It contains the largest share -- over two-thirds -- of total U.S. internationalaffairs spending. President Clinton asked Congress initially to appropriate $15.1 billion for FY2001 Foreign Operations, plus $1.25 billion in FY2000 supplemental funds. Congress approved some of thesupplemental spending in P.L. 106-246 , but in October 2000 reconsidered and approved as FY2001emergency appropriations portions of the FY2000 supplemental rejected earlier. Consequently, thecombined FY2000 supplemental/FY2001 regular Foreign Operations request, as it stood whenCongress debated the FY2001 Foreign Operations conference report in October, totaled $15.45billion. The largest program increases for FY2001 were those for the Export-Import Bank (+26%),USAID development aid (+18%), nonproliferation, terrorism, and demining (+44%), voluntarycontributions to international organizations (+45%), and multilateral development bank contributions(+24%). S. 2522 , as approved by the Senate on June 22, provided $13.4 billion for FY2001 Foreign Operations Appropriations. The measure was about $65 million less than FY2000 enactedand about $1.7 billion, or 11%, below the President's initial FY2001 request. A major new initiativein S. 2522 was the creation of a Global Health account ($691 million). Population aidwould have increased by $110 million and a new set of conditions on family planning programswould have effectively eliminated the FY2000 abortion-related restrictions. H.R. 4811 , as approved by the House on July 13, provided $13.3 billion, about $200 million less than the FY2000 enacted, and 13% less than the President's original request. Thebill maintained the FY2000 funding level and abortion-related restrictions for family planningprograms. At $238 million, the bill provided most of the Administration's FY2001 request for debtrelief, but still fell well short of the combined FY2000/2001 debt reduction request of $472 million. On October 25, Congress approved the conference report on H.R. 4811 ( H.Rept. 106-997 ), increasing FY2001 Foreign Operations spending to $14.9 billion, well above levels passedearlier by either the House or Senate. The enacted legislation ( P.L. 106-429 ) falls about $550million, or 3.5% below the President's combined FY2000 supplemental/FY2001 requests, but fullyfunds several top Administration priorities, including international debt relief and global healthprograms. For international family planning, Congress increased spending to $425 million, butrestricted the obligation of funds until after February 15, 2001. Prior to the release of these funds,President Bush reimposed the so-called \"Mexico City\" abortion restrictions that apply to FY2001and future U.S. family planning appropriations"
