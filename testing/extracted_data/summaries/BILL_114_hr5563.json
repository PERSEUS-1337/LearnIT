    "content": "Restoring Local Control of Airports Act of 2016 This bill reauthorizes through FY2021 and revises the Airport Improvement Program. Specifically, the bill: (1) eliminates the federal cap on passenger facility charges of $4.50 per enplanement. And (2) with respect to airports that increase such charges beyond $4.50 per enplanement, provides for corresponding reductions in program grant funding. In addition, the bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce the federal airline ticket tax."
