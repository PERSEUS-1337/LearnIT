    "content": "In February 2007, the 110th Congress finished consideration of FY2007 foreign operations appropriations legislation, held over from 2006, that provided foreign assistance to the Andean region. In addition to the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI), Andean countries benefit from Foreign Military Financing (FMF), International Military Education and Training (IMET) funds, and other types of economic aid. Congress continued to express concern with the volume of drugs readily available in the United States and elsewhere in the world. The three largest producers of cocaine are Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru. Ninety percent of the cocaine in the United States originates in, or passes through, Colombia. The United States has made a significant commitment of funds and material support to help Colombia and the Andean region fight drug trafficking since the development of Plan Colombia in 1999. From FY2000 through FY2007, the United States provided a total of about $5.7 billion for the region in ACI funds. The United States also provides funding for Development Assistance (DA), Child Survival and Health (CSH), and Economic Support Funds (ESF) to some countries in the region. The Defense Department maintains a central counternarcotics account that funds activities in Latin America. Since 2002, Congress has granted expanded authority to use counternarcotics funds for a unified campaign to fight both drug trafficking and terrorist organizations in Colombia. Three illegally armed groups in Colombia that participate in drug production and trafficking have been designated foreign terrorist organizations by the State Department. In 2004, Congress also increased the level of U.S. military and civilian contractor personnel allowed to be deployed in Colombia, in response to an Administration request. The FY2007 budget request, submitted to Congress on February 6, 2006, included a total of $721.5 million for ACI, an amount Congress approved in a continuing resolution. Congress did not complete work on the Foreign Operations bill in 2006, instead passing three continuing resolutions to maintain funding into 2007. The final bill, the FY2007 Continuing Resolution (H.J.Res. 20/P.L. 109-289, as amended by P.L. 110-5) was passed on February 15, 2007. For FY2006, Congress approved the Administration's request for $734.5 million in the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act (H.R. 3057/P.L. 109-102), although a 1% across-the-board rescission reduced it to $727.2 million."
