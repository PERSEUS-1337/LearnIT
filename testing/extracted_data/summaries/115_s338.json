    "content": "Scientific Integrity Act This bill requires, subject to the exemptions for disclosures of information under the Freedom of Information Act, each federal agency that funds or conducts scientific research to: (1) promote and maximize the communication and open exchange of data and findings to other agencies, policymakers, and the public of research conducted by a scientist employed or contracted by such an agency. And (2) prevent the intentional or unintentional suppression or distortion of such data and findings. The bill amends the America COMPETES Act to revise provisions relating to the release of data and results of research conducted by scientists employed at all federal civilian agencies that fund or conduct scientific research. Each federal agency that funds or conducts scientific research shall: (1) develop and enforce a specified scientific integrity policy, including procedures, regarding the release of data and findings to other agencies, policymakers, and the public of research conducted by a scientist employed or contracted by that agency. And (2) submit it to Congress and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). Such a policy shall apply to employees and contractors who conduct, handle, communicate, or supervise federally funded scientific research for a federal agency or for a federally funded research and development center sponsored by that agency. A federal agency that funds or conducts scientific research shall: (1) disseminate its policy to new employees and contractors, and (2) develop and require training on its policy for employees and contractors regarding scientific research for that agency. The OSTP shall enter into an agrement with the National Academy of Public Administration to study the effectiveness of the scientific integrity policies developed pursuant to this bill."
