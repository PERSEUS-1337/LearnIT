    "content": "Geographical indications (GIs) are place names used to identify products that come from these places and to protect the quality and reputation of a distinctive product originating in a certain region. The term is most often applied to wines, spirits, and agricultural products. Some food producers benefit from the use of GIs by giving certain foods recognition for their distinctiveness, differentiating them from other foods in the marketplace. In this manner, GIs can be commercially valuable. GIs may be eligible for relief from acts of infringement or unfair competition. GIs may also protect consumers from deceptive or misleading labels. Examples of registered or established GIs include Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and Prosciutto di Parma ham from the Parma region of Italy, Toscano olive oil from Tuscany, Roquefort cheese, Champagne from the region of the same name in France, Irish Whiskey, Darjeeling tea, Florida oranges, Idaho potatoes, Vidalia onions, Washington State apples, and Napa Valley Wines. The use of GIs has become a contentious international trade issue, particularly for U.S. wine, cheese, and sausage makers involved in trade between the United States and the European Union (EU). Accordingly, GIs are among the agricultural issues that have been raised in the ongoing Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) negotiations, a potential reciprocal free trade agreement that the United States and the EU are negotiating. Many U.S. food manufacturers view the use of common or traditional names as generic terms and the EU's protection of its registered GIs as a way to monopolize the use of certain wine and food terms and as a form of trade protectionism. Specifically, several industry groups have expressed concern that the EU is using GIs to impose restrictions on the use of common names for some foods\u2014such as parmesan, feta, and provolone cheeses and certain wines\u2014and limit U.S. food companies from marketing these foods using these common names. Complicating this issue further are GI protections afforded to registered products in third country markets. This has become a concern for U.S. agricultural exporters following a series of recently concluded trade agreements between the EU and countries such as Canada, South Korea, South Africa, and other countries that are, in many cases, also major trading partners with the United States. Laws and regulations governing GIs differ between the United States and EU, which further complicates this issue. In the United States, GIs are generally treated as brands and trademarks, whereas the EU protects GIs through a series of established quality schemes. These approaches differ with respect to the conditions for protection or the scope of protection, but both establish rights for collective use by those who comply with defined standards. In the United States, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) administers GI protections, along with labeling requirements for wine, malt beverages, beer, and distilled spirits under the jurisdiction of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. In the EU, a series of regulations governing GIs was initiated in the early 1990s covering agricultural and food products, wine, and spirits. Legislation adopted in 1992 covered agricultural products (not including wines and spirits), but it was changed in 2006 following a World Trade Organization (WTO) panel ruling that found some aspects of the EU's scheme inconsistent with WTO rules. The new rules came into force in January 2013. GIs are also protected by agreements of the WTO as part of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Some Members of Congress have long expressed their concerns about EU protections for GIs, which they claim are being misused to create market and trade barriers. However, they are also concerned about the implementation of GI protections in other trade agreements that have been or are being negotiated by the EU with other countries."
