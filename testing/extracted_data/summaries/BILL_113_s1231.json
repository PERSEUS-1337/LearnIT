    "content": "Duplication Elimination Act of 2013 - Requires the President, within 90 days after publication of the annual Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on duplication, consolidation, and elimination of duplicative government programs, to send Congress a proposed joint resolution accompanied by a special message specifying: any recommendations outlined in the GAO report that are excluded from the proposed joint resolution, in detail why they were excluded. And the outlined GAO recommendations included in the proposed joint resolution. Limits the proposed joint resolution to one that: (1) makes legislative changes needed to carry out the recommendations contained in the GAO report for a year that the President did not exclude, and (2) requires that any savings attributable to the legislative changes be transferred to the General Fund of the Treasury and be used to reduce the deficit. Sets forth procedures for expedited congressional consideration of the proposed joint resolution."
