The review, in the form of a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, is designed to ensure that the federal coal program is properly structured to provide a fair return to taxpayers and toreflect its impacts on the environment, while continuing to helpmeet energy needs. In addition, Interior shall reestablish the Royalty Policy Committee to ensure consultation among state, tribal, environmental, energy, and federal stakeholders. The committee must provide advice to Interior on the management of federal and Indian mineral leases and shall be composed of federal and non-federal members.
