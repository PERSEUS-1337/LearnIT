Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers Reform and Improvement Act of 2015 This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to codify the establishment of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The FLETC must be headed by a director who reports to the DHS Secretary. The bill sets forth functions of the director, including to: establish and execute organizational plans and priorities, direct and manage training facilities, programs, and activities, develop training goals and curricula. Disseminate homeland security information to law enforcement and security agencies and private sector stakeholders, conduct acquisition in compliance with federal law and regulations, coordinate and share digital resources with federal agencies. And collaborate to improve international instructional development, training, and technical assistance to foreign law enforcement. Additionally, the bill sets forth training responsibilities of the FLETC and partner organizations . It authorizes the FLETC to: (1) train federal employees engaged in homeland security operations or law enforcement activities, and (2) execute strategic partnerships with state and local law enforcement agencies and coordinate with private sector stakeholders to provide training. The FLETC must consult with relevant law enforcement and security agencies to develop and deliver training programs. A partner organization must pay for and assign non-reimbursable detailed instructors to support training programs. The FLETC may conduct federal employee trainings at FLETC facilities, at off-site locations, or by distributed learning, detail its employees throughout DHS, charge fees for non-federal trainings, provide certain student support services, hire retired federal employees with training experience. And reimburse travel expenses of non-federal and intermittent federal employees. Individuals who attend FLETC training must reside in FLETC housing, to the extent practicable. Finally, the bill codifies existing authorities of the FLETC to spend funds to promote awareness of and support for law enforcement training, accept and use gifts for authorized purposes, accept reimbursement for the construction or renovation of training facilities, obligate funds in anticipation of reimbursements, purchase uniforms and passenger vehicles, and provide room and board for student interns. It also authorizes the FLETC to spend funds to honor and memorialize FLETC graduates who have died in the line of duty."
