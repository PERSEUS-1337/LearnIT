    "content": "Recognizing the special burdens that members of the military may encounter in trying to meet their financial obligations while serving their country, Congress passed the Soldiers' and Sailors'Civil Relief Act of 1940 (SSCRA). This law has been amended from time to time, ordinarily inresponse to military operations that require the activation of the Reserves. P.L. 108-189 , the\"Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA),\" was enacted on December 19, 2003 and overhauls theSSCRA. This report summarizes the rights granted to persons serving on active duty in the U.S.Armed Forces under the newly enacted SCRA. SCRA is a comprehensive rewrite of the SSCRA which clarifies language that has been subject to differing interpretations by courts, and modifies or expands certain benefits. The SCRA providesprotections for servicemembers in the event that their military service impedes their ability to meetfinancial obligations incurred before their entry into active military service. The SCRA does notrequire forgiving any debts or the extinguishment of contractual obligations on behalf ofservicemembers who have been called up for active duty, nor does it provide absolute immunityfrom civil lawsuits. Instead, it suspends claims against servicemembers and protects them fromdefault judgments. The SCRA also protects military members and their families from eviction,protects against cancellation of life insurance policies or non-reinstatement of health insurancepolicies, allows some professionals to suspend malpractice or liability insurance while on activeduty, and protects from taxation in multiple jurisdictions as well as forced property sales to payoverdue taxes. The SCRA provides for a cap on interest at an annual rate of 6% on debts incurred prior to a person's entry into active duty military service, sets forth procedures for requesting such a reduction,and clarifies that the balance of interest for the servicemember's period of military service is to beforgiven by the lender. Other measures protect military families from being evicted from rentalproperty or from mortgaged property, from cancellation of life insurance, from taxation in multiplejurisdictions and from foreclosure of property to pay taxes that are due, and from losing certain rightsto public land. It raises the amount of the rent that qualifies for protection from eviction, allowsservicemembers on active duty to terminate housing leases, and allows some servicemembers toterminate automobile leases."
