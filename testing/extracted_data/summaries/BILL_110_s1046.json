    "content": "Senior Professional Performance Act of 2008 - Amends provisions relating to locality-based comparability payments for federal employees to exempt senior-level (SL) and scientific and professional personnel (ST) employees from limitations on total basic and comparability pay established at level III of the Executive Schedule. Increases the rate of basic pay for certain senior-level positions to level III. Permits a further increase to level II for agencies with a performance appraisal system that has been certified as making meaningful distinctions based on relative performance. Protects employees who are transferred to an agency subject to existing pay limitations from pay reductions. Provides that appointments to positions classified above GS-15 may be made on approval of the appointee's qualifications by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on the basis of qualification standards developed by the agency involved in accordance with criteria prescribed by the Director. Makes the amendments to senior-level pay provisions effective 180 days after enactment. Prohibits a reduction in the rate of basic pay for certain senior-level positions as a result of amendments made by this Act. Limits an agency's certification of performance appraisal systems to 24 months, with an additional extension of up to six months by the Director. Allows extensions of certifications scheduled to expire at the end of 2008 or 2009."
