Expresses the sense of the Congress that in order to promote security in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine: (1) the United States should support the full and active participation of these countries in activities that will qualify them for NATO membership. (2) the US Government should press the European Union to admit as soon as possible any country qualifying for membership. And (3) the United States and NATO should support military and peacekeeping initiatives between and among such countries, NATO countries, and Russia.

Requires the President to designate as eligible for such assistance other emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe that meet specified criteria.
