Outlines the requirements to be imposed on executive agencies through such regulations, including the requirement that each such agency reserve a specified percentage of its FY 1994 through 1997 appropriations for RD activities to be conducted by the Black colleges it must designate under this Act as federally funded RD centers. Increases such set-aside on a graduated basis for such fiscal years. Requires each recipient of such set-aside to pay a specified percentage of it to the Parren J. Mitchell Institute for Business Education for entrepreneurial and capital formation programs. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to the Congress annually on the activities of executive agencies in carrying out this Act."
