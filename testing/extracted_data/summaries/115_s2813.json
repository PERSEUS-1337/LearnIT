    "content": "Local Cheese Promotion and Dairy Support Act of 2018 This bill amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act to establish a Department of Agriculture (USDA) program to provide competitive grants to small cheese producers and cooperative groups of small cheese producers. In awarding grants, USDA must define the term quot, small cheese producerquot. And give preference to producers that use locally or regionally sourced product to produce cheese. Grant recipients may use the funds to: purchase equipment or renovate and make repairs to production facilities, develop a business plan or perform a feasibility study to grow the business, promote and market cheese, participate in accounting and financial literacy education and training, carry out food safety upgrades and training, and participate in job training. Using no more than 10 of the funds provided for this bill, USDA must establish a cheese production, education, and promotion pilot project at eligible institutions, including: land-grant colleges or universities, local offices of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture or other regional USDA offices, groups of regional experts that advise beginning farmers or ranchers, or nonprofit organizations."
