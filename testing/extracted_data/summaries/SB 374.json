    "title": "An act to amend Sections 20209.14 and 22161 of the Public Contract Code, relating to local public contracts.",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes local agencies to use the design-build method of project delivery for specified projects, except for projects on the state highway system. Existing law defines \u201clocal agency\u201d for purposes of these provisions as cities and counties, certain special districts relating to wastewater, solid waste, water recycling, and fire protection facilities, joint powers authorities formed to provide transit service, and specified types of local public entities responsible for the construction of transit projects. These provisions further define \u201cproject\u201d specifically for each category of local agency. Existing law requires specified information submitted by a design-build entity, as defined, in the design-build procurement process to be certified under penalty of perjury. This bill would specify that the definition of a local agency authorized to use the design-build method of project delivery includes the San Diego Association of Governments. The bill would define projects, as it pertains to the San Diego Association of Governments, to include development projects adjacent, or physically or functionally related, to transit facilities developed by the association. By expanding the design-build authorization of the San Diego Association of Governments to additional development projects, the bill would expand the scope of crime of perjury and would impose a state-mandated local program. This bill also makes a technical correction to a cross-reference. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the San Diego Association of Governments. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
