    "content": "The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 prohibits any person, in the course of doing business, from knowingly and intentionally exposing any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without giving a specified warning, or from discharging or releasing such a chemical into any source of drinking water, except as specified. Existing law prohibits the sale of expanded polystyrene packaging material by a wholesaler or manufacturer. Existing law prohibits a person from selling a plastic product in this state that is labeled with the term \u201ccompostable,\u201d \u201chome compostable,\u201d or \u201cmarine degradable\u201d unless, at the time of sale, the plastic product meets the applicable ASTM International standard specification. This bill would prohibit, on and after January 1, 2020, a person, as defined, from selling or offering for promotional purposes in this state a personal care product containing synthetic plastic microbeads, as specified. The bill would exempt from those prohibitions the sale or promotional offer of a product containing less than 1 part per million (ppm) by weight of synthetic plastic microbeads, as provided. The bill would make a violator liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500 per day for each violation. The bill would authorize the penalty to be assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in any court of competent jurisdiction by the Attorney General, to be retained by that office. The bill would make these moneys available to the office of the Attorney General, upon appropriation, for the purpose of enforcing these provisions. The bill would prohibit a city, county, or other local public agency from adopting, amending enforcing, or otherwise implementing an ordinance, resolution, regulation, or rule relating to the sale or offering for promotional purposes of personal care products that contain synthetic plastic microbeads. The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 prohibits any person, in the course of doing business, from knowingly and intentionally exposing any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without giving a specified warning, or from discharging or releasing such a chemical into any source of drinking water, except as specified. This bill would declare the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would prevent water pollution from synthetic plastic microbeads."
