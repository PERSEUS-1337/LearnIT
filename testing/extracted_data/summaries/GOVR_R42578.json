    "content": "The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) appropriations subcommittee is charged with providing annual appropriations for the Department of Transportation (DOT), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and related agencies. The HUD budget generally accounts for the largest share of discretionary appropriations provided by the subcommittee. However, when mandatory funding is taken into account, DOT's budget is larger than HUD's budget, because it includes funding from transportation trust funds. Mandatory funding typically accounts for a little less than half of the bill total. In the deliberations on FY2013 THUD funding during the second session of the 112th Congress, the House passed a THUD bill (H.R. 5972) and the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported out a THUD bill (S. 2322), but this bill was not passed by the Senate. Thus Congress did not enact a separate THUD funding bill prior to the beginning of FY2013. THUD appropriations for FY2013 were provided through a pair of continuing resolutions (CRs): P.L. 112-175 provided funding from the beginning of FY2013 through March 27, 2013, and P.L. 113-6 provided funding through the end of FY2013. These CRs provided funding at roughly the FY2012 level. These CRs included several exceptions (anomalies) for individual DOT and HUD accounts. P.L. 113-6 also included an across-the board rescission of 0.2%. FY2013 THUD funding was further reduced by the imposition of a sequester, per the terms of the Budget Control Act. The sequester reduced DOT funding by around $1.6 billion, and HUD funding by around $3 billion. In terms of final FY2013 THUD funding, Congress enacted $71.3 billion for DOT in FY2013; after the sequester reduction, DOT received around $70.6 billion. Congress enacted $33.4 billion for HUD in FY2013, pre-sequester. Accounting for sequestration, HUD was provided with about $31.4 billion in FY2013."
