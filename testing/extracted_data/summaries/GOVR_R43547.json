    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides benefits to veterans who meet certain eligibility criteria. Benefits to veterans range from disability compensation and pensions to hospital and medical care. The VA provides these benefits through three major operating units: the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA). This report focuses on funding for the VHA. The VHA is primarily a direct service provider of primary care, specialized care, and related medical and social support services to veterans through the nation's largest integrated health care system. Eligibility for VA health care is based primarily on previous military service, disability, and income. The President's FY2015 budget request was submitted to Congress on March 4, 2014. The President's budget requested $158.6 billion in budget authority for the VA as a whole. This included $93.5 billion in mandatory funding and $65.1 billion in discretionary funding. For FY2015, the Administration requested $56.6 billion for VHA. This included $45.4 billion for the medical services account, $5.9 billion for the medical support and compliance account, $4.7 billion for the medical facilities account, and nearly $589 million for the medical and prosthetic research account. Furthermore, as required by the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-81), the President's budget requested $58.6 billion in advance appropriations for the three medical care accounts (medical services, medical support and compliance, and medical facilities) for FY2016. On April 3, 2014, the House Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee approved its version of a Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for FY2015 (MILCON-VA Appropriations bill). The full House Appropriations Committee approved a draft measure by voice vote on April 9, 2014, and the House passed the MILCON-VA Appropriations bill for FY2015 (H.R. 4486; H.Rept. 113-416) on April 30, 2014. The House-passed version of the MILCON-VA Appropriations bill for FY2015 proposed a total of $158.2 billion for the VA as whole. For FY2015, H.R. 4486 proposed $56.2 billion for VHA. On May 20, 2014, the Senate Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee marked up its version of the MILCON-VA Appropriations bill for FY2015. The full Senate Appropriations Committee approved the measure (H.R. 4486 ; S.Rept. 113-174) on May 22. The committee-approved bill proposed $158.6 billion for the VA as a whole. For FY2015, H.R. 4486 (S.Rept. 113-174) proposed $56.4 billion for VHA. A MILCON-VA Appropriations bill funding most of the VA (excluding the three medical care accounts: medical services, medical support and compliance, and medical facilities), was not enacted prior to the beginning of FY2015, and Congress passed several continuing appropriations resolutions (CRs) to fund the VA. The President signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 83; P.L. 113-235) on December 16, 2014. Division I of P.L. 113-235 contained the FY2015 MILCON-VA Appropriations Act. The act provides appropriations totaling $159.1 billion for FY2015 for the functions of the VA as a whole and $56.4 billion for VHA. The MILCON-VA Appropriations Act, 2015 includes $58.6 billion in advance FY2016 funding for the medical services, medical support and compliance, and medical facilities accounts. P.L. 113-235 also amended 38 U.S.C \u00a7117. Beginning with the FY2016 MILCON-VA Appropriations bill, compensation and pensions, readjustment benefits, and veterans insurance and indemnities accounts will be provided advance appropriations for FY2017 together with the three health accounts."
