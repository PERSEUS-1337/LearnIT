    "content": "Nonprofit Property Protection Act This bill: amends the Liability Risk Retention Act of 1986 to rename it the Risk Retention Act of 1986, and exclude from quot, commercial insurancequot. Covered by the Act any health, life, or disability insurance or workers compensation insurance or express contractual obligations owed to a consumer as a result of a personal, family, or household transaction, where the consumer pays a separate consideration for the express contractual obligation. The bill expands the kinds of state laws pertaining to business insurance from which a risk retention group shall be exempt to include laws pertaining to other lines of commercial insurance offered by a risk retention group to an entity organized and operated exclusively as a federal tax-exempt nonprofit charitable or educational institution, as long as the group meets specified criteria."
