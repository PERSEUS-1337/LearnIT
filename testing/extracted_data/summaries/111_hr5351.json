(2) the President and the Secretary of State should not undertake actions that could legitimize the ICC. (3) the President and the Secretary should lead a diplomatic effort to encourage additional countries to enter into agreements with the United States preventing the ICC from proceeding against US personnel present in such countries. (4) the President and the Secretary should lead a diplomatic effort to defend the right to self-defense of the United States and other democracies, including Israel, against efforts such as the Goldstone Report that seek to deny democracies that very right via entities like the ICC. And (5) the President and the Secretary should explore alternative forums to combat impunity for war crimes and other atrocities while respecting the sovereignty and right to self-defense of democracies. Prohibits funds made available to any US government, state, or local department, agency, or entity, including any court, from being used for US participation in the ICC or its attendant activities, including any review conference or meeting of the Assembly of States Parties."
