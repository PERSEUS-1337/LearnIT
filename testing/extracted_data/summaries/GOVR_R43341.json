    "content": "This report details the National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget and appropriations process with a focus on FY2020 and FY2021, and on coronavirus supplemental funding for NIH. The report also provides an overview of funding trends in regular appropriations to the agency from FY1995 to FY2021. Appendix A includes funding tables by account and program-specific funding levels for FY2020 and FY2021. The NIH is the primary federal agency charged with conducting and supporting medical, health, and behavioral research, and it is made up of 27 Institutes and Centers and the Office of the Director (OD). About 80% of the NIH budget funds extramural research through grants, contracts, and other awards. About 10% of NIH funding goes to intramural researchers at NIH-operated facilities. Almost all of NIH's funding is provided in the annual Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. NIH also receives smaller amounts of funding from Interior/Environmental appropriations and a mandatory budget authority for type 1 diabetes research. NIH has an FY2020 program level of $41.685 billion and has received emergency supplemental appropriations in three coronavirus supplemental appropriations acts, totaling over $3.59 billion\u00e2\u0080\u0094an 8.6% funding increase over regular enacted FY2020 appropriations. The administration's FY2021 budget request, as amended by a March 2020 letter, proposes an FY2021 program level of $39.133 billion\u00e2\u0080\u0094a 6.1% decrease from the FY2020 program level (regular appropriations). NIH has seen periods of high and low funding growth during the period covered by this report, as illustrated in Figure 1 . Between FY1994 and FY1998, funding for NIH grew from $11.0 billion to $13.7 billion (nominal dollars). Over the next five years, Congress and the President doubled the NIH budget to $27.2 billion in FY2003. In each of FY1999 through FY2003, NIH received annual funding increases of 14% to 16%. From FY2003 to FY2015, NIH funding increased more gradually in nominal dollars. In some years (FY2006, FY2011, and FY2013), funding for the agency decreased in nominal dollars. From FY2016 through FY2020, NIH has seen funding increases of over 5% each year. The largest increase was from FY2017 to FY2018, where the program level increased by $3.0 billion (+8.7%), making this the largest single-year nominal dollar increase since FY2003. When looking at NIH funding adjusted for inflation (in projected constant FY2021 dollars using the Biomedical Research and Development Price Index; BRDPI), the purchasing power of NIH funding peaked in FY2003\u00e2\u0080\u0094the last year of the five-year doubling period\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then declined fairly steadily for more than a decade until back-to-back funding increases were provided in each of FY2016 through FY2020. The FY2021 budget request would provide a program level that is 13.0% below the peak FY2003 program level."
