    "title": "An act to add Section 208.3 to the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to juveniles.",
    "content": "Existing law permits minors who are detained in juvenile hall for habitual disobedience, truancy, or curfew violation to be held in the same facility as minors who are detained for violating any law or ordinance defining a crime, if they do not come or remain in contact with each other. Existing law also permits the detention of minors in jails and other secure facilities for the confinement of adults if the minors do not come or remain in contact with confined adults and other specified conditions are met. Existing law, the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, authorizes the involuntary detention for a period of 72 hours for the evaluation of a person, including a minor, who is dangerous to himself or herself or others, or gravely disabled, as defined. This bill would, commencing January 1, 2018, place restrictions on the use of room confinement of minors or wards who are confined in a juvenile facility, as specified. The bill would require the placement of a minor or ward in room confinement to be conducted in accordance with specified guidelines. By increasing the duties of local entities in connection with local juvenile facilities, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
