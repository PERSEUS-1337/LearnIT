    "content": "Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to add a new congressional statement of purpose which requires all Federal public land managers in Alaska to participate in an ANILCA training class. Defines, for purposes of title XI of such Act, compatible with the uses for which the unit was established to mean activities which would not cause significant adverse impacts on conservation system unit purposes. Requires, under such title, that any alternative transportation or utility system route that may be identified by the head of a Federal agency shall not be less economically feasible and prudent than the route for the system being sought by the applicant. Revises provisions concerning, among other things: (1) right of access to State or private owners or occupiers. (2) the use of snowmobiles, airplanes, and nonmotorized surface transportation for traditional activities. (3) possessory or personalty interests in, as well as alterations to, cabins located on conservation system units, (4) the taking of fish and wildlife. And (5) helicopter landings. Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from establishing policies for the purpose of administering any study area to preserve wilderness values prior to action by the Congress. Prohibits anything in ANILCA from being construed as limiting or restricting the power and authority of the State of Alaska, except as expressly provided."
