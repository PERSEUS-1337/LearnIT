And (2) a law enforcement agency to impound the vehicle of a person arrested for public intoxication for a period of 12 hours or until such later time as the person is able to operate the vehicle in a safe manner and not in violation of driving while intoxicated laws. Allows withheld funds to: (1) remain available for apportionment to the State for four years. (2) remain available for expenditure for three fiscal years after apportionment. And (3) be redistributed to other States if the originally targeted State is not in compliance, or the funds are not obligated for expenditure, within such periods."
