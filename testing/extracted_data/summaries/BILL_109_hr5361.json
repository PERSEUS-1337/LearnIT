    "content": "Platform Equality and Remedies for Right Holders in Music Act of 2006 or the Perform Act of 2006 - Requires Copyright Royalty Judges (CRJs) to establish rates for a statutory license for the transmission of sound recordings by organizations that most clearly represent the fair market value of the rights licensed. Replaces the different processes for setting rates and terms of royalty payments for subscription transmissions by preexisting subscription services, satellite digital radio services, and eligible nonsubscription transmission services with one process for all such transmissions. Directs CRJs, when setting such rates and terms, to consider: (1) the fair market value of the rights licensed. And (2) the degree to which reasonable recording affects the potential market for sound recordings and the additional fees that are required to be paid by services for compensation. Conditions statutory licensing of transmissions on the transmitting entity using technology that is reasonably available, technologically feasible, and economically reasonable to prevent the making of copies or phonorecords embodying the transmission in whole or in part, except for reasonable recording. Allows a performing rights society or a mechanical rights organization to monitor public performances or other uses of copyrighted works contained in transmissions. Requires the Register of Copyrights to convene a meeting among affected parties to discuss whether to recommend creating a new category of limited interactive services within certain statutory licenses for subscription transmissions."
