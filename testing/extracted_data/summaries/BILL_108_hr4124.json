    "content": "Medical Malpractice Relief Act of 2004 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a business tax credit for taxable years beginning in 2004 or 2005 for expenditures for medical professional malpractice insurance. Allows a credit for: (1) 20 percent of the malpractice insurance expenditures of a physician who practices in any surgical specialty or subspecialty, emergency medicine, obstetrics, or anesthesiology or who does intervention work which is reflected in medical malpractice insurance expenditures. (2) ten percent of such expenditures of a physician who practices in general medicine, allergy, dermatology, pathology, or other specialty. And (3) 15 percent of such expenditures of any hospital, clinic, or long-term care provider. Limits the amount of expenditures that may be taken into account to twice the average of costs of medical malpractice insurance for similarly situated health care providers, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, to make grants to certain non-profit hospitals, clinics, and long-term care providers to assist such entities in defraying their medical malpractice insurance expenditures. Limits the amount of such grants to 15 percent of the medical malpractice insurance expenditures incurred by such entities in any year."
