    "title": "An act to amend Section 1170.18 of the Penal Code, relating to sentencing.",
    "content": "Existing law, the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, enacted by Proposition 47, as approved by the voters at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election, reduced the penalties for various crimes. Under the provisions of the act, a person currently convicted of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under the act if the act had been in effect at the time of the conviction may petition or apply to have the sentence reduced in accordance with the act. That act requires that this petition or application be filed before November 4, 2017, or at a later date upon a showing of good cause. Proposition 47 authorizes its provisions to be amended by a statute that is consistent with and furthers its intent and that is passed by a 23 vote of each house of the Legislature and is signed by the Governor. Proposition 47 also provides that the Legislature may, by majority vote, amend, add, or repeal provisions to further reduce the penalties for offenses it addresses. This bill would instead authorize a person to petition or apply for a reduction of sentence before November 4, 2022, or at a later date upon a showing of good cause. Because the bill would extend the period of time in which a person could file a petition or application without a showing of good cause, the bill would amend the act and would require a 23 vote of the Legislature."
