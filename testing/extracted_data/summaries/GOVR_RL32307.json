    "content": "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes funding for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), the Department of the Interior's Bureau ofReclamation (BOR), most of the Department of Energy (DOE), and a number of independentagencies. The Bush Administration requested $27.94 billion for these programs for FY2005,compared with $27.26 billion appropriated for FY2004 ( P.L. 108-137 , and rescissions included in P.L. 108-199 ). On June 16 the House Appropriations Committee reported out its bill( H.R. 4614 ) with $27.99 billion, and the bill passed the House on June 25. The Senatedid not report out a separate Energy and Water Appropriations bill, and funding for these programsof $28.49 billion was included as Division C of the omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act( H.R. 4818 , P.L. 108-447 ). Key issues involving these programs included: funding and progress of major water/ecosystem restoration initiatives such as Florida Everglades and California \"Bay-Delta\" (CALFED); funding for the proposed national nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada; funding for developing a new nuclear warhead, the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator and for a \"Modern Pit Facility\" to build nuclear weapons components;and plans to reduce the time necessary to prepare the Nevada Test Site to resume nuclear weapons testing. Funding for the Yucca Mountain project was a major issue that prevented passage of a stand-alone bill, and the possibility of a year-long continuing resolution for Energy and Waterprograms was widely discussed. However, appropriators agreed in the omnibus bill to fund theproject at the same level as in FY2004. Part of the funding for Yucca Mountain came from thecontroversial Nuclear Earth Penetrator and pit facility and the upgrading of the Nevada Test Site,which were cut from the budget.
