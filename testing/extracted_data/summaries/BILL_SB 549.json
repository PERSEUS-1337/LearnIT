    "title": "SB 549",
    "content": "The California Constitution authorizes the Legislature to permit private, nonprofit, eligible organizations to conduct raffles as a funding mechanism to support beneficial and charitable works, if, among other conditions, at least 90 of the gross receipts from the raffle go directly to beneficial or charitable purposes in California. The California Constitution further authorizes the Legislature to amend the percentage of gross receipts required to be dedicated to beneficial or charitable purposes by a statute passed by a 23 vote of each house of the Legislature. Existing statutory law implements those provisions and requires the Department of Justice to administer and enforce those provisions. This bill would authorize a major league sports raffle at a home game conducted by an eligible organization, as defined, for the purpose of directly supporting specified beneficial or charitable purposes in California, or financially supporting another private, nonprofit, eligible organization, as defined, that performs those purposes if, among other requirements, each ticket sold contains a unique and matching identifier, 50 of the gross receipts generated from the sale of raffle tickets are used to benefit or provide support for beneficial or charitable purposes, as defined, the other 50 is paid to the winner, and the winners of the prizes are determined by a manual draw, as specified. The bill would authorize an electronic device to be used to sell tickets. The bill would prohibit the use of a random number generator for the manual draw or sale of tickets. This bill would define an eligible organization as a private, nonprofit organization established by, or affiliated with, a team from specified sports organizations that has been qualified to conduct business in California for at least one year before conducting a raffle and is exempt from taxation pursuant to specified provisions of federal and California law. The bill would require, if an eligible organization conducts a raffle for purposes of financially supporting another private, nonprofit, eligible organization, the eligible organization conducting the raffle to distribute to the other eligible organization all proceeds not paid out to the winners within 15 days of conducting the raffle. The bill would require an eligible organization to disclose to all ticket purchasers the designated private, nonprofit organization for which the raffle is being conducted. This bill would also prohibit an eligible organization from conducting a raffle, and a manufacturer or distributor of raffle-related products or services from conducting business with an eligible organization for purposes of conducting a raffle pursuant to these provisions, without first having obtained and thereafter maintained a registration from the Department of Justice, as specified. Once registered, the bill would require an eligible organization to file annually thereafter with the department a report that includes specified information for each of the eligible organization\u2019s last 3 fiscal years, and would require the department to make those reports available online, as provided. This bill would require the department to adopt, on or before June 1, 2016, regulations to enforce these provisions, would authorize the department to assess annual registration fees, as specified, to be deposited in the General Fund to cover the reasonable costs of establishing and operating this registration system, and would require the department to maintain a database of registrants and conduct specified proceedings in compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act. The bill would repeal its provisions on December 31, 2018."
