Designates each center as an Ovarian Cancer Biomarker Center of Excellence. Allows federal payments under such an agreement or grant to be used for research on: (1) the development and characterization of new biomarkers and the refinement of existing biomarkers, (2) the clinical and laboratory validation of such biomarkers. (3) the development and implementation of clinical and epidemiological research on the utilization of such biomarkers. And (4) the development and implementation of repositories for new tissue, urine, serum, and other biological specimens. Requires the Director to: (1) make available for research banked serum and tissue specimens from clinical research regarding ovarian cancer that was funded by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). (2) establish an Ovarian Cancer Biomarker Clinical Trial Committee to assist the Director to design and implement national clinical trials to determine the utility of such biomarkers. And (3) establish a national data center to conduct statistical analyses of trial data."
