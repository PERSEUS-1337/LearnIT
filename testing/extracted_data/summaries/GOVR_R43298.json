    "content": "The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014, P.L. 113-121) became law on June 10, 2014. The conference report, H.Rept. 113-449, resolved differences between H.R. 3080, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2013 (WRRDA 2013), and S. 601, the Water Resources Development Act of 2013 (WRDA 2013). Both bills represented omnibus authorization legislation for water resource activities, principally associated with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). Authorizing and Deauthorizing Projects. WRRDA 2014 authorized 34 construction projects totaling $25.65 billion ($15.64 billion federal, $10.01 billion nonfederal). It established expedited House and Senate procedures for bills authorizing construction projects meeting specified criteria. It requires an annual report from the Administration identifying proposed new studies, completed feasibility reports, and project modification reports. WRRDA 2014 also authorized a process to deauthorize previously authorized projects with federal costs to complete totaling $18 billion; the process will be led by the Administration, with opportunities for public input and congressional disapproval. Expediting Studies, Environmental Reviews, and Permits. The conference report, like H.R. 3080 and S. 601, aimed to expedite Corps studies and compliance with applicable environmental laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). It raised the project cost trigger for independent peer review of feasibility studies from $45 million to $200 million. Expanding Project Delivery and Financing Opportunities. The conference report, like H.R. 3080 and S. 601, encouraged nonfederal opportunities in delivering water resources projects. It expanded opportunities for crediting for nonfederal work, financial, and study and project management. Like S. 601, the conference report established a pilot program known as the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) to finance water infrastructure projects. The Corps and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are responsible for administering the WIFIA pilot program. Investing in Navigation. WRRDA 2014 encouraged increased spending from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF). It modified prioritization of HMTF funding among different types of harbors but retains similar provisions contained in H.R. 3080 and S. 601 reserving certain portions of funds to harbors with less cargo. The conference report, like H.R. 3080 and S. 601, did not enact changes to inland waterway revenues in general but increased the threshold for major rehabilitation efforts on inland waterways, authorized changes to waterway project delivery, and altered the cost-share for one project (Olmsted Locks and Dam). These changes may increase the likelihood of Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) monies being available for use on other inland waterway construction projects. Reducing Flood Risks. WRRDA 2014 authorized establishment of a levee safety initiative\u2014a scaled-down version of S. 601 provisions\u2014expanding Corps technical assistance and training to promote levee safety, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assistance in establishing or improving state and tribal levee safety programs, and Corps levee rehabilitation assistance. Like H.R. 3080 and S. 601, WRRDA 2014 required the Corps to develop national levee safety guidelines and review. Restoring and Protecting Aquatic Ecosystems. WRRDA 2014 provided congressional direction on various efforts for regional river and coastal restoration (e.g., Chesapeake Bay, North Atlantic coastal restoration) and authorized the construction of projects which have previously been studied in the Everglades and Coastal Louisiana, among other places. It also added to Corps authorities for the prevention, control, and eradication of invasive species. Addressing Other Issues. WRRDA 2014 included provisions amending the applicability of the scope of the Environmental Protection Agency's oil spill prevention, control, and countermeasure regulations, by exempting certain farms from the requirements. It also included amendments to certain water infrastructure provisions of the Clean Water Act (CWA). These CWA provisions, while representing the first amendments to CWA Title VI since 1987, did not address many of the more long-standing or controversial CWA issues. WRRDA 2014 did not include the ocean-related provisions of H.R. 3080 and S. 601. Instead, it authorized the Corps studies and limited construction of Corps projects to enhance ocean and coastal ecosystem resiliency."
