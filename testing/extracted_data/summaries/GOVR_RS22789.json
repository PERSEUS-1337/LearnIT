    "content": "The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007 (H.R. 3887), passed by the House on December 4, 2007, continues and reenforces the anti-trafficking efforts that began with Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. That legislation sought to protect the women and children most often the victims of both international and domestic trafficking with a series of diplomatic, immigration, and law enforcement initiatives. H.R. 3887 follows in its path. This report is limited to the bill's law enforcement initiatives or more precisely its proposals to amend federal criminal law. Representative Lantos introduced H.R. 3887 on October 17, 2007, for himself and several other Members. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs reported an amended version of the bill on November 6, 2007. A further revised version passed under suspension of the rules on December 4, 2007. When the bill reached the Senate its criminal law proposals included newly assigned sex trafficking offenses, a sex tourism offense, a coerced services offense, obstruction of justice offenses, an importation of prostitutes offense, a false statement offense, and provisions for civil liability, victim assistance, forfeiture, extraterritorial jurisdiction, Justice Department reorganization, and a model state statute. This is an abridged version of CRS Report RL34323, William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007 (H.R. 3887 as Passed by the House): Criminal Law Provisions, by [author name scrubbed] without the footnotes, quotations, or citations to authority found in the longer report."
