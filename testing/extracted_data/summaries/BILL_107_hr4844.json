    "content": "Wild Sky Wilderness Act of 2002 - Designates certain lands in the Skykomish River valley, Washington, as the Wild Sky Wilderness, to be managed by the Secretary of Agriculture. Directs the Secretary to establish a hiking trail plan. Authorizes the use of helicopter access to construct and maintain a joint Forest Service and Snohomish County repeater site, in compliance with a Forest Service approved communications site plan, to improve communication for safety, health, and emergency services. Authorizes the use of floatplanes on Lake Isabel where such use has already become established. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire specified priority acquisition lands by purchase, donation, or exchange. Directs that the boundaries of the Snoqualmie National Forest and the Wild Sky Wilderness be adjusted to encompass any lands so acquired. Directs the Secretary to assure adequate access to private in-holdings within the Wild Sky Wilderness. States that valuation of private lands shall be determined without reference to any restrictions on access or use which arise out of designation as a wilderness area. Requires the Secretary to exchange specified lands with the Chelan County Public Utility District if the District offers to the Secretary lands within the Snoqualmie National Forest, Washington, in exchange for a permanent easement, including helicopter access, consistent with such levels as used as of the date of this Act's enactment, to maintain an existing snowtel site on land within the Wenatchee National Forest, Washington. Sets forth conditions for consummation of the exchange and for reversion to the United States if the District no longer needs to maintain a snowtel site."
