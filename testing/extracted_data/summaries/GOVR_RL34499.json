    "content": "While many young people have access to emotional and financial support systems throughout their early adult years, older youth in foster care and those who are emancipated from care often lack such security. This can be an obstacle for them in developing independent living skills and building supports that might ease their transition to adulthood. Older foster youth who return to their parents or guardians may continue to experience poor family dynamics or lack supports, and studies have shown that recently emancipated foster youth fare poorly relative to their counterparts in the general population on measures such as education and employment. The federal government recognizes that older youth in foster care and those who have been emancipated, or aged out, are vulnerable to negative outcomes and may ultimately return to the care of the state as adults through the public welfare, criminal justice, or other systems. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers the primary federal programs that are targeted to these youth. These include the federal foster care program and the John H. Chafee Program for Successful Transition to Adulthood program (\"Chafee program\"), both of which are authorized under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Foster care is a temporary living arrangement intended to ensure a child's safety and well-being until a permanent home can be re-established or newly established. Under the Title IV-E foster care program, a public child welfare agency must work to ensure that each child who enters foster care is safely returned to his/her parents, or, if this is determined not to be possible or appropriate (by a court), to find a new permanent home for the child. Jurisdictions (states, territories, and tribes) may seek reimbursement for youth to remain in care up to age 21. Approximately half of all states extend care to that age. In addition, the foster care program has certain protections for older youth. For example, jurisdictions must annually obtain the credit report of each youth in care who is age 14 and older. They must also assist youth with developing a transition plan that is in place 90 days before aging out. The law requires that a youth's caseworker\u2014and as appropriate, other representative(s) of the youth\u2014assist and support him/her in developing the plan. The law requires that the plan be guided by the youth, and should include specific options on housing, health insurance, education, local opportunities for mentors, and other supports. The Chafee program provides supports and services to youth ages 14 to 21 who are or were in foster care (with some exceptions). Youth in states that extend foster care to age 21 can be served under the program until age 23. The program authorizes funds to be used for providing assistance in obtaining a high school diploma, career exploration, training in daily living skills, training in budgeting and financial management skills, and preventive health activities, among other purposes. States must meet certain requirements, including that not more than 30% of Chafee funds are used for room and board expenses. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher (ETV) provides funding for Chafee-eligible youth to attend institutions of higher education. Youth can receive up to $5,000 annually for up to five years (consecutive or nonconsecutive) until they reach age 26. The Chafee law directs HHS to collect outcome and other information for current and former foster youth, and HHS established the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) for this purpose. Along with the foster care and Chafee programs, other federal programs are intended to help youth currently and formerly in foster care make the transition to adulthood. Federal law authorizes funding for states and local jurisdictions to provide workforce support and housing to older foster youth and youth emancipating from care. Further, beginning on January 1, 2014, eligible young people who were in foster care at age 18 are covered under a mandatory Medicaid pathway until age 26. Youth in foster care or recently emancipated youth are also specifically eligible for certain educational supports."
