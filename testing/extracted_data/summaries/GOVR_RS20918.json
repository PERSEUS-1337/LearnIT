    "content": "One way that federal law regulates groups participating in election activities is by requiring them to report information on such things as their contributions and expenditures. Reporting requirements are imposed on \"political organizations\" by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and \"political committees\" by the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA). Some of the requirements are similar; in which case, entities are generally subject to either the ones in the IRC (and report to the Internal Revenue Service) or those in FECA (and report to the Federal Election Commission). Included in the entities that report to the IRS are those colloquially known as \"527s\" or \"527 groups.\" No legislation has yet been introduced in the 111th Congress that would affect the timing of the reporting requirements under the IRC or FECA."
