    "content": "Fair Trade Accessibility and Accountability Act of 2017 This bill directs the Department of Commerce to provide financial assistance to small firms to assist them in preparing and filing petitions to obtain the remedies and benefits available under the Tariff Act of 1930 relating to the imposition of countervailing and antidumping duties investigations. Commerce shall review an application for assistance submitted by a small firm based on the firm's ability-to-pay and its economic impact in its local community. The amount of such assistance is capped. The bill amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to modify criteria for determining industry support for petitions in countervailing and antidumping duties investigations. A US business enterprise may file a petition with the Senate Committee on Finance or the House Committee on Ways and Means to determine whether or not a foreign country has violated its obligations under any trade agreement to which the United States is a party. Any good listed on a General Services Administration federal supply schedule described as made in America must have all or virtually all of the good and component parts made in the United States. Suppliers of any good not in compliance with Made in America requirements are subject to civil penalties."
