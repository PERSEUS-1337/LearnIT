    "content": "The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), a wholly owned U.S. government corporation, is referred to as the U.S. development finance institution (DFI). It provides political risk insurance, project and investment funds financing, and other services to promote U.S. direct investment in developing countries and emerging economies that will have a development impact. It operates under the foreign policy guidance of the Secretary of State. OPIC's governing legislation is the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. \u00a72191 et seq.). Congress periodically has extended OPIC's authority to conduct its programs. Over the past several years, Congress has extended OPIC's authority through appropriations law, most recently through April 28, 2017 (FY2017 further continuing resolution, P.L. 114-254). The last multi-year, stand-alone reauthorization took place in 2003 with legislation extending OPIC's authority until September 30, 2007 (P.L. 108-158). Congress also has appropriations, oversight, and other legislative responsibilities related to OPIC. OPIC's programs are intended to promote U.S. private investment in developing countries by mitigating risks, such as political risks (including currency inconvertibility, expropriation, and political violence). Its financing and insurance are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Congress places statutory requirements on OPIC's activities, such as those related to the economic and environmental impacts of projects. OPIC support is available in over 160 countries around the world and across a range of economic sectors. According to OPIC, it extended $4.4 billion in financing and insurance commitments in FY2015. OPIC also reported a record high total exposure of nearly $20 billion at the end of that year. OPIC estimates that since its inception in 1974, it has contributed to about $80 billion in U.S. exports and supported over 280,000 U.S. jobs. The international context in which OPIC operates has evolved. Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows have overtaken official development assistance (ODA) flows as a primary source of external financing to developing countries. DFIs are playing a more active role in supporting private sector capital flows to developing countries. The composition of DFI players, historically dominated by developed countries, also has evolved, with emerging markets such as China becoming more prominent. OPIC states that it operates on a \"self-sustaining basis,\" using its own revenues, which include user fees and interest from U.S. Treasury securities. Congress annually sets in legislation OPIC's maximum spending levels for its administrative and program expenses. The FY2016 appropriations act provided $62.8 million for OPIC's administrative expenses to carry out its credit and insurance programs and a transfer of $20 million from its noncredit account for credit program costs. In FY2016, OPIC had a staff of 289 full-time equivalents (estimate). OPIC presents a number of possible issues for Congress, a key one being whether to renew OPIC's authority and, if so, under what terms. Supporters highlight OPIC's role in filling gaps in private sector investment financing and political risk insurance and helping to level the playing field for U.S. businesses vis-\u00e0-vis foreign competitors, while critics argue that OPIC is a form of \"corporate welfare,\" with the private sector better suited to conduct such services, and question OPIC's development benefits. Other issues include OPIC's financial product offerings, policies, activity composition, and organizational structure."
