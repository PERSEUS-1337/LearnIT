    "content": "P.L. 114-94, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, was signed by President Obama on December 4, 2015. The act reauthorizes federal highway and mass transit programs through the end of FY2020. It also authorizes to be appropriated about $305 billion for these programs, an increase of about 4.2% over current funding levels plus projected inflation for highway programs and 7.9% over current funding levels plus projected inflation for public transportation programs. Although the federal presence, and influence, on surface transportation policy remains significant, FAST is a continuation of previous reauthorizations' emphasis on increasing state decisionmaking authority. For example, FAST provides states greater flexibility in the use of federal highway assistance by converting the Surface Transportation Program (STP) into a block grant; rolling the Transportation Alternatives Program into the STP and allowing 50% of local government transportation alternatives funding to be used on any STP-eligible project; and consolidating truck and bus safety grant programs. FAST also includes changes to the project delivery approval process in an effort to reduce the average project delivery time for highway and mass transit construction projects. For many years, state and local government officials have lobbied for increased federal assistance for surface transportation grants and increased flexibility in the use of those funds. They argue that they are better able to identify surface transportation needs in their states than federal officials and are capable of administering federal grant funds with relatively minimal federal oversight. They also argue that states have a long history of learning from one another. In their view, providing states added flexibility in the use of federal funds results in better surface transportation policy because it enables states to experiment with innovative solutions to surface transportation problems and then share their experiences with other states. Others argue that the federal government has a responsibility to ensure that federal funds are used in the most efficient and effective manner possible to promote the national interest in expanding national economic growth and protecting the environment. In their view, providing states increased flexibility in the use of federal funds diminishes the federal government's ability to ensure that national needs are met. Still others have argued for a fundamental restructuring of federal and state government responsibilities in surface transportation policy, with some responsibilities devolved to states and others remaining with the federal government. This report provides a historical perspective on contemporary federalism issues in surface transportation policy since the beginning of the nation. It includes a discussion of the five multi-year reauthorizations of the Federal-Highway Act since 1987: 1. the $151 billion, six-year Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA; P.L. 102-240) signed by President George H. W. Bush on December 18, 1991. 2. the $203.4 billion, six-year Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21; P.L. 105-178) signed by President Bill Clinton on June 9, 1998. 3. the $286 billion, six-year Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA; P.L. 109-59) signed by President George W. Bush on August 10, 2005. 4. the $118 billion ($105.2 billion for FY2013 and FY2014), 27-month, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141) signed by President Barack Obama on July 6, 2012. 5. the $305 billion, five-year Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST; P.L. 114-94), signed by President Barack Obama on December 4, 2015."
