    "title": "AB 282",
    "content": "Existing law generally regulates various business activities and practices, including the sale within the state of cribs and bunk beds intended for use by children. This bill would, beginning January 1, 2018, make it unlawful to sell to a purchaser located in the state a corded window covering. The bill would define \u201ccorded window covering\u201d as a window covering, including, but not limited to, blinds, curtains, draperies, and shades, that has an accessible cord, and would define \u201caccessible cord\u201d as any cord determined to be accessible pursuant to the 2012 American National Standard for Safety of Corded Window Covering Products adopted by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission and any successor standards. Existing law provides for the licensing and regulation of community care facilities, including, among others, residential facilities, foster family homes, certified family homes, and group homes by the State Department of Social Services. Existing law also provides for the licensing and regulation of child day care facilities by the department. A person who violates a law relating to community care facilities, or who willfully or repeatedly violates a law relating to child day care facilities, is guilty of a misdemeanor. This bill would prohibit a community care facility or child day care facility that serves children under 6 years of age from installing a corded window covering in the facility. The bill would also require those facilities to remove all corded window coverings or retrofit the corded window coverings as soon as is reasonably possible with repair kits, as specified, by January 1, 2019. The bill would also authorize the department to require those facilities to replace existing corded window coverings, as specified, if a person or facility fails to comply with the above provisions. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would also make related findings and declarations. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. make specified findings and would declare the intent of the Legislature to subsequently amend this bill to enact legislation to protect children from the preventable strangulation hazard posed by cords on window coverings by adopting standards that provide for safer window coverings in California."
