    "title": "An act to\namend Section 1367 of\nadd Section 1367.255 to\nthe Health and Safety Code, relating to health\ncare.\ncare coverage.",
    "content": "Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care. Under existing law, the Director of Managed Health Care may, after appropriate notice and opportunity for a hearing, by order suspend or revoke a license issued under the act or assess administrative penalties if the director determines that the licensee has committed an act or omission constituting grounds for disciplinary action. This bill would provide that a health care service plan is not required to include abortion as a covered benefit. The bill would prohibit the director from denying a license, or disciplining a licensee, on the basis that the plan excludes coverage for abortions. Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care. Existing law requires health care service plans and, if applicable, specialized health care service plans, to meet specified criteria, including requiring the appropriate licensure of facilities and personnel. Willful violation of that act a crime. This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions."
