    "title": "AB 2762",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the creation of statewide and local transportation agencies, which may be established as joint powers authorities or established expressly by statute. Existing law establishes the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, which is authorized to acquire, construct, own, operate, control, or use rights-of-way, rail lines, bus lines, stations, platforms, switches, yards, terminals, parking lots, and any and all other facilities necessary or convenient for rapid transit service. This bill would establish the Altamont Pass Regional Rail Authority for purposes of planning and delivering a cost effective and responsive interregional rail connection between the Bay Area Rapid Transit District\u2019s rapid transit system and the Altamont Corridor Express in the Tri-Valley, within the City of Livermore, that meets the goals and objectives of the community. The bill would require the authority\u2019s governing board to be composed of 12 representatives and would authorize the authority to appoint an executive who may appoint staff or retain consultants. The bill would provide specified authorizations and duties to the authority. This bill would require all unencumbered moneys dedicated for the completion of the connection to be transferred to the authority. The bill would require the Bay Area Rapid Transit District to assume ownership of all physical improvements, and to assume operational control, maintenance responsibilities, and related financial obligations for the connection, upon its completion. The bill would require the Department of Transportation to expedite reviews and requests related to the connection. The bill would require the authority to provide a project update report to the public, to be posted on the authority\u2019s Internet Web site, on the development and implementation of the connection. By imposing new duties on local governmental entities, this bill would create a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions. Existing law, until January 1, 2021, prohibits a toll from being imposed on the passage of a pedestrian or bicycle over any bridge that is part of the state highway system, as specified. This bill would extend that prohibition until January 1, 2022."
