    "content": "Requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to prescribe regulations under which a lump-sum credit for an employee's or Member's retirement contributions shall not be paid without the consent of the employee's or Member's spouse and former spouse where OPM has received information or documentation that a court order bars payment of the credit in order to preserve the court's ability to award a survivor or former spouse's annuity, or that payment of the credit would extinguish the spouse's or former spouse's entitlement, under a court order on file, to such an annuity."
