    "content": "Recreational Boating Safety Improvement Act of 1994 - Amends Federal boating safety law to prohibit a person from operating a recreational vessel under 26 feet in length unless each individual 12 years or younger wears a personal flotation device while on the vessel's deck. Declares that such prohibition shall not be construed to limit a State's authority to establish more stringent requirements for the wearing of personal flotation devices on recreational vessels. Sets forth a formula for the allocation of State recreational boating safety program funds based upon State adoption of laws prohibiting the operation of recreational vessels while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to submit to specified congressional committees a plan to increase reporting of vessel accidents to appropriate State law enforcement officials. Establishes penalties for violation of reporting requirements. Declares that any individual operating a recreational vessel in a negligent manner shall complete a boating safety course approved by the Secretary. Declares that any person operating a recreational vessel in violation of Federal shipping code recreational boating provisions may be ordered to complete a qualified recreational boating safety course."
