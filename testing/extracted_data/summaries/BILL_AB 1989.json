    "title": "AB 1989",
    "content": "Existing law, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases. Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the State Air Resources Board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of a market-based compliance mechanism relative to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for specified purposes, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions associated with water use and supply. The state board is required to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 to be achieved by 2020. This bill would require the State Water Resources Control Board, in coordination with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Department of Water Resources, to develop and implement a grant and low-interest loan program for water projects that result in the net reduction of water-related greenhouse gas emissions. The bill would continuously appropriate $200,000,000 annually from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to the State Water Resources Control Board to develop and implement the grant and low-interest loan program."
