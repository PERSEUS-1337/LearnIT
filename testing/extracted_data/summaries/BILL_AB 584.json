    "title": "AB 584",
    "content": "Existing law creates the Joint Legislative Retirement Committee, prescribes the composition of the committee, and requires the committee to study and review the benefits, programs, actuarial condition, practices, investments and procedures of, and all legislation relating to, retirement systems for public officers and employees in this state as well as trends in the field of retirement. Existing law requires a copy of each bill that affects any public employee retirement system to be transmitted to the committee. Existing law requires the committee to establish a board of experts, the composition of which is prescribed, and to retain an independent actuary as a consultant to the board of experts. Existing law makes a statement of legislative findings in this regard. This bill would rename the committee the Joint Pension Administration and Sustainability Committee and, in addition to the duties described above, would require the committee to make reports and recommendations to the Legislature and its respective houses on these retirement issues. The bill would revise the composition of the committee to reflect current legislative practice. The bill would require the committee to transmit an analysis for each bill submitted to it, including an actuarial opinion if appropriate, to the policy committee that is responsible for the bill. The bill would require the committee to retain a legal advisor recognized for expertise in pension and investment law and an academician from a California university with recognized expertise in investing, pension administration, and the operation of financial markets to act as consultants to its board of experts. The bill would revise the statement of legislative findings associated with these provisions."
