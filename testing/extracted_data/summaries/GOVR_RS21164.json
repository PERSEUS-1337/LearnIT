    "content": "The debate over a possible reduction in federal highway program spending duringFY2003 has ended. Congress haschosen to overrule provisions of law that would have reduced the FY2003 spending level to $23.2 billion, and hasinstead settled on $31.8 billion, the same asthe FY2002 level. In early 2002, it appeared that a major reduction in highway program spending was in the offing.An Office of Management and Budgetcalculation in the President's budget indicated that the RABA adjustment for FY2003 would be negative. TheAdministration and Congress were not proposinga cutback. Rather a complex financing mechanism known as Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) wasproving the famous law of unintendedconsequences. Predictions made at the time RABA was created by the Transportation Equity Act for the21st Century as amended (TEA-21)( P.L. 105-178 & P.L. 105-206 ) saw it as an ever growing source of funding for the highway program, even though RABA was createdwith the possibility of a downwardadjustment. RABA provided the highway program with almost $9 billion in additional financing during the yearsFY2000 through FY2002. Congressionalaction in the 2nd Session of the 107th Congress precluded this downward adjustment,at least in part, and the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003 ( P.L.108-7 ) guaranteed that funding would remain at the FY2002 level. This report will not be updated."
