    "title": "An act to amend Sections 25500.5, 25514, 25514.5, and 25516 of the Public Resources Code, and to amend Section 740.3 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to electricity.",
    "content": "The Warren-Alquist State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Act establishes the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission and requires it to certify sufficient sites and related facilities that are required to provide a supply of electricity sufficient to accommodate projected demand for electricity in that commission\u2019s most recent forecast of statewide and service area electricity demand. This bill would make nonsubstantive revisions to the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission\u2019s certification requirements. Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission, in cooperation with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, the State Air Resources Board, air quality management districts and air pollution control districts, electrical and gas corporations, and the motor vehicle industry, to evaluate and implement policies to promote the development of equipment and infrastructure needed to facilitate the use of electricity and natural gas to fuel low-emission vehicles. This bill would make nonsubstantive revisions to these requirements of the Public Utilities Commission."
