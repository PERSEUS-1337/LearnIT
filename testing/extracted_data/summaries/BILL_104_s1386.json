    "content": "Small Business Metrification Amendments of 1995 - Amends the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 to define specified terms, including hard metric conversion and soft metric conversion. Prohibits Federal agencies from: (1) using construction or procurement guidelines that require the use of a hard-metric conversion or product. And (2) establishing bidding requirements or preferences for federally-assisted construction contracts that mandate the use of hard-metric products if soft-metric production is feasible, and, as certified by an industry representative, hard-metric alternatives are not readily available, would exceed specified capital costs, and would result in negligible trade benefits."
