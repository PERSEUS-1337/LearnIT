Requires the Director of the National Park Service, or his or her designee, to represent the Secretary on the Farmington River Coordinating Committee provided for in the Plan. Requires the Secretary to offer to enter into cooperative agreements with the State of Connecticut and its relevant political subdivisions in order to provide for the long-term protection, preservation, and enhancement of the segment and to make a similar offer to the Farmington River Watershed Association. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter into cooperative agreements with other parties who may be represented on the Committee. And (2) provide technical assistance, staff support, and funding to assist in implementation of the Plan.
