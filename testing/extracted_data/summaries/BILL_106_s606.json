Limits agent or attorney recovery fees to 15 percent of such sums. Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit and set penalties for teaching or demonstrating the making or use of an explosive, destructive device, or weapon of mass destruction, or distributing information pertaining to its manufacture or use, with or knowing of the intent that the information be used for a Federal crime of violence. Requires the Secretary to pay to the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin, in full satisfaction of any claims that the Tribe may have against the United States, a specified sum for damages sustained by the Tribe by reason of: (1) the enactment and implementation of a Federal statute providing for a per capita distribution of Menominee tribal funds and authorizing the withdrawal of the Tribe from Federal jurisdiction. And (2) the mismanagement by the United States of tribe assets held in trust by the United States before April 30, 1961, the effective termination date of Federal supervision of the Tribe. Provides that such payment shall have the status of a judgment of the United States Court of Federal Claims for purposes of the Indian Tribal Judgment Funds Use or Distribution Act and shall be made in accordance with the requirements of that Act on the condition that, of the amounts remaining after payment of attorney's fees and litigation expenses: (1) at least 30 percent shall be distributed on a per capita basis. And (2) the balance shall be set aside and programmed to serve tribal needs, including educational, economic development, and health care programs. Limits agent or attorney recovery fees to 15 percent of sums paid."
