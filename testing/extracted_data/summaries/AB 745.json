    "title": "An act to amend Section 5845 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to mental health.",
    "content": "Existing law, the Mental Health Services Act, an initiative measure enacted by the voters as Proposition 63 at the November 2, 2004, statewide general election, establishes the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission, and requires the commission to consist of 16 voting members, including, among others, two persons with a severe mental illness and a mental health professional, all appointed by the Governor. The act may be amended by the Legislature by a 23 vote of both houses and only so long as the amendment is consistent with and furthers the intent of the act. The Legislature may clarify procedures and terms of the act by majority vote. The bill would require the Governor to appoint an additional member to the commission who has experience providing supportive housing to persons with a severe mental illness. The bill would state the findings and declarations of the Legislature that this change is consistent with and furthers the intent of the act."
