Each Review must: (1) establish integrated, governmentwide national energy objectives in the context of economic, environmental, and security priorities. And (2) consider reasonable estimates of future federal budgetary resources when making recommendations. The President's report to Congress on the Review must address an integrated view of short-, intermediate-, and long-term objectives for federal energy policy. The Secretary of Energy shall give each Review necessary analytical, financial, and administrative support as requested by the cochairpersons."
