    "title": "AB 691",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the disposition of a testator\u2019s property by will. Existing law also provides for the disposition of that portion of a decedent\u2019s estate not disposed of by will. Existing law provides that the decedent\u2019s property, including property devised by a will, is generally subject to probate administration, except as specified. This bill would enact the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act, which would authorize a decedent\u2019s personal representative or trustee to access and manage digital assets and electronic communications, as specified. The bill would authorize a person to use an online tool to give directions to the custodian of his or her digital assets regarding the disclosure of those assets. The bill would specify that, if a person has not used an online tool to give that direction, he or she may give direction regarding the disclosure of digital assets in a will, trust, power of attorney, or other record. The bill would require a custodian of the digital assets to comply with a fiduciary\u2019s request for disclosure of digital assets or to terminate an account, except under certain circumstances, including when the decedent has prohibited this disclosure using the online tool. The bill would make custodians immune from liability for an act or omission done in good faith in compliance with these provisions."
