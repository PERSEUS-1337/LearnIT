    "title": "AB 1103",
    "content": "The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, administered by the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, generally regulates the disposal, management, and recycling of solid waste. Existing law requires exporters, brokers, and transporters of recyclables or compost to submit periodic information to the department on the types, quantities, and destinations of materials that are disposed of, sold, or transferred. This bill would additionally require a self-hauler to submit that information to the department and would require the department to develop regulations that define \u201cself-hauler\u201d to include specified persons and entities."
