    "content": "P.L. 104-193, the 1996 welfare reform law, substantively changed the rules governinghow child support collections are distributed among families, states, and the federal government. The general rulesin effect as ofOctober 1, 2000 are that child support collected during the time a family receives cash welfare belongs to the state;current childsupport and arrearages (past-due payments) that are owed to a family that is no longer receiving welfare belongsto the family; andchild support owed to a family that never received welfare belongs to the family. This is referred to as the \"familiesfirst\" childsupport distribution policy. (These \"families first\" distribution rules do not apply to child support collections madeby interceptingfederal income tax refunds.) Many policymakers contend that Congress should simplify the child supportdistribution system whichcurrently requires the tracking of six categories of arrearage payments to properly pay custodial parents. Legislationthat includedprovisions to simplify child support distribution procedures and provide more of the child support collected tocustodial parents(rather than the government) was passed by the House in the 106th and 107th Congresses, but not by the Senate. Similar legislation hasbeen reintroduced as part of the welfare reauthorization measure in the 108th Congress. This reportwill be updated as needed toreflect legislative activity."
