    "content": "Stop Iran From Smuggling Weapons to Terrorists Act This bill authorizes the Department of Defense (DOD) to provide training to: (1) the national military or other security forces of Israel, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, and Qatar that have among their functional responsibilities maritime security missions. And (2) ministry, agency, and headquarters level organizations for such forces. Such assistance and training may be referred to as the Counter Iran Maritime Initiative. Such training: (1) may include the provision of de minimis equipment, supplies, and small-scale military construction. And (2) shall include the promotion of human rights and respect for legitimate civilian authority. It is the sense of Congress that DOD should seek payments from such countries to offset training costs. DOD shall negotiate a training cost-sharing agreement with a recipient country that covers at least 50 of related costs."
