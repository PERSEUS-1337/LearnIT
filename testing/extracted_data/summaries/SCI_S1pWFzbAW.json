Model compression methods effectively reduce the memory requirements of these models, usually through applying transformations such as weight pruning or quantization. In this paper, we present a novel scheme for lossy weight encoding which complements conventional compression techniques. The encoding is based on the Bloomier filter, a probabilistic data structure that can save space at the cost of introducing random errors. Leveraging the ability of neural networks to tolerate these imperfections and by re-training around the errors, the proposed technique, Weightless, can compress DNN weights by up to 496x; with the same model accuracy, this results in up to a 1.51x improvement over the state-of-the-art. The continued success of deep neural networks (DNNs) comes with increasing demands on compute, memory, and networking resources. Moreover, the correlation between model size and accuracy suggests that tomorrow's networks will only grow larger. This growth presents a challenge for resource-constrained platforms such as mobile phones and wireless sensors. As new hardware now enables executing DNN inferences on these devices BID0 Qualcomm, 2017) , a practical issue that remains is reducing the burden of distributing the latest models especially in regions of the world not using high-bandwidth networks. For instance, it is estimated that, globally, 800 million users will be using 2G networks by 2020 BID11 , which can take up to 30 minutes to download just 20MB of data. By contrast, today's DNNs are on the order of tens to hundreds of MBs, making them difficult to distribute. In addition to network bandwidth, storage capacity on resource-constrained devices is limited, as more applications look to leverage DNNs. Thus, in order to support state-of-the-art deep learning methods on edge devices, methods to reduce the size of DNN models without sacrificing model accuracy are needed.Model compression is a popular solution for this problem. A variety of compression algorithms have been proposed in recent years and many exploit the intrinsic redundancy in model weights. Broadly speaking, the majority of this work has focused on ways of simplifying or eliminating weight values (e.g., through weight pruning and quantization), while comparatively little effort has been spent on devising techniques for encoding and compressing.In this paper we propose a novel lossy encoding method, Weightless, based on Bloomier filters, a probabilistic data structure BID5 . Bloomier filters inexactly store a function map, and by adjusting the filter parameters, we can elect to use less storage space at the cost of an increasing chance of erroneous values. We use this data structure to compactly encode the weights of a neural network, exploiting redundancy in the weights to tolerate some errors. In conjunction with existing weight simplification techniques, namely pruning and clustering, our approach dramatically reduces the memory and bandwidth requirements of DNNs for over the wire transmission and ondevice storage. Weightless demonstrates compression rates of up to 496\u00d7 without loss of accuracy, improving on the state of the art by up to 1.51\u00d7. Furthermore, we show that Weightless scales better with increasing sparsity, which means more sophisticated pruning methods yield even more benefits.This work demonstrates the efficacy of compressing DNNs with lossy encoding using probabilistic data structures. Even after the same aggressive lossy simplification steps of weight pruning and clustering (see Section 2), there is still sufficient extraneous information left in model weights to allow an approximate encoding scheme to substantially reduce the memory footprint without loss of model accuracy. Section 3 reviews Bloomier filters and details Weightless. State-of-the-art compression results using Weightless are presented in Section 4. Finally, in Section 4.3 shows that Weightless scales better as networks become more sparse compared to the previous best solution. This paper demonstrates a novel lossy encoding scheme, called Weightless, for compressing sparse weights in deep neural networks. The lossy property of Weightless stems from its use of the Bloomier filter, a probabilistic data structure for approximately encoding functions. By first simplifying a model with weight pruning and clustering, we transform its weights to best align with the properties of the Bloomier filter to maximize compression. Combined, Weightless achieves compression of up to 496\u00d7, improving the previous state-of-the-art by 1.51\u00d7.We also see avenues for continuing this line of research. First , as better mechanisms for pruning model weights are discovered, end-to-end compression with Weightless will improve commensurately. Second , the theory community has already developed more advanced-albeit more complicatedconstruction algorithms for Bloomier filters, which promise asymptotically better space utilization compared to the method used in this paper. Finally , by demonstrating the opportunity for using lossy encoding schemes for model compression, we hope we have opened the door for more research on encoding algorithms and novel uses of probabilistic data structures."
