Partial funding for a select few of the accounts and somegeneral provisions of the Treasury, Postal Service,Executive Office of the President, and General Government FY2001 Appropriations are included in the Departmentof Transportation FY2001 Appropriation( P.L. 106-346 , Title V, October 23, 2000) and the continuing funding resolution ( P.L. 106-275 , as amended). Twenty-one continuing resolutions providedstopgap funding during the period October 1 through December 21, 2000. There were four appropriations billswhich would have funded all or some of theaccounts usually funded through the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government FY2001 appropriations acts. The House had passed, on July 20, H.R. 4871 . The Senate had reported, on July 20, S. 2900 and, on July 26, had voted to invoke clotureto proceed with debate on H.R. 4871 . The third version, H.R. 4985 , was introduced on July 26 as a new bill and reported fromthe Legislative Branch( H.R. 4516 ) appropriations conference committee as section 1001, Division B of that conference. This billwas vetoed October 30, 2000.The Houseagreed to the conference report on H.R. 4516 September 14. On October 6, the House and Senate approvedand sent to the President, a conferenceagreement for Department of Transportation appropriations ( H.R. 4475 ). Title V partially funds ($348.4million) several of the accounts. P.L. 106-554 funds the accounts at $30.4 billion ($14.7 in mandatory funding and $15.6 in discretionary accounts). The FY2001 budget, submitted to Congresson February 7, 2000, requested $31.2 billion. The FY2000 funding totals $28.3 billion, including mandatoryfunding (reflecting scorekeeping by theCongressional Budget Office (CBO)). Incorporating the CBO scorekeeping for FY2001, the budget would havemandatory accounts funded at $14.7 billion anddiscretionary funding set at $16.5 billion. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved allocationsto the various appropriations:House--discretionary budget authority at $14.402 billion with outlays at $14.751 billion; and Senate--$14.3 billionfor budget authority and $14.566 billion foroutlays. While the congressional allocations were in disagreement with one another, they were consistently lowerthan the requested funding. P.L. 106-346 ( H.R. 4475 ) adds $348 million. The Budget and Key Policy Issues section of the report discusses both the funding provisions and policy initiatives in the funding statutes. The funding provisionsin Title V of the Department of Transportation appropriations act were critical to the success of passage of the mainfunding provisions in that compromises werereached on the main bill based on commitments to funding for the Department of the Treasury, principally theInternal Revenue Service's (IRS) STABLE programand for IRS information technology. Table 4 details the funding, in the various versions of the FY2001appropriations proposals, by account.
