    "content": "Congressional Medal for Outstanding Contributions in Math and Science Education Act of 2004 - Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish a Congressional Medal for Outstanding Contributions in Math and Science Education program. Requires the Director to annually name as finalists for medals up to: (1) 20 private entities with more than 500 employees. And (2) 20 private entities with 500 or fewer employees. Requires the Director to annually award medals from among such finalists up to: (1) five private entities with more than 500 employees. And (2) five private entities with 500 or fewer employees. Requires the Director to distribute information about the Medal recipients in a timely and efficient manner to schools, institutions of higher education, educators, parents, administrators, policy-makers, researchers, public and private entities, and the general public. Allows any entity that is a finalist or receives a medal under this section to use such information for advertising and other publicity purposes. Limits eligibility for such a medal to private entities that have: (1) whether alone or in partnership with for-profit or nonprofit entities, assisted students, teachers, administrators, or other support staff to improve student achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in a school or community. And (2) been involved in such activities in a sustained manner for at least two years with at least one elementary or secondary school. Requires the Director to establish a system for accepting applications from entities seeking to be considered for a medal under this Act. Directs that applications include at least two letters of support, which: (1) may come from teachers, professional support staff, administrators, professional or business organizations, local, county, or State Departments of Education, or any other category of persons as designated by the Director. And (2) shall describe the reasons the entity deserves the medal. Requires the Director, in selecting entities to receive medals under this Act, to give priority consideration to evidence of improved achievement in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics by students, including improved achievement by women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. Directs the Director to also consider evidence of: (1) innovative approaches to increase interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics by students, including women, minorities, and persons with disabilities, one measure of which may be an increase in the number of students enrolled in advanced courses related to such fields. (2) employee interaction with students or teachers to support and improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics learning. (3) success in positively influencing student attitudes and promoting education and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. (4) successful outreach to students, parents, and the community regarding the importance of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education to the Nation's prosperity, job creation, and standard of living, as well as future earning potential for the individual. And (5) strong and sustained commitment to the students and schools. Amends the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act to change the deadline for submission to Congress of the NSF report on women and minorities in science and engineering from even-numbered to odd-numbered years. Authorizes appropriations to NSF."
