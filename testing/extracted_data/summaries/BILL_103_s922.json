    "content": "Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act - Amends the Federal judicial code to require the appropriate authority of each State to enforce according to its terms a child support order made by a court of another State, provided that the court had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the matter and enter such an order and personal jurisdiction over the contestants and that the contestants were given reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard. Prohibits such an authority from seeking or making a modification of such an order unless the authority has jurisdiction to make such a child support order and: (1) the court of the issuing State no longer has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of the order because it no longer is the child's State or the residence of any contestant. Or (2) each contestant has filed written consent to that authority making the modification and assuming continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the order. Permits a State court that no longer has continuing jurisdiction over such orders to enforce prior orders with respect to unsatisfied obligations. Requires that the forum State's law apply in a proceeding to establish, modify, or enforce a child support order, except that in: (1) interpreting a child support order, a court shall apply the law of the State of the court that issued the order. And (2) an action to enforce a child support order, a court shall apply the statute of limitation of the forum State or the State of the court that issued the order, whichever statute provides the longer period of limitation."
