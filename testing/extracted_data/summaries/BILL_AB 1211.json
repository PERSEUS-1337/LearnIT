    "title": "AB 1211",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation by the State Department of Public Health of health facilities, including congregate living health facilities. A violation of these provisions is a misdemeanor. For this purpose, existing law defines \u201ccongregate living health facility\u201d as a residential home with a capacity of no more than 12 beds, that provides inpatient care and skilled nursing care on a recurring, intermittent, extended, or continuous basis. This bill would include in the definition of congregate living health facility a residential home with a capacity of no more than 18 beds that provides inpatient and skilled nursing care, as specified. By changing the definition of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would make other technical, nonsubstantive changes. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."
