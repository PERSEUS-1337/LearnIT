    "content": "Three individual temporary tax provisions expired in 2017. In the past, Congress has regularly acted to extend expired or expiring temporary tax provisions. Collectively, these temporary tax provisions are often referred to as \"tax extenders.\" Most recently, Congress addressed tax extenders in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA18; P.L. 115-123). Three of the four individual income tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2016 were extended in the BBA18, retroactive to 2017. These include the Tax Exclusion for Canceled Mortgage Debt, Mortgage Insurance Premium Deductibility, and Above-the-Line Deduction for Qualified Tuition and Related Expenses. Brief background information on these provisions is provided in this report. The other individual income tax provision that expired at the end of 2016, the medical expense deduction adjusted gross income (AGI) floor of 7.5% for individuals aged 65 and over, was expanded to all taxpayers through 2017 and 2018 in the December 2017 tax legislation (P.L. 115-97). Options related to expired tax provisions in the 115th Congress include (1) extending all or some of the provisions that expired at the end of 2017 or (2) allowing expired provisions to remain expired. This report provides background information on individual income tax provisions that expired in 2017. For information on other tax provisions that expired at the end of 2016, see CRS Report R44677, Tax Provisions that Expired in 2016 (\"Tax Extenders\"), by [author name scrubbed].
