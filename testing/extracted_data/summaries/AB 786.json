    "title": "An act to amend Section 4735 of the Civil Code, relating to common interest developments, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately.",
    "content": "The Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act governs the management and operation of common interest developments. Existing law provides that, unless otherwise provided in the common interest development declaration, the association is responsible for repairing, replacing, or maintaining the common area, other than exclusive use common area, and the owner of each separate interest is responsible for maintaining that separate interest and any exclusive use common area appurtenant to that interest. Existing law makes void and unenforceable any provision of the governing documents or architectural or landscaping guidelines or policies that prohibits use of low water-using plants, or prohibits or restricts compliance with water-efficient landscape ordinances or regulations on the use of water, as specified. Existing law also prohibits an association, except an association that uses recycled water for landscape irrigation, from imposing a fine or assessment on separate interest owners for reducing or eliminating watering of vegetation or lawns during any period for which the Governor has declared a state of emergency or the local government has declared a local emergency due to drought. This bill would revise that exception to instead authorize the imposition of a fine or assessment against the owner of a separate interest that receives recycled water from a retail water supplier, as defined, and fails to use that recycled water for landscaping irrigation. This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 4735 of the Civil Code proposed by AB 349 that would become operative if this bill and AB 349 are enacted and this bill is enacted last. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."
