    "title": "An act to amend Section 14005.37 of, and to add Section 15927 to, the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to public health.",
    "content": "Existing law establishes various programs to provide health care coverage to persons with limited financial resources, including the Medi-Cal program and the state\u2019s children\u2019s health insurance program (CHIP). Existing law establishes the California Health Benefit Exchange (Exchange), pursuant to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and specifies the duties and powers of the board governing the Exchange relative to determining eligibility for enrollment in the Exchange and arranging for coverage under qualified health plans through the Exchange. Existing law, the Health Care Reform Eligibility, Enrollment, and Retention Planning Act, requires an individual to have the option to apply for insurance affordability programs in person, by mail, online, by telephone, or by other commonly available electronic means. Existing law defines \u201cinsurance affordability programs\u201d to include the Medi-Cal program, CHIP, and a program that makes available to qualified individuals coverage in a qualified health benefit plan through the Exchange with advance payment of the premium tax credit established under a specified provision of the Internal Revenue Code and a cost-sharing reduction under a specified provision of federal law. During the processing of an application, renewal, or a transition due to a change in circumstances, existing law requires an entity making eligibility determinations for an insurance affordability program to ensure that an eligible applicant and recipient of those programs that meets all program eligibility requirements and complies with all necessary requirements for information moves between programs without any breaks in coverage and without being required to provide any forms, documents, or other information or undergo verification that is duplicative or otherwise unnecessary. This bill would establish procedures to ensure that eligible recipients of insurance affordability programs move between the Medi-Cal program and other insurance affordability programs without any breaks in coverage as required under the provision described above. The bill would require an individual\u2019s case information and eligibility determination to be referred to his or her county of residence within 3 business days if the individual who has been enrolled in a qualified health plan through the Exchange is determined newly eligible for Medi-Cal through the California Healthcare Eligibility, Enrollment and Retention System (CalHEERS). The bill would require those referrals to be processed by the county, as specified, to ensure the individual\u2019s Medi-Cal eligibility is effective pursuant to specified timelines. The bill would generally prohibit, if an individual is eligible to enroll in a qualified health plan through the Exchange, Medi-Cal benefits from being terminated until at least 20 days after the county sends the notice of action terminating Medi-Cal eligibility, and would require the notice of action to inform the individual of the date by which he or she must select and enroll in a qualified health benefit plan through the Exchange, as specified. The bill would provide that this provision shall only be implemented to the extent that federal financial participation is available. By modifying the enrollment process under the Medi-Cal program, thereby increasing the responsibilities of counties in the administration of the Medi-Cal program, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
