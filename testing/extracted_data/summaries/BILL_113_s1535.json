    "content": "Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act - Amends the federal judicial code to include among the exceptions to US jurisdictional immunity of foreign states any statutory or common law tort claim arising out of an act of extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, terrorism, or the provision of material support or resources for such an act, or any claim for contribution or indemnity relating to a claim arising out of such an act. Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) impose liability on any person who aids, abets, or conspires with a person who commits an act of international terrorism that is committed, planned, or authorized by a designated foreign terrorist organization and that injures a US national. And (2) repeal provisions prohibiting civil actions against foreign states or foreign officials for damages related to acts of terrorism. Grants US district courts personal jurisdiction, to the maximum extent permissible under the Fifth Amendment, over any person who commits or aids and abets an act of international terrorism, or who otherwise sponsors such act or the person who committed such an act, that injures a US national. Makes this Act applicable to any civil action: (1) pending on, or commenced on or after, this Act's enactment date. And (2) arising out of an injury to a person, property, or business on or after September 11, 2001."
