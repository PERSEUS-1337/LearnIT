    "title": "A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to exempt nonprofit small public water systems from certain drinking water standards relating to naturally occurring contaminants.",
    "content": "Rural Community Arsenic Relief Act - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to require States exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems to exempt any nonprofit small public water system that so requests in accordance with this Act from the requirements of any national primary drinking water regulation for naturally occurring contaminants, including arsenic, radon, radium, and uranium. Requires exemption requests to demonstrate that the system's compliance with applicable national primary drinking water regulations: (1) is not economically feasible, (2) has a disproportionate and adverse impact on low-income families. (3) is substantially impeded by limited access to innovative and affordable technology. Or (4) is not necessary because the drinking water provided by the system does not pose an unreasonable health risk. Sets forth alternative arsenic standards for those systems receiving arsenic exemptions. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a university-based arsenic research consortium comprised of specified institutions of higher education. Authorizes the Administrator to provide grants to the consortium to carry out its duties."
