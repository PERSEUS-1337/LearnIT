    "content": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports both basic research and education in the non-medical sciences and engineering. NSF is a major source of federal support for U.S. university research, especially in certain fields such as mathematics and computer science. It is also responsible for significant shares of the federal science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education program portfolio and federal STEM student aid and support. Overall, the Obama Administration sought $7.964 billion for NSF in FY2017, a $501 million (6.7%) increase over the FY2016 estimate of $7.463 billion. This request included $7.564 billion in discretionary budget authority and $400 million in new one-time mandatory budget authority. NSF has six major appropriations accounts: Research and Related Activities (RRA), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC), Agency Operations and Award Management (AOAM), National Science Board (NSB), and Office of Inspector General (OIG). The FY2017 request would have increased total budget authority in three accounts relative to the FY2016 estimate: RRA by $392 million (6.5%), EHR by $73 million (8.3%), and AOAM by $43 million (13%). The request would have provided NSB and OIG with about the same amount as in FY2016 and decreased MREFC account funding by $7 million (3.6%). The new mandatory budget funding request was split between two accounts\u2014RRA ($346 million) and EHR ($54 million). Mandatory funding is not usually part of NSF's budget request for major accounts. As reported by the Senate, S. 2837 would have provided a total of $7.510 billion to NSF for FY2017. This amount is $46 million (0.6%) above the FY2016 estimated funding level, $54 million (0.7%) below the FY2017 discretionary funding request, and $454 million (5.7%) below the request including new mandatory funding. The bill would have kept funding for the major accounts nearly the same as the FY2016 estimate, except for MREFC, which would have increased by $46 million (23%). As reported by the House, H.R. 5393 would have provided a total of $7.406 billion to NSF for FY2017. This amount is $57 million (0.8%) below the FY2016 estimated funding level, $158 million (2.1%) below the President's FY2017 discretionary funding request, and $558 million (7.5%) below the request including new mandatory funding. The bill would have kept funding for the EHR, NSB, and OIG accounts nearly the same as in the FY2016 estimate, increased the RRA and AOAM accounts by $46 million (0.8%) and $10 million (3%), respectively, and decreased the MREFC account by $113 million (57%). A series of continuing appropriations acts (P.L. 114-223, P.L. 114-254, P.L. 115-30) provided funding for NSF from October 1, 2016, through May 5, 2017, at 99.5-99.8% of the FY2016 funding level. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31), signed by the President on May 5, 2017, provides $7.472 billion in discretionary funding to NSF, which is 0.1% above the FY2016 enacted amount. Overall growth in the NSF budget slowed after FY2003. Median annual growth in NSF funding was 9% between FY1953 and FY2003 and 3% between FY2004 and FY2016. Most of NSF's funding supports scientific and technological research. Further, the portion of NSF spending that goes to research increased over the past decade. Within the NSF total, RRA has accounted for the lion's share of growth in obligations since FY2003. Agency appropriations levels were last authorized in FY2010 and expired in FY2013; various reauthorization measures were introduced in the 114th Congress that included proposed funding levels for FY2017."
