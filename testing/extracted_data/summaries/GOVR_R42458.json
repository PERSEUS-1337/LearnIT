    "content": "This report discusses the history of the use of offsetting rescissions to pay for supplemental appropriations to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) from FY1990 through FY2013. As Congress debated the growing size of the budget deficit and national debt, efforts intensified to control spending and offset the costs of legislation. Several times between FY1990 and FY2013, the question of offsetting disaster relief spending became a focus of congressional debate. Usually, in the time reviewed, supplemental disaster relief funding was treated as emergency spending. This designation exempted it from counting against discretionary budget caps, and from needing an offset. However, supplemental spending measures at times have carried rescissions that have offset, to one degree or another, their budgetary impact. In some instances, supplemental spending measures have contained both appropriations for the DRF and offsetting rescissions, but without a specific link between the two. With the passage of the Budget Control Act (BCA), a new mechanism was created that altered the congressional pattern of funding the DRF in part through supplemental appropriations. The BCA included an \"allowable adjustment\" for the federal costs of major disasters declared under the Stafford Act, which generally resulted in larger appropriations for the DRF in annual appropriations bills, and a reduced reliance on supplemental appropriations. When Hurricane Sandy struck in 2012, calls for supplemental appropriations to help pay for recovery efforts (the cost of which exceeded the size of the allowable adjustment) were met with calls for offsets from some quarters. Congress ultimately chose to provide supplemental appropriations, including funding for the DRF, with a combination of the allowable adjustment and emergency funding. Several billion dollars of appropriations under consideration for mitigation projects had their emergency designation struck on a point of order, and therefore those appropriations counted against discretionary spending limits. In past debates over whether supplemental funding for the DRF should be offset, Congress discussed past precedents. Through independent research, CRS identified three specific incidences from FY1990 through FY2013 where bills that had an impact on the level of funding available in the DRF were fully offset, but only one case in which CRS can authoritatively state that supplemental funding for the DRF was completely offset by rescissions."
