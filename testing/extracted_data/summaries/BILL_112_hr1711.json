(2) to an eligible child without the supervision of an employee whose criminal background check satisfies requirements, pending receipt of such individual's background check. And (3) to an eligible child for a period exceeding 90 days with the supervision of an employee whose criminal background check satisfies requirements, pending receipt of such individual's background check. Requires a state child care services plan to also certify that the state will carry out a comprehensive criminal background check of an employee or applicant of such a child care provider as soon as practicable after the provider's request and make the results available to such provider, employee, and applicant. Requires the state to certify that: (1) each eligible child care provider that is licensed by the state will be inspected at least at 3-month intervals. And (2) each such provider that receives funds under the Program will receive not less than 40 hours of initial training and 24 hours of training annually that includes CPR, first aid, recognizing child abuse, basic safety and health, and child behavior and development. Reduces by 10 allotments to states that fail to comply with the requirements of this Act."
