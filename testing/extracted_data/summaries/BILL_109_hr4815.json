    "content": "Safe NOW Act of 2006 - Establishes the National Sex Offender Risk Classification Task Force to create guidelines for a risk-based sex offender classification system. Authorizes the Task Force to carry out demonstration programs in five selected jurisdictions to: (1) use the Task Force's preliminary guidelines to implement such a system for their sex offender registries. And (2) identify ways to improve such guidelines. Expresses the sense of Congress that each state, federally recognized Indian tribe, and US possession and territory should use final Task Force guidelines to implement such a system for its registry."
