    "content": "The Endangered Species Act (ESA) protects species that are determined to be eitherendangered or threatened according to assessments of their risk of extinction. The ESA has not beenreauthorized since September 30, 1992, and efforts to do so have been controversial and complex. Some observers assert that the current ESA is a failure because few species have recovered, and thatit unduly and unevenly restricts the use of private lands. Others assert that since the act's passage,few species have become extinct, many have improved, and that restrictions to preserve species donot place a greater burden on landowners than many other federal, state, and local laws. This report provides a side-by-side analysis of two bills and a proposed amendment thatwould amend the ESA. This analysis compares H.R. 3824 , the Threatened andEndangered Species Recovery Act of 2005, as passed by the House; proposed House Amendment588 to H.R. 3824 (Miller/Boehlert Amendment); and S. 2110 , theCollaboration for the Recovery of Endangered Species Act. Proponents of each proposal indicate that it is designed to make the ESA more effective byredefining the relationship between private and public property uses and species protection,implementing new incentives for species conservation, and removing what some see as undue landuse restrictions. Thus, all three proposals contain provisions meant to encourage greater voluntaryconservation of species by states and private landowners, a concept that has been supported by manyobservers. Further, all three proposals would modify or eliminate certain procedural or otherelements of the current ESA that some have viewed as significant protections and prohibitions,including eliminating or changing the role of \"critical habitat\" (CH) (which would eliminate oneaspect of the current consultation process); making the listing of all threatened and endangeredspecies more difficult or less likely; expanding \u00c2\u00a710 permits allowing incidental take (which couldincur a greater need for agency oversight and enforcement); and expanding state rather than federalimplementation of ESA programs (which might make oversight more difficult). Proponents of thesechanges assert that tighter listing standards would enable a better focus on species with the most direneeds, and that other measures would achieve recovery of more species. Critics argue that proposedchanges create gaps in the ESA safety net of protections and prohibitions. It is difficult to assess whether, on balance, the proposals would be likely to achieve greaterprotection and recovery of species, or to what extent the controversies over land use constraintswould diminish. However, replacing some of the protections of the current ESA with newincentives, rather than adding the new incentives to the current protections, arguably makes adequatefunding of the new programs more critical to determining the outcome of the ESA. This report will be updated as events warrant."
