    "title": "AB 652",
    "content": "Existing law gives the Department of Transportation full possession and control of all state highways. Existing law describes the authorized routes in the state highway system and establishes a process for adoption of a highway on an authorized route by the California Transportation Commission. Existing law authorizes the commission to relinquish certain state highway segments to local agencies. Existing law authorizes the commission to relinquish to the County of Sacramento the portion of State Highway Route 16 that is located within the unincorporated area of the county, east of the City of Sacramento boundary and west of Watt Avenue, under certain conditions. This bill would revise this authorization to apply to a specified portion of State Highway Route 16 that is located within the unincorporated area of the county, between the general easterly city limits of the City of Sacramento and near Grant Line Road, and would impose additional conditions on the relinquishment. The bill would state the intent of the Legislature in this regard. This bill would also authorize the commission to relinquish to the City of Rancho Cordova a specified portion of State Highway Route 16, under certain conditions."
