    "content": "In cities with tall buildings, emergency responders need an accurate floor level location to find 911 callers quickly. We introduce a system to estimate a victim's floor level via their mobile device's sensor data in a two-step process. First, we train a neural network to determine when a smartphone enters or exits a building via GPS signal changes. Second, we use a barometer equipped smartphone to measure the change in barometric pressure from the entrance of the building to the victim's indoor location. Unlike impractical previous approaches, our system is the first that does not require the use of beacons, prior knowledge of the building infrastructure, or knowledge of user behavior. We demonstrate real-world feasibility through 63 experiments across five different tall buildings throughout New York City where our system predicted the correct floor level with 100% accuracy.\n Indoor caller floor level location plays a critical role during 911 emergency calls. In one use case, it can help pinpoint heart attack victims or a child calling on behalf of an incapacitated adult. In another use case, it can help locate firefighters and other emergency personnel within a tall or burning building. In cities with tall buildings, traditional methods that rely on GPS or Wi-Fi fail to provide reliable accuracy for these situations. In these emergency situations knowing the floor level of a victim can speed up the victim search by a factor proportional to the number of floors in that building. In recent years methods that rely on smartphone sensors and Wi-Fi positioning BID28 have been used to formulate solutions to this problem.In this paper we introduce a system that delivers an estimated floor level by combining deep learning with barometric pressure data obtained from a Bosch bmp280 sensor designed for \"floor level accuracy\" BID3 and available in most smartphones today 1 . We make two contributions: the first is an LSTM BID13 trained to classify a smartphone as either indoors or outdoors (IO) using GPS, RSSI, and magnetometer sensor readings. Our model improves on a previous classifier developed by BID1 . We compare the LSTM against feedforward neural networks, logistic regression, SVM, HMM and Random Forests as baselines. The second is an algorithm that uses the classifier output to measure the change in barometric pressure of the smartphone from the building entrance to the smartphone's current location within the building. The algorithm estimates the floor level by clustering height measurements through repeated building visits or a heuristic value detailed in section 4.5.We designed our method to provide the most accurate floor level estimate without relying on external sensors placed inside the building, prior knowledge of the building, or user movement behavior. It merely relies on a smartphone equipped with GPS and barometer sensors and assumes an arbitrary user could use our system at a random time and place. We offer an extensive discussion of potential real-world problems and provide solutions in (appendix B).We conducted 63 test experiments across six different buildings in New York City to show that the system can estimate the floor level inside a building with 65.0% accuracy when the floor-ceiling distance in the building is unknown. However , when repeated visit data can be collected, our simple clustering method can learn the floor-ceiling distances and improve the accuracy to 100%. All code , data and data collection app are available open-source on github.2 . In this paper we presented a system that predicted a device's floor level with 100% accuracy in 63 trials across New York City. Unlike previous systems explored by BID1 , BID26 , BID20 , BID17 BID27 , our system is completely selfcontained and can generalize to various types of tall buildings which can exceed 19 or more stories. This makes our system realistic for real-world deployment with no infrastructure support required.We also introduced an LSTM, that solves the indoor-outdoor classification problem with 90.3% accuracy. The LSTM matched our baseline feedforward network, and outperformed SVMs, random forests, logistic regression and previous systems designed by BID22 and BID30 . The LSTM model also serves as a first step for future work modeling the overall system end-to-end within the LSTM.Finally, we showed that we could learn the distribution of floor heights within a building by aggregating m \u2206 measurements across different visits to the building. This method allows us to generate precise floor level estimates via unsupervised methods. Our overall system marries these various elements to make it a feasible approach to speed up real-world emergency rescues in cities with tall buildings."
