    "content": "This bill provides continuing FY2017 appropriations to most federal agencies until the earlier of December 9, 2016, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations legislation. It prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur when FY2017 begins on October 1, 2016, because the FY2017 appropriations bills that fund the federal government have not been enacted. The bill specifies the rates of operations for security and nonsecurity programs for the duration of the continuing appropriations. The bill enacts, by reference, the provisions of the conference report for H. R. 2577 .
