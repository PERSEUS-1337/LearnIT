    "title": "A bill to establish an energy technologies innovation network, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "Directs the Secretary of Energy to conduct a survey every five years to determine the 10 highest-priority energy-related problems to resolve to ensure the goals of: (1) maximizing US energy security, (2) maximizing improvements in energy efficiency within the United States. And (3) minimizing damage to the domestic economy and the environment. Instructs the Secretary to: (1) report to Congress the survey results, including a list of the 10 highest-priority energy-related problems based on survey responses. And (2) ensure that, during the five year period beginning on the date of receipt of the report, all energy-related research and development activities of the Department of Energy (DOE) are implemented for the purpose of resolving the problems listed. Establishes the Energy Technologies Innovation Network to provide a forum through which interested parties can present, discuss, and collaborate with respect to information and ideas relating to energy technologies. Requires each research facility that receives federal funding to provide to the Network the results of the research conducted using that funding, regardless of whether the research relates to energy."
