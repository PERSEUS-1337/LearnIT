    "content": "Separation of Powers Restoration Act - States that a presidential order, with specific exceptions, neither constitutes nor has the force of law and is limited in application and effect to the executive branch. Directs the President to provide with each presidential order a statement of the specific statutory or constitutional authority for such action. Authorizes both Houses of Congress, a Senator or Representative, certain State and local officials, and certain aggrieved persons to bring an action to challenge the validity of any presidential order which exceeds the power granted to the President by the relevant authorizing statute or the Constitution. States that, to the extent that any Act of Congress grants to the President or any other executive officer or employee the power to declare a national emergency, such power is divested to Congress alone. Terminates after 90 days all powers and authorities possessed by the President or any other Federal officer or employee or executive agency as a result of the existence of a declaration of national emergency in effect on the date of enactment of this Act."
