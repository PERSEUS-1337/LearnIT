The farm value of animal production is estimated at $169 billion in 2012, nearly 44% of the total value of U.S. agricultural production. In addition, the value of animal product exports and imports grew to about $43 billion in 2012. Approximately 1.1 million of the nation's more than 2.2 million farms were classified in the 2007 Census of Agriculture as primarily animal production operations. These included cattle farms and ranches; cattle feedlots; dairies; operations with hogs, poultry, eggs, sheep, or goats; and farms with horses, bison, beekeeping, and aquaculture. Except for dairy, livestock and poultry products generally are not eligible for the price and income support programs authorized in farm bills for major crops such as grains, cotton, and oilseeds. Livestock and poultry producers count on federal government leadership in policy areas such as food safety, animal health, the promotion of fair and competitive trade practices, and foreign trade for the benefit of animal agriculture. Other long-standing public policy concerns include animal agriculture's obligations with respect to animal welfare and environmental protection. A couple of key animal agriculture issues are expected to be part of the omnibus farm bill debate in the 113th Congress. The 112th Congress proposed substantial changes to U.S. dairy policy, including the creation of a Dairy Production Margin Protection Program and a Dairy Market Stabilization Program. Similar provisions may be reintroduced in the 113th Congress as part of a new omnibus farm bill. Also, three expired livestock disaster assistance programs\u2014the Livestock Forage Disaster Program, the Livestock Indemnity Program, and the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program\u2014may be proposed for reauthorization with mandatory funds in any farm bill introduced this year. The farm bills in the 112th Congress would have reauthorized the programs. The House and Senate Agriculture Committees might be involved in a variety of issues through their oversight of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The livestock and poultry industries have intently focused on a repeal or revision of the Renewable Fuels Standard, which they say has harmed their sectors by driving up feed costs. The 113th Congress also might address issues related to livestock and poultry contracts. In the FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act, the 112th Congress prohibited USDA from finalizing parts of its proposed rule on contracts. Proposals in the FY2013 House Agriculture appropriations bill and the House farm bill would have repealed the provisions that USDA finalized in 2011. The repeal of the USDA rules may be reintroduced this year. Oversight of USDA's food safety responsibilities could also be of interest to Congress as USDA is in the midst of rulemaking for some significant food safety\u2013related issues. Trade agreements could be addressed as the United States negotiates the Trans-Pacific Partnership and considers engaging the European Union in free trade negotiations. Congress may address legislation on horse slaughter and laying-hen cages. Congress might also consider environmental regulations that impact livestock and poultry, and conservation programs that have benefited animal agriculture."
