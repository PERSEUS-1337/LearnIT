    "content": "Quantum computers promise significant advantages over classical computers for a number of different applications. We show that the complete loss function landscape of a neural network can be represented as the quantum state output by a quantum computer. We demonstrate this explicitly for a binary neural network and, further, show how a quantum computer can train the network by manipulating this state using a well-known algorithm known as quantum amplitude amplification. We further show that with minor adaptation, this method can also represent the meta-loss landscape of a number of neural network architectures simultaneously. We search this meta-loss landscape with the same method to simultaneously train and design a binary neural network. Finding a suitable set of weights for a neural network has become one of the most studied problems of modern machine learning. It has presented a significant challenge to computer scientists for whom few successful alternatives to back-propagation are available. It can be difficult to explore very large search spaces efficiently and, worse, optimization may converge to a local minima far from global optimum BID2 . Understanding the cost function landscape is also hard, and choosing hyper-parameters and designing neural networks remains mostly a manual process. As Moore's law approaches its end, two new computing paradigms have been explored, neuromorphic and quantum computers. Quantum computing is based on quantum bits (or qbits) obeying the laws of quantum physics as opposed to the classical bits of today that are based on classical physics. Note that in physics the term classical is used to mean non-quantum and we use this terminology throughout. Quantum machine learning aims to find an advantage in applying quantum computing to machine learning. Current research into quantum machine learning falls into one of two catgeories. Some quantum algorithms promise a revolution in machine learning in theory, but contain many gaps in their implementation in practice. In contrast, others are more realistic in their method, but struggle to justify a place amongst the well-established methods of machine learning. In this paper, it is shown that a quantum computer can output a quantum state that represents the entire cost landscape for a given neural network. The method is shown to be versatile and even able to represent a meta-cost landscape of all possible hyperparameters and parameters. Applying it to the connectivities and weights of a binary neural network and simulating the quantum algorithm on a classical computer, we further show that this landscape state can be used for training and metatraining the binary neural network for a small toy problem using quantum amplitude amplification, a standard quantum algorithm. We show that quantum superposition can be used to represent many parameters of a neural network at once and efficiently encode entire loss landscapes in a quantum state using just a single run of a quantum circuit. We demonstrate this explicitly for both parameters and hyper-parameters of a BNN, and show that further processing of this state can lead to quantum advantage in training and metatraining. As a training method it possesses significant advantages as it is landscape-independent, has a quadratic speedup over a classical search of the same kind, and would be able to solve statistically neutral problems such as parity problems BID23 . It is not, however, without shortcomings. One potential criticism is the issue of over-fitting. Since our problem is so small, we chose to define a target state as one where the accuracy is 100% on the training set but this is rarely desirable in real machine learning. One solution may be to simply run the quantum algorithm and, upon finding a particular set of weights that represents an overfit, run the algorithm again but with a deselection of that particular set of weights. This can be done by simply changing the sign of the probability amplitude corresponding to that state during each iteration of the quantum amplitude amplification. A similar issue is that regular machine learning typically uses batch learning, whilst our method incorporates the entire dataset at once. This too can be fixed by altering our method to use a different batch of the data for each quantum amplitude amplification iteration. This works since no matter what batch we use, a good set of weights should still be amplified by the circuit. In fact, such an implementation is advantageous since it would allow us to use less qubits which in practical terms are limited in number in the near term. A significant limitation in our method is the requirement that the input is binary, and the poor scaling of the activation function. Both of these problems arise completely from our implementation of the sign function, which could either be improved or replaced entirely with a different binary activation function that could be implemented more efficiently on a quantum computer and would be compatible with non-binary input. There has been progress on creating effective non-linear activation functions by so-called repeat-until-success circuits BID1 ). An alternative approach would be to use floating point representations as in classical computing and the quantum equivalent of full-adders, but this would require an overhead in the number of qubits that would take us beyond the limit of classical simulation. Finally, we note that this method scales poorly compared to backpropagation and that the advantage only appears in like for like comparisons of unstructured classical/quantum searches. The cost function landscape is not unstructured and algorithms such as backpropagation take advantage of this. We conjecture that a quantum search method that applies quantum advantage to structured searches, if it exists, can be applied to the cost landscape in place of quantum amplitude amplification.Finding ways to harness quantum computers to aid classical machine learning methods in a meaningful way remains an open problem and we present the loss landscape state as a plausible candidate towards this goal. Whilst we used the example of quantum training, the most fruitful approach in the short term is to ask whether some property of the state can be used to glean useful information for classical machine learning methods. This might take the form of understanding the roughness of the landscape, identifying certain features, or even choosing an appropriate learning rate. Further work in investigating the relationship between the landscape as a quantum state and its features from a machine learning perspective would be a step forward in this direction."
