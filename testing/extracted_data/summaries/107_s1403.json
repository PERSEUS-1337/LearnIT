    "title": "A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to promote energy independence and diversity by providing for the use of net metering by certain small electric energy generation systems, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "Home Energy Generation Act - Mandates that retail electric suppliers offer to make an electric energy meter capable of net metering available to retail customers that have installed energy generation units intended for net metering if the customer-generator's existing electrical meter cannot perform that function. Prescribes guidelines for: (1) net energy measurement and billing, (2) safety and performance standards. (3) limitations upon the maximum local distribution services to additional customer-generators. And (4) interconnection standards. Directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to promulgate regulations ensuring that simplified contracts will be used for the interconnection of electric energy by electric energy transmission or distribution systems and generating facilities that have a power production capacity not greater than 250 kilowatts."
