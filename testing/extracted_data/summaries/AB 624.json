    "title": "An act to amend Sections 11302 and 11319 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to real estate appraisers.",
    "content": "Existing law, the Real Estate Appraisers\u2019 Licensing and Certification Law, regulates the licensing of real estate appraisers and provides definitions of specified terms that govern the construction of that law. Existing law provides that the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice sets forth the minimum standards of conduct and performance for real estate appraisers in any work or service performed that is addressed by those standards. This bill would instead provide that the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice constitutes the minimum standard of conduct and performance for federally related real estate appraisal activity, as defined. The bill would revise existing, and additionally include new, definitions for specified terms for purposes of the Real Estate Appraisers\u2019 Licensing and Certification Law. The bill would also authorize, if a licensee is performing a nonfederally related appraisal activity, a standard of valuation practice, as defined, for a licensee if that practice is disclosed to, and agreed upon, by the client, and if that practice is described in an appraisal, as provided."
