By the end of 2011, the Global Fund had approved roughly $22.6 billion to help 150 countries fight these three diseases. According to the Global Fund, from 2002 through 2011, it had supported AIDS treatment for 3.3 million HIV-positive people, anti-tuberculosis treatment for 8.6 million people, and 230 million insecticide-treated nets for the prevention of malaria, saving about 7.7 million lives. In November 2011, the Global Fund Board announced that due to inadequate resources from donors, it would cancel its 11th round of funding, but would maintain support for existing activities to avoid disruptions in ongoing services. The Fund also announced that it expected to offer new funding for grants in 2014. The United States has demonstrated strong support for the Global Fund since making a founding pledge in 2001. U.S. officials have served on several Global Fund boards, U.S. contributions to the Fund have surpassed those of any other country, and U.S. global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs have been increasingly coordinated with Global Fund activities. Donors last met on October 4, 2010, to make their pledges for the Global Fund over the next three years. There, the United States made its first multiyear pledge to the Fund of $4 billion. Despite rigorous debate on the overall budget and the role of foreign aid in particular, the 112th Congress has maintained support for the Global Fund. In both FY2011 and FY2012, Congress appropriated $1.05 billion for the Global Fund, excluding rescissions. In order to meet the $4 billion multiyear pledge made in 2010, the President's FY2013 budget request included $1.65 billion for the Global Fund, a significant increase from previous years. As part of the budget request, the Administration requested a transfer of $250 million from the State Department's FY2012 bilateral HIV/AIDS funding to the Global Fund, bringing the estimated FY2012 funding level to $1.3 billion. Global health advocates urge Congress to meet the President's FY2013 request for the Fund in order to support the sustainability of its activities and to encourage continued contributions from other donors. Although Congress has traditionally been a strong supporter of the Fund, several issues may affect congressional views about the Fund in the future. Such factors include the following: Fiscal austerity. Proposals to reduce federal spending continue to dominate foreign aid debates, with some Members of Congress aiming to target foreign aid accounts, including those for global health, in an attempt to balance the budget. At the same time, others argue that cutting back on the relatively small size of foreign aid (about 1% of total budget authority) will do little to cut the deficit, but could imperil the lives of millions. Oversight and transparency. In early 2011, reports about misuse of Global Fund resources in some grants ignited a debate about corruption in foreign aid in general, and in the Global Fund in particular. Some have called for donors to withhold support for the Fund until better safeguards are established. Others argue the Fund should not be penalized for oversight shortcomings, which are familiar to many aid programs. Role of the Global Fund in U.S. global health policy. When the Global Fund was established, U.S. bilateral investments in HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB were relatively small. Since then, U.S. bilateral investments in fighting these diseases have grown significantly, particularly since the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) were launched in 2003 and 2005, respectively. Some observers advocate allocating the majority of U.S. funds for global HIV/AIDS and malaria to bilateral programs to ensure sufficient control and oversight of funds. On the other hand, other analysts argue that the Global Fund represents a more efficient and flexible funding mechanism than bilateral programs and offers the United States the ability to pool funds and share risk with other donors, which some believe is particularly important given the challenges of the current fiscal environment. This report provides background information on the Global Fund, outlines U.S. funding for the Fund, discusses changes the Global Fund has made to improve the efficiency of its programs and address allegations of corruption, and analyzes issues Congress might consider as it debates the appropriate level of U.S support to provide the Fund."
