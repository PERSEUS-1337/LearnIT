    "content": "The United States faces a number of significant national security threats, ranging in scopefrom intercontinental ballistic missiles to the use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) byterrorists. The debate over the seriousness of the various threats intensified recently, even before theevents of September 11, 2001. Various studies and commissions recommended far reaching changesin the U.S. approach to domestic preparedness and response to threats to the homeland, many nowbeing implemented. Many experts believe the probable long term effects of a WMD attack byterrorists on the population, environment, and the economy make it imperative that the U.S. be fullyprepared to either deter or interdict an attempted terrorist attack. This paper reviews the current legislation and policies that govern the military's role whensupporting law enforcement in a domestic terrorism crisis and highlights some of the issuesconfronting the U.S. government. To fully understand the military's role in domestic crisis responseit is necessary to explore existing national-level structures and response options prior to theinvolvement of military forces. Crisis management is predominately a law enforcement function thatmanages the resources necessary to prevent or resolve a terrorist incident, including one involvingWMD. Current U.S. government terrorism response policy is contained in presidential directives. Among other matters, these directives address National Security Council structure and federalagency crisis response roles when responding to a domestic terrorism incident. The creation of theDepartment of Homeland Security and U.S. Northern Command has not yet changed the basic rolesand relationships described herein. Many federal agencies are available to assist the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indealing with a terrorist threat or in the resolution of an actual terrorist incident. The Department ofDefense (DoD), as a supporting agency in domestic law enforcement operations, has developed andmaintains plans and capabilities to respond to threats or acts of terrorism, including those involvingthe use of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons. In a domestic crisis, DoD may be called uponto assist in several different ways ranging from actual interdiction of the terrorists to the loaning ofspecialized equipment for use by law enforcement agencies. DoD has published specific policy forassistance to civil law enforcement officials in emergencies involving terrorism and WMD. U.S.terrorism policy is an issue of growing policy debate. Most experts believe that a comprehensivenational strategy for domestic terrorism is a critical step in defeating the threat. Some say moreeffectively employing DoD's capabilities during domestic crisis response operations, or newrelationships based on the recent creation of the Department of Homeland Security are the bestmethods to ensure success against domestic terrorism. Lastly, newly proposed congressionaloversight roles are seen by many as an important factor in a more effective response to domesticterrorism. This report will be updated should major changes occur to the relationships described."
