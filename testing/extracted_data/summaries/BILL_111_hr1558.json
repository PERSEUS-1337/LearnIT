Or (2) providing for an affiliation period for coverage offered by a health maintenance organization (HMO). Defines an affiliation period as a period of time before health insurance coverage becomes effective.

Prohibits preexisting condition exclusions for individual health insurance coverage. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to Congress on the impact of this Act on health benefits coverage. Authorizes the Secretary to request claims data, enrollee data, and other appropriate information from group health plans and health insurance issuers.
