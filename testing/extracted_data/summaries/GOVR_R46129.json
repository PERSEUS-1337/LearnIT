    "content": "Presidential records provide Congress, members of the public, and researchers with documentation, context, and explanations for presidential actions. The Presidential Records Act (PRA; 44 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a72201-2207) set forth requirements regarding the maintenance, access, and preservation of presidential and vice presidential information during and after a presidency. This report describes the institutions involved in presidential recordkeeping, explains what is and is not considered a presidential record, and identifies recordkeeping responsibilities and access policies during and after a presidency. The report concludes with information and policy options for congressional oversight and enforcement of the PRA with respect to electronic records provisions under the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014. Prior to the PRA, records were considered the President's private property. Now, the PRA states that presidential records are the property of the United States. Under the PRA, the President may request advice and assistance from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) regarding records management practices, and the Archivist of the United States (the head of NARA) plays an important role in the maintenance and access of a former President's records. The PRA does not establish automatic access to an incumbent President's records, which may be protected by executive privilege on a case-by-case basis. However, the PRA does statutorily narrow an incumbent President's ability to restrict records access as the Administration draws to a close. As the length of time between the conclusion of a presidency and the present day increases, presidential records become more accessible. Access to a former President's records is governed in terms of time passed since the conclusion of the presidency: Less than five years out, no public access is granted due to the Archivist's processing of the records. Between five and 12 years out, the Archivist determines PRA restrictions with the former President in accordance with Title 44, Section 2204, of the U.S. Code . After 12 years, these PRA restrictions no longer apply. Certain federal officials may access a former President's records within the 12-year time frame by gaining \"special access\" to presidential records. The PRA permits either house of Congress, committees, or subcommittees requesting information for chamber or committee business to be granted special access to the former President's records. In practice, observers have questioned what constitutes a House or Senate request for presidential records and who needs to make the request to qualify under the PRA. This statutory ambiguity may impact the ability of minority party members and general committee members to gain access to presidential records. As a result of the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014, presidential records are assessed for preservation not by the media used to store the information but rather by the content of the information itself. Questions regarding the volume and completeness of records may be suitable for congressional consideration. Any delay in NARA's processing of records will directly impact timely access to those records and the ability of NARA to comply with the PRA's statutory directive to make records available as rapidly and completely as possible."
