And (2) coordinate the provision of, and access to, supportive services for patients affected, which shall include a telephone hotline, an information clearinghouse, peer-support programs, and registries of families willing to adopt children affected by such conditions. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of CDC, to provide assistance to state and local heath departments to integrate the results of prenatal testing into state-based vital statistics and birth defects surveillance programs. Directs the Secretary to ensure that a provider is only able to participate in activities under this Act if it provides assurances that it will provide a patient receiving a positive result from a prenatal test with certain information, including: (1) up-to-date scientific information concerning the life expectancy, clinical course, and intellectual and functional development and treatment options for a fetus diagnosed with, or a child born with, such conditions. And (2) referrals to supportive service providers. Requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to submit a report to Congress concerning the effectiveness of current health care and family support programs serving as resources for the families of children with disabilities."
