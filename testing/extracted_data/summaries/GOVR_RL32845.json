    "content": "In January 2005, Viktor Yushchenko became Ukraine's new President, after massivedemonstrations helped to overturn the former regime's electoral fraud, in what has been dubbed the\"Orange Revolution,\" after Yushchenko's campaign color. The \"Orange Revolution\" has sparkeda great deal of interest in Congress and elsewhere. Some hope that Ukraine may finally embark ona path of comprehensive reforms and Euro-Atlantic integration after nearly 15 years of half-measuresand false starts. Others are interested in the geopolitical implications of a pro-Western Ukraine inthe former Soviet region and in relations between Russia and the West. Some analysts detect a newwave of democracy sweeping the post-Soviet region. Yushchenko has said that his key domestic priorities include reducing the size of theunofficial, \"shadow\" economy, maintaining macroeconomic stability, and fighting corruption, amajor problem in Ukraine. Other critical priorities include improving the independence andeffectiveness of the judiciary and attracting foreign investment. Yushchenko has vowed to prosecutethose guilty of crimes, including fraud during the election, the 2000 murder of Ukrainian journalistGeorgi Gongadze, and an attempt on Yushchenko's life during the campaign, which has left himdisfigured. In foreign policy, Ukraine seeks closer ties with the European Union, NATO, and theUnited States, with the goal of eventual NATO and EU membership. Yushchenko has said that heviews Russia as a \"strategic partner\" of Ukraine, but that integration with the West will supercedeRussian-led integration efforts. The Bush Administration has hailed the \"Orange Revolution\" as a part of a wave ofdemocratization sweeping the region and the world, and has proposed a modest increase in U.S. aidto Ukraine. Experts believe that prompt U.S. and international assistance may be needed to help thenew government to boost public support before crucial March 2006 parliamentary elections. TheUnited States has also expressed hopes that the United States and Ukraine will work together moreeffectively on such issues as weapons proliferation and trafficking in persons. The Administrationhas downplayed Yushchenko's decision to honor a campaign pledge to pull Ukraine's troops out ofIraq by the end of this year. President Yushchenko visited the United States on April 4-7. During the Ukranian presidential election campaign and during the ensuing electoral crisis,Congress approved legislation calling for free and fair elections in Ukraine and urged theAdministration to warn the previous regime of possible negative consequences for Ukraine's leadersand for U.S.-Ukraine ties in the case of electoral fraud. The 109th Congress will consider aid fundingfor Ukraine, and may take up extending permanent Normal Trade Relations to Ukraine, terminatingthe application of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to Ukraine, which bars permanent NTR status forcountries with non-market economies that do not permit freedom of emigration.
