    "content": "State, Excise, Sales, and Transaction Tax Enforcement Act of 1998 - Amends the Federal judicial code to require the owners and operators of tribal retail enterprises to collect and remit qualified State taxes. Allows a State to bring an action in a district court: (1) for a declaratory judgment concerning the applicability or lawfulness of such a tax. Or (2) against a tribal retail enterprise or the Indian tribe or a tribal member that owns or operates the enterprise to enforce the collection or remittance of such a tax. Defines a qualified State tax as any lawfully imposed, nondiscriminatory excise, sales, or transaction tax imposed by a State on a purchase of a good or service from a tribal retail enterprise by a person who is not a member of that Indian tribe, excluding any State tax: (1) imposed on a purchase from an enterprise that is exempted under State law from collecting and remitting because the associated Indian tribe imposes and collects an equivalent tax. (2) imposed on a sale if the State has waived the applicability of that tax to a purchase from the enterprise by a person who is not a member of the associated tribe. (3) that is the subject of an agreement between an enterprise and a State that exempts that enterprise from collecting and remitting that tax. Or (4) the incidence of which falls on an Indian tribe or a member of an Indian tribe."
