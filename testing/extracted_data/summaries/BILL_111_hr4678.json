Exempts from this Act's requirements a foreign manufacturer or producer that distributes a covered product through its US parent company or US subsidiary, provided certain conditions are met. Requires the registered agent to be: (1) located in a state with a substantial connection to the importation, distribution, or sale of the products. As well as (2) an individual, domestic firm, or domestic corporation that is a US permanent resident. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish, maintain, and make available to the public and to the Commissioner for US Customs and Border Protection (CBP): (1) a registry of such agents. And (2) information on US manufacturers or producers that have submitted certifications of responsibility and liability for their foreign manufacturers or producers or who have had their certifications removed for cause. Deems a foreign manufacturer or producer of products covered under this Act that registers an agent to consent to the personal jurisdiction of the state or federal courts of the state in which the agent is located for the purpose of any judicial proceeding.

Requires foreign manufacturers or producers of a covered product to report within five business days to the head of the applicable agency their determination to conduct a safety recall or other safety campaign of a covered product that is identical or substantially similar to a covered product offered for sale in the United States.

Requires the head of an applicable agency similarly to study the feasibility of methods requiring foreign manufacturers or producers of component parts of covered products distributed in US commerce to register agents in the United States for purposes of such service of process.
