    "content": "Economic Growth and Development Act This bill requires the President to establish a primary interagency mechanism to coordinate US development assistance programs carried out by federal agencies overseas with private sector investment activities. The mechanism shall: streamline the private-sector liaison, coordination, and investment promotion functions of such agencies. Facilitate the use of development and finance tools across such agencies to attract greater participation in development activities by the private sector. And establish a single point of contact for US private sector entities pursuing partnership opportunities with such agencies. Federal agencies planning or providing US development assistance overseas shall ensure that: (1) a rigorous analysis of the constraints to economic growth and investment within a recipient country guides any US development strategy, and (2) US development strategies are coordinated with private sector activities in such countries. Each analysis shall identify and analyze: (1) the constraints posed by inadequacies in critical infrastructure, the education system, the rule of law, the tax and investment codes, or the customs or regulatory regimes in the recipient country. And (2) the particular economic sectors that are central to achieving economic growth in the recipient country. The results of each analysis shall be: (1) incorporated into any relevant development strategy, and (2) used to guide the allocation of resources by federal agencies planning or providing US development assistance overseas."
