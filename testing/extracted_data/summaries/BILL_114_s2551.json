    "content": "Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2016 This bill states that it is US policy to regard the prevention of mass atrocities and genocide as a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility. The President may establish an interagency Atrocities Prevention Board, which shall: (1) ensure that atrocities and the risk of atrocities throughout the world are adequately considered and addressed, and (2) oversee the development and execution of policies and tools to enhance the capacity of the United States to prevent and respond to atrocities. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 is amended to provide for the training of Foreign Service Officers in conflict and atrocity prevention. The bill establishes in the Treasury the Complex Crises Fund to enable the US Agency for International Development to support programs and activities to prevent or respond to emerging or unforeseen foreign challenges and complex crisis overseas, including potential mass atrocities."
