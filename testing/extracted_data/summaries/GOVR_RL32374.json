    "content": "The international financial institutions (IFIs) all have procedures to prevent, identify, and punish corruption within their organizations. The World Bank appears to have the most extensive anddetailed process for addressing corruption issues, but the other multilateral development banks(MDBs) have or are establishing similar procedures. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) doesnot make loans for specific projects; all its loans go directly to the central bank or finance ministryof the borrower country. Nevertheless, it also has procedures for preventing, investigating, andpunishing unethical or corrupt practices. Organizations may achieve more effective anti-corruption programs by implementing complementary measures to counter corruption at many levels. These include scrutiny of the IFIs'lending procedures, their systems for the procurement of goods and services, staff conduct, oversightand management of their operations, and the education of staff on policies and procedures. Majorprocedures for controlling corruption include the establishment of an independent corruption unit,an oversight committee, mandatory staff financial disclosure procedures, and a corruption reportinghotline. The World Bank is the only IFI that has adopted procedures in all four areas. Most of theothers, excepting the African Development Bank (AFDB) and the International Fund for AgriculturalDevelopment (IFAD), have procedures in three of these areas. The AFDB requires mandatory stafffinancial disclosure and is considering possible action in the other areas. IFAD's anti-corruption unitis organized differently than the other IFIs in that anti-corruption responsibilities are carried out byits Office of Internal Audit, but it functions similarly to anti-corruption units at the other IFIs. Also,IFAD is still in the process of implementing mandatory staff financial disclosure. This report provides, on a side-by-side basis, comparisons of the anti-corruption procedures in the MDBs and the IMF. It also provides a detailed description of the institutional arrangements eachIFI has adopted to address corruption issues. This report will be updated if significant changes aremade in the systems and procedures it describes."
