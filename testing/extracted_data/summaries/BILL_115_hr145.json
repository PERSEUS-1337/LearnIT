    "content": "Citizen Legislature Anti-Corruption Reform Act or the CLEAN Act This bill amends the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) to exclude Members of Congress, except the Vice President, from further CSRS and FERS retirement coverage. The bill prohibits further government contributions or deductions from such Member's basic pay for deposit in the Treasury to the credit of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. Nothing in this bill shall: (1) be considered to nullify, modify, or otherwise affect any right, entitlement, or benefit under CSRS or FERS for any Member covering any period before enactment of this bill. Or (2) affect the eligibility of a Member to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) in accordance with otherwise applicable law. The bill requires that each bill, order, resolution, or vote submitted by Congress to the President be limited to one subject which shall be clearly expressed in the measure's or vote's title. Any provision of law that provides an exception in its application to a Member of Congress or an employee of such Member shall have no effect. Each state must conduct congressional redistricting, beginning with the decennial census conducted during 2020, using a redistricting plan developed by a nonpartisan independent redistricting commission (NIRC). After such redistricting, no state may use federal funds directly for election administration purposes unless it certifies to the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) that it conducts redistricting for its legislative districts using an NIRC redistricting plan. Each state must hold open primaries for elections for federal office. A state may not use any federal funds provided directly for election administration purposes unless it certifies to the EAC that it holds open primaries for elections for state and local office."
