    "content": "The House has passed H.R. 1115 and the Senate Judiciary Committee has reported out S. 274 (both styled the Class Action Fairness Act of 2003). Each (1) creates aconsumer class action bill of rights, and (2) allows the federal courts to try a greater number of largeclass action law suits (100 plaintiffs or more) arising out of state law where the parties come fromdiverse states. Current law requires that each plaintiff have suffered $75,000 in damages and thatthere be complete diversity before a state lawsuit may be filed in or removed to federal court, thatis to say all of the plaintiffs must be citizens residing in different states than all of the defendants. The bills ease the complete diversity requirement and eliminate the requirement of individualdamages of $75,000 as long as the damages suffered by the class as a whole is $5 million or more. The consumer class action bill of rights in each proposal contains safeguards which provide for judicial scrutiny of coupon and other noncash settlements, protection against a proposed settlementthat would result in a net loss to a class member, protection against discrimination based upongeographic location, and prohibition on a class representative receiving a greater share of the award. S. 274 / S. 1751 alone includes within its bill of rights explicit provisions for \"plain English\" settlement notices and settlement notifications for state and federalauthorities. H.R. 1115 instead defers to the notice reforms recommended in theamendments to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure forwarded to Congress by theSupreme Court on March 27, 2003. H.R. 1115 alone permits pre-trial review of a lowerfederal court's grant or denial of class certification and makes its provisions retroactively applicableto suits filed before the date of enactment (but prior to class certification). On October 21, 2003, Senator John Breaux introduced S. 1769 as an alternative bill which is considered to be much broader than S. 1751 . On December 15, 2003, Senator Dodd proposed Senate Amendment 2232 to S. 274 , introduced in the Senate on January 20, 2004, by Senator Grassley. Most of these amendmentsare also incorporated into S. 2062 (the Class Action Fairness Act of 2004) which wasintroduced by Senator Grassley in the Senate on February 10, 2004. On July 8, 2004, S. 2062 failed to get the 60 votes needed to proceed for further consideration which probably will aid the demise of the legislation for this legislative year."
