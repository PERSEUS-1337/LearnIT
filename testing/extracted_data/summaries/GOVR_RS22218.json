    "content": "The United States, like most of the world, is moving to replace current television technology with a new, technically superior format generally referred to as digital television (DTV). As part of this transition, Congress has acted to move television broadcasters out of radio spectrum currently used for the old, analog technology. The vacated radio frequencies are now scheduled for release in accordance with provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-171 ), which sets a February 2009 date for the release of the spectrum. Auctions for commercial uses of the spectrum are scheduled to begin on January 24, 2008. About $10 billion of the auction proceeds has been designated for specific purposes by the act. On July 31, 2007, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced the rules for the auction of airwaves now used for analog TV broadcasting (700 MHz). Because the decisions the FCC makes in setting up an auction of spectrum licenses can shape the bidding process and the eventual outcome of the auction, the FCC typically finds itself under pressure to set requirements that favor specific interests or policy goals. The preparations for the upcoming auction have been particularly fraught with controversy. The propagation characteristics of the spectrum are such that it is considered ideal for wireless broadband. For this and other reasons, control of this spectrum is sought not only by the incumbent wireless companies wishing to expand their capacity but also by companies eager to apply next-generation technologies for new business models. The auction rules introduce two innovative business models for spectrum management and assignment that represent departures from past policy. One model requires a shared network to accommodate both public safety and commercial users in a partnership. The other innovative model designates spectrum licenses for a network that could be managed to accept any suitable wireless device. The decisions the FCC has made for this auction\u00e2\u0080\u0094and by extension for spectrum policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094have framed a new debate about access to the airwaves, the nature of competition in the wireless industry, and wireless access to the Internet."
