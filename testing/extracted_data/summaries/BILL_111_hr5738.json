    "content": "School Enhancement of Talented Students Act or School EATS Act - Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to award competitive grants to states, local educational agencies, or school food authorities to reduce the amount of processed food served each day under the school lunch and breakfast programs. Gives grant priority to applicants: (1) in which at least 50 of the students enrolled in schools under their jurisdictions are eligible for free or reduced price meals. And (2) located in states where the adult obesity rate is not less that 30 and the child obesity rate is more than 30, as determined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Requires grant funds to be used to: (1) procure unprocessed foods, (2) train food service staff to prepare such foods. And (3) purchase the equipment needed to prepare such foods. Requires the Secretary to provide technical assistance to grantees on the procurement of healthy, unprocessed foods. Makes food weight and quantity requirements under the school lunch and breakfast programs inapplicable to food served under this Act's grant program."
