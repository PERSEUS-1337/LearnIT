    "content": "The Mobilehome Residency Law governs tenancies in mobilehome parks. That law, among other things, sets forth certain rights and requirements for the management and selling homeowners in connection with the listing, sale, or exchange of a mobilehome, and, if not prohibited by management, the rental of a mobilehome, including, but not limited to, authorizing the display of signs advertising the sale, exchange, or rental, and authorizing the display of an \u201copen house\u201d sign unless prohibited by park rules. Requiring the signs to contain specified information and be of an H-frame or A-frame design. And requiring the management, upon request of a prospective homeowner, to provide the information the management will use to determine if the person will be acceptable as a homeowner in the park. Under that law, the management or owner may be held liable for damages proximately resulting from the withholding of approval of a prospective homeowner for any reason not stated in that law. On and after July 1, 2016, this bill would no longer condition the display of an open house sign on the lack of prohibition in park rules, but would allow a park to establish reasonable rules or regulations governing the conduct of open houses, as specified. Would additionally authorize a seller to display one sign of an L-frame or a generally accepted yard-arm type design. Would authorize management to require the use of a step-in L-frame sign. And would define a \u201clisting.\u201d The bill would require the management, upon written request, to provide in writing the information and standards the management will use to review a prospective homeowner to the prospective homeowner or seller and make technical changes. The bill would additionally condition the liability for damages resulting from withholding approval of a prospective homeowner for reasons based upon fraud, deceit, or concealment of material facts by the prospective purchaser."
