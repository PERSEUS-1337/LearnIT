In FY2018-FY2026, the Centers for Medicare amp, Medicaid Services,nbsp, usingnbsp, the Medicaid Improvement Fund, shall pay a 90nbsp. Federal matching rate to eligible states for home- and community-based services furnished under a state Medicaid waiver to patientsnbsp, who had been onnbsp, a waiting list for such services."
