Requires the Director to require any GSE obligated to make such a payment to propose criteria for determining whether the liability or legal expenses for which such payment is to be made are reasonable. Requires prompt review and approval or disapproval of such proposed criteria. Requires the Director to require each GSE to adopt bylaws requiring any entity-affiliated party accused of fraud, moral turpitude, or breach of fiduciary duty to post collateral, security, bonding or other assurances of repayment. Requires the Director to prohibit a GSE from using any Treasury funds to satisfy any settlement, judgment, order, or penalty. Requires settlement costs to be satisfied out of the sale of GSE assets. Requires the Director to prohibit a GSE from entering into any consent decree or settlement of a claim, proceeding, or action involving an entity-affiliated party that will result in any qualified indemnification payments exceeding an aggregate of $1 million before 30 days after notice of the decree or settlement to specified congressional committees."
