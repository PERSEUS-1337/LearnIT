    "content": "Restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba have constituted a key and often contentious component in U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba's communist government since the early 1960s. Such restrictions are part of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR), the overall embargo regulations administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Various Administrations have eased and tightened the restrictions over the years as U.S. policy toward Cuba has changed. The Obama Administration lifted all restrictions on family travel and remittances in 2009. In 2011, the Administration eased restrictions on other types of travel, including travel related to religious, educational, and people-to-people exchanges, and allowed any U.S. person to send remittances to individuals in Cuba. As part of President Obama's major shift in U.S. policy toward Cuba in December 2014, which moved the U.S. approach away from a sanctions-based policy toward one of engagement, the Administration took actions that considerably eased restrictions on nonfamily travel and remittances. In 2015 and 2016, OFAC amended the embargo regulations five times to implement the new policy. It initially authorized travel by general license for all 12 categories of travel set forth in the CACR; eliminated traveler per diem limits; increased the amount of nonfamily remittances; and permitted other types of remittances. OFAC subsequently removed dollar limits for donative remittances to Cuban nationals; authorized people-to-people educational travel for individuals; and removed value limits for the importation of Cuban products, including alcohol and tobacco products, by U.S. travelers as accompanied baggage for personal use. In June 2017, the Trump Administration announced a partial rollback of U.S. engagement toward Cuba that included the elimination of individual people-to-people travel and restrictions on financial transactions with companies controlled by the Cuban military, intelligence, or security services or personnel. To implement the policy changes, OFAC amended the embargo regulations in November 2017, and the State Department took complementary action by issuing a list of restricted entities, including more than 80 hotels. Legislative Initiatives In the 115th Congress, six bills have been introduced that would lift all restrictions on travel to Cuba. H.R. 351 (Sanford) and S. 1287 (Flake) would focus solely on prohibiting restrictions on travel to Cuba. H.R. 572 (Serrano) would ease certain restrictions on agricultural and medical exports to Cuba and also would lift restrictions on travel to Cuba. H.R. 574 (Serrano), H.R. 2966 (Rush), and S. 1699 (Wyden) would lift the embargo on Cuba by removing provisions of law restricting trade and other financial transactions with Cuba, including restrictions on travel; both H.R. 2966 and S. 1699 also would prohibit restrictions on remittances. The 115th Congress also took legislative action in October 2018 related to concerns about Cuba's airport security. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, P.L. 115-254, signed into law October 6, 2018, includes a provision requiring the Transportation Security Administration to brief Congress on certain aspects of security measures at Cuban airports that have air service to the United States and to take action to more reliably track air charter operations between the United States and Cuba. Some of the language in the provision is similar, although not identical, to a provision in H.R. 3328 (Katko), the Cuban Airport Security Act of 2017, approved by the House in October 2017; an identical bill, S. 2023 (Rubio), was introduced in the Senate in October 2017. This report examines developments in U.S. policy restricting travel and remittances to Cuba, current permissible travel and remittances, enforcement of the travel restrictions, and debate on lifting the travel restrictions. Appendix A provides a chronology of major actions taken on travel restrictions from 1962 through 2018. Appendix B provides a history of legislative action related to the restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba from 1999 through 2016.
