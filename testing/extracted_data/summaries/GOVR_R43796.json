    "content": "This report analyzes the FY2015 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). While this report makes note of many budgetary resources provided to DHS, its primary focus is on funding approved by Congress through the appropriations process. The Administration requested $38.332 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2015, as part of an overall budget of $60.919 billion (including fees, trust funds, and other funding that is not appropriated or does not score against the budget caps). The request amounted to a $0.938 billion, or 2.4%, decrease from the $39.270 billion enacted through the consolidated appropriations act for FY2014 (P.L. 112-74). In addition, the Administration requested an additional $6.438 billion not reflected above for FEMA in disaster relief funding as defined by the Budget Control Act (BCA). On June 11, 2014, the House Appropriations Committee marked up its draft Homeland Security Appropriations bill, and voted to report it out of committee. The House committee-reported bill provided $39.220 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, as well as the requested disaster relief funding. On June 26, 2014, the Senate Appropriations Committee marked up its draft Homeland Security Appropriations bill, and voted to report it out of committee. The Senate committee-reported bill provided $39.000 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, as well as the requested disaster relief funding, and $213 million for Coast Guard overseas contingency operations. On September 19, 2014, the President signed H.J.Res. 124, the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015, into law as P.L. 113-164. This continuing resolution originally funded the operations of the federal government at the current annual rate until December 11, 2014, or until full-year appropriations were passed, whichever came first. It has been extended by three other short-term continuing resolutions, including Division L of H.R. 83, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, which extended funding for DHS through February 27, 2015. With the beginning of the 114th Congress, both House- and Senate-reported FY2015 annual homeland security appropriations bills were no longer available for action. H.R. 240, a new FY2015 annual homeland security appropriations bill, was introduced on January 9, 2015, and considered in the House the following week under a structured rule that allowed five immigration policy-related amendments. After adopting these five amendments, the bill passed the House on January 14, 2015. On February 27, the Senate passed an amended H.R. 240 without the legislative text added by the House amendments. After the House did not pass a three-week extension of the continuing resolution, the Senate and House passed a one week extension of the continuing resolution to avoid a lapse in annual appropriations for DHS. On March 3, 2015, the House voted to approve the Senate version of H.R. 240. The bill was signed into law on March 4, 2015, as P.L. 114-4. As enacted, the bill provided $39.670 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, as well as the requested $6.438 billion in disaster relief funding and $213 million for Coast Guard overseas contingency operations, for total adjustments under the BCA of $6.651 billion."
