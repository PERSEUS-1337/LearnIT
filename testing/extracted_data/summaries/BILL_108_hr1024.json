    "content": "Creates within the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) a pelagic longline highly migratory species bycatch and mortality reduction research program, to be developed by a design team established by the Secretary of Commerce. Requires the program to determine the impact of existing time and area closures designed to reduce bycatch of longline vessels. Authorizes the NMFS to grant permits for vessels with NMFS-provided observers to fish in closed areas of the Atlantic Ocean in furtherance of the research program. Amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to close to pelagic longline fishing the lower mid-Atlantic Conservation Zone between August 15 and October 1 and the upper mid-Atlantic Conservation Zone between July 15 and October 1 of each year."
