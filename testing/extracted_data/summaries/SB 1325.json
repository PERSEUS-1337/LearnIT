    "title": "An act to amend Section 25247 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to hazardous waste.",
    "content": "Existing law requires the owner or operator of a hazardous waste facility to submit hazardous waste facility closure and postclosure plans to the Department of Toxic Substances Control and to the California regional water quality control board for the region in which the facility is located. Existing law requires the department to review those plans and to approve a plan if it finds that the plan complies with the regulations adopted by the department and all other applicable state and federal regulations. Existing law requires the department to impose the requirements of a hazardous waste facility postclosure plan on the owner or operator of a facility through the issuance of a postclosure permit, or, only until January 1, 2009, through an enforcement order or an enforceable agreement, except as specified. This bill would restore the authority of the department to impose those requirements through an enforcement order or an enforceable agreement and would require the department, on or before January 1, 2018, to adopt regulations to impose postclosure plan requirements. This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 25247 of the Health and Safety Code proposed by AB 1611 and SB 839 that would become operative if this bill and one or both of those bills are enacted and this bill is chaptered last."
