    "title": "An act to amend Section 48204 of the Education Code, relating to pupils.",
    "content": "Existing law requires persons between 6 and 18 years of age, inclusive, to attend a public school within the school district in which the pupil\u2019s parent or legal guardian resides, unless otherwise exempted. Existing law provides that a pupil complies with a school district\u2019s residency requirements for school attendance in that school district if the pupil meets one of the specified requirements. This bill would provide that a pupil complies with a school district\u2019s residency requirements in instances where the pupil\u2019s parent or legal guardian resides outside of the boundaries of that school district but is employed and lives with the pupil at the place of his or her employment within the boundaries of the school district for a minimum of 3 days during the school week. By requiring a school district to allow those pupils to attend a public school within the school district, thereby increasing the duties of a school district, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
