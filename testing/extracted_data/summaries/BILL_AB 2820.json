    "title": "AB 2820",
    "content": "Under existing law, upon the proclamation of a state of emergency resulting from an earthquake, flood, fire, riot, storm, or natural or manmade disaster declared by the President of the United States or the Governor, or upon the declaration of a local emergency resulting from an earthquake, flood, fire, riot, storm, or natural or manmade disaster by the executive officer of any county, city, or city and county, and for a period of 30 days following that declaration, it is a misdemeanor with specified penalties for a person, contractor, business, or other entity to sell or offer to sell certain goods and services for a price that exceeds by 10 the price charged by that person immediately prior to the proclamation of emergency, except as specified. This bill would revise the definitions of a state of emergency and a local emergency to mean a natural or manmade emergency resulting from an earthquake, flood, fire, riot, storm, drought, plant or animal infestation or disease, or other natural or manmade disaster for which a state of emergency has been declared by the President of the United States or the Governor of California or for which a local emergency has been declared by an official, board, or other governing body vested with authority to make such a declaration in any city, county, or city and county in California, respectively. The bill would include towing services in the provisions described above. The bill would also specify that housing means any rental housing with an initial lease term of no longer than one year for purposes of these provisions. The bill would make other clarifying and conforming changes, including, among others, a specification that these provisions apply to both a state of emergency and a local emergency, and would make certain additional findings by the Legislature. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would create a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
