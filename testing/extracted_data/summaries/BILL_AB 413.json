    "title": "AB 413",
    "content": "The California Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise Program addresses the special needs of disabled veterans by assisting state procurement authorities in meeting or exceeding the disabled veteran enterprise participation goal of 3 for procurement contracts. Existing law, under the program, authorizes a child or spouse to continue to operate a disabled veteran business enterprise for 3 years after the death or the certification of a permanent medical disability of a disabled veteran who was the majority owner of that enterprise, but only for purposes of any contract entered into before his or her death or certification of disability. This bill would delete the provision that only allows a child or spouse to operate the business for purposes of the contracts entered into before death or certification of disability. The bill would clarify the scope and purpose of the provision authorizing a child or spouse to continue to operate a disabled veteran business enterprise for 3 years after the death or the certification of a permanent medical disability of a disabled veteran who was the majority owner of that enterprise. The bill would also set forth a statement of legislative intent."
