    "content": "Stealth Lobbyist Disclosure Act of 2007 - Amends the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 to redefine the term client with respect to coalitions and associations on whose behalf a lobbyist must file a registration. Provides that, in the case of a coalition or association that employs or retains other persons to conduct lobbying activities, each of the individual members of the coalition or association, and not the coalition or association itself as under current law, is the client for whom a registration must be filed. Exempts from such registration requirement any individual member of a coalition or association if the amount such member is reasonably expected to contribute toward specific legislation-influencing activities of the coalition or association is less than $1,000 per any quarterly period. Requires quarterly instead of semiannual filing of lobbying disclosures reports. Lowers the dollar thresholds of contributions toward lobbying activities that trigger the requirement to register as a lobbyist."
