    "content": "This bill amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to reauthorize and modify the Department of Agriculture Assistive Technology Program for Farmers with Disabilities. The bill modifies the program to specify that veterans are eligible for assistance under the program, including disabled veterans and family members who: (1) are engaged in farming and farm-related occupations, and (2) are pursuing new farming opportunities. The bill also permits the grants to be used for programs that provide behavioral therapy programs to assist veterans with mental service-connected disabilities, such as post-traumatic stress disorder."
