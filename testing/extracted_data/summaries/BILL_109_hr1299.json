    "content": "Critical Habitat Enhancement Act of 2005 - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to require the relevant Secretary to make any designation of critical habitat of an endangered or threatened species not later than one year after final approval of a recovery plan for the species or three years after final regulations implementing a determination that the species is endangered or threatened, whichever is earlier. Directs the Secretary to reconsider determinations that critical habitat designation is not practicable or determinable during the next five-year review of listed species or at the time of final approval of a recovery plan for the species. Makes critical habitat designations inapplicable to actions authorized by: (1) an incidental taking permit, (2) an incidental taking statement provided by the Secretary. Or (3) a land conservation or species management program that meets specified requirements. Directs the Secretary, in determining whether an area is critical habitat, to seek and consider information from local governments in the vicinity of the area. Specifies factors for consideration in determining the economic impact of critical habitat designation. Modifies notice requirements applicable to proposed designations of critical habitat to require that any municipality having administrative jurisdiction over the area in which the species is believed to occur is given actual notice. Redefines critical habitat to mean geographic areas determined by field survey data to be occupied by the species at the time of designation and which are necessary to the continued existence of the species."
