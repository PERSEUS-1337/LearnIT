The enterprise level Cloud Migration projects are generally com- plex, involves dynamically planning and replanning various types of transformations for up to 10k endpoints. Currently the planning and replanning in Cloud Migration are generally done manually or semi-manually with heavy dependency on the migration expert\u2019s domain knowledge, which takes days to even weeks for each round of planning or replanning. As a result, automated planning engine that is capable of gener- ating high quality migration plan in a short time is particu- larly desirable for the migration industry. In this short paper, we briefly introduce the advantages of using AI planning in Cloud Migration, a preliminary prototype, as well as the challenges the requires attention from the planning and scheduling society. Automated planning and AI planning have been investigated extensively by researchers and successfully applied in many areas for decades, for example, health care BID0 , semiconductor manufacturing BID1 , and aviation BID2 , to name a few. Meanwhile, attracted by the promise of the scalability, flexibility and potentially lower cost of the resources, more and more enterprises are considering moving their IT infrastructure and applications to Cloud or Hybrid Cloud service platforms, which is called Cloud Migration in general (Armbrust et. al. 2010, Khajeh-Hosseini, Greenwood, and Sommerville 2010) . Noticing that the discussions of using AI planning in the Cloud Migration are limited both in academia and in industry, in this short paper we identify the advantages and challenges of applying AI planning to Cloud Migration by (i) introducing Cloud Migration and its planning problem; (ii) demonstrate problem feasibility by showing a prototype AI planning model; and (iii) discuss the limits of current model and future research."
