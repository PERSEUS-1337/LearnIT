    "content": "The California Bay-Delta Program (CALFED) was initiated in 1995 to resolve water resources conflicts in the Sacramento/San Joaquin Rivers Delta and San Francisco Bay (Bay-Delta) in California. The program planning effort focused on developing a plan to address three main problem areas in the Bay-Delta: ecosystem health, water quality, and water supply reliability. CALFED was initially authorized to receive federal funding from FY1998 to FY2000; and since that time only certain projects supporting CALFED goals received appropriations. The program was finally reauthorized October 25, 2004. The Bay-Delta is formed by the confluence of the north-flowing San Joaquin River, the south-flowing Sacramento River, and the San Francisco Bay, to which the delta of the two rivers is linked. This 738,000-acre area contains a vast network of marshes, wetlands, and open water that supplies water to two-thirds of California's population and nearly seven million acres of farmland through a series of pumps, canals, and dams operated by the federal and state governments. The competing demands for Bay-Delta water have stretched the resource's capacity to provide reliable amounts of water to users (e.g., farmers) and the ecosystem. The Bay-Delta ecosystem is being altered by habitat conversion and water quality degradation, including salt water intrusion. For example, several fish populations have declined, and some species are on federal threatened and endangered species lists. Many attribute the deterioration to unnaturally low levels of water in the Bay-Delta. Listing of these species has affected the timing and use of water pumped from the Bay-Delta and has created uncertainty in water supplies for water users in southern California. Allocating water from the Bay-Delta has been the subject of conflicts and disputes among stakeholders such as farmers, urban water contractors, and environmentalists for years. CALFED was developed as a response to these conflicts through a series of agreements and revisions that have involved federal and state legislation, and stakeholder accords. A Record of Decision (ROD) for the current CALFED Program was issued by a consortium of state and federal agencies in August 2000; however, legislation to implement the CALFED Program as outlined in the ROD had not been enacted until recently. CALFED, as described in the ROD, has 12 program components that range from water quality and supply to ecosystem restoration and governance. CALFED was planned to be implemented in three phases, of which two are already completed. The third phase is the implementation of the CALFED program as outlined in the ROD. Stage I (of three stages in phase III) of CALFED is currently underway and is expected to take seven years to complete and cost nearly $8.7 billion. The reauthorization of CALFED funding has been controversial. Specific issues such as authorization for water storage projects, balance among project and program activities, and water supplies for the environment, as well as broader issues such as governance and the degree to which the ROD is implemented, were resolved to varying degrees with the passage of P.L. 108-361, which reauthorized the CALFED Program. This report will be updated as events warrant."
