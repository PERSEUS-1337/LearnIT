    "content": "Gold Star Families Equality Act - Requires a lapel button to be designed to identify widows, parents, and next of kin of members of the Armed Forces who die, under circumstances not already prescribed for under existing eligibility standards for a gold star lapel button, while serving on active duty or while assigned to a reserve component in a drill status. Makes such next of kin button available retroactively to survivors of members of the Armed Forces who have died since September 10, 2001. Directs the Secretary of each military department and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to provide for the issuance of a Gold Star Installation Access Card to family members with gold or next of kin buttons to expedite their ability to gain unescorted access to military installations for the purpose of obtaining on-base services and benefits. Requires regulations to be prescribed to permit parents with such buttons to use commissary stores and other military retail facilities on the same basis as surviving spouses or children."
