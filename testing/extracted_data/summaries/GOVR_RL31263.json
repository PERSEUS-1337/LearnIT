Improving public health preparedness andresponse capacity offers protection not only from bioterrorist attacks, but also from naturallyoccurring public health emergencies. On June 12, 2002, the President signed into law the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-188 , H.R. 3448 ), which is intendedto bolster the nation's ability to respond effectively to bioterrorist threats and other public healthemergencies. The act builds on the programs and authorities established in Title III of the PublicHealth Service (PHS) Act by the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-505 ,Title I). P.L. 107-188 is a 5-year authorization bill, which calls for a total of $2.4 billion in funding in FY2002, $2.0 billion in FY2003, and such sums as may be necessary for the remaining years. Theact authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to upgrade and renovate facilitiesat the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), purchase smallpox vaccine, expand thenational stockpile of drugs, vaccines, and other emergency medical supplies, and provide grants tostate and local governments and hospitals to improve preparedness and planning. The Secretariesof HHS and Agriculture are required to register and regulate facilities that handle potentiallydangerous biological agents. The anti-bioterrorism legislation also includes provisions to protect the nation's food and drug supply and enhance agricultural security, including new regulatory powers for the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) to block the importation of unsafe foods. To protect the drinking watersupply, the act requires community water systems to conduct vulnerability assessments and developemergency response plans.
