    "content": "The Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 , 116 Stat. 2135) contains provisions to arm pilots of passenger aircraft and gives deputized pilots the authority to use force,including lethal force, to defend the flight deck against criminal and terrorist threats. Participationin the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program, established under the Arming Pilots Against TerrorismAct contained in P.L. 107-296 , was initially limited to pilots of passenger aircraft. However, aprovision in the FAA reauthorization act (Vision 100; P.L. 108-176 , 117 Stat. 2490) expanded theprogram to include flight engineers as well as flight crews of all-cargo aircraft. During debate over legislation to arm pilots, proponents argued that the potential benefits of deterring or thwarting terrorist and criminal acts against passenger aircraft outweighed the inherentrisks associated with arming pilots. However, opponents of policy allowing pilots to be armed withlethal weapons argued that such a program's safety risks and monetary costs significantlyoutweighed these potential benefits. Risks cited included potential distraction to the flight crew,dangers that a weapon discharge could pose to the aircraft or its occupants, and security concernsassociated with carrying firearms in secured areas of the aviation system. Proponents countered thatthese risks could be effectively mitigated, but recognized that these are important issues to beaddressed for successful implementation of the policy to arm pilots. With enactment of this legislation, focus on the issue of arming pilots has turned to implementation of the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program. These implementation issues fall intofour broad categories: 1) pilot selection and screening; 2) equipment (i.e., firearms and ammunitionand the risks they may pose to aircraft and passengers); 3) training; and 4) operational procedures. This report describes several implementation issues within each of these areas that may requirecontinued legislative oversight and possible clarification regarding the intent of the legislation. TheTSA has fully implemented the program over the last year. However, continued concerns voiced bypilot groups over the implementation of the program include: the extensive background checksrequired of applicants; the requirement to transport issued firearms in lock boxes; and theinconvenient location of training facilities. These issues, along with the possibility of using privatecontractors to provide recurrent training for deputized pilots may be the topics of continuedcongressional oversight. This report will not be updated."
