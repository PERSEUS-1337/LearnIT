    "content": "COPS Improvements Act of 2015 This bill amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to codify the establishment of the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services within the Department of Justice (DOJ). It revises and reauthorizes through FY2020 the Community Oriented and Policing Services program. The bill expands the purpose areas of the existing program with respect to community policing and crime prevention grants. Additionally, it establishes three new programs. The bill: (1) directs DOJ to administer a troops-to-cops program to encourage the use of grants to hire and train former members of the Armed Forces as career law enforcement officers, (2) authorizes DOJ to award grants to pay for additional community prosecuting programs, and (3) authorizes DOJ to award grants to develop and use new crime-prevention technologies."
