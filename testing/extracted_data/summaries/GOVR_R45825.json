    "content": "The Constitution's Supremacy Clause provides that federal law is \"the supreme Law of the Land\" notwithstanding any state law to the contrary. This language is the foundation for the doctrine of federal preemption, according to which federal law supersedes conflicting state laws. The Supreme Court has identified two general ways in which federal law can preempt state law. First, federal law can expressly preempt state law when a federal statute or regulation contains explicit preemptive language. Second, federal law can impliedly preempt state law when Congress's preemptive intent is implicit in the relevant federal law's structure and purpose. This report begins with an overview of certain general preemption principles. In both express and implied preemption cases, the Supreme Court has made clear that Congress's purpose is the \"ultimate touchstone\" of its statutory analysis. The Court's analysis of Congress's purpose has at times been informed by a canon of statutory construction known as the \"presumption against preemption,\" which instructs that federal law should not be read as preempting state law \"unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\" However, the Court has recently applied the presumption somewhat inconsistently, raising questions about its current scope and effect. Moreover, in 2016, the Court held that the presumption no longer applies in express preemption cases. After reviewing these general themes in the Supreme Court's preemption jurisprudence, the report turns to the Court's express preemption case law. In this section, the report analyzes how the Court has interpreted federal statutes that preempt (1) state laws \"related to\" certain subjects, (2) state laws concerning certain subjects \"covered\" by federal laws and regulations, (3) state requirements that are \"in addition to, or different than\" federal requirements, and (4) state \"requirements,\" \"laws,\" \"regulations,\" and \"standards.\" While preemption decisions depend heavily on the details of particular statutory schemes, the Court has assigned some of these phrases specific meanings even when they have appeared in different statutory contexts. Finally, the report reviews illustrative examples of the Court's implied preemption decisions. In these cases, the Court has identified two subcategories of implied preemption: \"field preemption\" and \"conflict preemption.\" Field preemption occurs when a pervasive scheme of federal regulation implicitly precludes supplementary state regulation, or where states attempt to regulate a field where there is clearly a dominant federal interest. Applying these principles, the Court has held that federal law occupies a number of regulatory fields, including alien registration, nuclear safety regulation, and the regulation of locomotive equipment. In contrast, conflict preemption occurs when simultaneous compliance with both federal and state regulations is impossible (\"impossibility preemption\"), or when state law poses an obstacle to the accomplishment of federal goals (\"obstacle preemption\"). The Court has extended the scope of impossibility preemption in two recent decisions, holding that compliance with both federal and state law can be \"impossible\" even when a regulated party can (1) petition the federal government for permission to comply with state law, or (2) avoid violations of the law by refraining from selling a regulated product altogether. In its obstacle preemption decisions, the Court has concluded that state law can interfere with federal goals by frustrating Congress's intent to adopt a uniform system of federal regulation, conflicting with Congress's goal of establishing a regulatory \"ceiling\" for certain products or activities, or by impeding the vindication of a federal right."
