    "title": "AB 2723",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may adjudge certain children to be dependents of the court under certain circumstances, including when the child is abused, a parent or guardian fails to adequately supervise or protect the child, as specified, or a parent or guardian fails to provide the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or medical treatment. Existing law declares that a child is within the dependency jurisdiction of the juvenile court if the child is a victim of sexual trafficking, or receives food, shelter, or money in exchange for specified sexual acts, as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent or guardian to protect the child, and declares that this is declaratory of existing law. This bill would additionally include a child within the dependency jurisdiction of the juvenile court if the child solicits or engages in any act of prostitution or loiters in a public place with the intent to commit prostitution, and the child\u2019s parent or guardian has failed to protect the child. The bill would state that these provisions are declaratory of existing law. The Arnold-Kennick Juvenile Court Law provides that any person who is under 18 years of age when he or she violates any criminal law while in this state, except an age curfew ordinance or any other specified offense, comes within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may adjudge the person a ward of the court. This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to that provision."
