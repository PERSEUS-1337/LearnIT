    "title": "AB 946",
    "content": "Existing law requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to implement the Alternative and Renewable Fuel Vehicle Technology Program to provide financial assistance to develop and deploy innovative technologies that transform California\u2019s fuel and vehicle types to help attain the state\u2019s climate change policies. Existing law includes within the program alternative and renewable fuel infrastructure, fueling stations, and equipment. This bill would specify that alternative and renewable fuel infrastructure includes electric vehicle charging infrastructure in disadvantaged communities. Existing law, the Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Open Access Act, prohibits the charging of a subscription fee on persons desiring to use an electric vehicle charging station, as defined, and prohibits a requirement for persons to obtain membership in any club, association, or organization as a condition of using the station, except as specified. The act authorizes the State Air Resources Board to adopt interoperability billing standards for network roaming payment methods for electric vehicle charging stations if no interoperability billing standards have been adopted by a national standards organization by January 1, 2015. The act provides that if the state board adopts interoperability billing standards, all electric vehicle charging stations that require payment shall meet those standards within one year. This bill would change the date of the state board\u2019s conditional authorization to adopt those interoperability billing standards to January 1, 2016, and would require the electric vehicle charging stations to meet those standards within 6 months."
