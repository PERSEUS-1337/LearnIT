    "content": "Internet privacy issues encompass several types of concerns. One is the collection ofpersonally identifiable information (PII) by website operators from visitors to government andcommercial websites, or by software that is surreptitiously installed on a user's computer (\"spyware\")and transmits the information to someone else. Another is the monitoring of electronic mail andWeb usage by the government or law enforcement officials, employers, or email service providers. The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks intensified debate over the issue of monitoring bythe government and law enforcement officials, with some advocating increased tools to help themtrack down terrorists, and others cautioning that fundamental tenets of democracy, such as privacy,not be endangered in that pursuit. Congress passed the 2001 USA PATRIOT Act ( P.L. 107-56 ) that, inter alia , makes it easier for law enforcement officials to monitor Internet activities. That act wasamended by the Homeland Security Act ( P.L. 107-296 ), loosening restrictions as to when, and towhom, Internet Service Providers may voluntarily release the content of communications if theybelieve there is a danger of death or injury. Some provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act, includingtwo that relate to Internet use, would have expired on December 31, 2005. Congress passed a briefextension (to February 3, 2006) in P.L. 109-160 . Debate over whether civil liberties protectionsneed to be added if the provisions are to be made permanent is expected to continue in the secondsession of the 109th Congress. Revelations that President Bush directed the National SecurityAgency to monitor some communications, including e-mails, in the United States without warrantsmay affect those deliberations. The debate over website information policies concerns whether industry self regulation orlegislation is the best approach to protecting consumer privacy. Congress has considered legislationthat would require commercial website operators to follow certain fair information practices, but theonly law that has been enacted (COPPA, P.L. 105-277 ) concerns the privacy of children under 13,not the general public. Legislation has passed regarding information practices for federalgovernment websites, including the E-Government Act ( P.L. 107-347 ). The growing controversy about how to protect computer users from \"spyware\" withoutcreating unintended consequences is discussed briefly in this report, but in more detail in CRS Report RL32706 . Another issue, identity theft, is not an Internet privacy issue per se, but is oftendebated in the context of whether the Internet makes identity theft more prevalent. For example,Internet-based practices called \"phishing\" and \"pharming\" may contribute to identity theft. Identitytheft is briefly discussed in this report; more information is available in CRS Report RS22082 , CRS Report RL31919 , and CRS Report RL32535 . Wireless privacy issues are discussed in CRS Report RL31636 . This is the final edition of this report. It provides an overview of Internet privacy issues andrelated laws passed in previous Congresses, and discusses legislative activity in the first session ofthe 109th Congress."
