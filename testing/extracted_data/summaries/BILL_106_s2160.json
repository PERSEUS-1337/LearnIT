    "content": "Prohibits group health plans and health insurance issuers from: (1) denying an individual eligibility or continuing eligibility to enroll or renew coverage because of the individual's or enrollee's use or potential use of items or services covered by this Act. (2) providing monetary payments or rebates to a covered individual to encourage the acceptance of less than minimum protections available under this Act. Or (3) providing incentives to a health care professional to induce such professional to withhold infertility services from a covered individual. Amends the PHSA to apply infertility benefits provisions to health insurance coverage offered by an issuer in the individual market in the same manner as they are applied to coverage in the group market. Provides the infertility benefit coverage described by this Act for Federal employee health benefit plans as well."
