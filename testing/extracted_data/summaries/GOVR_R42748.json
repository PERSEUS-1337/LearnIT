CTE is an element of the nation's workforce development system. As such, CTE plays a role in reducing unemployment and the associated economic and social ills. This report provides a primer on CTE to support congressional discussion of initiatives designed to rationalize the workforce development system. CTE prepares students for roles outside the paid labor market, teaches general employment skills, and teaches skills required in specific occupations or careers. In order to focus and structure programs, curricula, and resources, practitioners at the local, state, and federal levels often organize CTE into 16 career clusters and various career pathways for each career cluster. CTE career clusters include several occupational areas, such as health science and manufacturing. Career pathways generally refer to a series of connected education and training strategies and support services that enable individuals to secure industry-recognized credentials and obtain employment within an occupational area and to advance to higher levels of future education and employment in that area. At the secondary level, CTE is offered in high schools, area CTE centers, community colleges, and detention centers. Nearly all 2009 public high school graduates (88%) earned at least one CTE credit, and 19% earned at least three CTE credits in a single occupational area. Four issues confound the offering of CTE at the secondary level. The first is whether CTE courses should be offered to (1) broaden the students' education and provide early exposure to several career options or (2) ensure students are prepared to enter the workforce immediately with an industry-recognized credential after completion of a career pathway in high school or after one to two additional years of postsecondary education or training. The second issue is the expense of maintaining and updating the instructional resources and equipment for a single career cluster or pathway, particularly at the secondary level. The third issue is whether CTE adds value to a college preparatory high school curriculum. For example, U.S. Department of Education statistics of 2004 public high school graduates demonstrated no significant difference in average wages between all graduates working for pay but not enrolled in postsecondary education and CTE graduates working for pay but not enrolled in postsecondary education. However, of the CTE graduates working for pay but not enrolled in postsecondary education, only 30% were in an occupation related to their high school CTE concentration. The final issue is related to state adoption in recent years of the common core standards that are termed college- and career-ready standards, although the standards do not define career-ready and thus may not provide immediate career preparation. At the postsecondary level, CTE is offered by community colleges, vocational schools, and employers through apprenticeships and on-the-job training. Some CTE programs are terminal (few courses are transferable for credit toward a more advanced credential), while others may lead to stackable credentials (a sequence of credentials leading to more advanced qualifications). The ability or inability to transfer CTE credits toward a credential with higher earning potential or a bachelor's degree highlights one conflict among policymakers. The difficulty in structuring every postsecondary CTE program to include the first one to two years of general bachelor's degree requirements is that the CTE program will likely require more time to accomplish and may be of less interest to the CTE student. CTE for adults is work-related course-taking that may incorporate adult basic education (ABE). At the adult level, CTE is offered by secondary and postsecondary CTE providers, employers, and community and government organizations. The rates at which adults engage in work-related course-taking increases with age, labor market engagement, and education. The Bureau of Census collects earnings data for the adult population with various educational credentials. The most recent data available on subbaccalaureate populations suggests that alternative credentials (such educational certificates or professional certification and licenses) are associated with a statistically significant wage premium for populations with no postsecondary degree when compared to others with comparable levels of formal education. In addition, vocational certificates and associate's degrees in more technical CTE fields like computer and information services are associated with substantially higher earnings than vocational certificates and associate's degree in less technical CTE fields like business."
