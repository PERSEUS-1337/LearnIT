    "content": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) exempt qualified disaster-relief distributions from the ten percent penalty on premature distributions from tax-exempt retirement plans. And (2) allow repayment of such distributions to the retirement plan within five years after the date of such distribution. Defines a qualified disaster-relief distribution as a distribution to an individual who has sustained a loss in excess of $100 from a major disaster declared under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act if such distribution is made within one year after the disaster declaration and the distribution does not exceed the amount of the loss and is not covered by insurance or otherwise."
