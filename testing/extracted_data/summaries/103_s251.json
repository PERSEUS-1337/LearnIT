Allows use of program grant funds for retraining or to update existing skills with respect to an eligible dislocated worker, including an employee of an eligible defense contractor or subcontractor, who has been terminated or laid off, or received notice of termination or layoff, as a consequence of reductions in US expenditures for defense or by closures of US military facilities. Allows program grant funds also to be used to pay for the Federal share of such retraining with respect to an employee of eligible defense contractors or subcontractors if: (1) the employee is currently involved in defense work. (2) the retraining is designed to enable the employee to achieve placement and retention in unsubsidized employment that involves nondefense work and in which the employee has not been previously engaged. And (3) the employer certifies that the employee would have become an eligible dislocated worker without such retraining. Revises program administration provisions. Allows program grants to be used to reimburse an entity for funds expended under JTPA provisions for Dislocated Workers.
