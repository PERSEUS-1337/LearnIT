    "title": "An act to amend Sections 13700, 13700.5, 13701, and 13703 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to homeless youth, and making an appropriation therefor.",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the Homeless Youth and Exploitation Program, under which homeless youth emergency service projects are established in the Counties of Los Angeles, Santa Clara, San Diego, and the City and County of San Francisco through a grant program to eligible private, nonprofit agencies with a demonstrated record of success in the delivery of services to homeless youth. Under existing law, this program is administered by the Office of Emergency Services. Existing law requires each project to provide specified services, including food and access to overnight shelter, counseling to address immediate emotional crises and problems, and long-term stabilization planning. This bill would require a homeless youth emergency service project to be established in the County of Orange and would require the Office of Emergency Services to establish additional homeless youth emergency service projects in other counties with a priority given to counties that lack existing services for runaway and homeless youth. The bill would require the Office of Emergency Services to develop, with input from specified stakeholders, criteria for the selection of grantees and the determination of grant amounts under the grant program. The bill would additionally require each project to provide transitional living services for designated homeless youth for a period of up to 36 months, with access to education and employment assistance, independent living skill development, and family engagement and interventions. The bill would appropriate $25,000,000 from the General Fund to the Office of Emergency Services to provide additional funding for these homeless youth emergency service projects."
