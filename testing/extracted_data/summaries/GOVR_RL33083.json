    "content": "Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal and state governments, but each state designs andadministers its own version of the program under broad federal guidelines. The complexity ofMedicaid can present an enormous challenge in meeting the needs of Hurricane Katrina's victims,especially when evacuees cross state lines. State variation in eligibility, covered services, and thereimbursement and delivery of services is the rule rather than the exception. Furthermore, althoughMedicaid is targeted at individuals with low income, not all of the poor are eligible, and not all thosecovered are poor. As a federal-state program that helps to finance health care services for people with limitedresources, Medicaid is an obvious avenue of quick response for support of victims in the aftermathof a disaster. The program's federal budgetary status as mandatory spending means that federalfunding is available to support coverage for all people who meet the program's eligibility criteria,without the need for a supplemental appropriation. However, the ability of Medicaid to respond to a disaster -- in terms of the numbers and typesof people who can rely on it for health care support -- may depend on a number of factors, includingcongressional action to modify statutory provisions (e.g., the level of federal Medicaidreimbursement offered to states), the Secretary of Health and Human Services' ability to waivecertain program requirements administratively (e.g., regarding eligibility and benefits), and actionsof the states (each of whom operates its own unique Medicaid program within federal guidelines). This report, which will be updated as events warrant, discusses the following: Medicaid's rules on eligibility, benefits, and financing in the context of currentquestions and issues raised by Hurricane Katrina. Recent state actions in response to Medicaid issues raised by thehurricane. Federal Medicaid waiver authority, including information on current activityin this area and the New York Disaster Relief Medicaid waiver granted in response to the September11 terrorist attacks. Current federal legislation related to Medicaid and Hurricane Katrina reliefefforts."
