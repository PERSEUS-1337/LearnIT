    "content": "In the Supreme Court's 2003-2004 term, concluded June, 2004, the Court accepted for reviewseven environmental cases -- an unusually large number. Five decisions were handed down duringthe term, and two cases were carried over to the upcoming 2004-2005 term. Of the five decided cases, three involve the Clean Air Act (CAA). Alaska Dep't ofEnvironmental Conservation v. EPA asked whether EPA may issue CAA enforcement orders thateffectively overrule a permit issued by a state under its EPA-approved air program. The Court saidyes, though only by a 5-4 margin. In Engine Manufacturers Ass'n v. South Coast Air QualityManagement District , the Court held that the CAA preempts a state from compelling local vehiclefleet operators to buy new vehicles from the state's list of low-emission models. And Dep't ofTransportation v. Public Citizen spoke to whether DOT safety regulations whose promulgationallowed Mexican trucks greater range in the United States must be preceded by environmentalanalyses under the CAA and National Environmental Policy Act. Because DOT lacks discretion toprevent the truck movement, said the Court, the added emissions from that movement did not haveto be considered. The other decided cases are, first, South Florida Water Management District v. MiccosukeeTribe of Indians , holding that a point source of discharges into U.S. navigable waters must obtaina Clean Water Act permit despite the fact that the point source itself did not add the pollutants in thedischarged water. Second, Norton v. Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance clarified the availabilityof judicial review of federal agency inaction under the Administrative Procedure Act, which allowsreview of agency action \"unlawfully withheld.\" Environmental cases to be heard in the 2004-2005 term are Cooper Industries, Inc. v. AviallServices, Inc. , addressing when contribution actions are available under the Superfund Act, and Bates v. Dow Agrosciences, LLC , which wrestles with the scope of federal preemption of state lawunder the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. It is not apparent why the Court has chosen this moment to enlarge its environmental docket. No unifying theme is apparent in the accepted cases, and why some of them piqued the Court'sinterest is perplexing. There are some commonalities, however. All seven cases raise principallystatutory, rather than constitutional, issues. The results, in the cases decided so far, lean against the\"environmental\" side, though not exclusively so. And three of the seven cases turn on the nature ofthe federal-state relationship, a favorite theme of the current Court."
