    "content": "This report discusses FY2017 appropriations for the Department of the Interior's (DOI's) Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), and Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR). The three agencies collectively administer federal ocean energy resources covering more than 1.7 billion acres on the U.S. outer continental shelf (OCS). BOEM administers offshore energy leasing, BSEE oversees offshore operational safety and environmental responsibility, and ONRR manages public revenues from federally regulated offshore and onshore energy projects. BOEM, BSEE, and ONRR receive appropriations in the annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. The 114th Congress did not enact full-year Interior appropriations for FY2017. Continuing funds for the ocean energy agencies were provided through April 28, 2017, by two continuing resolutions (CRs; P.L. 114-223 and P.L. 114-254). The CRs generally provide funding at the FY2016 level, minus an across-the-board reduction of less than 1%. The 115th Congress is faced with addressing these agencies' appropriations for the remainder of FY2017. BOEM's and BSEE's operations are funded both by discretionary appropriations from general funds of the Treasury and by the authority to expend offsetting collections derived from a portion of OCS rental receipts and cost recovery fees (and, for BSEE, inspection fees). The initial discretionary appropriation for each fiscal year to each agency is reduced by the amount of eligible receipts and fees that are collected, so that the final amount appropriated to BOEM and BSEE is the net of those collections. ONRR does not receive funding through offsetting collections. For FY2017, the Obama Administration requested total appropriations of $175.1 million for BOEM, $204.9 million for BSEE, and $129.3 million for ONRR. The BOEM total included an estimated $94.9 million in offsetting collections, for a net appropriation of $80.2 million. The BSEE total included an estimated $108.5 million in offsetting collections, for a net appropriation of $96.3 million. The requests for all three agencies represented increases from enacted FY2016 appropriations\u2014a requested increase of 8.0% for BOEM (for the net appropriation after offsets), 8.9% for BSEE (for the net appropriation after offsets), and 3.0% for ONRR. On July 14, 2016, the House passed H.R. 5538, the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill for FY2017. On June 16, 2016, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of the bill, S. 3068. Neither bill was enacted. For BOEM, H.R. 5538 recommended total appropriations of $169.3 million, with $94.9 million derived from offsetting collections, for a net appropriation of $74.4 million. S. 3068 recommended total appropriations of $169.6 million for BOEM, with $94.9 million derived from offsetting collections, for a net appropriation of $74.6 million. For BSEE, H.R. 5538 recommended total appropriations of $204.9 million, with $96.5 million derived from offsetting collections, along with a rescission of $20.0 million\u2014resulting in a net appropriation for BSEE of $88.3 million. S. 3068 recommended total appropriations of $204.7 million for BSEE, with $96.5 million derived from offsetting collections and a rescission of $25.0 million, for a net appropriation of $83.1 million. For ONRR, H.R. 5538 contained appropriations of $126.5 million and S. 3068 contained appropriations of $121.8 million."
