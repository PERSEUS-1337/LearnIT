Deems any period of enrollment under a health benefits plan administered by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation before the effective date of this Act to be a period of enrollment in a Federal health benefits plan for purposes of the administration of Federal health benefits coverage. Allows any individual who, as of the enrollment eligibility date, is covered by a Corporation-administered plan to enroll in an approved Federal health benefits plan for continued coverage after such date, including individuals currently under a continued coverage period and unmarried dependent children.
