    "title": "SB 662",
    "content": "Existing law requires the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery to develop a comprehensive market development plan that will stimulate market demand in the state for postconsumer waste material and secondary waste material generated in the state. Existing law authorizes a local governing body, as defined, to propose eligible property within its jurisdiction as a recycling market development zone, as defined, and authorizes the department to designate recycling market development zones. Existing law creates the Recycling Market Development Revolving Loan Subaccount and continuously appropriates the funds deposited in the subaccount to the department for making loans to local governing bodies, private businesses, and nonprofit entities within the recycling market development zones and in other specified areas for purposes of the Recycling Market Development Revolving Loan Program. Existing law makes these provisions inoperative on July 1, 2021. This bill would authorize the department to expend moneys in the subaccount to make payments to local governing bodies within recycling market development zones for services related to the promotion of the zone. By expanding the purposes of a continuously appropriated fund, the bill would make an appropriation. The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 requires a manufacturer of architectural paint or the designated stewardship organization to submit to the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery an architectural paint stewardship plan to develop and implement a recovery program to manage the end of life of postconsumer architectural paint. A manufacturer is required to submit a report to the department by September 1 of each year, describing its paint recovery efforts. This bill would change the date when the report is due to November 1 of each year."
