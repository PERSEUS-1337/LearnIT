    "content": "The Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill includes funding for the Department of the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President (EOP), the judiciary, the District of Columbia, and 26 independent agencies. Among the independent agencies funded by the bill are the General Services Administration (GSA), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Small Business Administration (SBA), the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the United States Postal Service (USPS). On May 7, 2009, the Obama Administration delivered its FY2010 budget request to Congress. The Administration requested $46.439 billion for FSGG agencies and programs, a 4.2% increase from FY2009 enacted appropriations, excluding emergency and supplemental appropriations. On July 16, 2009, the House passed H.R. 3170, the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, FY2010. The House bill would provide $46.389 billion for FSGG programs and agencies, a 4.1% increase from FY2009 enacted appropriations and $50 million less than the Administration requested. On July 9, 2009, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 1432, which would provide $46.479 billion for FSGG programs and agencies. This represents a 4.3% increase from FY2009 enacted appropriations and $40 million more than the Administration requested. No further action has been taken on S. 1432. A continuing resolution (CR) went into effect October 1, 2009, which generally provided funding for FSGG programs and activities at FY2009 levels through October 31, 2009. P.L. 111-88, enacted October 30, 2009, extended funding under the CR through December 18, 2009. FSGG appropriations were ultimately provided through a consolidated budget bill (H.R. 3288) that was signed into law (P.L. 111-117) by President Obama on December 16, 2009. FSGG agencies were provided $46.435 billion in enacted appropriations for FY2010, which is $4 million less than the Administration requested. The wide scope of FSGG appropriations\u2014which provide funding for two of the three branches of the federal government, a city government, and 26 independent agencies with a range of functions\u2014encompasses a number of potentially controversial issues, some of which are identified below. Department of the Treasury. Is the proposed funding for enforcement, taxpayer services, and business systems modernization at the Internal Revenue Service adequate for lowering the federal tax gap? Executive Office of the President (EOP). Should Congress consider proposals from the Obama Administration to combine the White House Office and the Office of Policy Development accounts, and to increase National Security Council funding and staff levels under the EOP appropriation? The Judiciary. What level of funding should Congress provide for judicial security enhancements and other administrative issues, such as hiring of additional staff to meet the demands of rising workloads due to increases in bankruptcy filings and criminal cases, and increasing the hourly rates paid to public defenders? United States Postal Service. In light of the U.S. Postal Service's financial challenges, should Congress consider removing the six-day delivery requirement that has appeared in annual appropriations laws?"
