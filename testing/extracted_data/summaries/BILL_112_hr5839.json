    "content": "Disaster Savings and Resilient Construction Act of 2012 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a business-related tax credit for the cost of constructing commercial and residential buildings that comply with resilient construction requirements in a federally-declared major disaster area. Defines resilient construction requirements as requirements that ensure that such buildings: (1) can resist hazards brought on by a major disaster and can continue to provide their primary functions after a major disaster, (2) can reduce the magnitude or duration of a disruptive event, and (3) have the absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity, and recoverability to withstand a potentially disruptive event. Terminates such credit for any any property for which a certificate of occupancy is issued after December 31, 2015."
