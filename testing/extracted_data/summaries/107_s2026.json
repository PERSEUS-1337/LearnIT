    "title": "A bill to authorize the use of Cooperative Threat Reduction funds for projects and activities to address proliferation threats outside the states of the former Soviet Union, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to expend up to $50 million for a fiscal year in Cooperative Threat Reduction funds to prevent proliferation of nuclear, chemical and other weapons outside the former Soviet Union, where allocation of such funds is currently limited to. Specifies that such expenditures may occur if determined that certain projects or activities will assist the United States in dealing with critical emerging proliferation threats or in achieving long-standing nonproliferation goals. Determines that such funds may go only to equipment, goods and services and cannot be spent directly on a project or activity. Directs the President to include in a given year's budget a request for funds distributed under the Act during the last fiscal year with a description of what projects would otherwise have been funded. Sets a time frame for the Secretary to inform Congress of what funds will be used for. Contains a provision for emergency distribution of funds to meet a critical emerging proliferation threat or a nonproliferation goal that requires such allocation. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the advisability of establishing one or more new cooperative threat reduction programs to account for projects or activities for which emergency distribution of funds were distributed under the Act or that were funded under the Act two years in a row."
