    "content": "Although new legislation to address greenhouse gases is a leading priority of the President and many members of Congress, the ability to limit these emissions already exists under Clean Air Act authorities that Congress has enacted \u2013 a point underlined by the Supreme Court in an April 2007 decision, Massachusetts v. EPA. In response to the Supreme Court decision, EPA has begun the process of using this existing authority, issuing an \"endangerment finding\" for greenhouse gases (GHGs) December 7, 2009, and proposing GHG regulations for new motor vehicles in the September 28, 2009 Federal Register. On September 30, 2009, the agency took another step toward Clean Air Act regulation of GHGs, proposing what it calls the Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule. The rule would define when Clean Air Act permits would be required for GHG emissions from stationary sources. The proposed threshold (annual emissions of 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents) would limit which facilities would be required to obtain permits; for the next six years, the nation's largest GHG emitters, including power plants, refineries, cement production facilities and about two dozen other categories of sources, would be the only sources required to obtain permits. Smaller businesses and almost all farms would be shielded from permitting requirements during this period. By tailoring the permit requirement to the largest sources, EPA says it would focus on about 13,000 facilities accounting for nearly 70% of stationary source GHG emissions. Like the proposed standards for motor vehicles, the Tailoring Rule is part of a two-track approach to controlling emissions of GHGs. On one track, Congress and the Administration are pursuing new legal authority (for cap-and-trade, carbon tax, or other mechanisms) to limit emissions. At the same time, on a parallel track, the Administration, through EPA, has begun to exercise the Clean Air Act's existing authority to regulate GHGs. Despite EPA's commitment to move forward on this second track, EPA Administrator Jackson and others in the Administration have made clear their preference that Congress address the climate issue through new legislation. The first step in using the Clean Air Act's existing authority is for the EPA Administrator to find that GHG emissions are air pollutants that endanger public health or welfare. The Administrator proposed this endangerment finding in the April 24, 2009 Federal Register and finalized it December 7. With the finding finalized, the agency can (indeed, must) proceed to set GHG emission standards for new motor vehicles, as it proposed to do, September 28. Motor vehicle GHG standards will lead EPA and state permitting authorities to require permits for stationary sources: language in the Act triggers permitting under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program and Title V of the Act whenever a pollutant is \"subject to regulation\" under any of the Act's authorities. It is this trigger that the Tailoring Rule addresses. This report reviews the various options that EPA could exercise to control GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Act. The PSD and Title V permitting requirements that are automatically triggered may be the most immediate point of interest, but an endangerment finding for GHGs would present the agency with other options, as well. Five of these options are discussed in this report. Among these, particular attention should be paid to Section 111 of the Act, which provides authority to set New Source Performance Standards and, under Section 111(d), requires the states to control emissions from existing sources of the same pollutants. As EPA moves forward, Section 111 appears to be the most likely authority it will use to establish emission standards for stationary sources."
