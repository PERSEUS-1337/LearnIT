    "content": "National Capital Area Physician Emergency Assistance Act - Permits physicians licensed in Virginia, Maryland, or the District of Columbia to provide services to victims of emergencies in any of such jurisdictions regardless of the jurisdiction of their licensure whenever and wherever a public health emergency is declared by the relevant Governor or Mayor or by the President for the entire National Capital Area. Protects physicians from liability for all but willful, criminal, or reckless misconduct, gross negligence, or a conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of others while performing such volunteer emergency service. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide an advance registration system for physician volunteers which verifies their credentials, licences, and hospital privileges."
