    "title": "AB 1107",
    "content": "Existing law regulates sellers of travel, as defined, and requires their registration with the Attorney General. Existing law requires a seller of travel to deposit all sums received from any person or entity for air or sea transportation, or for any travel services offered by the seller of travel, and any refunds made by carries or providers of travel services, into a trust account, as specified. Existing law requires the seller of travel to file with the Attorney General an agreement allowing the Attorney General, a district attorney, or their representative to examine and obtain copies of all business records, including, but not limited to, those related to the trust account. This bill would require the seller of travel to maintain all business records for a minimum period of 3 years. The bill would authorize the Attorney General to maintain an action for recovery of examination costs and expenses in any court of competent jurisdiction, as specified. The bill would require the seller of travel to pay for costs and expenses for any examination if the Attorney General bills the seller of travel, provided that the examination shows that the seller of travel has failed to comply with certain requirements. Existing law creates the Travel Consumer Restitution Corporation, which assesses each registered seller of travel for both its operations and restitution funds. Existing law requires certain assessments to be due 45 days from the date the bill for that assessment is mailed. This bill would instead require those assessments to be due 45 days from the date the bill for that assessment is sent to the seller of travel."
