    "content": "Enhancing border and transportation security (BTS) are essential strategies for improving andmaintaining homeland security. Border security entails regulating the flow of traffic across thenation's borders so that dangerous and unwanted goods and people are detected and denied entry.This requires a sophisticated border management system that balances the need for securing thenation's borders with facilitating the essential free flow of legitimate commerce, citizens, andauthorized visitors. Transportation security involves securing the flow of people and goods alongthe nation's highways, railways, airways, and waterways. (For more information on the complexityof the BTS challenge, see CRS Report RL32839 , Border and Transportation Security: TheComplexity of the Challenge , by [author name scrubbed].) While in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 effortsprimarily concentrated on an expanded federal role in aviation security (in particular on theheightened screening of passengers and baggage), increasingly attention is being turned towardsother modes of transportation. The effective implementation of border and transportation security measures requires theparticipation of numerous agencies. Federal responsibility for border and transportation securityefforts is primarily contained within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS's Borderand Transportation Security Directorate houses: the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection(CBP), which has responsibility for security at and between ports-of-entry along the border; theBureau of Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE), which has responsibility for investigatingand enforcing the nation's customs and immigration laws; and the Transportation SecurityAdministration (TSA), which is responsible for the security of the nation's transportation systems. The U.S. Coast Guard is a stand-alone agency within DHS, and has primary responsibility for themaritime components of homeland security (U.S. ports, coastal and inland waterways, and territorialwaters). DHS's Citizenship and Immigration Services Bureau (USCIS) is charged with approvingimmigrant petitions. In addition, the Department of State's (DOS) Bureau of Consular Affairs isresponsible for issuing visas; and the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) Executive Office forImmigration Review (EOIR) has a significant policy role through its adjudicatory decisions onspecific immigration cases.
