    "content": "NAFTA Worker Adjustment Assistance Act - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to provide trade adjustment assistance to workers adversely affected by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States and Mexico. Makes such workers eligible for assistance if the Secretary of Labor determines that: (1) increases of imports like or directly competitive with imports produced by such workers' firm contributed importantly to a separation and decline in sales. (2) NAFTA contributed importantly to a shift in US production in Mexico. Or (3) the workers are employed in the manufacture of motor vehicles in the United States. Makes such assistance available during the phase-in period of the Agreement. Revises provisions under the trade adjustment assistance program concerning reemployment assistance to include labor market information, job development, and job search and placement services. Makes funds available to States to provide such services. Increases the funds available for training under such program. Requires the establishment of a standardized reporting system to determine the effectiveness of State-run programs. Directs the President to negotiate an agreement for the temporary imposition of a de minimis uniform fee on all articles imported into the United States from Mexico to fund trade adjustment assistance programs needed as a result of NAFTA. Requires, if the President is unable to negotiate such an agreement, that a certain portion of tariffs imposed on Mexican imports be used to fund such programs. Transfers any increase in duties to the Trade Adjustment Assistance Trust Fund. Authorizes appropriations to such Fund as necessary."
