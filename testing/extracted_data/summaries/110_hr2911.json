Redefines electronic fund transfer to cover any transaction initiated through an electronic terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer, including transactions initiated through the use of a check card or a debit card. Revises requirements for a financial institution's discretionary provisional recredit of a consumer's account after receiving notice of an error. Makes such a provisional recredit mandatory, within one business day after receipt of such a notice. Revises requirements for prompt resolution of errors to authorize a financial institution to require a consumer to submit written confirmation of an oral error notice before it recredits provisionally the consumer's account."
