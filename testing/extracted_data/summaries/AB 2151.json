    "title": "An act to amend Section 11450 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to CalWORKs.",
    "content": "Existing law requires each county to provide cash assistance and other social services to needy families through the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program using federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families block grant program, state, and county funds. Existing law specifies the amounts of cash aid to be paid each month to CalWORKs recipients, including an allowance of $10 for each eligible recipient for recurring special needs, as specified. which includes special diets, upon the recommendation of a physician for conditions other than pregnancy, and unusual costs of transportation, laundry, housekeeping services, telephone, and utilities. This bill would include food preparation needs within the recurring special needs for which a recipient may receive the $10 monthly allowance. The bill would also require that an additional allowance be paid each month in the amount of $20 or actual expenses, whichever is greater, to a recipient who has a special, diet-related food need caused by a permanent or temporary medical condition, other than pregnancy. The bill would require the verification to be signed by a licensed physician, dentist, dietician, nutritionist, or other qualified health practitioner. The bill would require verification of the recipient\u2019s medical condition by a health care provider, as specified. By increasing the administrative duties of counties administering the CalWORKs program, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing law continuously appropriates moneys from the General Fund to defray a portion of county costs under the CalWORKs program. This bill would instead provide that the continuous appropriation would not be made for purposes of implementing the bill. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
