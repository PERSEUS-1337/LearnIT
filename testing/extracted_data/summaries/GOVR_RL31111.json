    "content": "The United States has pursued missile defenses since the dawn of the missile age shortly afterWorld War II. The development and deployment of missile defenses has not only been elusive, buthas been one of the most divisive issues of the past generation until recent years. The Bush Administration substantially altered the debate over missile defenses. TheAdministration requested significant funding increases for missile defense programs, eliminated thedistinction between national and theater missile defense, restructured the missile defense programto focus more directly on developing deployment options for a \"layered\" capability to interceptmissiles aimed at U.S. territory across the whole spectrum of their flight path, adopted a new, untrieddevelopment and acquisition strategy, announced U.S. withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-ballisticMissile Treaty, and has deployed an initial national missile defense capability. The Administration argued these steps were necessary in response to growing concerns overthe spread of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, especially on the part of ahandful of potentially hostile states and terrorists. In addition, they asserted that U.S. deterrencetheory has outlived its usefulness and that conventional or nuclear deterrence could not be reliedupon to dissuade unstable leaders in rogue states. Critics, however, take issue with assertions that the threat is increasing, citing evidence thatthe number of nations seeking or possessing nuclear weapons has actually declined over the past 20years. Moreover, they argue that the technology for effective missile defense remains immature, thatdeployment can be provocative to allies, friends, and adversaries, and it is a budget-buster thatreduces the availability of funds to modernize and operate U.S. conventional military forces. Theyargue especially that some major powers view U.S. missile defense as an attempt at strategicdomination and that other, such as China, will expand their missile capabilities in response. This report will be updated as needed."
