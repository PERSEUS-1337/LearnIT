Requires the Secretary, acting through the Office on Disability of HHS, to: (1) establish a pilot program to increase the awareness of health care providers of the need to offer accessible environments, examination rooms, and examination tables for individuals with disabilities and to increase voluntary compliance with federal accessibility requirements. And (2) develop and disseminate resources to support individuals with disabilities in finding providers that are accessible to such individuals, which shall include a concise list of questions for individuals with disabilities to ask when calling a health care provider for the first time to schedule an appointment and suggestions for explaining the special needs of such individuals to the provider and for seeking accommodation from the provider. Requires the Secretary to establish a National Advisory Committee on Access to Health Care for Individuals With Disabilities to support implementation of this Act and to ensure interagency coordination of efforts to improve access to care for individuals with disabilities."
