    "content": "Deadly Biological Agent Control Act of 2001 - Revises Federal criminal code provisions regarding biological weapons to set penalties for: (1) knowingly possessing a select biological agent or toxin without obtaining a certification from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). And (2) any research facility knowingly transferring a select agent to an entity that has not obtained such certification. Amends the AEDPA to direct the Secretary of HHS to: (1) annually review the existing list of select agents and, if necessary, revise the list. (2) prioritize countermeasures, including vaccines, therapies, medical devices, and diagnostic tests which must be developed, produced, or obtained in preparation for a bioterrorist attack or other significant disease emergency to treat, prevent, or identify infection by, or exposure to, listed biological agents and toxins. And (3) provide for the establishment and enforcement of standards and procedures governing the possession and use of listed agents. Requires the Secretary to establish a certification process for the possession and use of listed agents. Sets forth legitimate purposes. Requires any individual who handles listed agents to pass a criminal background check, including a determination of whether that individual is a restricted person, and to be registered with the Department of HHS for the specific research project that requires the use of biological agents or toxins. Sets penalties for violations."
