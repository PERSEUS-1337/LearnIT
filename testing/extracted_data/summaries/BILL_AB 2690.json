    "title": "AB 2690",
    "content": "Existing law creates the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA), with various powers and duties with respect to transportation planning, programming, construction, and operations. Existing law authorizes LACMTA to provide for a small business preference of 5 of the lowest responsible bidder meeting specifications, with respect to contracts in construction, the construction component of a design-build team, the procurement of goods, or the delivery of services. Existing law also authorizes LACMTA to establish a subcontracting participation goal for small businesses on certain contracts financed with nonfederal funds and to grant a preference of 5 to the lowest responsible bidders that meet that goal. This bill would also authorize LACMTA to establish disabled veteran business enterprise participation goals, and would define \u201cdisabled veteran business enterprise\u201d for these purposes. Existing law imposes various requirements on bidders relative to contracts involving small business enterprise goals. This bill would delete those requirements and instead authorize LACMTA to require bidders to comply with small business enterprise and disabled veteran business enterprise goals and requirements established by LACMTA relative to contracts financed with nonfederal funds. The bill would also authorize LACMTA to award contracts under certain circumstances to small business enterprises with respect to work that is set aside for competition among certified small business enterprises, and would require the authority to report to the Legislature by December 31, 2017, regarding any contracts awarded in this regard."
