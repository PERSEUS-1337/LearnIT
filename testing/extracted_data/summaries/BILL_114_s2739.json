The council must prepare a plan for the use of those payments to promote any combination of: (1) economic development, (2) infrastructure development. Or (3) educational, health, recreational, and social welfare objectives of the tribe and its members. The Bonneville Power Administration must make specified settlement payments to the tribe. Payments made to the council or tribe may be used or invested by the council in the same manner as other tribal governmental funds. Amounts paid to the council are subject to an annual tribal government audit. The Bonneville Power Administration is credited a specified amount on interest payments otherwise payable to the Department of the Treasury. Deposit of amounts in the fund extinguishes all monetary claims that the tribe may have against the United States to a fair share of the annual hydropower revenues generated by the Grand Coulee Dam."
