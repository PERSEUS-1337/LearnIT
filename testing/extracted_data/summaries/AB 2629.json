Existing law provides that, except as specified, the fee for a first copy of a transcript by a person who does not simultaneously purchase the original transcript is $0.20 for each 100 words, and for each additional copy purchased at the same time, $0.15 for each 100 words. Existing law authorizes a court reporter, in civil cases, to charge an additional 50 for special daily copy service. This bill would increase the fee charged for original transcripts and copies purchased at the same time, and copies purchased thereafter without the original transcript, incrementally commencing January 1, 2017, except as specified. The bill would also provide that the fee for transcription is an additional 50 for special daily copy service. The bill would require the Judicial Council to report to the Legislature by January 1, 2021, with regard to transcript fees, as specified."
