    "content": "Emergency Unemployment Compensation Expansion Act of 2011 - Amends the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 with respect to the state-established individual emergency unemployment compensation account (EUCA). Revises the formula for making Tier-1 credits in an applicant's EUCA for a benefit year. Increases the figures in the formula : (1) from 80 to 131 of the total amount of regular compensation payable to the individual during the benefit year, and (2) from 20 to 34 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount for the benefit year. Authorizes a state to elect to pay Tier-2, Tier-3, or Tier-4 extended unemployment compensation (EUC), or a combination of them, before payment of an increased Tier-1 EUC until the state determines that such increased Tier-1 EUC may be paid without undue delay. Authorizes a state to pay extended compensation to an otherwise eligible individual before any additional EUC is paid under this Act, if the individual claimed extended compensation for at least one week of unemployment after the initial exhaustion of EUC. Extends the program until September 22, 2012."
