    "content": "Comprehensive Student Achievement Information Act of 2017 This bill amends title I of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to modify consumer information disclosure requirements related to completion or graduation rates. Currently, an institution that participates in federal student aid programs must disclose the completion or graduation rate of first-time, full-time, certificate- or degree-seeking undergraduate students. This bill expands disclosure requirements to also include the completion or graduation rates of non-first time and half-time certificate- or degree-seeking undergraduate students. The bill also sets forth new time periods for calculating the completion or graduation rates for programs of study that are less than four years."
