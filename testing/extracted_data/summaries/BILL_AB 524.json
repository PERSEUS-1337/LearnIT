    "title": "AB 524",
    "content": "Existing law establishes a system of public elementary and secondary schools in this state, and authorizes local educational agencies throughout the state to operate schools and provide instruction to pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive. Existing law prescribes the course of study a pupil is required to complete while in grades 9 to 12, inclusive, in order to receive a diploma of graduation from high school. These requirements include the completion of 3 courses in social studies, including one-year courses in United States history and geography and world history, culture, and geography, and one-semester courses in American government and economics. This bill would express legislative findings and declarations relating to service learning. The bill would additionally require, commencing with the high school class graduating during the 2020\u201321 school year, and for the high school classes graduating in each subsequent school year, at least one of the social studies classes courses completed by a pupil to satisfy the graduation requirements referenced above to have a service learning component. The bill would define \u201cservice learning\u201d for this purpose. The bill would require the Superintendent of Public Instruction to develop curriculum standards for social studies courses that incorporate a service learning component in order to satisfy the requirements of this bill. The bill would require the Superintendent to consult with leaders of community organizations, pupils, parents, classroom teachers, school administrators, postsecondary educators, representatives of business and industry, and other persons with knowledge or experience the Superintendent deems appropriate to the task of developing these curriculum standards. The bill would require the Superintendent to submit these proposed curriculum standards to the State Board of Education on or before July 1, 2016, March 1, 2017, and for the state board to adopt or reject curriculum standards that incorporate a service learning component into social studies courses on or before January July 1, 2017. The If the state board adopts these proposed curriculum standards, the bill would require these the curriculum standards to be implemented by school districts, commencing with the 2017\u201318 school year, as a component of social studies courses in order to satisfy the graduation requirements enacted by this bill. To the extent the implementation of these curriculum standards would impose new duties on school districts, this bill would constitute a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
