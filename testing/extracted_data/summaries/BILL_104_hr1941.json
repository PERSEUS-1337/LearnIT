    "content": "Removes the requirement that individuals performing temporary military service be discharged from such service under honorable conditions in order to be eligible for certain reemployment rights in the positions interrupted by such service. States that an employer shall be considered to have engaged in prohibited discrimination against an employee if the person's action in enforcing a protection, testimony or statement, assistance or other participation in an investigation, or other exercise of a right is a motivating factor in the employer's action, unless the employer can prove that the employer's action would have been taken in the absence of such person's action. Allows individuals to bring complaints concerning reemployment rights and prohibited actions against the Office of Personnel Management . Repeals a provision that such reemployment rights shall not be construed to prohibit a person from seeking alternative employment in the Federal Government. Empowers the Secretary of Labor's authorized representative with reasonable access to, and the right to interview, persons with information relevant to the investigation. Amends the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 to remove the requirement that a person must have served on active duty in order to be eligible for the continuation of employer-provided insurance."
