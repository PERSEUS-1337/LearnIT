    "content": "At its most basic level of organization, the Treasury Department is a collection of departmental offices and operating bureaus. The bureaus as a whole typically account for 95% of Treasury's budget and workforce. Most bureaus and offices are funded through annual appropriations. Treasury appropriations are distributed among 12 accounts in FY2017: (1) Departmental Offices (DO), (2) Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI), (3) Cybersecurity Enhancement Account (CEA), (4) Department-wide Systems and Capital Investments Program (DSCIP), (5) Office of Inspector General (OIG), (6) Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), (7) Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP), (8) Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), (9) Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS), (10) Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (ATTB), (11) Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFIF), and (12) the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The President's budget request for FY2017 called for the Treasury Department to receive $13.144 billion in appropriations, including a rescission of $657 million for the Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFF). Of the requested funds, $12.280 billion would have gone to the IRS; $353 million to the BFS; $217 million to DO; $117 million to TFI; $246 million to CDFIF; $170 million to TIGTA; $115 million to FinCEN; $106 million to ATTB; $41 million to SIGTARP; $37 million to OIG; and $5 million to DSCIP. In July 2016, the House approved a bill (H.R. 5485) providing appropriations for the Treasury Department and several other agencies in FY2017. Under the measure, Treasury would have received $11.694 billion in appropriations, including a rescission of $754 million from the TFF. This amount was $248 million less than the amount enacted for FY2016 and $1.450 billion less than the budget request. During the previous month, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill (S. 3067) to fund Treasury in FY2017. Under the measure, Treasury would have received $12.040 billion in appropriations, including a rescission of $657 million from the TFF. The recommended amount was $98 million below the amount enacted for FY2016 and $1.104 billion less than the budget request. The congressional debate over funding for the IRS in FY2017 raised at least three issues: (1) the appropriate size of the IRS budget in light of recent budget cuts, (2) the advantages and disadvantages of using discretionary funding cap adjustments under the Balanced Budget Act of 2011 to pay for new IRS enforcement activities, and (3) the impact on the IRS budget of the budget scoring convention of disregarding the net revenue effect of agency administrative programs, including enforcement actions. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31), the 12 Treasury appropriations accounts received the following amounts for FY2017: (1) DO: $224.4 million, (2) TFI: $123.0 million, (3) CEA: $47.7 million, (4) DSCIP: $3.0 million, (5) OIG: $37.0 million, (6) TIGTA: $169.6 million, (7) SIGTARP: $41.2 million, (8) FinCEN: $115.0 million, (9) BFS: $353.1 million, (10) ATTB: $111.4 million, (11) CDFIF: $248 million, and (12) IRS: $11.235 billion."
