    "content": "Federal Firefighters Fairness Act of 2017 This bill provides that: (1) heart disease, lung disease, and specified cancers of federal employees employed in fire protection activities for a minimum of 5 years shall be presumed to be proximately caused by such employment if an employee is diagnosed with any such disease within 10 years of the last active date of employment in fire protection activities. (2) the disability or death of such an employee due to any such disease shall be presumed to result from personal injury sustained while in the performance of duty. And (3) such presumptions may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence. These presumptions shall also apply to fire protection employees who contract any uncommon infectious disease, including but not limited to tuberculosis, hepatitis A, B, or C, or the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), regardless of length of employment. The bill defines an employee in fire protection activities as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, rescue worker, ambulance personnel, or hazardous material worker, who: (1) is trained in fire suppression. (2) has the legal authority and responsibility to engage in fire suppression. (3) is engaged in the prevention, control, and extinguishment of fires or response to emergency situations where life, property, or the environment is at risk. And (4) performs such activities as a primary responsibility. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must examine the implementation of this bill and appropriate scientific and medical data related to the health risks associated with firefighting."
