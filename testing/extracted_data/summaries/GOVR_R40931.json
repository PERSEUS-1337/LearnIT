    "content": "As Congress debates the justification for comprehensive health reform and considers various proposals, some states have taken the initiative by enacting reforms to address concerns about health insurance coverage and health care costs, among other issues. Massachusetts is one such state. While Massachusetts has a legislative history full of reforms to its health care system, its most ambitious effort to date was enactment and implementation of a comprehensive health reform law that sought to provide universal health insurance coverage and reduce health care costs at the same time. In 2006, Massachusetts enacted a comprehensive health reform law that included provisions to expand eligibility for certain public coverage programs, provide premium subsidies for certain low-income individuals, require the purchase of insurance by adult residents who can afford it, and require employers to make contributions toward health coverage. To make private health insurance plans more accessible, it modified state insurance laws and created a quasi-public entity called the Health Insurance Connector Authority whose duties include facilitating the purchase of insurance primarily by individuals who are not offered subsidized insurance by a large employer and are not eligible for public coverage. Health reform's impact on health insurance coverage, health care costs and spending, and access to care have produced both promising results and troubling trends. Massachusetts has achieved near-universal coverage. The state had the lowest uninsured rate among all states in 2008, and by 2009, state survey data showed the insured rate was 97.3%. Along with the increase in health coverage, state residents have paradoxically reported increases in obtaining medical care and problems accessing health services. In addition, state costs associated with gains in coverage have exceeded initial projections, and consumers have experienced both increases and reductions in affordability of obtaining health care during the initial implementation phase of health reform. Statements on the success or failure of Massachusetts health reform are far from final. The impact of the state's ambitious health reform plan may not be fully quantified and analyzed until the plan has been implemented and in operation for some time. However, the initial impact on coverage and costs simultaneously deserves attention and raises concerns. The drop in uninsurance is impressive by any measure, but long-term sustainability is seen as an open question, especially with respect to costs. This report provides background information on the main components of the state's reform law and the law's initial impact on coverage, costs, access to care, employers, and uncompensated care. The report will be updated as circumstances warrant."
