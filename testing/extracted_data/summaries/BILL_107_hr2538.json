    "content": "Native American Small Business Development Act - Amends the Small Business Act to authorize a Small Business Development Center in an eligible State to apply for an additional Small Business Administration grant to be used solely to provide specified services to assist with outreach, development, and enhancement on Indian lands of small business startups and expansions that are owned by Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, or Native Hawaiians and that are located in Alaska or Hawaii, or on Indian lands in the 48 contiguous States. Defines an eligible State as one in which such members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians comprise at least one percent of its population. Limits each recipient to $300,000 in such grants in a fiscal year. Authorizes appropriations. Requires a State receiving a small business development center program grant to request the advice of the governing bodies of Indian tribes, corporations organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and other Alaska Native entities, and Native Hawaiian organizations, as appropriate, on how best to provide assistance to such members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians and where to locate satellite centers to provide such assistance."
