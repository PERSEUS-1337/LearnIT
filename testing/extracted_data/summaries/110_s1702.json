    "content": "Employer Work Incentive Act for Individuals with Severe Disabilities - Amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to require the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy to establish, annually, a government-wide target for procurement contracts awarded to businesses that employ individuals with severe disabilities. Requires such target to be established at not less than 2.5 of the total value of all prime contract procurements for each fiscal year. Directs: (1) each executive agency to have an annual procurement target that presents the maximum practicable opportunity for businesses that employ individuals with severe disabilities to participate in the performance of agency contracts. (2) the Administrator to ensure that the cumulative agency targets meet or exceed the annual targets. (3) the Administrator to work with the Administrator of General Services to establish and maintain a database of eligible entities that qualify as businesses that employ such individuals. And (4) the Administrator to promulgate regulations providing that the participation of such businesses shall be an evaluation factor in all contracts awarded by executive agencies. Provides that the failure of a business that is awarded a contract to meet the employment criteria within one year shall result in contract termination, unless a one-time waiver is approved for good cause. Makes the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment and Training responsible for obtaining input from agencies, individuals, and organizations regarding the effectiveness, outreach, utilization, and advancement of the goals and purposes of the employment and contracting program. Requires the Secretary of Labor to utilize existing Regional Assistance Centers to provide assistance to businesses in qualifying for the evaluation factor."
