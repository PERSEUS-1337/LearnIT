    "title": "AB 1194",
    "content": "Existing law, the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, provides for the involuntary commitment and treatment of persons with specified mental disorders for the protection of the persons so committed. Under the act, when a person, as a result of mental health disorder, is a danger to others, or to himself or herself, or gravely disabled, he or she may, upon probable cause, be taken into custody by a peace officer, member of the attending staff of an evaluation facility, designated members of a mobile crisis team, or other designated professional person, and placed in a facility designated by the county and approved by the State Department of Social Services as a facility for 72-hour treatment and evaluation. Existing law requires, when determining if probable cause exists to take a person into custody, or cause a person to be taken into custody pursuant to the provisions described above, any person who is authorized to take or cause that person to be taken into custody to consider available relevant information about the historical course of the person\u2019s mental disorder, as specified, if the authorized person determines that information has a reasonable bearing on the determination described above. This bill would provide that, when determining if a person should be taken into custody pursuant to the provisions described above, the individual making that determination shall consider available relevant information about the historical course of the person\u2019s mental disorder if the individual concludes that the information has a reasonable bearing on the determination, and that the individual shall not be limited to consideration of the danger of imminent harm. Existing law requires the admitting facility to require an application in writing stating the circumstances under which the person\u2019s condition was called to the attention of those persons authorized to make the determination of probable cause, and stating that he or she has probable cause, as specified. The bill would also require the application to record whether the historical course of a person\u2019s mental disorder was considered in the determination of probable cause. By imposing additional duties on local officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
