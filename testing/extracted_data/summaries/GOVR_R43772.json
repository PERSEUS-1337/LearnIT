    "content": "The Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA; P.L. 105-277), enacted in 1998, implemented a three-year moratorium preventing state and local governments from taxing Internet access, or imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. Under the moratorium, state and local governments cannot impose their sales tax on the monthly payments that consumers make to their Internet service provider in exchange for access to the Internet. In addition to the moratorium, a grandfather clause was included in ITFA that allowed states which had already imposed and collected a tax on Internet access before October 1, 1998, to continue implementing those taxes. Previously under ITFA, the moratorium on Internet access taxes and the grandfather clause were temporary provisions. With the passage of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-125), the moratorium on taxing Internet access was extended permanently, while the grandfather clause was extended temporarily through June 30, 2020. The original three-year moratorium had been extended eight times before being converted to a permanent statute. As the original moratorium was extended, changes were made to the definition of Internet access to include and exclude different services and technology. Notable changes include the inclusion of digital subscriber lines under the moratorium and the exclusion of Voice over Internet Protocol services from the moratorium. Over time the grandfather clause has protected a decreasing number of states' abilities to tax Internet access. While 13 states previously taxed Internet access and were protected under the grandfather clause, 7 states now tax Internet access. In addition, changes made to ITFA in 2007 rendered the grandfather provision inapplicable for states that repealed or nullified their taxes on Internet access before the enactment of these changes. As a public policy, the moratorium on taxing Internet access has economic and fairness implications. The policy likely improves lower income individuals' ability to purchase Internet access, which has economic benefits, but the blanket nature of the moratorium likely results in some economic waste. Additionally, the moratorium results in unequal application of state and local taxes to the provision of services depending upon how the services are delivered. Under the moratorium, state and local governments are prevented from taxing Internet access. This may have implications for state and local government revenues and provision of services. The Internet Tax Freedom Act and its subsequent extensions are often conflated with issues related to the taxation of electronic commerce across state borders. ITFA is largely unrelated to these issues.
