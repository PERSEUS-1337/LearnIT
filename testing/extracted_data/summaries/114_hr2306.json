    "content": "Obamacare Marriage Penalty Elimination Act This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the tax credit for health care insurance premium assistance, to: (1) calculate the amount of such credit in the case of a joint tax return as the sum of each credit amount allowed to each spouse, thusnbsp, preventing the tax effect known as the marriage penalty. And (2) replace the 400 poverty line eligibility limit for such credit with an applicable percentage based on a calculation of the combination of increased tax revenues and decreased outlays resulting from this Act."
