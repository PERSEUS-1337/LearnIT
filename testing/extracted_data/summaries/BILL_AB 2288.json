    "title": "AB 2288",
    "content": "Existing law provides that the California Workforce Development Board is responsible for assisting the Governor in the development, oversight, and continuous improvement of California\u2019s workforce investment system. Existing law requires that the California Workforce Development Board and each local workforce development board ensure that programs and services funded by the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 and directed to apprenticeable occupations are conducted in coordination with apprenticeship programs approved by the Division of Apprenticeship Standards, as specified. Existing law also requires the California Workforce Development Board and each local workforce development board to develop a policy of fostering collaboration between community colleges and approved apprenticeship programs in the geographic area. This bill would require the California Workforce Development Board and each local board to ensure that federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 funds respectively awarded by them for preapprenticeship training in the building and construction trades fund programs and services that follow the Multi-Craft Core Curriculum implemented by the State Department of Education and that develop a plan to help increase the representation of women in those trades, as specified. The bill would require the California Workforce Development Board to develop policies to implement these provisions. By imposing new requirements on the local workforce development boards, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
