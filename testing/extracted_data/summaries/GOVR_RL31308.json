    "content": "On February 20, 2003, President Bush signed the FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution ( H.J.Res. 2 : H.Rept. 108-10 , P.L. 108-7 ), providing appropriations for theDepartment of Transportation (DOT) and other departments. Congress agreed to the conferencecommittee report on February 13, 2003. It provides $64.6 billion to the DOT and related agenciesfor FY2003, minus a 0.65% across-the-board rescission which reduces the total by around $420million (figures in this report do not reflect the 0.65% rescission, as it is unclear how that cut wouldbe calculated for DOT and related agencies overall and for particular departments, agencies, andprograms in the bill). This is $9 billion more than the President requested for FY2003, the primarydifference being increased highway spending. It is $1.8 billion less than enacted in FY2002, a yearin which transportation appropriations were boosted by supplemental spending for security and forrepair of damage to transportation infrastructure in New York City. Prior to the passage of P.L.108-7 , DOT was funded through a series of 8 Continuing Resolutions (CRs) that provided fundingat FY2002 levels, prorated. The events of September 11, 2001, have had a significant impact on DOT's budget. The DOT received an extra $7.3 billion in FY2002 in emergency supplemental appropriations, much of it forsecurity-related activities, including the creation of an entirely new agency, the TransportationSecurity Administration (TSA). During FY2003 the Coast Guard and TSA are scheduled to betransferred to the newly-created Department of Homeland Security. The abrupt decrease from FY2002 to FY2003 in requested federal-aid highway funding-from $32 billion to $24 billion-caused a stir. It was mandated by the Revenue-Aligned Budget Authority(RABA) provision in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) that ties annualhighway funding levels to trust fund revenues; trust fund revenues dropped below predicted levelsin 2001. The second FY2002 emergency supplemental act ( P.L. 107-206 ) included a provisionsetting the RABA adjustment for FY2003 to zero, effectively restoring the federal-aid highwayprogram to $27.7 billion, the level authorized in TEA-21. The House Appropriations Committeerecommended this level; the Senate-passed version of H.J.Res. 2 maintained theFY2002 level (which was $4.5 billion over the authorized level as a result of a RABA increase thatyear) for FY2003, $31.8 billion. P.L. 108-7 provided $31.8 billion. P.L. 108-7 provides Amtrak $1.05 billion, plus deferral of repayment of a $100 million loan, which it said would be enough to keep it solvent through FY2003. The bill introduced a new policyon Amtrak oversight, providing the money not to Amtrak directly but to the Secretary ofTransportation, who will provide the money to Amtrak in quarterly installments through thegrant-making process. Each of Amtrak's long-distance routes will have to have a separate grantapplication for funding. Key Policy Staff Division abbreviations: RSI = Resources, Science, and Industry Division."
