H.R. 5528, the Simplifying the Application for Student Aid Act, would amend procedures for completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to mandate the use of income and tax information from the second preceding (prior-prior) year for purposes of calculating a student's expected family contribution (EFC), to require development of a tool that facilitates completion of the FAFSA using a mobile device, and to promote enhancements in the capacity of the Internal Revenue Service Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to be used to populate portions of the FAFSA. H.R. 3178, the Strengthening Transparency in Higher Education Act, would revise the types of consumer information about institutions of higher education that must be disclosed through a new Department of Education College Dashboard, which would succeed the current College Navigator website and revise the types of information on college costs and prices that must be made available through net-price calculators. H.R. 3179, the Empowering Students Through Enhanced Financial Counseling Act, would establish annual requirements for the counseling of federal student loan and Pell Grant recipients, with the aim of enhancing the timing, frequency, and content of the counseling to better enable borrowers to make sound decisions concerning their federal student aid. H.R. 5529, the Accessing Higher Education Opportunities Act, would amend the Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions program to allow the use of funds for offering student support services to enable the advancement of students from baccalaureate programs to postbaccalaureate degree programs for healthcare occupations. H.R. 5530, the HBCU Capital Financing Improvement Act, would make several changes to the Historically Black College and University (HBCU) Capital Financing Program to enhance program operations, support, and congressional oversight. This report identifies and describes how the proposals made in these five bills would amend the affected programs and activities authorized under the HEA. Each bill is described separately. This report will be updated to reflect legislative developments."
