    "content": "The year 2015 was a memorable year in U.S.-Vietnam relations, marking the 40th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War, the 20th anniversary of the reestablishment of diplomatic relations, the first U.S. visit by a Chairman of the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) (in July), and the conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade negotiations (in October). This year also will be marked with historical events, including the 15th anniversary of the United States granting Vietnam permanent normal trade relations (PNTR), the February signing of the TPP, and President Obama's first official visit to Vietnam in May. According to U.S. trade statistics, bilateral trade has grown from about $220 million in 1994 to $45.1 billion in 2015, transforming Vietnam into the 13th-largest source for U.S. imports and 37th-largest destination for U.S. exports. Vietnam is the second-largest source of U.S. clothing imports (after China), and a major source for electrical machinery, footwear, and furniture. Much of this rapid growth in bilateral trade can be attributed to U.S. extension of normal trade relations (NTR) status to Vietnam in 2001. Another major contributing factor is over 20 years of rapid economic growth in Vietnam, ushered in by a 1986 shift to a more market-oriented economic system. Vietnam's incentive to join the TPP largely is contingent on greater market access in the United States, particularly for agricultural goods, aquacultural goods, clothing, and footwear. For the United States, Vietnam offers a significant market for U.S. exports, but some parties are concerned about Vietnam's protection of workers' rights, protection of intellectual property rights, and potential unfair competition from state-owned or state-controlled enterprises. Vietnam is also a party to negotiations to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a pan-Asian regional trade association that currently does not include the United States. It is uncertain how RCEP would affect Vietnam's interest and commitment to TPP, if both regional trade agreements are finalized. Congress would have to consider implementing legislation for the United States to comply with the TPP. The growth in bilateral trade has not been without accompanying issues and problems. Vietnam would like the United States officially to recognize it as a market economy and to further relax U.S. restrictions on arms sales to Vietnam. In addition, the two nations have disagreed over U.S. treatment of the import of catfish-like fish known as basa, swai, or tra, from Vietnam. In 2008, the 110th Congress passed legislation that transferred the regulation of catfish from the Food and Drug Administration to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which many analysts contend maintain stricter inspection standards than the FDA. The Vietnamese government strongly protested the law as a protectionist measure. The Agricultural Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-79) confirmed the transfer of inspection to the USDA, and explicitly included basa, swai, and tra as catfish. In November 2015, the USDA released final regulations for the import of catfish that went into effect in March 2016. While Vietnam continues to object to the regulatory change, it is making efforts to comply with the new U.S. inspection regime. The 114th Congress may play an important role in one or more of these issues, as have past Congresses. The Human Rights Act of 2016 (S. 2632) opposes the \"further easing of the prohibition on the sale of lethal military equipment to the Government of Vietnam\" unless certain human rights conditions improve. The House report accompanying the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (H.R. 1890), cites a perceived lack of a \"mechanism to ensure compliance by TPP parties\" to international standards for labor laws and practices, and in particular Vietnam. Vietnam's compliance with a bilateral trade and labor relations side agreement to the TPP may factor in congressional consideration of the larger TPP agreement. This report will be updated as circumstances require."
