The bill includes funding for the Interior Department except the Bureau of Reclamation,but only segments of the funding of the other three departments, Agriculture, Energy, and Health andHuman Services. On February 1, 1999, President Clinton submitted his FY2000 budget to Congress. The FY2000 request for Interior and Related Agencies totaled $15.266 billion compared to the $14.298billion enacted for FY1999 ( P.L. 105-277 ), an increase of almost $1 billion. The Administration alsoproposed $579 million for Department of Interior agencies as part of the $1 billion Lands LegacyInitiative. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported the FY2000 Interior Appropriations bill ( S. 1292 , S.Rept. 106-99 ) on June 28, 1999, and the House Appropriations Committeereported its version of the bill ( H.R. 2466 , H.Rept. 106-222 ) on July 2, 1999. Thecommittee-approved levels were $14.058 billion in the Senate and $14.105 billion in the House, adifference of $46.7 million. On July 15, 1999, the House passed H.R. 2466 by a voteof 377-47, providing $13.935 billion in FY2000 funding. On September 23, 1999, the Senate passedits version of H.R. 2466 by a vote of 89-10, providing $14.056 billion for FY2000. The conference report ( H.R. 2466 , H.Rept. 106-406 ) was agreed to by both the House and Senate on October 21, 1999. It provided a total of $14.534 billion; after scorekeepingadjustments, the amount was $14.565 billion (including $57.4 million in mandatory funding). Thetotals included $68 million of emergency funding for the United Mine Workers of Americacombined benefit fund. However, this conference agreement was not sent to the President. Instead, following renegotiations, the House and Senate incorporated the five remaining appropriations measures into a single measure ( H.R. 3194 , H.Rept. 106-479 ), whichinitially provided funding only for the District of Columbia. The omnibus measure passed the Houseon November 18, 1999, and the Senate on November 19, 1999. The \"Consolidated AppropriationsAct for FY2000\" was enacted into law on November 29, 1999 ( P.L. 106-113 ). The Interiorappropriations portion of the consolidated measure also was introduced as a separate bill( H.R. 3423 ), which the consolidated measure enacted by cross-reference. Theconsolidated measure contained a total Interior appropriation of $14.928 billion; after scorekeepingadjustments, the total was $14.959. These amounts, and others in this report, do not reflect thegovernment-wide cut of 0.38% in discretionary appropriations for FY2000 that was required by theomnibus appropriations measure. Before the consolidated appropriations measure was signed intolaw, a total of seven measures providing continuing appropriations for Interior (and otherappropriations measures) had been enacted. These continuing resolutions covered October 1, 1999,through December 2, 1999.
