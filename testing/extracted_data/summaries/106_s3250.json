(2) to bar of US assistance to the government of any unilaterally declared Palestinian state, the Palestinian Authority , and any programs or projects in the West Bank or Gaza. (3) to withhold a specified percentage of the US contribution to any international organization that recognizes a unilaterally declared Palestinian state. And (4) to oppose such state's membership in any international financial institution or the extension by such institution of any loan or other financial assistance to it. Authorizes the President to suspend, for one year, the application of a specified number of such measures provided he determines and certifies to specified congressional committees that such suspensions are in the national security interests of the United States or the application of such measures would significantly hinder the prospects for a negotiated peace agreement in the Middle East."
