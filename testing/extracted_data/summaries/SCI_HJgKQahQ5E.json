    "content": "Goal recognition is the problem of inferring the correct goal towards which an agent executes a plan, given a set of goal hypotheses, a domain model, and a (possibly noisy) sample of the plan being executed. \n   This is a key problem in both cooperative and competitive agent interactions and recent approaches have produced fast and accurate goal recognition algorithms. \n   In this paper, we leverage advances in operator-counting heuristics computed using linear programs over constraints derived from classical planning problems to solve goal recognition problems. \n   Our approach uses additional operator-counting constraints derived from the observations to efficiently infer the correct goal, and serves as basis for a number of further methods with additional constraints. Agents that act autonomously on behalf of a human user must choose goals independently of user input and generate plans to achieve such goals ). When such agents have complex sets goals and require interaction with multiple agents that are not under the user's control, the resulting plans are likely to be equally complex and non-obvious for human users to interpret BID0 . In such environments, the ability to accurately and quickly identify the goals and plans of all involved agents is key to provide meaningful explanation for the observed behavior. Goal recognition is the problem of inferring one or more goals from a set of hypotheses that best account for a sequence of observations, given a fixed initial state, a goal state, and a behavior model of the agent under observation. Recent approaches to goal recognition based on classical planning domains have leveraged data-structures and heuristic information used to improve planner efficiency to develop increasingly accurate and faster goal recognition algorithms BID1 BID2 . Specifically, BID2 use heuristics based on planning landmarks BID1 ) to accurately and efficiently recognize goals in a wide range of domains with various degrees of observability and noise. This approach, however, does not deal with noise explicitly, relying on the implicit necessity of landmarks in valid plans for goal hypotheses to achieve com- petitive accuracy with other methods BID3 BID3 , while increasing the number of recognized goals (spread).Thus , goal recognition under partial observability (i.e., missing observations) in the presence of noisy observation is a difficult problem to address while achieving both reasonable recognition time (i.e., a few seconds), high accuracy and low spread. In this paper, we address these limitations by leveraging recent advances on operator-counting heuristics (Pommerening et al. 2014; BID4 ). Operator-counting heuristics provide a unifying framework for a variety of sources of information from planning heuristics BID1 ) that provide both an estimate of the total cost of a goal from any given state and and indication of the actual operators likely to be in such plans. This information proves to be effective at differentiating between goal hypotheses in goal recognition.Our contributions are threefold. First, we develop three, increasingly more accurate goal recognition approaches using operator-counting heuristics.Second, we empirically show that these heuristics are very effective at goal recognition, overcoming existing approaches in almost all domains in terms of accuracy while diminishing the spread of recognized goals. Such approaches are substantially more effective for noisy settings. Third, we discuss a broad class of operator-counting heuristics for goal recognition that can use additional constraints to provide even finer handling of noise and missing observations. We developed a novel class goal recognition technique based on operator-counting heuristics from classical planning (Pommerening et al. 2014) which, themselves rely on ILP constraints to estimate which operators occur in valid optimal plans towards a goal. The resulting approaches are competitive with the state of the art in terms of high accuracy and low false positive rate (i.e., the spread of returned goals), at a moderate computational cost. We show empirically that the overall accuracy of our best approach is sub- stantially superior to the state-of-the-art over a large dataset. Importantly, the values of the operator-counting constraints we compute for each of the heuristics can be used as explanations for recognized goals. The techniques described in this paper use a set of simple additional constraints in the ILP formulation to achieve substantial performance, so we expect substantial future work towards further goal recognition approaches and heuristics that explore more refined constraints to improve accuracy and reduce spread, as well as deriving a probabilistic approach using operator-counting information. Examples of such work include using the constraints to force the LP to generate the counterfactual operator-counts (i.e., non-compliant with the observations) used by the R&G approach, or, given an estimate of the noise, relax the observation constraints to allow a number of observations to not be included in the resulting operator-counts.
