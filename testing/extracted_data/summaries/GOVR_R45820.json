    "content": "Historically, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been one of the larger federal departments in terms of budgetary resources. Estimates by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) indicate that HHS has accounted for at least 20% of all federal outlays in each year since FY1995. Most recently, HHS is estimated to have accounted for 27% of all federal outlays in FY2018. Final FY2019 appropriations had not been enacted for a few HHS operating divisions and accounts prior to the development of the FY2020 President's budget request. As a result, the FY2019 estimates contained in FY2020 President's budget materials (and this report) are based on annualized amounts provided in the FY2019 continuing resolution for this subset of HHS accounts. The remainder of the HHS estimates for FY2019 are based on enacted full-year appropriations contained in Division B of P.L. 115-245 , along with current services estimates for mandatory spending. Under the FY2020 President's budget request, HHS would spend an estimated $1.286 trillion in outlays in FY2020. This is $56 billion (+5%) more than estimated HHS spending in FY2019 and $166 billion (+15%) more than actual HHS spending in FY2018. Mandatory spending typically comprises the majority of the HHS budget. Two programs\u00e2\u0080\u0094Medicare and Medicaid\u00e2\u0080\u0094are expected to account for 86% of all estimated HHS spending in FY2020, according to the President's budget request. Medicare and Medicaid are \"entitlement\" programs, meaning the federal government is required to make mandatory payments to individuals, states, or other entities based on criteria established in authorizing law. Discretionary spending accounts for about 8% of HHS outlays in the FY2020 President's budget request. Although discretionary spending represents a relatively small share of total HHS spending, the department nevertheless receives more discretionary money than most federal departments. According to OMB data, HHS accounted for 7% of all discretionary budget authority across the government in FY2018. This report provides information about the FY2020 HHS budget request. It begins with a review of the department's mission and structure. Next, the report provides some context for the FY2020 President's budget request. It then discusses the concept of the HHS budget as a whole, in comparison to how funding is provided to HHS through the annual appropriations process. The report continues with a breakdown of the HHS request by operating division. An appendix summarizes the mission of each HHS operating division and identifies additional agency-level resources related to the FY2020 budget request."
