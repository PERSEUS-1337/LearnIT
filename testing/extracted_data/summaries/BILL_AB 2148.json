    "title": "AB 2148",
    "content": "Existing federal law, the Federal Aviation Administration Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, provides for the integration of civil and public unmanned aircraft systems, commonly known as drones, into the national airspace system. Existing law establishes both the Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Department of Parks and Recreation in the Natural Resources Agency. A violation of any rule or regulation made or adopted by the Department of Fish and Wildlife pursuant to the Fish and Game Code is a misdemeanor. A violation of the rules and regulations established by the Department of Parks and Recreation to protect the state park system is punishable as either a misdemeanor or an infraction. This bill would make it unlawful for any person to operate an unmanned aircraft system in, or fly an unmanned aircraft system over, lands or waters managed by the Department of Fish and Wildlife and Department of Parks and Recreation, except as authorized or unless exempted from this prohibition. The bill would authorize the consideration of certain factors when reviewing a request for authorization for the use of an unmanned aircraft system. The bill would also make it unlawful to use an unmanned aircraft system to take, or assist in the take of, fish or wildlife for sport purposes, including, but not limited to, the use of unmanned aircraft systems for scouting purposes. The bill would provide that an unmanned aircraft system is a motorized air vehicle within the meaning of a certain existing prohibition and, thus, under that prohibition may not be used to pursue, drive, or herd any bird or mammal, except as specified, including, among other things, specified permits and notices. Because violations of the provisions of the bill would be crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would provide that certain of its provisions are severable and do not apply to the operation of an unmanned aircraft system by a state agency within or over these managed lands or waters, or to any person whom the Federal Aviation Administration authorizes to operate an unmanned aircraft system for a commercial purpose and who operates it in a manner that complies with that authorization. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
