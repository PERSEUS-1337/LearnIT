    "content": "In weakly-supervised temporal action localization, previous works have failed to locate dense and integral regions for each entire action due to the overestimation of the most salient regions. To alleviate this issue, we propose a marginalized average attentional network (MAAN) to suppress the dominant response of the most salient regions in a principled manner. The MAAN employs a novel marginalized average aggregation (MAA) module and learns a set of latent discriminative probabilities in an end-to-end fashion.  MAA samples multiple subsets from the video snippet features according to a set of latent discriminative probabilities and takes the expectation over all the averaged subset features . Theoretically, we prove that the MAA module with learned latent discriminative probabilities successfully reduces the difference in responses between the most salient regions and the others . Therefore, MAAN is able to generate better class activation sequences and identify dense and integral action regions in the videos . Moreover, we propose a fast algorithm to reduce the complexity of constructing MAA from $O(2^T)$ to $O(T^2)$. Extensive experiments on two large-scale video datasets show that our MAAN achieves a superior performance on weakly-supervised temporal action localization.\n\n\n Weakly-supervised temporal action localization has been of interest to the community recently. The setting is to train a model with solely video-level class labels, and to predict both the class and the temporal boundary of each action instance at the test time. The major challenge in the weakly-supervised localization problem is to find the right way to express and infer the underlying location information with only the video-level class labels. Traditionally, this is achieved by explicitly sampling several possible instances with different locations and durations BID2 BID11 . The instance-level classifiers would then be trained through multiple instances learning BID4 BID40 or curriculum learning BID1 ). However, the length of actions and videos varies too much such that the number of instance proposals for each video varies a lot and it can also be huge. As a result, traditional methods based on instance proposals become infeasible in many cases.Recent research, however, has pivoted to acquire the location information by generating the class activation sequence (CAS) directly BID17 , which produces the classification score sequence of being each action for each snippet over time. The CAS along the 1D temporal dimension for a video is inspired by the class activation map (CAM) BID46 BID19 BID18 in weakly-supervised object detection. The CAM-based models have shown that despite being trained on image-level labels, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have the remarkable ability to localize objects. Similar to object detection, the basic idea behind CAS-based methods for action localization in the training is to sample the non-overlapping snippets from a video, then to aggregate the snippet-level features into a video-level feature, and finally to yield a video-level class prediction. During testing, the model generates a CAS for each class that identifies the discriminative action regions, and then applies a threshold on the CAS to localize each action instance in terms of the start time and the end time.In CAS-based methods, the feature aggregator that aggregates multiple snippet-level features into a video-level feature is the critical building block of weakly-supervised neural networks. A model's ability to capture the location information of an action is primarily determined by the design of the aggregators. While using the global average pooling over a full image or across the video snippets has shown great promise in identifying the discriminative regions BID46 BID19 BID18 , treating each pixel or snippet equally loses the opportunity to benefit from several more essential parts. Some recent works BID17 BID49 have tried to learn attentional weights for different snippets to compute a weighted sum as the aggregated feature. However, they suffer from the weights being easily dominated by only a few most salient snippets.In general, models trained with only video-level class labels tend to be easily responsive to small and sparse discriminative regions from the snippets of interest. This deviates from the objective of the localization task that is to locate dense and integral regions for each entire action. To mitigate this gap and reduce the effect of the domination by the most salient regions, several heuristic tricks have been proposed to apply to existing models. For example, BID35 BID44 attempt to heuristically erase the most salient regions predicted by the model which are currently being mined, and force the network to attend other salient regions in the remaining regions by forwarding the model several times. However, the heuristic multiple-run model is not end-to-end trainable. It is the ensemble of multiple-run mined regions but not the single model's own ability that learns the entire action regions. \"Hide-and-seek\" BID28 randomly masks out some regions of the input during training, enforcing the model to localize other salient regions when the most salient regions happen to be masked out. However, all the input regions are masked out with the same probability due to the uniform prior, and it is very likely that most of the time it is the background that is being masked out. A detailed discussion about related works can be found in Appendix D.To this end, we propose the marginalized average attentional network (MAAN) to alleviate the issue raised by the domination of the most salient region in an end-to-end fashion for weakly-supervised action localization. Specifically, MAAN suppresses the action prediction response of the most salient regions by employing marginalized average aggregation (MAA) and learning the latent discriminative probability in a principled manner. Unlike the previous attentional pooling aggregator which calculates the weighted sum with attention weights, MAA first samples a subset of features according to their latent discriminative probabilities, and then calculates the average of these sampled features. Finally, MAA takes the expectation (marginalization) of the average aggregated subset features over all the possible subsets to achieve the final aggregation. As a result, MAA not only alleviates the domination by the most salient regions, but also maintains the scale of the aggregated feature within a reasonable range. We theoretically prove that, with the MAA, the learned latent discriminative probability indeed reduces the difference of response between the most salient regions and the others. Therefore, MAAN can identify more dense and integral regions for each action. Moreover, since enumerating all the possible subsets is exponentially expensive, we further propose a fast iterative algorithm to reduce the complexity of the expectation calculation procedure and provide a theoretical analysis. Furthermore, MAAN is easy to train in an end-to-end fashion since all the components of the network are differentiable. Extensive experiments on two large-scale video datasets show that MAAN consistently outperforms the baseline models and achieves superior performance on weakly-supervised temporal action localization.In summary, our main contributions include: (1) a novel end-to-end trainable marginalized average attentional network (MAAN) with a marginalized average aggregation (MAA) module in the weaklysupervised setting; (2) theoretical analysis of the properties of MAA and an explanation of the reasons MAAN alleviates the issue raised by the domination of the most salient regions; (3) a fast iterative algorithm that can effectively reduce the computational complexity of MAA; and (4) a superior performance on two benchmark video datasets, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3, on the weakly-supervised temporal action localization. incorporates MAA, and introduce the corresponding inference process on weakly-supervised temporal action localization in Sec. 2.4. We have proposed the marginalized average attentional network (MAAN) for weakly-supervised temporal action localization. MAAN employs a novel marginalized average aggregation (MAA) operation to encourage the network to identify the dense and integral action segments and is trained in an end-to-end fashion. Theoretically, we have proved that MAA reduces the gap between the most discriminant regions in the video to the others, and thus MAAN generates better class activation sequences to infer the action locations. We have also proposed a fast algorithm to reduce the computation complexity of MAA. Our proposed MAAN achieves superior performance on both the THUMOS14 and the ActivityNet1.3 datasets on weakly-supervised temporal action localization tasks compared to current state-of-the-art methods."
