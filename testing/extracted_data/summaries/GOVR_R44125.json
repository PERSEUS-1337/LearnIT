    "content": "The consumer data industry\u2014generally referred to as credit reporting agencies or credit bureaus\u2014collects and subsequently provides information to firms about the behavior of consumers when they participate in various financial transactions. Firms use consumer information to screen for the risk that consumers will engage in behaviors that are costly for businesses. For example, lenders rely upon credit reports and scores to determine the likelihood that prospective borrowers will repay their loans. Insured depository institutions (i.e., banks and credit unions) rely on consumer data service providers to determine whether to make available checking accounts or loans to individuals. Some insurance companies use consumer data to determine what insurance products to make available and to set policy premiums. Some payday lenders use data regarding the management of checking accounts and payment of telecommunications and utility bills to determine the likelihood of failure to repay small-dollar cash advances. Merchants rely on the consumer data industry to determine whether to approve payment by check or electronic payment card. Employers may use consumer data information to screen prospective employees to determine the likelihood of fraudulent behavior. In short, numerous firms rely upon consumer data to identify and evaluate potential risks a consumer may pose before entering into a financial relationship with that consumer. Greater reliance by firms on consumer data significantly affects\u2014and potentially limits\u2014consumer access to financial products or opportunities. Specifically, negative or derogatory information, such as late payments, loan defaults, and multiple overdrafts, may stay on consumer reports for several years and lead firms to deny a consumer access to credit, a financial product, or a job opportunity. Having a nonexistent, insufficient, or a stale credit history may also prevent credit access. Accordingly, various policy issues have been raised about the consumer data industry, most notably including the following: How to address inaccurate or disputed consumer data provided in consumer data reports; How long negative or derogatory information should remain in consumer data reports; How to address differences in billing and collection practices that can adversely affect consumer data reports, an issue of particular concern with medical billing practices; How to ensure that consumers are aware of their rights and how to exercise them in the event of a consumer data dispute; Whether uses of consumer data reports outside of the financial services, such as for employment decisions, adversely affect consumers and should be limited; Whether the use of alternative consumer data or newer versions of credit scores may increase accuracy and credit access; and How to address data protection and security issues in consumer data reporting. Congress has shown continuing interest in these and other policy questions surrounding the consumer data industry, particularly in its regulation and whether such regulation currently provides sufficient protection to consumers. In the 116th Congress, legislation has been introduced to address many of these concerns. The Comprehensive Credit Reporting Reform Act of 2019 (CCRRA) and the Protecting Innocent Consumers Affected by a Shutdown Act, both released as drafts by Chairwoman Maxine Waters, would amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and create additional laws to address these concerns. Other relevant bills introduced in the 116th Congress address topics such as credit reporting and cybersecurity (H.R. 331 and H.R. 1282); credit information used for auto insurance (H.R. 1756); and federal employees affected by the shutdown (H.R. 935, H.R. 799, H.R. 1286, and S. 535)."
