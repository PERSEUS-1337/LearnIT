    "content": "Congress established the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System (NWSRS) in 1968 through the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (WSRA; P.L. 90-542) to preserve free-flowing rivers for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations and to complement the then-current national policy of constructing dams and other river structures that altered flow. Designated rivers usually are referred to as wild and scenic rivers (WSRs). The WSRA established three classes of WSRs\u00e2\u0080\u0094wild, scenic, and recreational\u00e2\u0080\u0094reflecting the characteristics of the rivers at the time of designation and affecting the type and amount of subsequently allowable development. The system now includes 226 river units comprising over 13,400 miles in 41 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. WSRs may come into the NWSRS either by congressional designation or by state nomination to the Secretary of the Interior. WSRs may be located on federal lands, nonfederal lands, or a combination of both. Some WSRs on nonfederal land are referred to as partnership wild and scenic rivers (or partnership WSRs). The WSRA does not define this term; it is an umbrella term used to describe WSRs with generally similar characteristics, such as nonfederal management and land ownership, but partnership WSRs can vary. WSRs on nonfederal land also may be added to the NWSRS through an administrative process, wherein states may apply to the Secretary of the Interior for inclusion of a state-protected river. Rivers added to the system through state nomination, or rivers designated by Congress that run through both federal and nonfederal lands, generally are not referred to as partnership WSRs. In the case of congressionally designated rivers, Congress may first direct in legislation that a study be conducted to determine whether the river area is suitable for wild and scenic designation. Congress generally specifies in the designating legislation that either the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior administer the WSR. If the designated WSR contains federal land, the Secretary then manages the river through the federal land management agency of jurisdiction\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service (NPS), or the Fish and Wildlife Service within the Department of the Interior or the Forest Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The relevant local jurisdiction manages partnership WSRs and state-nominated WSRs, with certain administrative functions carried out at the federal level. WSRs are administered to protect and enhance the values for which the rivers were included in the system and to preserve the rivers' free-flowing condition. The agency, or the relevant local jurisdiction for WSRs on nonfederal land, prepares a comprehensive resource management plan (CRMP) to guide management. The WSRA prohibits federally licensed or assisted water resources projects that would have a \"direct and adverse\" effect on the values for which a river was established and prohibits the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from licensing projects on or directly affecting a designated river segment. The agency of jurisdiction enforces this provision; on partnership WSRs and state-nominated WSRs, NPS enforces this provision. In addition to the provisions of the WSRA, management of WSRs on federal lands differs based on the statutory management criteria for each agency's lands. Each federal land management agency specifies policies regarding river management at varying levels of detail. Agencies typically provide the most protection to wild rivers. For congressionally designated rivers on federal lands, Congress provides funds for operations and maintenance through annual appropriations for the relevant agencies. Agencies sometimes provide funding separately for individual rivers or provide funding through broader budget activities, not specific to an individual river. Rivers added to the NWSRS through state nomination typically do not receive federal funding. However, partnership WSRs receive funding through NPS. The WSRA authorizes federal agencies to provide technical assistance to states and their political subdivisions (such as counties, townships, and others), landowners, organizations, or individuals in planning, protecting, and managing WSRs. Designation of wild and scenic rivers has been controversial in some cases, especially for WSRs containing nonfederal lands. Initially following enactment of the WSRA, Congress designated rivers primarily on federal land. Over the past 20 years, Congress has designated or authorized for study an increasing number of partnership WSRs. Opinions regarding the balance of federal and local control over partnership WSRs have varied. Some have observed that Congress intended the state nomination authority to be the primary means for rivers on nonfederal lands to be included in the system, but this designation method has not been used in recent years. Congress may consider whether it is preferable to encourage use of the state-nominated process, which includes a set of fixed provisions, or to continue to establish partnership WSRs through individual designating statutes, whose provisions vary."
