    "title": "An act to amend Section 34191.4 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to redevelopment.",
    "content": "Existing law dissolved redevelopment agencies and community development agencies as of February 1, 2012, and provides for the designation of successor agencies to wind down the affairs of the dissolved redevelopment agencies, subject to review by oversight boards, and to, among other things, make payments due for enforceable obligations and to perform obligations required pursuant to any enforceable obligation. Existing law requires the Department of Finance to issue a finding of completion to a successor agency upon confirmation by the county auditor-controller that specified payments have been fully made by the successor agency. Existing law defines \u201cenforceable obligation\u201d for these purposes to generally exclude any agreements, contracts, or arrangements between the city, county, or city and county that created the redevelopment agency and the former redevelopment agency. However, existing law provides that upon application by the successor agency and approval by the oversight board, loan agreements entered into between the redevelopment agency and the city, county, or city and county that created the redevelopment agency are deemed to be enforceable obligations provided that the oversight board makes a finding that the loan was for legitimate redevelopment purposes. This bill would additionally provide that upon application by the successor agency and approval by the oversight board, loan agreements entered into between a redevelopment agency and the City of San Joaquin, where the outstanding principal balance of the loan is $1,250,000 or less, are enforceable obligations if the oversight board finds, among other things, that the loan was for legitimate redevelopment purposes, it was entered into more than 2 years after the creation of the former redevelopment agency and prior to January 1, 2011, and it is the only debt of the former redevelopment agency remaining to be paid on the recognized obligation payment schedule. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City of San Joaquin."
