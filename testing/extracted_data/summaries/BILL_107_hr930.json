And (2) the economic model and relevant data used to make such projections. Requires Social Security account statements to contain: (1) a comparison of the annual Social Security tax inflows to the amount paid annually in benefits. And (2) a statement of whether the ratio will result in a cash flow deficit, what year such deficit will commence as well as the first year in which funds in the Trust Funds will cease to be sufficient to cover the deficit, and the percentage of benefits due at that time that could be paid from annual tax inflows. Requires account statements also to explain the average rate of return that a taxpayer can expect to receive on old- age insurance benefits as compared to the total amount of Social Security taxes a taxpayer expects to pay. Makes Social Security Administration Continuous Work History Sample data publicly available for statistical research purposes subject to certain limitations."
