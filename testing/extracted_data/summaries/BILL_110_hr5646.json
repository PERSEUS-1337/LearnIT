    "content": "Protecting the Second Amendment and Hunting Rights on Federal Lands Act of 2008 - Prohibits any federal regulation from restricting any individual from possessing or carrying a firearm or ammunition, if such restriction is based, in whole or in part, upon the fact that the individual is in a unit of the National Park System or the Wildlife Refuge System. Sets forth provisions with regard to allowing hunting activities on federal lands. Requires an agency with jurisdiction over any federal land, when developing or considering approval of a management plan, to ensure that hunting activities are allowed as a use of such land to the extent that such use is not clearly incompatible with the purposes for which the federal land is managed."
