    "content": "The GI Bills\u00ae provide financial assistance to individuals, whose eligibility is based on their or a family member's experience in the uniformed services, while they are enrolled in approved programs of education, including training programs. In FY2017, the GI Bills are estimated to provide over $14 billion in benefits to over 1 million veterans and servicemembers and their dependents. The largest program, the Post-9/11 GI Bill, is estimated to account for approximately 93% of the benefits and 80% of the participants. This report provides a description of and background information on selected provisions in three laws that amended the GI Bills in the 114th Congress. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (P.L. 114-92) was enacted on November 25, 2015. The bill effectively ends the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) on November 25, 2019. It also prohibits nonexempt individuals from receiving a Post-9/11 GI Bill allowance while receiving Unemployment Compensation for Ex-Servicemembers (UCX). The Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-228) was enacted on September 29, 2016. Among other purposes, the law authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to treat a program of education as approved for 18 months in the event that the Secretary of Education withdraws the recognition of the accrediting agency that accredited the educational institution at which the program of education was offered. This authority applies to those programs of education that were approved for GI Bill purposes on the basis of being offered directly by an educational institution that is accredited by an ED-recognized accrediting agency. The authority was intended to protect GI Bill participants attending approximately 900 educational institutions accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS), which lost its ED recognition on December 12, 2016. The Jeff Miller and Richard Blumenthal Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-315) was enacted on December 16, 2016. The law enacted several provisions considered throughout the 114th Congress, including some providing for enhanced benefits for select individuals, others providing for more rigorous processes and standards for approving programs of education for GI Bill purposes, and some aiming to enhance information gathering and dissemination activities. Finally, the law was largely paid for ($56 million over 10 years) by reducing the GI Bill reporting fees paid to educational institutions and training establishments."
