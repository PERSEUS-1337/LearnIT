(2) give preference to those that would significantly expand on or fill a gap in existing programs in a geographical region. And (3) consider the special needs and opportunities for increased energy efficiency for manufactured and site-built housing, including construction, renovation, and retrofit. Sets forth Center activities and operations. Prescribes selection criteria. Prohibits the use of grant funds for facilities construction."
