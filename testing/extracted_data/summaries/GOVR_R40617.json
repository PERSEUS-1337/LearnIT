    "content": "Approximately $5.0 billion was requested for legislative branch operations in FY2010, an increase of 14.5% over the FY2009 enacted level. The Subcommittees on the Legislative Branch of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees held hearings during which Members considered the legislative branch requests. On September 23, 2009, the House ordered the previous question (Roll No. 733, 240-171) and agreed by voice vote to a conference with the Senate on H.R. 2918, the FY2010 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill. A motion to instruct conferees failed (Roll No. 734, 191-213), and the House appointed conferees. The House Rules Committee met on September 24, 2009, to adopt a rule for consideration of the conference report. The committee reported the rule (H.Res. 772) and the House adopted it the following day. Following adoption of the rule, the House passed the conference report on H.R. 2918. The House passed H.R. 2918, with amendments, on June 19, 2009. The House bill would have provided nearly $3.675 billion, not including Senate items. The Senate Appropriations Committee held a markup and reported an original bill for legislative branch appropriations on June 18, 2009. The Senate bill (S. 1294) contained $3.136 billion, not including House items. The Senate agreed to the House bill, as amended, on July 6, 2009, and appointed conferees. The conference report (H.Rept. 111-265) provides $4.656 billion. It was agreed to in the House on September 25 and in the Senate on September 30. It was signed by the President and became P.L. 111-68 on October 1, 2009. Among issues that have been considered during hearings on the FY2010 budget in the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, Subcommittees on the Legislative Branch, are the following: the need for the new U.S. Capitol Police radio system and the timing of funding; deferred maintenance issues around the Capitol complex; the effect of the Office of Compliance citations on the Architect's project prioritization and budget request; employment issues, including pay, recruitment and retention, diversity, and equal employment opportunity concerns; and the future of the Open World Leadership Program, including the location of the program within the legislative branch and the selection of participant countries. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-8, enacted on March 11, 2009) provided $4.4 billion for legislative branch activities. This represents an approximately 11% increase over the nearly $4 billion approved by Congress for FY2008. In FY2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5) provided an additional $25 million for the Government Accountability Office and the FY2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-32) provided $71.6 million for the new U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) radio system and $2 million for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). This report will not be updated."
