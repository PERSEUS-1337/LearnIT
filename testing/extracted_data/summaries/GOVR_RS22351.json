    "content": "Alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles face significant market barriers, such as high purchase price and limited availability of refueling infrastructure. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) expands and establishes tax incentives that encourage the purchase of these vehicles and the development of infrastructure needed to support them. Among the new provisions are tax credits for the purchase of hybrid vehicles (replacing an existing tax deduction), tax credits for the purchase of advanced diesel vehicles (although it is unclear whether any current vehicles will qualify), and tax credits to expand refueling infrastructure. This report discusses current federal tax incentives for alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles. It also outlines how the Energy Policy Act of 2005 changes those incentives. This report will be updated as events warrant."
