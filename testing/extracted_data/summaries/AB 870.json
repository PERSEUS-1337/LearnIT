    "title": "An act to add and repeal Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 15290) of Part 6.6 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, relating to housing.\nAn act to add and repeal Chapter 3.6 (commencing with Section 11366) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, relating to state agency regulations, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately\n.",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes various state entities to adopt, amend, or repeal regulations for various specified purposes. The Administrative Procedure Act requires the Office of Administrative Law and a state agency proposing to adopt, amend, or repeal a regulation to review the proposed changes for, among other things, consistency with existing state regulations. This bill, until January 1, 2020, would require each state agency to, on or before January 1, 2019, review that agency\u2019s regulations, identify any regulations that are duplicative, overlapping, inconsistent, or out of date, revise those identified regulations, as provided, and report to the Legislature and Governor, as specified. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute. Existing federal law, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, allocated, until September 30, 2011, $1.5 billion to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development for the Homelessness Prevention Fund, to be used for homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing. Existing federal law, known as the Emergency Solutions Grants Program, provides grants to states, local governments, and private nonprofit organizations, as specified, for specified housing assistance activities. Existing law, the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids Act, provides housing supports to individuals if the administering county determines that the individual or his or her family is experiencing homelessness or housing instability that would be a barrier to self-sufficiency or child well-being and declares that it is the intent of the Legislature that housing supports utilize evidence-based models, including those established in the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program. This bill would require the Department of Housing and Community Development to establish, upon appropriation of funds in the annual Budget Act, an enhancement program for awarding grants to counties and private nonprofit organizations that operate a rapid rehousing program. The bill would require the department to develop guidelines to select 4 counties and private nonprofit organizations to receive these grant funds and require that eligible counties and private nonprofit organizations include those that are eligible to receive funds from the state pursuant to the Emergency Solutions Grants Program with a demonstrated high funding need. The bill would require the department to give priority to counties with existing programs that have demonstrated effectiveness in providing rapid rehousing for homeless individuals and veterans. This bill would require the department to distribute this money equally to each of the selected counties and private nonprofit organizations, less an amount of up to 5 deducted for administrative purposes. The bill would repeal these provisions as of July 1, 2018."
