On November 30, 2016, the House passed the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 34, the 21st Century Cures Act, on a vote of 392 to 26. The bill was then sent to the Senate where it was considered and passed, with only minor technical modification, on December 7, 2016, on a vote of 94 to 5. The law consists of three divisions: Division A\u201421st Century Cures Act; Division B\u2014Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis; and Division C\u2014Increasing Choice, Access, and Quality in Health Care for Americans. CRS has published a series of reports on this law, one on each Division. This is the report for Division A of the law. This report provides a brief summary of each provision of the 21st Century Cures Act (Division A of P.L. 114-255), by title, subtitle, and section. The Division includes five titles, as follows: (1) Innovation projects and state responses to opioid abuse; (2) Discovery; (3) Development; (4) Delivery; and (5) Savings. Title I provides funding for biomedical research, including the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) and the Cancer Moonshot Initiative, for the opioid crisis response, and for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to support certain new activities authorized by the law. Title II, consisting of seven subtitles, requires or authorizes a number of activities to support biomedical research, including the reauthorization of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the reform of that agency through numerous administrative, reporting, and data access provisions. The Title includes provisions that support young investigators funded by NIH; pediatric research; collaborative research such as research on neurological disease; and precision medicine efforts, and specifically the PMI. Title III, consisting of ten subtitles, focuses on modifying the drug and device approval pathways at the FDA to support innovation, and specifically includes provisions that support patient-focused drug development and streamlined and clarified pathways to approval for drugs, combination products, antimicrobials, Orphan drugs, drugs for rare disease, and regenerative therapies.
