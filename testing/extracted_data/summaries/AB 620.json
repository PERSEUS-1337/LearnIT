    "title": "An act to amend Section 149.9 of the Streets and Highways Code, relating to transportation.",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes a value-pricing and transit development program involving high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes to be conducted, administered, developed, and operated on State Highway Routes 10 and 110 in the County of Los Angeles by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) under certain conditions. Existing law requires LACMTA, in implementing the program, to continue to work with the affected communities in the respective corridors and provide mitigation measures for commuters and transit users of low income, including reduced toll charges and toll credits. Existing law requires eligible commuters and transit users to meet the eligibility requirements for specified assistance programs. This bill would require LACMTA to take additional steps, beyond the previous implementation of a low-income assistance program, to increase enrollment and participation in the low-income assistance program, as specified, through advertising and work with community organizations and social service agencies. The bill would also require LACMTA and the Department of Transportation to report to the Legislature by December 31, 2018, on efforts to improve the HOT lane program, including efforts to increase participation in the low-income assistance program."
