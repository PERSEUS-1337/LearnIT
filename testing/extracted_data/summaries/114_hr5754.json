    "content": "S Corporation Modernization Act of 2016 This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the tax treatment of S corporations, to: allow a nonresident alien to be a qualifying beneficiary of an electing small business trust (ESBT), which is a type of trust that is permitted to hold shares in an S corporation. Allow S corporations to increase passive investment income from 25 to 60 without incurring additional taxes. Eliminate a provision terminating the S corporation status of corporations with excessive passive income for three consecutive years. Allow any S corporation bank to have individual retirement account shareholders, allow ESBTs to claim expanded tax deductions for charitable contributions. And allow an adjustment to the basis of an S corporation's assets upon the death of a shareholder, in the form of a 15-year amortization deduction."
