    "content": "Voter Outreach and Turnout Expansion Act of 2003 - Amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to: (1) permit an individual to register to vote on the date of the election at each polling place in a State at which ballots are cast in an election for Federal office. And (2) require each jurisdiction in a State which administers an election for Federal office to designate early voting sites to serve as polling places for the election prior to the election date, and to permit any registered voter to cast a ballot at the site. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) many Americans do not vote on Election Day because of conflicting work schedules. (2) Federal, State, and local governments should share the responsibility for increasing voter turnout. (3) States should establish Election Day as a legal public holiday and provide full paid leave for State government employees. And (4) the treatment of Election Day in the same manner as Veterans Day for purposes of law relating to Federal employment will lead to increased voter turnout and will increase the availability of poll workers and suitable polling places. Sets out requirements for employee voting leave. Expresses the sense of Congress encouraging State and other jurisdictions to distribute sample ballots, information on voting, and other voter education materials as an aid to preventing errors by voters at the polls and reducing the rates of spoiled ballots."
