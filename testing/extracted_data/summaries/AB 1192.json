    "title": "An act to add Section 38568 to the Health and Safety Code, relating to greenhouse gases.\nAn act to add Chapter 22.4 (commencing with Section 22595) to Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to data.",
    "content": "Existing law requires an operator of a commercial Web site or online service that collects personally identifiable information, as defined, through the Internet about individual consumers residing in California to conspicuously post its privacy policy on its Internet Web site, and requires that privacy policy to, among other things, identify the categories of personally identifiable information that the operator collects. This bill would require a person, as defined, that provides a mobile operating system or platform that is used by an operator or developer of a mobile application that collects personal data from an individual California user through the mobile application or an online service to create universal privacy policy standards that are based on certain principles, including, but not limited to, transparency and security. The bill would require that person to conspicuously post those standards on the person\u2019s Internet Web site in a digital format that is accessible to all users, and would require a developer or operator of a mobile application using a mobile operating system or platform to accept those universal privacy policy standards, except as specified. The bill would also make legislative findings and declarations regarding those principles. The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 establishes the State Air Resources Board as the state agency responsible for monitoring and regulating sources emitting greenhouse gases. The act requires the state board to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit to be achieved by 2020 equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions levels of 1990. The state board additionally is required to adopt rules and regulations in an open public process to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Pursuant to the act, the state board has adopted the Low Carbon Fuel Standard regulations. This bill would authorize the state board to establish a very low carbon fuel market commitment program that requires wholesalers, producers, importers, or any other entity that provides transportation fuel to a retailer or sells transportation fuel to a consumer to include as part of their transportation fuel sales in the state percentages of very low carbon transportation fuel, as defined, as determined by the state board. These provisions would become inoperative 5 years after the state board notifies the Secretary of State that very low carbon fuel sales have reached 2 of all transportation fuel sales in the state."
