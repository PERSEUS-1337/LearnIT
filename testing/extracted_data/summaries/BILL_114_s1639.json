    "content": "Education Stability for Foster Youth Act This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require a state plan for academic content and achievement standards to describe how the state will ensure the educational stability of children in foster care. Specifically, a state plan must include assurances that: (1) a foster child will remain or be enrolled in the childrsquo. S school of origin absent a determination that such enrollment is not in the childrsquo, s best interest. (2) if such a determination is made, the child will be immediately enrolled in a new school, which must immediately contact the childrsquo, s previous school to obtain relevant records. And (3) the state will designate a point of contact for child welfare agencies, who shall also oversee implementation of the statersquo. S responsibilities under the bill. Relatedly, a local educational agency (LEA) plan must provide assurances that the LEA will develop and implement procedures governing the provision and funding of transportation services necessary to maintain a foster childrsquo, s enrollment in the childrsquo. S school of origin. This bill amends the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to alter the definition of ldquo, homeless children and youthsrdquo. To no longer include children who are awaiting foster care placement."
