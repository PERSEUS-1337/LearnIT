    "content": "On June 23, 2005, the Supreme Court handed down Kelo v. City of New London , holding thatunder the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause, the sovereign power of eminent domain(\"condemnation\") can be used to transfer private property to new private owners for the purpose ofeconomic development. Kelo sparked a public outcry and a flurry of legislative proposals inCongress and the states to restrict the use of eminent domain. The principal Kelo bill in Congress is H.R. 4128 , the \"Sensenbrenner bill,\"which passed the House on November 3, 2005. Its key provision prohibits states and their politicalsubdivisions (hereinafter \"states\") from using eminent domain to transfer private property to otherprivate parties for economic development -- or allowing their delegatees to do so. The prohibitionapplies to any fiscal year after the bill's enactment in which the state received federal economicdevelopment funds. A state that violates the prohibition is ineligible to receive federal economicdevelopment funds for two fiscal years following a judicial determination of violation -- a penaltyenforceable by private right of action. H.R. 4128 raises several legal issues. The prohibition on economic developmentcondemnations extends not only to land taken for the explicit purpose of economic development butalso to land subsequently so used. The latter coverage raises the possibility that although a parcelwas initially condemned for a non-prohibited purpose, its use years later for a prohibited one wouldtrigger the two-year cut-off of federal funds. Nor does there seem to be any proportionalityrequirement between the prohibited condemnations and the length and scope of the federal fundssuspension. If Congress's Spending Power includes a proportionality requirement for conditions onfederal funds, as the Court suggests, the absence of proportionality in some of the bill's applicationsmay raise a constitutional issue. Persons forced to move by a prohibited condemnation may run into a standing problemshould they attempt to use the bill's right of action to impose a funds suspension. Standing requiresthat the remedy sought in an Article III court will redress the complained-of injury. A suspensionof federal funding to the offending jurisdiction does not redress the fact that the person was madeto move, unless it can be argued that the funding cut-off makes it more likely that the jurisdictionwill elect to return the wrongfully condemned property. The Bond Amendment, inserted into an FY2006 appropriations bill by Senator Bond, is nowenacted law. Like H.R. 4128 , it attaches a condemnation-restricting condition tofederal funds, though limited to funds appropriated under the statute. The Amendment's list ofacceptable and unacceptable condemnation purposes largely echoes existing case law construing the\"public use\" prerequisite for condemnation in the Constitution."
