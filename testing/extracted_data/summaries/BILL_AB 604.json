Existing law makes a violation of these provisions punishable as an infraction. This bill would define the term \u201celectrically motorized board.\u201d The bill would prohibit the operation of an electrically motorized board upon a highway while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug, or under the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and any drug. The bill would require the operator of an electrically motorized board to wear a helmet while operating an electrically motorized board upon a highway, bikeway, or any other public bicycle path, sidewalk, or trail. The bill would require an operator to be at least 16 years of age in order to operate an electrically motorized board. The bill would also require electrically motorized boards to be equipped with safety equipment, as specified, and restrict the operation speed of electrically motorized boards. Because a violation of these provisions would be punishable as an infraction, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would also require the Commissioner of the California Highway Patrol to submit a report, as specified, to the Legislature, on or before January 1, 2021, to assist in determining the effect that the use of electrically motorized boards has on traffic safety. Existing law authorizes transit development boards and public agencies, including, but not limited to, the Regents of the University of California and the Trustees of the California State University, to adopt ordinances, rules, or regulations, respectively, to restrict, or specify the conditions for, the use of bicycles, motorized bicycles, skateboards, and roller skates on property under the control of, or any portion of property used by, the board, or on public property under the jurisdiction of the agency, respectively. This bill would additionally authorize those boards and agencies to adopt ordinances, rules, and regulations, respectively, for the use of electrically motorized boards. Existing law authorizes local authorities to adopt rules and regulations by ordinance or resolution prohibiting or restricting persons from riding or propelling skateboards on highways, sidewalks, or roadways. This bill would additionally authorize local authorities to adopt rules and regulations by ordinance or resolution prohibiting or restricting persons from riding or propelling electrically motorized boards on highways, sidewalks, or roadways. Existing law makes it a crime to operate a motorized skateboard on any sidewalk, roadway, or any other part of a highway or on any bikeway, bicycle path or trail, equestrian trail, or hiking or recreational trail. This bill would provide that an electrically motorized board is not a motorized skateboard for those purposes. Existing law authorizes the Department of Transportation and local authorities to prohibit or restrict the use of bicycles, motorized bicycles, and motorized scooters upon freeways or expressways. This bill would authorize the Department of Transportation and local authorities to also prohibit or restrict the use of electrically motorized boards upon freeways or expressways. This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 21113 of the Vehicle Code proposed by AB 1096 that would become operative only if this bill and AB 1096 are both chaptered, and this bill is chaptered last. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
