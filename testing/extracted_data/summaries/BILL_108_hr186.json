    "content": "Sewage Sludge in Food Production Consumer Notification Act of 2003 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to classify a food as adulterated if it was produced, or contains any ingredient that was produced, on land on which sewage sludge was applied. Permits the following exceptions: (1) if the application of sewage sludge ended more than one year before the production of the food commenced, (2) if a labeling requirement is met. Or (3) in the case of a food that is generally offered for sale without labeling, if an informative sign is posted near the product. Amends the Egg Products Inspection Act, the Federal Meat Inspection Act, and the Poultry Products Inspection Act to classify specified foods under those Acts as adulterated if sewage sludge was involved in specified ways in their production. Allows exceptions for each food similar to those to be permitted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to modify the prohibition under a specified Federal regulation on the use of sewage sludge in organic food production under the National Organic Program of the Department of Agriculture."
