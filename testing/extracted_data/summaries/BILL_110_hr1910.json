Or (2) introduce into commerce, sell, trade, or advertise in commerce, offer to sell, or transport or distribute in US commerce, any sweatshop good. Grants the President, for reasons of national interest, authority to recommend waiver of the applications set forth in this Act in connection with the goods of any country with respect to one or more of the principles and rights defined in this Act as a core labor standard. Sets forth procedures for consideration of such a waiver. Makes it unlawful for persons to introduce into commerce, sell, trade, or advertise in commerce, offer to sell or transport or distribute in commerce any sweatshop good.

Allows specified persons with standing to bring a civil action in US district courts against sellers of goods, wares, articles, or merchandise on grounds of a violation of such prohibition. Lists those with standing. Prohibits executive agencies and the Armed Forces from entering into procurement contracts for sweatshop goods.
