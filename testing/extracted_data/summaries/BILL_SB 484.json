    "title": "SB 484",
    "content": "The California Community Care Facilities Act provides for the licensure and regulation of community care facilities, including foster family homes and group homes, by the State Department of Social Services. A violation of this act is a misdemeanor. Under existing law, a child in a group home may receive mental health services, as deemed necessary by the placing agency and under the case management of that agency. Under existing law, only a juvenile court judicial officer may make orders regarding the administration of psychotropic medications to a child adjudged a dependent or ward of the court and removed from the physical custody of the parent. Existing law requires that the order be based on a request from a physician, indicating the reasons for the request and a description of the child\u2019s diagnosis and behavior, among other requirements. This bill would provide that psychotropic medications may be used at a group home, other than at a runaway and homeless youth shelter, only in accordance with the written directions of the physician prescribing the medication and as authorized by the juvenile court. The bill would require the group home to maintain in the child\u2019s records specified information regarding the administration of those medications. Existing law requires the Director of Social Services, at least annually, to publish and make available to interested persons a list covering all licensed community care facilities, except as specified, and the services for which each facility has been licensed or issued a special permit. This bill would require the department to compile specified information regarding the administration of psychotropic medications to children in group homes and to post that information on the department\u2019s Internet Web site. The bill would require the department, in consultation with the State Department of Health Care Services and stakeholders, to establish a methodology to identify those group homes that have levels of psychotropic drug utilization warranting additional review, as specified. The bill would also require the department, for the facilities identified by the methodology that it establishes, to visit those facilities at least once a year to examine specified factors. The bill would authorize the department, following that inspection, to share relevant information and observations with county placing agencies, social workers, probation officers, the court, dependency counsel, or the Medical Board of California, or share relevant information and observations with the facility and require the facility to submit a plan to the department, within 30 days of receiving the department\u2019s information and observations, to address any identified risks within the control of the facility related to psychotropic medication. The bill would require the department to approve the plan and verify the plan\u2019s implementation to determine whether those identified risks have been remedied. Because the failure of the facility to comply with these provisions would be a misdemeanor, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing law requires the department, on or before January 1, 2016, in consultation with specified associations and other stakeholders, to develop additional performance standards and outcome measures that require group homes to implement programs and services to minimize law enforcement contacts with minors in group homes or under supervision of group home staff. This bill would require the department, on or before January 1, 2017, in consultation with specified associations and other stakeholders, to develop additional performance standards and outcome measures that require group homes to implement alternative programs and services, as specified. The bill would make related changes. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
