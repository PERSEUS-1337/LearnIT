    "content": "Dust Off Crews of the Vietnam War Congressional Gold Medal Act This bill directs the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate to make appropriate arrangements for the presentation of a Congressional Gold Medal in honor of the Dust Off crews of the Vietnam War in recognition of their heroic military service. It is the sense of Congress that the Smithsonian Institution should also make such medal available for display elsewhere, particularly at appropriate locations associated with the Vietnam War, and that preference should be given to locations affiliated with the Smithsonian."
