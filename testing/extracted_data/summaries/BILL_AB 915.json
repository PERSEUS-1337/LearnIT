    "content": "Existing law requires the governing board of a school district to provide by rules and regulations for industrial accident or illness leaves of absence for employees who are a part of the classified service and for all certificated employees. Existing law requires the governing board of a community college district to provide by rules and regulations for industrial accident or illness leaves of absence for employees who are part of the classified service and for all academic employees. Existing law requires an employee receiving benefits pursuant to these provisions to remain within California during periods of injury or illness, unless the governing board authorizes travel outside the state. This bill would remove the travel restriction on an employee receiving these benefits."
