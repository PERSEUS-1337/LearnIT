Directs the Secretary to establish a National Jobs Council Advisory Committee. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) community-based affiliates should establish local jobs council advisory committees to aid in establishing local community support for local implementation of the program. And (2) at least one-third of the members of the committee should be employers in high-impact, high-growth industries in the locality."
