    "content": "Military personnel issues typically generate significant interest from many Members of Congress and their staffs. Ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in support of what the Bush Administration terms the Global War on Terror, along with the emerging operational role of the Reserve Components, have further heightened interest and support for a wide range of military personnel policies and issues. CRS selected a number of issues addressed by Congress as it considered the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1585/S. 1547/H.R. 4986). In each case, a brief synopsis is provided that includes background information, a comparison of the House-passed, Senate-passed, and public law provisions, and a brief discussion of the issue. This update reflects the actions taken on the various House and Senate provisions in H.Rept. 110-477, the conference report to accompany H.R. 1585, which was filed on December 6, 2007. Note: due to objections by the Administration to language that might have led to a freeze on Iraqi assets in U.S. banks contained in H.R. 1585, President Bush vetoed the bill. The bill was reconsidered by the House and Senate, and reissued (without the Iraqi language) as H.R. 4986. H.R. 4986 became P.L. 110-181. Where appropriate, other CRS products are identified to provide more detailed background information and analysis of the issue. For each issue, a CRS analyst is identified and contact information is provided. Note: some issues were addressed in last year's National Defense Authorization Act and discussed in CRS Report RL33571, The FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act: Selected Military Personnel Policy Issues, concerning that legislation. Those issues that were previously considered in CRS Report RL33571 are designated with a \"*\" in the relevant section titles of this report. This report focuses exclusively on the annual defense authorization process. It does not include appropriations, veterans' affairs, tax implications of policy choices or any discussion of separately introduced legislation. Updates to this report are not anticipated."
