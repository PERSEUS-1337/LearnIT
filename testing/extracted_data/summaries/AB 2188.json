    "content": "Existing law authorizes a peace officer to arrest a person without a warrant if the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed a public offense in the officer\u2019s presence or if the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed a felony. This bill would authorize a peace officer to arrest a person without a warrant if the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed the misdemeanor offense of soliciting a minor for prostitution. Existing law requires the Department of Justice to seek to control and eradicate organized crime by, among other things, gathering, analyzing, and storing intelligence related to organized crime and providing this intelligence to local, state, and federal law enforcement units. Existing law also requires, prior to a local law enforcement agency designating, or submitting a document to the Attorney General\u2019s office for the purpose of designating, a person as a gang member, associate, or affiliate in a shared gang database, as defined, the local law enforcement agency to provide written notice to the person and his or her parent or guardian of the designation and the basis for the designation if the person is under 18 years of age, except as specified. Existing law authorizes the person or his or her parent or guardian to submit written documentation contesting that designation and requires the local law enforcement agency to provide written verification of its decision within 60 days. This bill would require the department, on or before January 1, 2018, to expand its shared gang database, as defined in the provision described above, in order to provide accurate, timely, and electronically generated data of statewide human trafficking intelligence information. The bill would specify that the purpose of that expansion is to allow law enforcement agencies in California to collaborate in reducing the incidence of human trafficking. The bill would authorize the department to promulgate regulations to implement its provisions."
