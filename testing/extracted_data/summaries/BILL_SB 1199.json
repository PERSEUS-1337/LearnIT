    "title": "SB 1199",
    "content": "Existing law, the Outdoor Advertising Act, provides for the regulation by the Department of Transportation of advertising displays, as defined, within view of public highways. The act regulates the placement of off-premises advertising displays along highways that generally advertise business conducted or services rendered or goods produced or sold at a location other than the property upon which the display is located. A violation of the act is a crime. The act also provides that an advertising display advertising businesses and activities developed within the boundary limits of, and as a part of, an individual redevelopment agency project, as those project boundaries existed on December 29, 2011, may remain and be considered an on-premises display, until January 1, 2023, if the advertising display meets specified criteria. The act further authorizes, on and after January 1, 2022, the applicable city, county, or city and county to request from the department an extension for good cause, as specified, beyond January 1, 2023, not to exceed the expiration of the redevelopment project area. This bill would authorize under similar provisions the advertising of businesses or activities operating outside a redevelopment project area but within the boundaries of the City of Inglewood. The bill would impose certain duties on the City of Inglewood regarding advertising displays. By increasing the level of service provided by the city, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would also make findings and declarations as to the need for a special statute relating to the City of Inglewood. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
