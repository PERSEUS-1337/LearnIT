    "content": "Prior to January 1, 2005, alcohol fuel blenders qualified for a 5.2\u00c2\u00a2 tax exemption against theexcise taxes otherwise due on each gallon of blended mixtures (mixtures of 10% ethanol, and 90%gasoline). This exemption, which was scheduled to decline to 5.1\u00c2\u00a2 on January 1, 2005, reduced thegasoline excise tax for \"gasohol,\" from 18.4\u00c2\u00a2 to 13.2\u00c2\u00a2/gallon. The reduction was realized at the timewhen the gasoline tax was otherwise imposed: typically when the fuel was loaded from the terminalonto trucks for distribution. The 5.2\u00c2\u00a2 exemption could also be claimed later, i.e., when blendersfiled their income tax return, as a 52\u00c2\u00a2 excise tax credit per gallon of alcohol used to make a fuelmixture (which was also scheduled to decline to 51\u00c2\u00a2 in tandem with the exemption on January 1,2005). This credit, however, was not as valuable as the exemption because 1) it was taxable asincome, 2) was not available instantaneously as the fuel was blended -- blenders had to wait untiltheir income tax returns were filed to reduce their tax liability by the amount of the credit, and 3) thetax credit was not refundable -- it was only available to the extent of tax liability. Because theprimary benefits from alcohol fuels were realized through an exemption rather than a tax credit,revenue losses from the exemption (or reduced excise taxes) accrued to the Highway Trust Fund(HTF). The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-357 ) restructured the basic tax subsidiesfor alcohol fuels: 1) the blender's income tax credits were eliminated and 2) the blender's excise tax exemption was replaced by an \"instant\" excise tax credit of the same amount -- 5.1\u00c2\u00a2/gallon of a 90:10mixture, which is also equivalent to 51\u00c2\u00a2 per gallon of ethanol in the mixture. These tax reforms wentinto effect on January 1, 2005. As before, the excise tax credit is claimed against the 18.4\u00c2\u00a2 per gallonexcise tax on gasoline, so that the actual excise tax paid and remitted to the Treasury is 13.3\u00c2\u00a2 -- thetax is reduced by 5.1\u00c2\u00a2/gallon just as with the exemption. When income tax effects are considered,however, the new excise tax credit has a greater economic or subsidy value than the exemptionbefore it because income tax deductions are taken at 18.4\u00c2\u00a2 rather then 13.3\u00c2\u00a2. In other words, bylabeling the tax reduction as an excise tax credit rather than an excise tax exemption , the tax lawtreats the blenders as paying the full excise tax of 18.4\u00c2\u00a2/ gallon rather than 13.3\u00c2\u00a2 per gallon. At a25% marginal income tax rate, the additional 5.1\u00c2\u00a2 deduction is valued at 1.7\u00c2\u00a2/gallon of a blend or17\u00c2\u00a2/gallon of ethanol, which means that the total after-tax subsidy for alcohol fuel mixtures iseffectively 68\u00c2\u00a2/gallon of ethanol rather than the nominal rate of 51\u00c2\u00a2. By nominally increasing the excise tax on gasohol by 5.1\u00c2\u00a2/gallon, an extra $1,500 millionin FY2006 is projected to be allocated into the HTF from the general fund, which implies that HTFexpenditures, and budget deficits can be expected to be higher than under the exemption. In additionto the alcohol fuel mixture excise tax credit there are three other federal tax subsidies that areavailable for the production and use of alcohol transportation fuels (but are little used).Comprehensive energy policy legislation H.R. 6 , as passed by the Senate, includes arenewable fuels standard that would, by 2010, more than double both the use of ethanol and therevenue loss from the new alcohol fuels tax incentives."
