An insurance claim for malpractice benefits by a contractor-defendant shall be subrogated to the United States. The VA shall: (1) revoke the authorization to provide VA care of a contractor who has been the defendant in at least three cases during a five-year period that resulted in a judgment or settlement against the United States, and (2) bring an adverse action against certain VA health care personnel for similar reasons."
