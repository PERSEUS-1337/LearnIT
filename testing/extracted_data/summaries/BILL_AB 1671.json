    "title": "AB 1671",
    "content": "Existing law makes it a crime, subject to specified exemptions, for a person to intentionally eavesdrop upon or record a confidential communication by means of an electronic amplifying or recording device without the consent of all parties to the confidential communication. Existing law defines a confidential communication as any communication carried on in circumstances that reasonably indicate that any party to the communication desires it to be confined to the parties thereto. Existing law exempts from the prohibition the recording of a confidential communication made for the purpose of obtaining evidence reasonably believed to relate to the commission by another party to the communication of certain crimes, including any felony involving violence against the person making the recording. This bill additionally would make it a crime for a person who unlawfully eavesdrops upon or records a confidential communication as described above with a health care provider, as defined, to intentionally disclose or distribute the contents of the confidential communication without the consent of all parties to the confidential communication unless specified conditions are met. The bill would make this prohibition subject to the same exemptions as are applicable to the prohibition on eavesdropping upon or recording a confidential communication as described above. The bill would also specify the conduct that constitutes aiding and abetting the commission of those offenses, as specified. The bill would specify, with respect to the exemption for recording communications believed to relate to the commission of a crime by a party to the communication, that a felony involving violence includes human trafficking, as defined. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing law authorizes any person who has been injured by a violation of the prohibition on eavesdropping upon or recording confidential communications, and related offenses, to bring an action against the person who committed the violation to enjoin and restrain the violation, as well as to bring an action for monetary damages, as specified. This bill would provide that the monetary damages be imposed per violation of the above-described provisions. Existing law makes the above-specified crime of eavesdropping punishable by a fine not to exceed $2,500 or imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or in the state prison for 16 months or 2 or 3 years. If the person has previously been convicted of eavesdropping, or has previously been convicted of specified invasion of privacy crimes, existing law requires the person to be punished by a fine not exceeding $10,000, by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or in the state prison for 16 months or 2 or 3 years. This bill would require the above-specified fines to be imposed on a per-violation basis and would impose the same penalties prescribed for the unlawful eavesdropping upon or recording of a confidential communication to the disclosure crimes created by the bill. The bill also would make various technical, nonsubstantive changes to existing law. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
