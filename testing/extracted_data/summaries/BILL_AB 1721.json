    "content": "The Cal Grant Program establishes the Cal Grant A and B Entitlement awards, the California Community College Transfer Entitlement awards, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B awards, the Cal Grant C awards, and the Cal Grant T awards under the administration of the Student Aid Commission, and establishes eligibility requirements for awards under these programs for participating students attending qualifying institutions, as defined. This bill would express the intent of the Legislature to renew California\u2019s commitment to college affordability by increasing the aid available to needy students, and, specifically, broadening access to financial aid to students enrolled in California community college career technical education programs leading to industry valued credentials, through expanding the Cal Grant Program. colleges. Under existing law, no more than a total of 25,750 Competitive Cal Grant A and B awards may be granted annually. This bill, commencing with the 2016\u201317 academic year, would raise that limit to 34,000. The bill would, effective with the fall term or semester of the 2017\u201318 academic year, make students enrolled in occupational or technical training courses leading to industry valued credentials of no less than 4 months in length at a California community college eligible for Cal Grant B awards under an existing allocation reserved for community college students, notwithstanding an existing requirement that limits Cal Grant B awards to for-credit instructional programs that are not less than one academic year in length. Existing law requires a Cal Grant C award to be utilized only for occupational or technical training in a course of not less than 4 months. Existing law requires that there be the same number of Cal Grant C awards each year as were made in the 2000\u201301 fiscal year. This bill instead would require that there be the same number of Cal Grant C awards each year as were paid in the 2015\u201316 fiscal year."
