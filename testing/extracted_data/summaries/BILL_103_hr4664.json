    "content": "Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require the administering authority, whenever it has determined upon the filing of a short-supply petition that a short-supply situation exists with respect to a particular product within the same class or kind as merchandise that is the subject of an antidumping duty order or finding, or a countervailing duty order, to authorize the importation of additional quantities of such merchandise free of duties, estimated duty deposits, reporting requirements, and other restrictions, unless it determines that such imports will erode the pricing structure of domestic merchandise comparable to the class or kind of merchandise that is subject to such order or finding. Requires the administering authority, whenever it finds that a short-supply petition contains adequate information, to determine: (1) if a short-supply situation exists in the United States with respect to a product. And (2) if an affirmative determination is made, the quantity of the product, if any, that may be imported into the United States without regard to the applicable antidumping or countervailing duty order. Requires the administering authority, if it determines that a short-supply situation does not exist because a US producer states that it will supply the product in the quantity requested, and such producer fails to supply such product as promised, to grant a short-supply allowance for the quantity such producer failed to supply."
