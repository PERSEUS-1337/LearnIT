    "content": "The annual Foreign Operations appropriations bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which Congress reviews the U.S. foreign aid budget and influences executive branch foreign policymaking generally. It contains the largest share -- over two-thirds -- of total U.S. internationalaffairs spending. President Bush requested $15.167 billion for FY2002 Foreign Operations, an amount 1.5% higher than enacted FY2001 appropriations. By comparison, foreign policy resources proposed forState Department, U.N. contributions, and other non-foreign aid activities would increase by 13.2%from FY2001, in nominal terms. Although the overall FY2002 Foreign Operations proposedincrease was relatively small -- $224 million -- some activities funded in FY2001 would either notneed new appropriations or would require smaller resources in FY2002, thereby freeing up funds forother initiatives. After adjusting the FY2001 base amount to reflect these reduced fundingrequirements that did not alter current policy, the request represented a higher increase for ForeignOperations -- $698 million, or 4.8% more, in nominal terms. The FY2002 Foreign Operations request set most accounts at or near FY2001 funding levels, while largely concentrating proposals to increase spending in a few areas -- disaster aid, globalhealth, international narcotics control, and contributions to the World Bank and other internationalfinancial institutions. Likewise, the budget submission recommended cutting appropriationssignificantly in two accounts -- debt reduction resources for the Heavily Indebted Poor Country(HIPC) initiative and the Export-Import Bank - but only the latter represented a policy shift. Except in one area, the FY2002 budget request represented few changes in the list of top U.S. foreign aid recipients. Israel, Egypt, and Jordan remained the leading recipients. The mostsignificant change was the increase in aid for Latin American drug producing nations. Under theAdministration's Andean Counterdrug Initiative, Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia would be among theleading 10 recipients of U.S. aid. Following nearly six months of debate, Congress cleared for the President on December 20, 2001, a $15.35 billion Foreign Operations Appropriations for FY2002 ( P.L. 107-115 ; H.R. 2506 ). The measure is roughly midway between levels passed earlier by the House($15.17 billion) and the Senate ($15.52 billion), and $178 million higher than requested by thePresident. This marks one of the few occasions when Congress has approved more spending forForeign Operations than sought by the Administration. The amount is about $400 million, or 2.7%higher than for FY2001 (excluding the $1.1 billion for Foreign Operations programs allocated fromthe terrorism emergency supplemental measure; P.L. 107-38 ). Highlights of the bill include: $779million for the Export-Import Bank, nearly $100 million more than requested; $475 million forHIV/AIDS, up from the $429 million proposal; and $625 million for the Andean CounternarcoticsInitiative, a cut of $106 million from the request. The enacted measure drops Senate-passedlanguage overturning the President's international family planning restrictions, but approved fundinglevels for population aid and UNFPA near the higher Senate-passed amounts."
