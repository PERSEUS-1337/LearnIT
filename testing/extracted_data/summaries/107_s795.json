    "title": "A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permit the consolidation of life insurance companies with other companies.",
    "content": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include life insurance companies as an includible corporation for purposes of filing consolidated tax returns. Permits an affiliated group which includes at least one domestic insurance company that elects to file a consolidated return rather than pay tax under certain life insurance provisions to use a phased-in percentage of insurance company net operating loss in determining its own taxable income. Provides for: (1) subsidiary stock basis adjustment. And (2) waiver of the five-year reconsolidation waiting period for certain formerly includible corporations which became nonincludible as a result of becoming a subsidiary of a nonincludible life insurance company."
