    "content": "This report provides an overview of actions taken by Congress and the President to provide FY2016 appropriations for accounts funded by the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (LHHS) appropriations bill. This bill provides funding for all accounts funded through the annual appropriations process at the Departments of Labor (DOL) and Education (ED). It provides annual appropriations for most agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with certain exceptions (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration is funded via the Agriculture bill). The LHHS bill also provides funds for more than a dozen related agencies, including the Social Security Administration (SSA). FY2016 Supplemental Appropriations: On September 29, 2016, President Obama signed into law H.R. 5325 (P.L. 114-223), a legislative vehicle that contained the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016, in Division B. The bill had been passed by the House and Senate one day earlier, on September 28, 2016. The Zika supplemental contained in this law provided $1.1 billion in emergency appropriations for domestic and international Zika response efforts. Of this, a total of $933 million was provided to HHS programs and activities. The budgetary totals in this report do not include these emergency appropriations. FY2016 Omnibus: On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113), which provided FY2016 LHHS appropriations in Division H. This law appropriated $170 billion in discretionary funding for LHHS, which is roughly $6 billion (+4%) more than FY2015 enacted levels and $5 billion (-3%) less than the FY2016 President's request. In addition, the FY2016 omnibus provided an estimated $718 billion in mandatory LHHS funding (pre-sequester), for a total of $888 billion for LHHS as a whole. DOL: The FY2016 omnibus provided roughly $12 billion in discretionary funding for DOL, about 2% more than FY2015 enacted. HHS: The FY2016 omnibus provided roughly $75 billion in discretionary funding for HHS, about 6% more than FY2015 enacted. ED: The FY2016 omnibus provided roughly $68 billion in discretionary funding for ED, about 2% more than FY2015 enacted. Related: The FY2016 omnibus provided roughly $15 billion in discretionary funding for LHHS related agencies, about 3% more than FY2015 enacted. FY2016 Continuing Resolutions: The FY2016 omnibus followed three government-wide continuing resolutions (CRs), which had provided temporary funding earlier in the fiscal year (P.L. 114-53, P.L. 114-96, and P.L. 114-100). With limited exceptions, the CRs generally funded discretionary LHHS programs at FY2015 levels, minus a reduction of less than one percent (-0.2108%). Earlier Senate LHHS Action: On June 25, 2015, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved its FY2016 LHHS appropriations bill by a vote of 16-14 (S. 1695; S.Rept. 114-74). This bill would have provided $162 billion in discretionary LHHS funds, which is about 1% less than FY2015 enacted levels. In addition, the Senate committee bill would have provided an estimated $718 billion in mandatory funding, for a total of $880 billion for LHHS as a whole. Earlier House LHHS Action: On June 24, 2015, the House Appropriations Committee approved its FY2016 LHHS bill by a vote of 30-21 (H.R. 3020; H.Rept. 114-195). This bill would have provided $161 billion in discretionary LHHS funds, which is about 2% less than FY2015 enacted levels. In addition, the House committee bill would have provided an estimated $718 billion in mandatory funding, for a total of roughly $879 billion for LHHS as a whole. President's Budget Submission: On February 2, 2015, the Obama Administration released the FY2016 President's budget. The President requested $175 billion in discretionary funding for accounts funded by the LHHS bill, which is about 6% more than FY2015 enacted levels. In addition, the President requested roughly $718 billion in annually appropriated mandatory funding, for a total of roughly $893 billion for LHHS as a whole."
