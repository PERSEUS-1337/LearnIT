    "title": "SB 260",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions. One method by which these services are provided is pursuant to contracts with various types of managed care health plans, including through a county organized health system. Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (Knox-Keene), provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law provides the California Medical Assistance Commission with the authority to negotiate exclusive contracts with county organized health systems to provide health care services under the Medi-Cal program. Under existing law, the contracting counties are exempt from Knox-Keene for purposes of carrying out those contracts. This bill would repeal that exemption and deleted delete related exemptions, deem a county contracting with the department under the provisions described above to be a health care service plan, plan as of specified dates, and subject contracting counties to the act for purposes of carrying out those contracts, unless the act expressly provides otherwise. The bill would make conforming changes. Because a willful violation of Knox-Keene is a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
