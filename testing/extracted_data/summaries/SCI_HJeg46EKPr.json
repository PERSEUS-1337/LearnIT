    "content": "Detecting anomalies is of growing importance for various industrial applications and mission-critical infrastructures, including satellite systems. Although there have been several studies in detecting anomalies based on rule-based or machine learning-based approaches for satellite systems, a tensor-based decomposition method has not been extensively explored for anomaly detection. In this work, we introduce an Integrative Tensor-based Anomaly Detection (ITAD) framework to detect anomalies in a satellite system. Because of the high risk and cost, detecting anomalies in a satellite system is crucial. We construct 3rd-order tensors with telemetry data collected from Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-2 (KOMPSAT-2) and calculate the anomaly score using one of the component matrices obtained by applying CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition to detect anomalies. Our result shows that our tensor-based approach can be effective in achieving higher accuracy and reducing false positives in detecting anomalies as compared to other existing approaches. Due to the high maintenance cost as well as extreme risk in space, detecting anomalies in a satellite system is critical. However, anomaly detection in a satellite system is challenging for several reasons. First, anomalies occur due to complex system interactions from various factors inside and outside a satellite system. For example, a sensor in one subsystem in a satellite system is often connected to several other types of sensors or resources in other subsystem modules. Each sensor measurement is encapsulated as telemetry and downlinked to the ground station. In order to identify anomalies, it is crucial to compare and understand not just one single telemetry but several telemetries as a whole. However, most of the previous studies (Fuertes et al., 2016; Hundman et al., 2018; OMeara et al., 2016) on detecting anomalies in satellite systems have primarily focused on analyzing individual telemetry. This can lead to a high false positives rate, because some instantaneous glitches may not be actual anomalies, but just trivial outliers (Yairi et al., 2017) . Additionally, false positives can be costly, requiring much manual effort from operators to investigate and determine whether they are anomalies (Hundman et al., 2018) . To reduce the false positives, analyzing a set of multiple telemetries as a whole can be more effective to determine true anomalies in a complex system. To the best of our knowledge, this integrated approach for a satellite system has not been studied extensively in the past. In order to address these challenges, we propose an Integrative Tensor-based Anomaly Detection (ITAD) framework for a satellite system, where a tensor can effectively capture a set of high dimensional data. Specifically, we construct a 3rd-order tensor for entire telemetries in one subsystem and decompose it into component matrices, which captures the characteristics of multiple telemetries as a whole to detect anomalies. We then conduct a cluster analysis on one component matrix in a decomposed tensor and calculate the anomaly score based on the distance between each telemetry sample and its cluster centroid. Finally, we used the dynamic thresholding method (Hundman et al., 2018) to detect anomalies; the dynamic thresholding method changes the detection threshold value over time instead of using a fixed value for the entire dataset. We performed experiments on our approach with a subset of real telemetries from the KOMPSAT-2 satellite, and verify that our approach can detect actual anomalies effectively and reduce false positives significantly, compared to other approaches. Determining an appropriate rank-size r is an NP-complete problem (H\u00e5stad, 1990) , and there is no general algorithm to find it. To choose r, we exploit the reconstruction error, which is proposed in the original CP research (Carroll and Chang, 1970; Harshman, 1970) . However, there is a possibility to suffer from overfactoring and ultimately failing to obtain an optimal solution from this method. To address this possibility, we plan to apply the Core Consistency Diagnostic (CORCONDIA) proposed by Bro and Kiers (2003) for determining the optimal rank r for our future work. We believe that the CORCONDIA method, which assesses the core consistency and measures the similarity between the core array and theoretical super-diagonal array, can yield more accurate results. Even though we use 10 months of real telemetry dataset, we do not have many anomalies, which is a realistic scenario. Otherwise, i.e. if there are many anomalous events, most mission-critical systems would fail very quickly. In the presence of a small number of anomalies, the main focus of our work is to reduce false positives to assist satellite operators to determine the true anomalies, as requested by KARI operators. However, we agree that because of a small number of anomalies, current precision, and recall metrics would be very sensitive to anomaly events. Missing one anomaly would result in a 33% drop in performance. To partially address this issue, we are currently in the process of collecting more datasets with anomalies within a longer and plan to evaluate our tensor-based system with datasets with more anomalies. Also, we believe we need to develop a better performance metric, which can capture the performance with a small number of anomalies. Lastly, we are in the process of deploying our tensor-based anomaly detection method to THE KOMPSAT-2 satellite in the spring of 2020. We plan to incorporate not only 88 telemetries we experimented in this research, but also other types of telemetries and subsystems to evaluate our integrative anomaly detection method. In this work, we proposed an Integrative Tensor-based Anomaly Detection framework (ITAD) to detect anomalies using the KOMPSAT-2 satellite telemetry dataset, where our approach can analyze multiple telemetries simultaneously to detect anomalies. Our ITAD achieves higher performance in precision and F1 score compared to other approaches. We also demonstrate that the ITAD reduces the false positives significantly. This reduction in FPs is because it can distinguish actual anomalies from trivial outliers by incorporating information from other telemetries at the same time. In the future, we plan to improve our algorithm by applying the CORCONDIA method to avoid overfactoring and find an optimal rank r and incorporate and evaluate datasets with more anomalies. We believe our work laid the first grounds using an integrated tensor-based detection mechanism for space anomaly detection. Moreover, the result demonstrates that our proposed method can be applicable in a variety of multivariate time-series anomaly detection scenarios, which require low false positives as well as high accuracy.
