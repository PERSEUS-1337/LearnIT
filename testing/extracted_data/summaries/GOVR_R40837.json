    "content": "As reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the six titles of S. 1462 are intended to address the energy security of the United States by promoting the development of clean energy technologies, improving energy efficiency, encouraging the development of domestic energy resources, promoting energy innovation and energy workforce development, improving the stability of U.S. energy markets, and informing energy strategies through a series of studies and reports. Some of these provisions build on similar or related provisions in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05, P.L. 109-58), the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA07, P.L. 110-140) and appropriations under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5). This report compares S. 1462 with certain energy provisions in H.R. 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, although there are substantial differences. H.R. 2454 is a broader bill that includes a greenhouse gas cap-and-trade system not found in the Senate Committee bill. (The energy provisions in S. 1462 are expected to be considered by the Senate when crafting its own greenhouse gas bill with input from other key committees.) Title I of S. 1462 would promote the commercial deployment of clean energy technologies by modifying the Loan Guarantee Program and increasing Department of Energy's (DOE's) authority to offer additional financial incentives. Title II promotes enhanced energy efficiency through a combination of policies that target manufacturing, appliances, buildings, and the electric grid. Title III is intended to enhance U.S. energy security, according to the Committee Report, by addressing the issues of critical electric infrastructure and its vulnerability to cyber attack; nuclear waste disposal and reprocessing; additional petroleum storage; expansion of oil and gas leasing in certain offshore areas; development of renewable energy resources on public lands; large-scale and long-term geologic storage of CO2; and reduction of the reliance of U.S. island territories on imported fossil fuels. Title IV contains provisions for advancing energy innovation and workforce development, including a variety of energy research, development, demonstration, and commercial application activities; a Grand Energy Challenges Research Initiative to integrate basic and applied energy research programs; expanding and modifying several energy programs, including the Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2014Energy; domestic vehicle battery manufacturing research; lightweight materials research and development; methane hydrate research and development; low-Btu gas and helium resources conservation; Arctic energy research, development, and deployment; and ultra-deepwater and unconventional natural gas and other petroleum resources R&D. Title V contains several measures designed to stabilize the oil, natural gas, and electricity markets and to enhance energy security. Title VI would provide direction and authorization for a number of studies and reports that would inform energy programs and policies."
