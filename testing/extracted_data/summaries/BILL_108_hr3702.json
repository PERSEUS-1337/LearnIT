Includes for the Medicare part D eligible individual as a choice of coverage, in addition to the current choice of coverage in at least two qualifying plans in the area in which the individual resides, a choice of enrollment in a nationwide prescription drug plan offered by the Secretary . Directs the Secretary, through the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services, to take such steps as may be necessary to qualify and serve as a prescription drug plan sponsor and to offer a prescription drug plan that offers basic prescription drug coverage throughout the United States and has a premium of $35 for 2006. Requires such a plan to be in addition to, and not in lieu of, other prescription drug plans offered. Provides for full reimbursement for employers for the cost of qualified retiree drug coverage and permits their costs to count towards senior's catastrophic limits.
