Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to pay 80 percent of the development and implementation costs of the NTS. Requires a metropolitan or State long-range plan to identify, at a minimum, transportation facilities, including, among others, airport, port, inland waterway, and railroad, that function as an integrated metropolitan or State transportation system, giving emphasis to facilities that serve important national and regional transportation functions.

Directs the Secretary to set-aside a specified percentage of NHS funds for grants for the developmental costs of the NTS. Directs States to set-aside a specified percentage of their NHS apportionment to provide intermodal connections to the NHS or connections between the NHS and the NTS. Prohibits the use of State set-asides for projects that add new capacity for single-occupant passenger vehicles . Sets forth formulae for the apportionment of NHS funds to certain urbanized and rural areas."
