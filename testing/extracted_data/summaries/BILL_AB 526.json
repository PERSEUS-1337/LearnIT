    "content": "Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school district to authorize a pupil who meets specified criteria to attend community college. Existing law limits the number of pupils a principal is authorized to recommend for community college summer session pursuant to those provisions to 5 of the total number of pupils in any grade level, as specified. This bill, until January 1, 2020, would exempt from the 5 limitation pupils who meet specified requirements and who enroll in certain community college courses. The bill would require the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to annually report to the Department of Finance the number of pupils who enrolled and received a passing grade in a community college summer session course. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."
