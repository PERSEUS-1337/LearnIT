    "title": "AB 804",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the certification and regulation of shorthand reporters by the Court Reporters Board of California in the Department of Consumer Affairs, and provides for the regulation of shorthand reporting schools by the board. Existing law provides for the renewal of a shorthand reporter\u2019s certificate if specified requirements are met. Existing law sets forth specified fees for the examination for, and the issuance and renewal of, a shorthand reporter\u2019s certificate. This bill would require the board, on or before July 1, 2017, to adopt regulations to establish, for renewal of a shorthand reporter\u2019s certificate, minimum approved continuing education requirements, with certain exceptions, and would require the board to establish a procedure for approving providers of those continuing education courses, as specified. The bill would also require the board to collaborate with the Judicial Council to develop a list of courses that satisfy the continuing education requirements of both these provisions and a specified rule, applicable to trial court personnel, of the California Rules of Court. The bill would also authorize the board to, by regulation, establish a fee for approval of those continuing education providers, not to exceed the reasonable regulatory costs, if any, to the board of approving those providers."
