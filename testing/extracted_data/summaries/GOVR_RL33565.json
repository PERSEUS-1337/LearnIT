    "content": "For more than a century, the federal government has constructed water resource projects for a variety of purposes, including flood control, navigation, power generation, and irrigation. While most municipal and industrial water supplies have been built by non-federal entities, most of the large, federal water projects in the West, including Hoover and Grand Coulee dams, were constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation (Department of the Interior) to provide water for irrigation. Growing populations and changing values have increased demands on water supplies and river systems, resulting in water use and management conflicts throughout the country, particularly in the West, where population is expanding rapidly. In many western states, agricultural needs are often in direct conflict with urban needs, as well as with water demand for threatened and endangered species habitat, recreation, and scenic enjoyment. Debate over western water resources revolves around the issue of how best to plan for and manage the use of this renewable, yet sometimes scarce and increasingly sought after, resource. Some observers advocate enhancing water supplies, for example, by building new storage or diversion projects, expanding old ones, or funding water reclamation and reuse facilities. Others emphasize the need to manage existing supplies more efficiently\u2014through conservation, revision of policies that encourage inefficient use of water, and establishment of market mechanisms to allocate water. The 109th Congress is considering a number of bills on western water issues, including title transfer, water recycling (e.g., S. 3639 and H.R. 5768), rural water supply (e.g., S. 895), and drought legislation (e.g., H.R. 5136 and S. 2751). Oversight of CALFED\u2014a joint federal and state program to restore fish and wildlife habitat and address California water supply/quality issues\u2014and Klamath River Basin and San Joaquin River Basin issues are also under consideration. The 109th Congress may also consider Indian water rights settlement legislation; however, Indian settlement bills are not tracked in this report."
