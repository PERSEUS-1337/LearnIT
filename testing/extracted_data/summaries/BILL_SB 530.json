    "title": "SB 530",
    "content": "Existing law generally regulates the operation of bicycles, including, among other things, providing that a person operating a bicycle on the highway has all the rights and is subject to all the provisions applicable to the driver of a vehicle, including a prohibition against operating a bicycle while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug. These provisions also apply to a pedicab, as defined. A violation of the provisions regulating the operation of a bicycle or pedicab is an offense. This bill would expand the definition of a pedicab to include a 4-wheeled device that is primarily or exclusively pedal-powered, has a seating capacity for 8 or more passengers, cannot travel in excess of 15 miles per hour, and is being used for transporting passengers for hire, as prescribed. The bill would impose specified requirements on these pedicabs defined by the bill, relating to, among other things, a maximum seating capacity for 15 passengers, local authorization to operate, operator qualifications and training, safety equipment, inspections, financial responsibility, reporting of accidents to the Department of the California Highway Patrol, the loading and unloading of passengers, and general operation of pedicabs. The bill would, until January 1, 2020, establish requirements for pedicabs that allow passenger alcohol consumption. Because a violation of these provisions would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
