    "content": "Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, and under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions. Existing law authorizes certain ground emergency medical transportation providers to receive supplemental Medi-Cal reimbursement in addition to the rate of payment that the provider would otherwise receive for those services. Existing law provides that participation in the supplemental reimbursement program by an eligible provider is voluntary, and requires the nonfederal share of the supplemental reimbursement to be paid only with funds from specified governmental entities. This bill would authorize the department to provide supplemental reimbursement under these provisions for the cost of paramedic services at a rate of payment equal to cost. This bill would also require the department to design and implement an intergovernmental transfer (IGT) program in order to increase capitation payments to Medi-Cal managed care plans for covered ground emergency medical transportation services, as specified. The bill would require the department to implement the IGT program on January 1, July 1, 2016, or a later date if otherwise required pursuant to any necessary federal approvals obtained. The bill would provide that participation in the IGTs is voluntary on the part of the transferring entity and would require Medi-Cal managed care plans to pay 100 of any amount of increased capitation payments made to eligible providers for providing and making available ground emergency medical transportation services. services, and would permit, to the extent federal approval is obtained, the increased capitation payments to commence for dates of services on or after January 1, 2016."
