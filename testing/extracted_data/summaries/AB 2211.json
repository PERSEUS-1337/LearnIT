    "title": "An act to amend Sections 488.080, 699.080, and 706.108 of the Code of Civil Procedure, relating to civil procedure.",
    "content": "Existing law establishes a process for the enforcement of money judgments, and authorizes a registered process server to levy under a writ of attachment or writ of execution on specified types of property. Existing law requires the registered process server, before levying under the writ, to deposit a copy of the writ with the levying officer and pay a specified fee. Existing law also permits a registered process server to serve an earnings withholding order on an employer and requires that the process server deposit specified documents with the levying officer and pay a specified fee. This bill would provide that the registered process server is authorized to have the required documents and fee delivered to the levying officer by someone other than the process server himself or herself."
