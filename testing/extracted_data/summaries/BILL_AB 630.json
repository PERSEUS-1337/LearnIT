    "title": "AB 630",
    "content": "The California Constitution requires Members of the Legislature, and all public officers and employees, to take and subscribe a specified oath of office or affirmation. The California Constitution permits inferior officers and employees to be exempted by law from this requirement. Existing law, in the case of particular officers, requires the oath, after being administered, to be filed in designated offices. This bill would authorize a county board of supervisors to require a new oath or affirmation to be filed within 10 days of a legal change in name, delegated authority, or department by an officer or department head of that county. The bill would authorize the county to maintain a record, subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act, of each person so required to file a new oath of office, indicating whether or not the person has complied. The bill would specify that failure to comply with this requirement for a new oath or affirmation is not punishable as a crime. This bill would specify that the powers of an appointed officer of a county are no longer granted upon the officer\u2019s departure from office, and would authorize a county board of supervisors to require the appointing authority to rescind these powers in writing by filing a revocation in the same manner as the oath of office was filed. Existing law requires the oath or affirmation of disaster service workers to be filed in designated offices. This bill would authorize a county board of supervisors to require a new oath or affirmation to be filed within 10 days of a change in legal name by a disaster service worker of that county. The bill would authorize the county to maintain a record, subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act, of each person so required to file a new oath of office, indicating whether or not the person has complied. The bill would specify that failure to comply with this requirement for a new oath or affirmation is not punishable as a crime. Existing law requires the written appointment of a deputy of a county official to be filed as specified. This bill would authorize a county board of supervisors to require a new appointment to be filed within 10 days of a legal change in name, delegated authority, or department by an appointed deputy of that county. The bill would authorize the county to maintain a record, subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act, of each person so required to file a new oath of office, indicating whether or not the person has complied. Violating an oath or affirmation is a crime. Because this bill would expand the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
