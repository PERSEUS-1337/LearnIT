    "content": "Feedforward convolutional neural network has achieved a great success in many computer vision tasks. While it validly imitates the hierarchical structure of biological visual system, it still lacks one essential architectural feature: contextual recurrent connections with feedback, which widely exists in biological visual system. In this work, we designed a Contextual Recurrent Convolutional Network with this feature embedded in a standard CNN structure. We found that such feedback connections could enable lower layers to ``rethink\" about their representations given the top-down contextual information. We carefully studied the components of this network, and showed its robustness and superiority over feedforward baselines in such tasks as noise image classification, partially occluded object recognition and fine-grained image classification. We believed this work could be an important step to help bridge the gap between computer vision models and real biological visual system. It has been long established that the primate's ventral visual system has a hierarchical structure BID5 including early (V1, V2), intermediate (V4), and higher (IT) visual areas. Modern deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition BID10 BID18 trained on large image data sets like ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) imitate this hierarchical structure with multiple layers. There is a hierarchical correspondence between internal feature representations of a deep CNN's different layers and neural representations of different visual areas BID3 BID25 ; lower visual areas (V1, V2) are best explained by a deep CNN's internal representations from lower layers (Cadena et al., 2017; Khaligh-Razavi & Kriegeskorte, 2014) and higher areas (IT, V4) are best explained by its higher layers (Khaligh-Razavi & Kriegeskorte, 2014; BID24 . Deep CNNs explain neuron responses in ventral visual system better than any other model class BID25 BID9 , and this success indicates that deep CNNs share some similarities with the ventral visual system, in terms of architecture and internal feature representations BID25 .However , there is one key structural component that is missing in the standard feedforward deep CNNs: contextual feedback recurrent connections between neurons in different areas BID5 . These connections greatly contribute to the complexity of the visual system, and may be essential for the success of the visual systems in reality; for example, there are evidences that recurrent connections are crucial for object recognition under noise, clutter, and occlusion BID14 BID19 BID15 .In this paper, we explored a variety of model with different recurrent architectures, contextual modules, and information flows to understand the computational advantages of feedback circuits. We are interested in understanding what and how top-down and bottom-up contextual information can be combined to improve in performance in visual tasks. We investigated VGG16 BID18 , a standard CNN that coarsely approximate the ventral visual hierarchical stream, and its recurrent variants for comparison. To introduce feedback recurrent connections, we divided VGG16's layers into stages and selectively added feedback connections from the groups' highest layers to their lowest layers. At the end of each feedback connection, there is a contextual module (Section 3.2) that refines the bottom-up input with gated contextual information. We tested and compared several networks with such contextual modules against VGG16 in several standard image classification task, as well as visual tasks in which refinement under feedback guidance is more likely to produce some beneficial effects, such as object recognition under degraded conditions (noise, clutter and occlusion) and fine-grained recognition. We found that our network could outperform all the baseline feedforward networks and surpassed them by a large margin in finegrained and occlusion tasks. We also studied the internal feature representations of our network to illustrate the effectiveness of the structure. While much future work has to be done , our work can still be an important step to bridge the gap between biological visual systems and state-of-the-art computer vision models. In this paper, we proposed a novel Contextual Recurrent Convolutional Network. Based on the recurrent connections between layers in the hierarchy of a feedforward deep convolutional neural network, the new network can show some robust properties in some computer vision tasks compared with its feedforward baseline. Moreover, the network shares many common properties with biological visual system. We hope this work will not only shed light on the effectiveness of recurrent connections in robust learning and general computer vision tasks, but also give people some inspirations to bridge the gap between computer vision models and real biological visual system."
