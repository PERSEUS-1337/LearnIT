    "title": "An act to amend Section 12990 of the Government Code, relating to discrimination.",
    "content": "Existing law subjects an employer who is, or wishes to become, a contractor with the state for public works, or for goods or services, to various nondiscrimination requirements. Existing law authorizes requiring an employer to submit a nondiscrimination program to the Department of Fair Employment and Housing for approval and certification prior to becoming a contractor or subcontractor with the state, as well as requiring the provision of periodic reports of contractor or subcontractor compliance with that program. Existing law authorizes a contractor or subcontractor to file an affirmative action, equal employment, or nondiscrimination program subject to review and approval by a federal compliance agency with the department in lieu of that nondiscrimination program. This bill would enact the Equal Pay for Equal Work Act of 2016. The bill would require an employer with a contract with the state that amounts to $50,000 or more that either is required by federal regulations to submit an EEO-1 report to the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or has 100 or more employees in the state to submit a nondiscrimination program to the department and to submit periodic reports of its compliance with that program, no more than annually, on a schedule to be determined by the department. The bill would require the department to make these programs and reports available to the Commission on the Status of Women and Girls. The bill would authorize the department to require approval and certification of the program. The bill would permit the department to require other employers to comply with those program and report submission requirements. The bill would require the department to define an employee for these purposes. The bill would require the nondiscrimination program to include policies and procedures designed to ensure equal employment opportunities for all applicants and employees, a description of employment selection procedures, and employee compensation data, as specified. The bill would specify that a contractor or subcontractor may submit an EEO-1 report subject to review by the EEOC with the department in lieu of the nondiscrimination program. The bill would specify that its provisions are not to be construed to negate certain exemptions established by regulation that predate its enactment or to require the department to reevaluate the validity of these exemptions, as specified. The bill would make a statement of legislative findings."
