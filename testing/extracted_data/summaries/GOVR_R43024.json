    "content": "Cuba remains a one-party communist state with a poor record on human rights. The country's political succession in 2006 from the long-ruling Fidel Castro to his brother Ra\u00fal was characterized by a remarkable degree of stability. In February 2013, Castro was reappointed to a second five-year term as President (until 2018, when he would be 86 years old), and selected 52-year old former Education Minister Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel as his First Vice President, making him the official successor in the event that Castro cannot serve out his term. Ra\u00fal Castro has implemented a number of gradual economic policy changes over the past several years, including an expansion of self-employment. A party congress held in April 2011 laid out numerous economic goals that, if implemented, could significantly alter Cuba's state-dominated economic model. Few observers, however, expect the government to ease its tight control over the political system. While the government reduced the number of political prisoners in 2010-2011, the number increased in 2012; moreover, short-term detentions and harassment have increased significantly over the past several years. U.S. Policy Congress has played an active role in shaping policy toward Cuba, including the enactment of legislation strengthening and at times easing various U.S. economic sanctions. While U.S. policy has consisted largely of isolating Cuba through economic sanctions, a second policy component has consisted of support measures for the Cuban people, including U.S. government-sponsored broadcasting (Radio and TV Mart\u00ed) and support for human rights and democracy projects. For most of the Obama Administration's first six years, it continued this similar dual-track approach. While the Administration lifted all restrictions on family travel and remittances in 2009, eased restrictions on other types of purposeful travel in 2011, and moved to reengage Cuba on several bilateral issues, it also maintained most U.S. economic sanctions in place. On human rights, the Administration welcomed the release of many political prisoners in 2010 and 2011, but it also criticized Cuba's continued harsh repression of political dissidents through thousands of short-term detentions and targeted violence. The Administration continued to call for the release of U.S. government subcontractor Alan Gross, imprisoned in Cuba in 2009, and maintained that Gross's detention remained an impediment to more constructive relations. Just after the adjournment of the 113th Congress, however, President Obama announced on December 17, 2014, that Cuba was releasing Alan Gross on humanitarian grounds and unveiled major changes in U.S. policy toward Cuba, including a restoration of diplomatic relations and new efforts toward engagement. The President maintained that the United States would continue to raise concerns about democracy and human rights in Cuba, but that \"we can do more to support the Cuban people and promote our values through engagement.\" Legislative Activity Strong interest in Cuba continued in the 113th Congress with attention focused on economic and political developments, especially the human rights situation, and U.S. policy toward the island nation, including sanctions. The continued imprisonment of Alan Gross remained a key concern for many Members. In March 2013, Congress completed action on full-year FY2013 appropriations with the approval of H.R. 933 (P.L. 113-6); in January 2014, it completed action on a FY2014 omnibus appropriations measure, H.R. 3547 (P.L. 113-76); and in December 2014, it completed action on a FY2015 omnibus appropriations measure (H.R. 83; P.L. 113-235)\u2014all of these measures continued funding for Cuba democracy projects and Cuba broadcasting (Radio and TV Mart\u00ed). Both the House and Senate versions of the FY2014 Financial Services and General Government appropriations measure, H.R. 2786 and S. 1371, had provisions that would have tightened and eased travel restrictions respectively, but none of these provisions were included in the FY2014 omnibus appropriations measure (P.L. 113-76). The House version of the FY2015 Financial Services and General Government Appropriation bill, H.R. 5016 (H.Rept. 113-508), had a provision that would have prohibited the use of funds to approve, license, facilitate, or allow people-to-people travel, but the provision was not included in the FY2015 omnibus appropriations measure (P.L. 113-235). Several other initiatives on Cuba were introduced in the 113th Congress, but no action was taken on these bills and resolutions. Several would have lifted or eased U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba: H.R. 214 and H.R. 872 (overall embargo); H.R. 871 (travel); and H.R. 873 (travel and agricultural exports). H.R. 215 would have allowed Cubans to play organized professional baseball in the United States. H.R. 1917 would have lifted the embargo and extended nondiscriminatory trade treatment to the products of Cuba after Cuba released Alan Gross from prison. Identical initiatives, H.R. 778/S. 647 would have modified a 1998 trademark sanction; in contrast, H.R. 214, H.R. 872, H.R. 873, and H.R. 1917 each had a provision that would have repealed the sanction. H.Res. 121 would have honored the work of Cuban blogger Yoani S\u00e1nchez. H.Res. 262 would have called for the immediate extradition or rendering of all U.S. fugitives from justices in Cuba. With regard to President Obama's December 2014 announcement of a new direction for policy toward Cuba, some Members of Congress lauded the initiative as in the best interests of the United States and a better way to support change in Cuba, while other Members strongly criticized the President for not obtaining concessions from Cuba to advance human rights. With some Members vowing to oppose the Administration's efforts toward normalization, the direction of U.S.-Cuban relations is likely to be hotly debated in the 114th Congress. This report reflects legislative activity through the 113th Congress and will not be updated; a new version of the report will be issued for the 114th Congress.
