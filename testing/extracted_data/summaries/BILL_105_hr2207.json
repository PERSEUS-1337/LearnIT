    "content": "Coastal Pollution Reduction Act of 1997 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require the owner or operator of the Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, publicly owned treatment works, in order to be eligible to apply for a waiver of secondary treatment requirements, to transmit to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency the results of a study of the marine environment of coastal areas in the Mayaguez area to determine the feasibility of constructing a deep ocean outfall for the treatment works. Authorizes the owner or operator of such treatment works to submit an application for modification of secondary treatment requirements. Prohibits the filing of such application unless the applicant has entered into a binding consent decree with the United States that includes certain minimum requirements for schedules of compliance, milestones, and a commitment to contribute a minimum amount to the Mayaguez Watershed Initiative. Bars the Administrator from granting a modification unless the outfall will use a well-designed and operated diffuser that discharges into unstressed ocean waters and is situated so as to avoid discharge to coral reefs, sensitive marine resources or recreational areas, and shorelines. Makes a modification effective only if the outfall is operational within four and a half years of the date of the Administrator's initial determination on the application. Permits certain grants for the development of estuary conservation and management plans to be used for the implementation of plans as well. Extends the authorization of appropriations for the National Estuary Program through FY 1998."
