    "content": "On October 6, conferees reached agreement on the FY2000 defense appropriations bill, H.R. 2561 , and the conference report was filed on October 8. The House approved theconference agreement by a vote of 372-55 on October 13, and the Senate approved it by a vote of87 to 11 on October 14, and the President signed the bill into law, P.L. 106-79 , on October 25. Thekey issue in the conference concerned funding for the F-22 fighter. The conference agreementprovides a total of $2.522 billion for the program, including $1.222 billion for R&D, $1 billion foracquisition of test aircraft, and $300 million in advance FY2001 appropriations for programtermination liability. The total amount is about $500 million below the request ($1.85 billion inprocurement and $1.2 billion in R&D). The conference agreement also prohibits award of an initiallow-rate production contract unless certain testing is successfully completed. Aside from the F-22, major issues in the FY2000 defense debate included whether to approve a new round of military base closures, how much to provide for military pay and benefits, whetherto impose constraints on funding for U.S. military operations in Kosovo, how to fund theater missiledefense programs, and how to respond to security lapses at Department of Energy (DOE) weaponslabs. The conference agreement on the defense authorization bill does not approve a new round ofmilitary base closures. It provides somewhat larger increases in pay and benefits than theAdministration had requested, including a 4.8% pay raise in 2000 and increased retirement benefits,though it does not include a Senate-passed provision to expand Montgomery GI Bill benefits. Although Congress approved supplemental FY1999 appropriations for Kosovo operations, theAdministration's policy remains controversial. The House removed a provision from the defenseauthorization bill prohibiting funds to be used for future operations in Kosovo, but only after theAdministration agreed to seek supplemental appropriations to cover costs of a peacekeeping missionin FY2000. Earlier in the year, both houses approved bills calling for deployment of a nationwidemissile defense, but funding for theater missile defense programs was a matter of dispute. Theauthorization conference agreement establishes an independent organization within DOE to overseesecurity, and the President objected to these provisions even as he signed the bill into law. Finally, the level of defense spending was resolved only at the very end of the appropriations process. The Senate-passed appropriations bill used about $4.9 billion of funds provided in theKosovo supplemental appropriations bill as an offset for defense increases and provided a net totalof $264.7 billion, $1.4 billion above the request. The House bill provided $268.7 billion in newbudget authority, $5.4 billion above the request and $4.0 billion above the Senate level. Theappropriations conference agreement provides $267.8 billion in FY2000, of which $7.2 billion isdesignated as emergency appropriations. Key Policy Staff"
