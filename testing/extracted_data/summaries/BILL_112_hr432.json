    "content": "Ban Poisonous Additives Act of 2011 - Deems a food to be adulterated if its container: (1) is composed, in whole or in part, of bisphenol A, or (2) can release bisphenol A into food. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to grant one-year renewable waivers to a facility for a particular container if such facility: (1) demonstrates that it is not technologically feasible to replace bisphenol A in the container or to use an alternative container that does not contain bisphenol A, and (2) submits to the Secretary a plan and timeline for removing bisphenol A from such container. Sets forth labeling requirements for a product granted a waiver. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (FDA), to review substances in order determine whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to such substance, taking into consideration potential adverse effects from low dose exposure and the effects on vulnerable populations and populations with high exposure. Sets forth remedial actions based on the Secretary's determination. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require a manufacturer or supplier of a food contact substance to notify the Secretary of the identity and intended use of any such substance prior to its introduction into interstate commerce and of its determination that: (1) no adverse health effects result from low-dose exposures to such substance. And (2) such substance has not been shown, after tests which are appropriate for the evaluation of the safety of food contact substances, to cause reproductive or developmental toxicity in humans or animals."
