    "content": "Bisti-De-Na-Zin Wilderness Expansion and Fossil Forest Protection Act - Amends the San Juan Wilderness Protection Act of 1984 to incorporate additional lands in New Mexico into the BistiDe-Na-Zin Wilderness. Withdraws such lands from all forms of appropriation under the mining laws and from disposition under laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing and mineral material sales. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue coal leases in New Mexico in exchange for any preference right coal lease application on such lands after a determination has been made by the Secretary that the applicant is entitled to a preference right lease and that the exchange is in the public interest. Provides for the exchange of State and Navajo Indian lands located in the wilderness for other lands. Establishes the Fossil Forest Research Natural Area within New Mexico. Makes such area subject to the same withdrawal requirements and coal preference rights as the wilderness area designated under this Act. Prohibits livestock grazing in the Area. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, to develop a baseline inventory of all categories of fossil resources within the Area and to conduct monitoring surveys. Requires the Secretary to submit a management plan for the Area to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs to include: (1) a plan for the implementation of a cooperative program with other agencies for laboratory and field interpretation and public education, (2) provisions for vehicle management, (3) procedures for the excavation and collection of fossil remains. And (4) mitigation and reclamation standards for activities that disturb the surface to the detriment of scenic and environmental values."
