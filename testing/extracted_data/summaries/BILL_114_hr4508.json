And the amount determined by the Department of Labor eight years after such date and annually thereafter.

The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an employer who pays at least $1 more per hour than the federal minimum wage, but not more than $15 per hour, a credit against the employment tax equal to 6.2 of wages paid by such employer during the calendar year."
