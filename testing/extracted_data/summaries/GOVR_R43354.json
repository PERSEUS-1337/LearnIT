    "content": "Broadly understood, domestic content restrictions are provisions which require that items purchased using specific funds appropriated or otherwise made available by Congress be produced or manufactured in the United States. Federal law contains a number of such restrictions, each of which applies to different entities and supplies, and imposes somewhat different requirements. Some of these restrictions have, however, been waived pursuant to the Trade Agreements Act (TAA). The Buy American Act of 1933 is the earliest and arguably the best known of the major domestic content restrictions. It generally requires federal agencies to purchase \"domestic end products\" and use \"domestic construction materials\" on contracts exceeding the micro-purchase threshold (typically $3,500) performed in the United States. Unmanufactured end products or construction materials qualify as \"domestic\" if they are mined or produced in the United States. Manufactured ones are treated as \"domestic\" if they are manufactured in the United States, and either (1) the cost of components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50% of the cost of all components, or (2) the items are commercially available off-the-shelf items. Agencies may, however, purchase \"foreign\" supplies in exceptional circumstances (purchase of domestic goods or use of domestic construction materials would be \"impracticable\"). The TAA permits the President to waive the application of domestic content restrictions that would discriminate against \"eligible\" products or suppliers from countries that have trade agreements with the United States or meet certain other criteria. The Buy American Act is one restriction that has been so waived. This means that certain federal agencies must generally treat end products or construction materials that have been wholly grown, produced, or manufactured in designated countries, or that have been \"substantially transformed\" into new and different articles within designated countries using materials from other countries, the same as domestic ones when acquiring goods or services whose value exceeds certain monetary thresholds. The Berry Amendment, as currently codified in 10 U.S.C. \u00a72533a, requires that food, clothing, tents, certain textile fabrics and fibers, and hand or measuring tools purchased by the Department of Defense (DOD) using appropriated or other funds be entirely grown, reprocessed, reused, or produced within the United States, with certain exceptions (e.g., procurements by vessels in foreign waters). Until 2006, the Berry Amendment also required that any \"specialty metals\" (certain types of steel and metal alloys) contained in aircrafts, missile and space systems, ships, tank and automotive items, weapon systems, ammunition, or any components thereof, purchased by DOD be melted or produced in the United States, with certain exceptions. However, that prohibition has since been codified in 10 U.S.C. \u00a72533b. The Buy America Act is the name commonly given to domestic content restrictions imposed on states, localities, and other nonfederal entities as a condition of receiving specific grant funds administered by the Department of Transportation (DOT) and certain other federal agencies. The nature of the restrictions can vary depending upon the funds involved. However, by way of example, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7313 generally requires recipients of Title 23 funding to use in funded projects steel and iron produced in the United States, as well as manufactured products consisting \"predominantly\" of steel and iron that were produced in the United States, with certain exceptions (e.g., materials needed are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities of satisfactory quality). There are also a number of other domestic content restrictions that apply in specific contexts and, in many cases, are intended to address perceived \"gaps\" left by the four major domestic content regimes noted above."
