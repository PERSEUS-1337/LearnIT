    "content": "In April and May 2001, the Bush Administration proposed $882.29 million in FY2002 economic and counter-narcotics assistance, as well as extension of trade preferences and othermeasures, for Colombia and regional neighbors in an initiative called the \"Andean RegionalInitiative\" (ARI). Critics of the Andean Regional Initiative argue that it is a continuation of what they regard as the misguided approach of Plan Colombia assistance approved in 2000, with an overemphasis onmilitary and counter-drug assistance, and with inadequate support for human rights and the peaceprocess in Colombia. Supporters argue that it continues needed assistance to Colombia, whileproviding more support for regional neighbors and social and economic programs. In action on the FY2002 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill ( H.R. 2506 ), the House passed the bill on July 24, 2001, with $826 million for the ARI, of which $675 million is forthe counter-narcotics \"Andean Counterdrug Initiative\" (ACI) portion, a reduction of $56 millionfrom the President's ACI request. The Senate passed the bill on October 24, 2001, with $698 millionfor the ARI, of which $547 million is for the ACI, a reduction of $184 million from the President'sACI request. The conference version of H.R. 2506 , as approved by the House onDecember 19, and the Senate on December 20, includes $625 million for the ACI, $106 million lessthan the President's ACI request, with $215 million earmarked for AID programs and a variety ofconditions, including an alteration of the cap on military and civilian contractors serving inColombia. In February 2002 budget submissions, the Bush Administration allocated $645 millionto the ACI account for FY2002, including $20 million transferred from the general InternationalNarcotics Control account. In action on the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2002-FY2003, the House passed H.R. 1646 on May 16, 2001, with four reporting requirements on activities in Colombiaand a prohibition on the issuance of visas to illegal armed groups in Colombia. The Senate ForeignRelations Committee reported out S. 1401 on September 4, 2001, with a requirementfor a report that outlines a comprehensive strategy to eradicate all opium cultivation at its source inColombia. No further action occurred on either of these bills in the first session of the 107thCongress. In action on the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2002, the House passed H.R. 2586 on September 25, 2001, with a cap of 500 on the number of U.S. militarypersonnel in Colombia, with some exceptions.
