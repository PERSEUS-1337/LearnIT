    "title": "SB 1341",
    "content": "Existing law, as amended by Proposition 9, the Victim\u2019s Bill of Rights Act of 2008: Marsy\u2019s Law, at the November 4, 2008, statewide general election, authorizes the Board of Parole Hearings, after considering the views and interests of the victim, to advance a parole hearing that was set after a hearing at which parole was denied to an earlier date when a change in circumstances or new information establishes a reasonable likelihood that consideration of the public and victim\u2019s safety does not require the prisoner to serve the additional period of incarceration required as a result of the previously set hearing date. Marsy\u2019s Law authorizes the Legislature to amend its provisions by passing a statute with 34 of the membership of each house concurring, unless the amendments expand the scope of Marsy\u2019s Law\u2019s provisions, recognize additional rights of crime victims, or further the rights of crime victims, in which case the Legislature may amend its provisions by passing a statute with a majority vote of membership of each house concurring. This bill would prohibit the board from advancing a parole hearing to a date less than 2 years after a hearing at which parole was denied."
