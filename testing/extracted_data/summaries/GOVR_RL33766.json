    "content": "As part of the implementation for the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round, the Department of Defense (DOD) required the military departments and defense agencies to create action plans for each of the BRAC Commission's recommendations. These plans, called \"Business Plans\", describe the implementing actions, their timing, cost, and other related issues. DOD is to use these plans as a mechanism to ensure proper coordination among the defense agencies, allocate BRAC resources more efficiently, and to monitor the status of the commission's recommendations. To date, 219 of the 237required plans have been completed and approved. This report answers frequently asked questions regarding the plans. It will be updated as necessary."
