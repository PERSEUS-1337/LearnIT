    "content": "Plan Colombia was developed by former President Pastrana (1998-2002) as a six-year planto end Colombia's long armed conflict, eliminate drug trafficking, and promote economic and socialdevelopment. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) is the primary U.S. program that supportsPlan Colombia. In addition, Colombia receives assistance from the Foreign Military Financing(FMF) program and the Department of Defense's central counternarcotics account. ACI funding forPlan Colombia from FY2000 through FY2005 totals approximately $2.8 billion. When FMF andDOD assistance is included, the total level of U.S. support to Colombia is $4.5 billion. Congressapproved the Administration's request to continue support for Plan Colombia beyond FY2005, butit also expressed the need for an evaluation of progress and a plan for future years. The objectives of Colombia and the United States differ in some aspects, although there isa significant overlap of goals. The primary U.S. objective is to prevent the flow of illegal drugs intothe United States, as well as to help Colombia promote peace and economic development becauseit contributes to regional security in the Andes. The primary objectives of Colombia are to promotepeace and economic development, increase security, and end drug trafficking. Both U.S. andColombian objectives have also evolved over time from a strict counternarcotics focus to encompasscounterterrorism activities. Because Plan Colombia is a six-year plan that expired at the end of 2005, Congress has beenand will likely continue assessing its progress in light of the Administration's request to continuefunding the ACI account, the latter having no statutory end-date. Congress has expressed theexpectation that funding would begin to decrease in FY2006. Some Members have also expressedthe opinion that the ratio between interdiction and alternative development should become morebalanced, and that the U.S. role should diminish as Colombia develops more operational capabilities. Measurable progress in Colombia's internal security has been made, as indicated by decreasesin violence and the eradication of drug crops. After many years of stable prices, purity, andavailability of cocaine and heroin in the United States, prices for both drugs have increased, whereaspurity and availability have decreased. Military operations against illegally armed groups haveintensified, but the main leftist guerrilla group seems no closer to agreeing to a cease-fire. Thedemobilization of rightist paramilitary fighters is proceeding, but its is doing so amid controversywith regard to its implementation.
