    "content": "Department of Veterans Affairs Nurses Appreciation Act of 1999 - Amends Federal provisions relating to the pay of health care personnel within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide that, effective October 1, 1999, pay adjustments for registered nurses and certain other positions within the VHA shall be made in the same manner as those generally applicable to Federal employees. Provides that, effective October 1, 2002, whenever the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines that such rates of pay are inadequate to recruit or retain high-quality health care personnel at such a facility, the Secretary shall adjust such pay to achieve consistency with the rate of compensation for corresponding health-care professionals in the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor market area of that facility."
