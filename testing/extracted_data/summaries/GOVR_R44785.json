    "content": "In January 2017, the House and Senate adopted a budget resolution for FY2017 (S.Con.Res. 3), which reflects an agreement between the chambers on the budget for FY2017 and sets forth budgetary levels for FY2018-FY2026. S.Con.Res. 3 also includes reconciliation instructions directing specific committees to develop and report legislation that would change laws within their respective jurisdictions to reduce the deficit. These instructions trigger the budget reconciliation process, which may allow certain legislation to be considered under expedited procedures. The reconciliation instructions included in S.Con.Res. 3 direct two committees in each chamber to report legislation within their jurisdictions that would reduce the deficit by $1 billion over the period FY2017-FY2026. In the House, the Committee on Ways and Means and the Energy and Commerce Committee are directed to report. In the Senate, the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions are directed to report. In response to the reconciliation instructions, there was activity in four different House committees\u2014Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, Budget, and Rules\u2014during the first quarter of 2017. The result of this activity was H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act (AHCA) of 2017. The version of the AHCA as passed by the House on May 4, 2017 (which incorporated eight amendments referenced in H.Res. 228 and H.Res. 308), is the topic of this report. The bill includes a number of provisions that would repeal or modify parts of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148, as amended). For example, the bill would repeal the ACA's cost-sharing subsidies for lower-income individuals who purchase health insurance through the exchanges, and it would substitute the ACA's premium tax credit for a tax credit with different eligibility rules and calculation requirements. The bill also would repeal some of the ACA's Medicaid provisions, such as the changes the ACA made to presumptive eligibility and the state option to provide Medicaid coverage to non-elderly individuals with income above 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL). The AHCA also includes a number of provisions that do not specifically relate to aspects of the ACA. For example, the bill would establish a late-enrollment penalty for certain individuals who do not maintain health insurance coverage, and it would create a new fund to provide funding to states for specified activities intended to improve access to health insurance and health care in the state. The bill would convert Medicaid financing to a per capita cap model (i.e., per enrollee limits on federal payments to states) starting in FY2020, and states would have the option to receive block grant funding (i.e., a predetermined fixed amount of federal funding) instead of per capita cap funding for non-elderly, nondisabled, non-expansion adults and children starting in FY2020. This report contains three tables that, together, provide an overview of all the AHCA provisions. Table 1 includes provisions that apply to the private health insurance market, Table 2 includes provisions that affect the Medicaid program, and Table 3 includes provisions related to public health and taxes. Each table contains a column identifying whether the AHCA provision is related to an ACA provision (e.g., whether the AHCA provision repeals an ACA-related provision). In addition to the three tables, the report includes more detailed summaries of each AHCA provision and two graphics showing the effective dates of AHCA provisions. Figure 1 covers AHCA provisions related to the private health insurance market, public health, and taxes. Figure 2 covers AHCA provisions related to the Medicaid program. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) issued a cost estimate for the AHCA, as passed by the House on May 4, 2017. According to the estimate, the AHCA would reduce federal deficits by $119 billion over the period FY2017-FY2026. With respect to effects on health insurance coverage, CBO and JCT project that, in CY2018, 14 million more people would be uninsured under the AHCA than under current law, and in CY2026, 23 million more people would be uninsured than under current law."
