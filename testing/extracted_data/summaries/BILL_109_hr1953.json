    "content": "San Francisco Old Mint Commemorative Coin Act - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue not more than 100,000 $5 gold coins and 500,000 $1 silver coins emblematic of the San Francisco Old Mint Building, its importance to California and US history, and its role in rebuilding San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake and fire. Sets forth: (1) coin specifications, (2) design requirements. And (3) guidelines for coin sales. Requires a surcharge of $35 for the $5 coin and of $10 for the $1 coin. Requires that all surcharges received by the Secretary from such coin sales be promptly paid to the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society to rehabilitate the Historic Old Mint in San Francisco as a city museum and an American Coin and Gold Rush Museum. Prohibits a surcharge with respect to the issuance of any coin under this Act during a calendar year if such issuance would result in the number of commemorative coin programs issued during such year to exceed the annual two commemorative coin program issuance limitation under specified law. Permits the Secretary of the Treasury to continue to issue, after December 31, 2005, numismatic items that contain 5-cent coins minted in the years 2004 and 2005."
