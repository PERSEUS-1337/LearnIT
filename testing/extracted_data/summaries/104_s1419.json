    "title": "Nigeria Democracy Act",
    "content": "Nigeria Democracy Act - Imposes certain economic sanctions against Nigeria to promote democracy and human rights there. Directs the President to notify Nigeria immediately of his intention to suspend air transportation between the United States and such country. Urges the President to seek multilateral support for an international embargo on the sale of arms to, and sale of crude oil or refined petroleum products from, Nigeria. Authorizes waiver of such sanctions if the President certifies to the Congress that: (1) Nigeria has released all political prisoners and demonstrated a commitment to respecting internationally-recognized human rights and civilian, democratic government. Or (2) such waiver is important to the national interest. Declares the sense of the Congress that the United States should impose additional measures against the Government of Nigeria if substantial progress has not been made within three months after enactment of this Act toward the establishment of civilian, democratic government and respect for internationally recognized human rights. Requires a progress report from the President to the Congress, including specified recommendations if progress has not been made."
