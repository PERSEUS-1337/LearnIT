    "content": "The Congressional Budget Act establishes the budget resolution as a central coordinating mechanism for budgetary decision making. The budget resolution sets forth aggregate levels of spending, revenue, and public debt. It is not intended to establish details of spending or revenue policy and does not provide levels of spending for specific agencies or programs. Instead, its purpose is to create enforceable parameters within which Congress can consider legislation dealing with spending and revenue. The spending policies in the budget resolution encompass two types of spending legislation: discretionary spending and direct (mandatory) spending. Discretionary spending is controlled through the appropriations process. Appropriations legislation is considered each fiscal year and provides funding for numerous programs such as national defense, education, and homeland security. Direct spending, alternately, is provided for in legislation outside of appropriations acts. Direct spending programs are typically established in permanent law and continue in effect until such time as revised or terminated by another law. The FY2010 budget resolution establishes congressional priorities by dividing spending among 21 major functional categories. These 21 categories do not correspond to the committee system by which Congress operates, and as a result these spending levels must be \"crosswalked\" to the House and Senate committees having jurisdiction over both discretionary and direct spending. These amounts are known as 302(a) allocations and hold committees accountable for staying within the spending limits established by the budget resolution. The House Budget Committee approved its budget resolution (H.Con.Res. 85) on March 25, 2009, on a 24-15 vote. The Senate Budget Committee approved its budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 13) the next day on a 13-10 vote. The House (on a 233-196 vote) and Senate (on a 55-43 vote) agreed to their versions of the budget resolution on April 2, 2009. The conference agreement on the budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 13) was passed in the House (on a 233-193 vote) and in the Senate (on a 53-43 vote) on April 29, 2009. This report summarizes some of the major provisions of S.Con.Res. 13, including overall spending and revenue totals, reconciliation instructions, and policy assumptions. It will be updated as circumstances warrant."
