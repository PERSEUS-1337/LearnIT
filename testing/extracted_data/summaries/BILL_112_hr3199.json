    "content": "Requires the Assistant Administrator of the Office of Research and Development at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), prior to the implementation of any waiver, partial waiver, or decision pursuant to current law and no later than 45 days after this Act's enactment, to enter into an agreement with the National Academies to provide a comprehensive assessment of research on the implications of the use of mid-level ethanol blends . Recommends that the assessment compare mid-level ethanol blends to gasoline blends containing 10 and 0 ethanol. Requires such assessment to: (1) evaluate the environmental, safety, durability, and performance effects of the introduction of mid-level blends on onroad, nonroad, and marine engines, onroad and nonroad vehicles, and related equipment. And (2) identify research and development necessary to permit existing motor fuels infrastructure to handle mid-level ethanol blends while preventing or mitigating against adverse impacts such as corrosion of materials used in pipes or storage tanks, ensuring fuel fungiblity, and protecting against misfueling by users at various points in the distribution and supply chain."
