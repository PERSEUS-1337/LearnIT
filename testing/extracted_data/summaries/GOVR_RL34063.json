    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides benefits to veterans who meet certain eligibility rules. Benefits to veterans range from disability compensation and pensions to hospital and medical care. The VA provides these benefits through three major operating units: the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA). The VHA is primarily a direct service provider of primary care, specialized care, and related medical and social support services to veterans through the nation's largest integrated health-care system. On February 5, 2007, the President submitted his FY2008 budget proposal to Congress. The total amount requested by the Administration for the VHA for FY2008 was $34.6 billion, a 1.93% increase in funding compared with the FY2007 enacted amount. For FY2008, the Administration was requesting $27.2 billion for medical services, $3.4 billion for medical administration, $3.6 billion for medical facilities, and $411 million for medical and prosthetic research. On June 15, 2007, the House passed its version of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill (MILCON-VA appropriations bill) for FY2008 (H.R. 2642, H.Rept. 110-186). H.R. 2642 provided $37.1 billion for the VHA for FY2008. This amount included $29.0 billion for medical services, a $1.9 billion (6.9%) increase above the President's request. H.R. 2642 also included $3.5 billion for medical administration, $69 million above the Administration's request of $3.4 billion; $4.1 billion for medical facilities, a 14% increase over the President's request; and $480 million for medical and prosthetic research, a 17% increase over the President's request of $411 million. H.R. 2642 did not include any bill language authorizing fee increases as requested by the Administration's budget proposal for the VHA for FY2008. On September 6, 2007, the Senate passed MILCON-VA appropriations bill for FY2008 (H.R. 2642, S.Rept. 110-85) with an amendment.
