    "title": "To require the Secretary of State to submit to Congress a report on efforts to bring to justice the Palestinian terrorists who killed John Branchizio, Mark Parson, and John Marin Linde.",
    "content": "Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the Palestinian Authority's (PA) continued inability or unwillingness to pursue and bring to justice the Palestinian terrorists who killed John Branchizio, Mark Parson, and John Marin Linde calls into question the PA's suitability as a US partner in diplomatic efforts to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. (2) future US assistance to the PA may be suspended or conditioned, and the continued operation of the PLO Representative Office in Washington may be jeopardized, if the PA does not cooperate in bringing these individuals to justice. And (3) it is in the US national interest to safeguard diplomats and all embassy and consulate personnel, and to use the full power of the United States to bring to justice any individual or entity that threatens or harms them. Directs the Secretary of State, within 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act and every 120 days thereafter, to report to the appropriate congressional committees describing US and PA efforts to bring to justice the Palestinian terrorists who killed John Branchizio, Mark Parson, and John Marin Linde."
