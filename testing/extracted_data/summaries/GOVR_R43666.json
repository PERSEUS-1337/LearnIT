    "content": "On July 8, 2014, the Administration requested $4,346 million in FY2014 supplemental appropriations to address two issues: the surge in both unaccompanied and escorted children illegally crossing the southwest border, and a shortfall in federal funding to pay the costs of wildfires. The appropriations were requested to be designated as emergency funding, meaning the requested funds would not count against the discretionary budget caps for FY2014. On July 23, 2014, the Senate introduced S. 2648, which includes $3,571 million in supplemental appropriations for the Administration's requested purposes as well as for defense assistance to Israel. S. 2648 would designate the appropriations as an emergency, meaning they would not count against the discretionary budget caps for FY2014. On July 29, 2014, the House introduced H.R. 5230, which included $659 million in supplemental appropriations to address the situation at the southwest border. The legislation also included $659 million in rescissions that would offset the budgetary impact of the bill. An amended version of H.R. 5230, which includes an additional $35 million to defray the cost to states of National Guard deployments to the southern border, $35 million more in offsets, and a different set of policy provisions, passed the House 223-189 on August 1, 2014. The primary focus of this report is the Administration's request for supplemental appropriations, and the appropriations legislation considered in response to that request. Other policy-related provisions of the legislation will be analyzed in other CRS materials. This report will be updated as events warrant."
