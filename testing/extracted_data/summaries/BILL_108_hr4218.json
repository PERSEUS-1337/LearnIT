Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to: (1) establish the goals and priorities for Federal high-performance computing research, development, networking, and other activities. (2) establish Program Component Areas that implement such goals and identify the Grand Challenges that the Program should address. And (3) develop and maintain a research, development, and deployment road map for the provision of high-performance computing systems. Eliminates the requirement that the Director provide for interagency coordination of the Program. Revises requirements for annual reports by requiring that such reports: (1) describe Program Component Areas, including any changes in the definition of or activities under such Areas and the reasons for such changes, and describe Grand Challenges supported under the Program. (2) describe the levels of Federal funding and the levels proposed for each Program Component Area. (3) describe the levels of Federal funding for each agency and department participating in the Program for each such Area. And (4) include an analysis of the extent to which the Program incorporates the recommendations of the advisory committee on high-performance computing. Eliminates the requirement that such reports include reports from the Secretary of Energy on Department of Energy activities taken to carry out the National High-Performance Computing Program. Requires such advisory committee to: (1) provide the Director with an independent assessment of the balance between components of the Program, including funding levels for the Program Component Areas and whether the research and development undertaken pursuant to the Program is helping to maintain US leadership in high-performance computing and networking. And (2) conduct periodic evaluations of the funding, management, coordination, implementation, and activities of the Program, and report at least once every two fiscal years to specified congressional committees. Requires the Office of Management and Budget to identify each element of its high-performance computing activities which contributes directly to the Program Component Areas or benefits from the Program. Repeals requirements under the Act for the National Research and Education Network and the Next Generation Internet. Modifies provisions regarding responsibilities of the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Secretary of Energy, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency."
