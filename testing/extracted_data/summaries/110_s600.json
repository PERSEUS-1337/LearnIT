Requires SBHCs to: (1) provide services to children and adolescents for whom parental or guardian consent has been obtained. (2) provide on-site access during the academic day when school is in session and 24-hour coverage through an on-call system and backup health providers to ensure access to services on a year-round basis when the school or SBHC is closed. Allows the Secretary to: (1) give preference to applicants who demonstrate an ability to serve populations of children and adolescents that have historically demonstrated difficulty in accessing health and mental health services. And (2) waive certain requirements under this Act for a designated period. Requires the Secretary to establish a program to provide technical and other assistance to SBHCs."
