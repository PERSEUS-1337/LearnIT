    "content": "National Sea Grant College Program Amendments Act of 2015 This bill amends the National Sea Grant College Program Act to reauthorize through FY2021 the National Sea Grant College Program. The bill requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to award Dean John A. Knauss Marine Policy Fellowships. Currently, NOAA may give fellowships. Those fellowships support graduate students in fields related to ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources in positions with the executive and legislative branches. NOAA must give priority placement of those fellows placed in the legislative branch in: (1) offices or committees of Congress that have jurisdiction over NOAA. And (2) offices of Members of Congress that have a demonstrated interest in ocean, coastal, or Great Lakes resources. NOAA must attempt to ensure that placements are equitably distributed among political parties. NOAA must establish priorities for the use of donations given for the National Sea Grant College Program. The bill authorizes through FY2020 grants for university research on: (1) the biology, prevention, and control of aquatic nonnative species, (2) oyster diseases, oyster restoration, and oyster-related human health risks, (3) the biology, prevention, and forecasting of harmful algal blooms. And (4) sustainable aquaculture techniques and technologies. The bill also authorizes through FY2020 grants for: (1) fishery extension activities conducted by sea grant colleges or sea grant institutes to enhance existing core program funding, and (2) priority issues identified in the National Sea Grant College Program's strategic plan."
