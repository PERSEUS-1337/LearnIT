    "content": "Small Business Tax Credit Accessibility Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that the Obama Administration should work to make the small employer health care insurance tax credit more accessible for small employers. Amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the small employer health care insurance tax credit, to: (1) revise the definition of eligible small employer to mean an employer with not more than 50 full-time employees. (2) modify the phaseout formula for such credit to base such phaseout on number of employees and average annual wages, (3) allow a 35 credit in 2014nbsp. To small employers who purchase health care coverage outside of the Small Business Health Option Program. (4) extend from two to three consecutive taxable years the period during which an employer may claim such credit, (5)nbsp. Eliminate the requirement that employers contribute the same percentage of cost of each employee's health insurance and the cap limiting eligible employer contributions to average premiums paid to a state health insurance exchange. And (6) make such credit available to dependents of a small employer."
