    "content": "The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB, P.L. 107-110) established the Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) under Title VI, Part B of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). Congress created this program to address the unique needs of rural schools that disadvantage them relative to nonrural schools. To be eligible for REAP funds, a local education agency (LEA) must be designated rural and must meet one of three additional requirements involving enrollment size, population density, and poverty status. Currently, REAP provides awards to nearly 6,000 LEAs, out of a total of about 14,000 nationwide. REAP authorizes formula grants through two subprograms: the Small Rural School Achievement (SRSA) program provides grants directly to LEAs and the Rural Low-Income School (RLIS) program provides grants to states, which then award subgrants to LEAs. The amount of funds received by eligible LEAs is determined differently by the SRSA and RLIS programs. Under the SRSA program formula, an initial amount is calculated for each eligible LEA based on enrollment; these amounts are then reduced based on offsetting amounts received from other ESEA programs. Under RLIS, formula grants are awarded to states based on the state's share of eligible students; states then subgrant funds to LEAs either on a formula or competitive basis. REAP funds may be used for a wide range of activities authorized throughout the ESEA, including Titles I-A, II-A, II-D, III, IV-A, IV-B, and V-A. In addition, the so-called REAP-Flex provision (ESEA, Sec. 6211) allows SRSA-eligible LEAs to use ESEA funds for certain activities not authorized by the program through which the LEA received such funds. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) study found that a large majority of LEAs use REAP funds to meet the NCLB highly qualified teacher requirement as well as the district's technology needs. The authorization for REAP, along with the rest of the ESEA, expired at the end of FY2008. However, these programs continue to operate as long as appropriations are provided. Congress is expected to consider whether to amend and extend the ESEA programs, including REAP. This report will conclude with a discussion of reauthorization issues related to REAP that may arise as Congress takes up the ESEA."
