    "content": "Comprehensive Fentanyl Control Act This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to modify the definition of quot, controlled substance analoguequot. To mean a substance that has a similar chemical structure and pharmacological effect to a schedule I controlled substance. Additionally, it modifies the treatment of controlled substance analogues. Under current law, a controlled substance analogue that is intended for human consumption is treated as a schedule I controlled substance. This bill replaces the intended for human consumption qualifier with a not a chemical substance subject to the Toxic Substances Control Act qualifier. Specifically, a controlled substance analogue that is not a chemical substance under the Toxic Substances Control Act is treated as a schedule I controlled substance. The bill modifies the drug quantity thresholds that trigger a mandatory minimum prison term for a defendant who manufactures, distributes, or possesses with intent to distribute fentanyl. It also establishes a consecutive mandatory prison term for a defendant who commits a drug offense involving a detectable amount of heroin or fentanyl. The bill allows the Drug Enforcement Administration to temporarily place a substance into schedule I if it reasonably believes that the substance: (1) is a synthetic opioid analgesic, (2) is the object of clandestine importation, manufacture, or distribution. And (3) poses an imminent hazard to public health and safety. Finally, the bill makes it a crime to knowingly mail to an unauthorized person equipment that may be used to manufacture counterfeit controlled substances."
