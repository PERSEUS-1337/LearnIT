Existing law prescribes a civil penalty for a failure to comply with these requirements of $500 for a first offense and $1,000 for each subsequent offense. Under existing law, any person who deprives or violates the personal liberty of another with the intent to obtain forced labor or services is guilty of the crime of human trafficking.

The bill would require that, by January 1, 2018, the training be incorporated into the initial training process for all new employees and that all existing employees who do not receive an initial training also receive the training. The bill would require the Department of Justice to, by July 1, 2017, develop guidelines for the training and to post them on its Internet Web site.
