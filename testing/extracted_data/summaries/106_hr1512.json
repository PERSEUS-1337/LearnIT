    "title": "Child Safety Lock Act of 1999",
    "content": "Makes it unlawful for a licensed manufacturer, importer, or dealer to sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun without a locking device and specified warnings to any person other than a licensed manufacturer, importer, or dealer, with exceptions for law enforcement officers and governmental entities. Sets forth civil penalties for related violations, including suspension or loss of license. Title II: Regulatory Provisions - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe such regulations governing the design, manufacture, and performance of trigger lock devices as are necessary to reduce or prevent the unintentional discharge of handguns. Specifies that such regulations shall, at a minimum, set forth a minimum safety standard that such devices must meet in order to be manufactured, sold, transferred, or delivered consistent with this title. Requires the Secretary, in developing the standard, to consider such devices that are not detachable, but are permanently installed and incorporated into the design of a handgun. Directs that such standard include provisions to ensure that any such device that meets the standard is of adequate quality and construction to prevent children who have not attained age 18 from operating a handgun, and to ensure that such a product cannot be removed except through the use of a key, combination, or other method of access provided in the manufacturer's design specifications. Directs that the standard be issued in final form within 12 months. Authorizes the Secretary to issue an order prohibiting the manufacture, sale, transfer, or delivery of a trigger lock device which the Secretary finds has been designed, manufactured, transferred, or distributed in violation of this title. Grants the Secretary specified authority regarding: (1) requiring the recall, repair, replacement, or refund with respect to such devices. And (2) inspections to ascertain compliance. Authorizes the Secretary to assess a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per violation. Amends the Brady Act to authorize the Secretary, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to revoke the Federal firearms license if the holder of the license violates title II of this Act or any rule or regulation prescribed thereunder. Imposes criminal penalties upon anyone who has received from the Secretary a notice that the person has violated a provision of this title or a regulation prescribed under it and subsequently knowingly violates such provision. Allows State law to afford greater protection with respect to trigger lock devices. Title III: Education Provisions - Directs that a portion of firearms tax revenue be used for public education programs on the safe storage and use of firearms."
