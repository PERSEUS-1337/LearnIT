    "content": "Saving Access to Compounded Medications for Special Needs Patients Act This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow drugs to be compounded and distributed to practitioners for treatment of, or administration to, patients of that practitioner. Currently, drugs may be compounded only for identified individual patients. Compounded drugs must comply with United States Pharmacopeia standards. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the FDA and a state regarding compounded drugs no longer must address interstate distribution of inordinate amounts of compounded drugs. Such an MOU must not create an unfunded mandate on a state."
