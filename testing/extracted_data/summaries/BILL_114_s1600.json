    "content": "Judicial Redress Act of 2015 Authorizes the Department of Justice (DOJ) to designate foreign countries or regional economic integration organizations whose natural citizens may bring civil actions under the Privacy Act of 1974 against certain US government agencies for purposes of accessing, amending, or redressing unlawful disclosures of records maintained by an agency. Allows DOJ, with the concurrence of the Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Homeland Security, to designate countries or organizations whose citizens may pursue such civil remedies if the person's country or organization has appropriate privacy protections for sharing information with the United States to prevent, investigate, detect, or prosecute criminal offenses. Exempts DOJ's designations from judicial or administrative review. Grants the US District Court for the District of Columbia exclusive jurisdiction over any claim arising under this Act."
