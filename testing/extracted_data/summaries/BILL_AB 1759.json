    "title": "AB 1759",
    "content": "Existing law requires the State Air Resources Board to adopt airborne toxic control measures to reduce emissions of toxic air contaminants from nonvehicular sources. Existing law prescribes civil penalties for violations of specified air pollution control laws, rules, regulations, permits, or orders of the State Air Resources Board or of an air pollution control district or air quality management district. This bill would require an owner or operator of an oil refinery that uses hydrogen fluoride, hydrofluoric acid, or modified hydrofluoric acid in its operations to send out biannual notices to each business, school, child care facility, library, church, community facility, senior facility, and residence within a 3.5-mile radius of the refinery, as specified. The bill would require the cost of the notice to be paid by the owner or operator of the refinery. The bill would require the owner or operator to file a copy of the notice and distribution list with the State Air Resources Board. An owner or operator who violates these provisions would be subject to those civil penalties. Existing law generally regulates the management of hazardous waste. A violation of the hazardous waste control laws is a crime. This bill would require a business that, at any time, handles, maintains, or stores more than 250 gallons of hydrogen fluoride or hydrofluoric acid to, if possible, convert to a known, significantly less hazardous substitute by January 1, 2017. If that conversion is not possible and the business is located within 2 miles of a residential dwelling, the bill would require the business to cease handling, maintaining, or storing hydrogen fluoride and hydrofluoric acid by January 1, 2017. Because a violation of these requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."
