It is the sense of Congress that: the United States and Israel should enter into a production agreement that specifies the terms of coproduction, program schedule, and an itemization of costs for the David's Sling weapons program production. Such production agreement should strive for optimal coproduction of the David's Sling components. And reaching such a bilateral production agreement, which includes funds disbursement policy, should be a priority."
