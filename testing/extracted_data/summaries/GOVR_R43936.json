    "content": "From the earliest days of commercial radio, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and its predecessor, the Federal Radio Commission, have encouraged diversity in broadcasting. This concern has repeatedly been supported by the U.S. Supreme Court, which has affirmed that \"the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public,\" and that \"assuring that the public has access to a multiplicity of information sources is a governmental purpose of the highest order, for it promotes values central to the First Amendment.\" The FCC's policies seek to encourage four distinct types of diversity: (1) diversity of viewpoints, as reflected in the availability of media content reflecting a variety of perspectives; (2) diversity of programming, as indicated by a variety of formats and content; (3) outlet diversity, to ensure the presence of multiple independently owned media outlets within a geographic market; and (4) minority and female ownership of broadcast media outlets. In addition to promoting diversity, the FCC aims, with its broadcast media ownership rules, to promote localism and competition by restricting the number of media outlets that a single entity may own or control within a local geographic market. Two characteristics of broadcast television and broadcast radio stations determine whether or not media ownership rules are triggered: (1) the geographic range of their signals, and (2) the boundaries of their media markets as determined by the Nielsen Company, a market research firm. After first adopting rules limiting common ownership of multiple local radio stations, multiple local television stations, and multiple national broadcast networks in the 1940s, the FCC continued to expand and modify media ownership rules. It began to limit cross-ownership of radio and television stations in 1970, and cross-ownership of newspapers and television stations in 1975. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the FCC to review these rules every four years and repeal or modify those it no longer deems to be in the public interest. Following its most recent review, the FCC retained its media ownership rules in 2016, and readopted rules counting broadcast stations that jointly sell advertising time as commonly owned. Pending approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the FCC will require independently owned broadcast television stations to include resource-sharing agreements in their online public inspection files. In addition, as directed by the U.S. Court of Appeals, Third Circuit, the FCC reviewed its broadcast ownership diversity policies. It concluded that it did not believe the 1996 Telecommunications Act nor the Communications Act of 1934 requires it to adopt race- or gender-conscious measures in order to promote ownership diversity. In order to increase broadcast ownership diversity, FCC also reinstated rules enabling certain small businesses to abide by less restrictive media ownership and attribution rules, and more flexible licensing policies, than their counterparts. The newly approved media ownership and diversity rules took effect on December 1, 2016. The FCC's 2016 review occurred against the background of sweeping changes in news consumption patterns. Surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center show 20% of respondents citing printed newspapers as a source they \"read yesterday\" or used regularly in 2016, down from 50% in 1996. While the percentage of adults citing local broadcast television as a news source declined from 65% in 1996 to 46% in 2016, it still outranked other local news sources. These trends, along with increased consumption of news online, are contributing to debate in Congress as to whether common ownership of multiple media outlets in the same market might limit diversity of viewpoints as much today as 20 or 40 years ago."
