    "content": "Preserving Rehabilitation Innovation Centers Act of 2015 Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to study whether there should be an increase in the prospective payment rate for inpatient rehabilitation services that would otherwise be made to a rehabilitation innovation center to cover additional costs incurred in: (1) furnishing items and services to individuals conducting research, and (2) providing medical training. Requires the study also to specify the amount of such an increase if the Secretary determines that it is recommended. Directs the Secretary also to study the access by individuals to rehabilitation care in rural communities in states where there is no rehabilitation innovation center."
