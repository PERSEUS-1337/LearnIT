    "title": "AB 355",
    "content": "Existing law, the Unclaimed Property Law, governs the disposition of unclaimed property, including the escheat of certain property to the state. Existing law provides for the escheat to the state of the contents of, or proceeds of sale of the contents of, any safe deposit box or any other safekeeping repository held in the state by a business association, as specified. In cases where the contents of a safe deposit box or other safekeeping repository escheat to the state, existing law requires the business association to report to the Controller certain information regarding the property and owner, including a description of the property and the place where it is held and may be inspected by the Controller. Within 165 days after the final date for filing the report, existing law requires the Controller to mail a notice to each person having an address listed in the report who appears to be entitled to property escheated, as specified. This bill would additionally authorize the Controller to mail a separate notice to an apparent owner of a United States savings bond, war bond, or military award inside a safe deposit box or other safekeeping repository whose name is shown on or can be associated with the contents of a safe deposit box or other safekeeping repository and is different from the name of the reported owner."
