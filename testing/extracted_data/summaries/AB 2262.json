    "title": "An act to add Chapter 16 (commencing with Section 1425) to Title 10 of Part 2 of the Penal Code, relating to prisoners.",
    "content": "Existing law prohibits a person from being tried, adjudged to punishment, or having his or her probation, mandatory supervision, postrelease community supervision, or parole revoked while that person is mentally incompetent. Existing law establishes a process by which a defendant\u2019s mental competency is evaluated and by which the defendant receives treatment, including, if applicable, antipsychotic medication, with the goal of returning the defendant to competency. Existing law credits time spent by a defendant in a state hospital or other facility as a result of commitment during the process toward the term of any imprisonment for which the defendant is sentenced. Existing law, as added by Proposition 184, adopted November 8, 1994, and amended by Proposition 36, adopted November 6, 2012, commonly known as the Three Strikes Law, prohibits certain recidivist offenders from being committed to any facility other than a state prison. This bill would authorize, if a defendant has pled guilty or nolo contendere to, or been convicted of, an offense that will result in a sentence to state prison or county jail, the defendant or the prosecutor submit evidence that the defendant suffers from a diagnosable mental condition that was a substantial factor that contributed to the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct. The bill would require that the evidence be submitted after the defendant\u2019s conviction, but before his or her sentencing. The bill would require the court to consider any evidence submitted as described above in conjunction with the defendant\u2019s sentencing, and would authorize the court to order the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or county jail authority, as applicable, to place the defendant in a residential mental health treatment facility. This placement would not be available to a defendant who is subject to the Three Strikes Law. The bill would also authorize the court to order the department or jail authority to place the defendant in a mental health program within the state prison or county jail, respectively. The bill would provide that the defendant has the right to counsel for these proceedings. This bill would authorize a defendant who is or has been eligible for public mental health services due to a serious mental illness or who is eligible for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits due to a diagnosed mental illness to petition the court, after the defendant\u2019s plea or conviction but prior to sentencing, for a sentence that includes mental health treatment. The bill would authorize a court, if it finds that the defendant has shown that he or she meets the criteria by a preponderance of the evidence, to order the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or the county authority to provide specified mental health service, including placement in a residential mental health treatment facility instead of state prison or county jail, placement in a mental health program within the state prison or county jail, or preparation of a postrelease mental health treatment plan. The bill would authorize the court, upon petition of the defendant or the prosecution, to recall a sentence that includes a mental health order and resentence the defendant to other mental health treatment or resentence the defendant without mental health treatment. The bill would provide that the defendant has the right to counsel for these proceedings. By imposing additional duties upon county jail authorities, this bill would create a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
