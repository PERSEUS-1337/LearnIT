    "title": "An act to amend Section 12940 of, and to add Article 3 (commencing with Section 12958) to Chapter 6 of Part 2.8 of Division 3 of Title 2 of, the Government Code, relating to employment.",
    "content": "Under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification or applicable security regulations established by the United States or the State of California, to refuse to hire or employ a person or to refuse to select a person for a training program leading to employment, or to bar or discharge a person from employment or a training program leading to employment, or to discriminate against a person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of the race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status of that person. The California Fair Employment and Housing Act provides that nothing in that act relating to discrimination on account of sex affects the right of an employer to use veteran status as a factor in employee selection or to give special consideration to Vietnam-era veterans. This bill would enact the Voluntary Veterans\u2019 Preference Employment Policy Act to authorize a private employer to establish and maintain a written veterans\u2019 preference employment policy, to be applied uniformly to hiring decisions, to give a voluntary preference for hiring or retaining a veteran over another qualified applicant or employee. The bill would provide that the granting of a veterans\u2019 preference pursuant to the bill, in and of itself, shall be deemed not to violate any local or state equal employment opportunity law or regulation, including, but not limited to, the antidiscrimination provisions of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. The bill would revise the existing veteran status provision in the California Fair Employment and Housing Act to remove references to discrimination on account of sex and to Vietnam-era veterans, and would, instead, provide that nothing in that act relating to discrimination affects the right of an employer to use veteran status as a factor in hiring decisions if the employer maintains a veterans\u2019 preference employment policy established in accordance with the Voluntary Veterans\u2019 Preference Employment Policy Act. The bill would prohibit a veterans\u2019 preference employment policy from being established or applied for the purpose of discriminating against an employment applicant on the basis of a protected classification, as specified."
