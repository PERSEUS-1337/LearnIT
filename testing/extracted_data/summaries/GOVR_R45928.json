    "content": "When Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010, it required employment-based health plans and health insurance issuers to cover certain preventive health services without cost sharing. Those services, because of agency guidelines and rules, would soon include contraception for women. The \"contraceptive coverage requirement,\" or \"contraceptive mandate\" as it came to be known, was heavily litigated in the years to follow, and exemptions from the requirement are currently the subject of a pending Supreme Court case. The various legal challenges to the contraceptive coverage requirement primarily concerned (1)\u00c2 what types of employers and institutions should be exempt from the requirement based on their religious or moral objections to contraception; (2)\u00c2 what procedures the government can require for an entity to invoke a religious-based accommodation; and (3) how much authority federal agencies have to create exceptions to the coverage requirement. As originally formulated, only houses of worship and similar entities were exempt from the requirement, but the government later added an accommodation process for certain religious nonprofit organizations. On June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court held in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. that the contraceptive coverage requirement violated federal law insofar as it did not also accommodate the religious objections of closely held, for-profit corporations. The law at issue in that case\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA)\u00e2\u0080\u0094prohibits the federal government from \"substantially burden[ing] a person's exercise of religion\" except under narrow circumstances. Since Hobby Lobby , the agencies tasked with implementing the ACA have faced numerous hurdles in their attempts to accommodate the interests of sincere objectors while minimizing disruptions to the provision of cost-free contraceptive coverage to women. The lower courts split on whether the accommodation process\u00e2\u0080\u0094which required eligible objecting entities to notify their insurers or the government that they qualified for an exemption\u00e2\u0080\u0094substantially burdened the objectors' exercise of religion. Initially, most circuit courts rejected the view that such an accommodation triggered, facilitated, or otherwise made objectors complicit in the provision of coverage, denying their RFRA claims. After consolidating some of these cases for review, the Supreme Court ultimately vacated and remanded the decisions when the government and the objecting parties suggested that a solution might be reached so that the objectors' insurers could provide the required coverage without notice from the objecting parties. Following a change in presidential administration, the implementing agencies reevaluated and reversed their position on the legality of the then-existing accommodation process, concluding that it violated RFRA when applied to certain entities. The agencies opted to automatically exempt most nongovernmental entities that objected to providing coverage for some or all forms of contraception on religious or moral grounds. These expanded exemptions sparked a new round of litigation based on claims that the agencies exceeded their authority under the ACA or violated federal requirements for promulgating new rules. Federal courts, including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, preliminarily enjoined the government from implementing the expanded exemptions. The Supreme Court is slated to hear arguments on the Third Circuit's decision in May in Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania . Meanwhile, the government is largely precluded from relying on the prior accommodation process as a result of a nationwide injunction issued by a federal district court. Little Sisters of the Poor marks the fourth Supreme Court term in six years in which the Court has granted certiorari in a dispute about the federal contraceptive coverage requirement. During that time period, the Executive Departments promulgated six different rules concerning the requirement, a change in presidential administration marked a turning point in the Departments' RFRA calculus, and the Supreme Court underwent its own changes with the appointment of two new Justices. A Supreme Court decision in Little Sisters of the Poor could inform Congress's next steps with regard to the contraceptive coverage requirement. From a legal perspective, Congress has several options for clarifying the requirement's scope, including through amendments to the ACA and RFRA. An opinion in Little Sisters may also provide additional direction to lawmakers and federal agencies asked to accommodate the religious and moral beliefs of regulated entities when enacting or implementing laws of broader applicability."
