    "content": "The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant provides federal grants to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and American Indian tribes for a wide range of benefits, services, and activities. It is best known for helping states pay for cash welfare for needy families with children, but it funds a wide array of additional activities. TANF was created in the 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193). At the federal level, TANF is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). TANF provides a basic block grant that totals $16.5 billion. It also requires states to contribute in the aggregate from their own funds at least $10.3 billion for benefits and services to needy families with children\u2014this is known as the maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement. TANF and MOE funds may be used in any manner \"reasonably calculated\" to achieve TANF's statutory purpose. This purpose is to increase state flexibility to achieve four goals: (1) provide assistance to needy families with children so that they can live in their own homes or the homes of relatives; (2) end dependence of needy parents on government benefits through work, job preparation, and marriage; (3) reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and (4) promote the formation and maintenance of two-parent families. Though TANF is a block grant, there are some strings attached to the use of its funds. Most TANF requirements apply to families receiving assistance. Assistance is often, but not exclusively, in the form of a cash benefit. Families must be financially needy and have a minor child to qualify for assistance; however, individual states and tribes determine the exact financial eligibility rules and benefit amounts for their programs. Some families have eligible children but the adults who care for their children are ineligible for aid. These are termed \"child-only\" families because benefits are paid only on behalf of the children. States and tribes must meet TANF work participation standards or risk a reduction in their block grant. For the states, the law sets standards stipulating that at least 50% of all families and 90% of two-parent families be \"engaged in work.\" Some families receiving TANF assistance are excluded from the calculation. Additionally, these statutory standards are reduced by credits for caseload reduction and state spending in excess of what is required under the TANF MOE. These credits and the effective (after credit) participation targets vary by state and year. Activities countable toward a family being \"engaged in work\" are focused on employment or working off the cash benefit, or are intended to rapidly attach welfare recipients to the workforce; education and training is countable, but limited. Work requirements for tribal programs are set by negotiation between the tribes operating the program and HHS. Federal TANF funds may not be used for a family with an adult who has received assistance for 60 months. This is the five-year time limit on welfare receipt. However, up to 20% of the caseload may be extended beyond the five years for reason of \"hardship.\" Each state may have its own definition of hardship. Additionally, funds spent to meet the TANF MOE requirement may be used to provide assistance to families beyond five years. TANF work participation rules and time limits do not apply to families receiving benefits and services not considered \"assistance.\" Such benefits and services include child care and transportation aid for families with earnings, state earned income tax credits for working families, activities to reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies, activities to promote marriage and two-parent families, and activities to help families that have experienced or are \"at risk\" of child abuse and neglect."
