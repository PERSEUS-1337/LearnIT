    "content": "The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA, P.L. 107-252 ) gave the federal ElectionAssistance Commission (EAC) the responsibility to develop a set of Voluntary Voting SystemGuidelines ( VVSG ) to replace the current voluntary Voting Systems Standards ( VSS ). The VVSG areto provide a set of specifications and requirements to be used in the certification of computer-assistedvoting systems, both paper-based and fully electronic. That was also the purpose of the VSS, whichwere developed in response to concerns raised about voting systems in the 1970s and 1980s. Moststates have adopted the VSS in whole or in part, and most are expected to adopt the VVSG, which arescheduled to go into effect two years after approval. The draft VVSG, a partial revision of the VSS, was released in June 2005 for a 90-daycomment period. Volume I provides performance guidelines for voting systems and is intended fora broad audience. It includes descriptions of functional requirements and performance standards,and requirements for vendors. The most extensive revisions are to the section on usability andaccessibility and the section on security of voting systems. Standards are also included for the useof voter-verified paper audit trails (VVPAT), a recent security measure developed in response toconcerns that electronic voting machines are vulnerable to tampering that might otherwise bedifficult to detect. Volume II provides details of the testing process for certification of votingsystems and has few revisions. Some issues associated with the VVSG have been controversial. Among them is the questionof timing. Some vendors claim that there needs to be more time for technology development beforethe new guidelines become effective; some activists argue that problems with voting systems, andHAVA provisions, demand more rapid implementation of the VVSG . In any event, it is generallyconsidered unlikely that the guidelines will have much direct impact on voting systems used in 2006,when HAVA requirements for voting systems go into effect. One exception may be the VVPATprovisions, since the VSS, under which most current voting systems are certified, have no provisionsrelating to this innovation. The VVSG will be voluntary, but some observers believe that a regulatoryapproach would be more appropriate given the importance of elections to the democratic process. However, since many states require that voting systems be certified, vendors are expected to treatthe VVSG in the same way they have treated the VSS -- as effectively mandatory. Among the other issues being debated about the guidelines are whether they should beexpanded to include voter registration systems, whether they impede innovation by focusing onintegrated systems rather than components, how to treat commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) productsthat are incorporated in voting systems, and whether a graded certification would be more effectivethan the current pass/fail approach. Several bills introduced in the 109th Congress could affect thescope or other aspects of the VVSG by requiring VVPAT or other security provisions, addressingconcerns about conflict of interest, and other measures. None have received committee or flooraction in either chamber during the first session. This report will be updated in response to majordevelopments."
