    "content": "The FY2005 Transportation, Treasury and Independent Agencies appropriations bill was passed as Division H of P.L. 108-447 , an omnibus appropriations bill, and was signed into law on December8, 2004. The bill provides $90.6 billion for Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies. However, the bill also includes an across-the-board rescission of 0.80%, which will reduce theTransportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies funding by approximately $725 million. Thiswill make the final figure $89.9 billion, slightly less than FY2004's $90.3 billion but more than theAdministration's request for FY2005. For FY2005, the Administration requested $88.9 billion for the Departments of Transportation and the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President, and a variety of independent agencies. Thiswas $1.6 billion (1.7%) less than the amount enacted for FY2004. On September 22, 2004, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5025 , the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2005. The Committee onAppropriations had recommended $89.9 billion, an increase of $0.9 billion over the President'srequest and $495 million below the FY2004 level. During the House floor debate on the bill,sections of the bill appropriating funds for unauthorized programs were struck. Since at the time ofthe floor debate the surface transportation programs were not authorized for FY2005, the result wasthat funding for federal highway, highway safety, and transit programs was eliminated, as wasfunding for Amtrak and the Airport Improvement Program. In the end, the House cut some $47billion in transportation funding from the $89.9 billion bill reported by the Committee. The appropriation subcommittee chairman assured members that this funding would be restored inconference (for this reason, the tables in this bill do not reflect these cuts). The House bill includedseveral provisions similar to provisions that were included in the FY2004 House bill and that provedcontroversial. These included setting the FY2005 federal civilian pay increase at the same level theAdministration requested for the military (3.5% for FY2005), limits on the outsourcing ofgovernment work, and loosening of sanctions on Cuba. On September 15, 2004 the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported out S. 2806 , their FY2005 Transportation, Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill. TheCommittee recommended $90.6 billion in funding and included provisions aligning the FY2005federal civilian pay increase with that of the military and limiting outsourcing of government work. This full Senate never acted on this bill. The conferees dropped the provisions limiting outsourcing of government work and relaxing restrictions on Cuba. Final passage of the bill was delayed to allow Congress to delete a provisionthat would have given appropriators' access to individual tax return information. This report willnot be updated.
