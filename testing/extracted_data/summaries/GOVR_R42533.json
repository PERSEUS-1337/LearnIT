    "content": "This report provides answers to frequently asked questions about the presidential nominating process, including how the delegates to the national conventions are chosen, the differences between a caucus and a primary, national party rules changes for 2016, and the national conventions themselves. It is not a comprehensive report on all aspects of the presidential nominating process. The Nominating Process The presidential nominating process is a subject of enduring congressional and national interest. Presidential elections are the only nationwide elections held in the United States and the initial phase of primaries and caucuses is subject to change every four years. Congress has a legislative, as well as a practical and political, interest in the presidential nominating process. Presidential nominees lead the party ticket in the fall election; the elected President will set many policy and political goals in the ensuing four years; and many Members of Congress will serve as delegates to the major party conventions. No legislation has been introduced in the 114th Congress to reform the presidential nominating process; taxpayer financing of the national party conventions was eliminated with the enactment of P.L. 113-94 in April 2014. The Rules Republican Party rules changes for 2012 set the background for the 2016 presidential primary season. The 2012 election featured a protracted contest for Republicans that began in January and continued until the end of May, partly due to two new Republican Party rules that led to a comparatively long primary battle. In an effort to decrease the large cluster of contests at the beginning of the primary and caucus calendar\u2014the phenomenon known as front-loading\u2014the Republican Party adopted two important changes to national party rules for 2012: delegate selection events could not be held before the first Tuesday in March, with exceptions for Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, which could hold their events on or after February 1 (regardless, Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina scheduled January events for 2012); and states that held contests before April 1 were required to allocate delegates on a proportional basis, according to primary or caucus results. Many state parties had used winner-take-all in the past, but the new rule required that delegates be awarded to presidential candidates in proportion to their primary vote totals, in some fashion. The rules changes reduced front-loading, but they also prolonged the contest in comparison to past primary cycles and led to speculation that the Republican convention might need more than one ballot to choose the nominee, an unprecedented occurrence in recent decades. That possibility did not occur. Republicans made additional revisions to party rules for 2016 that might impact the contest for the nomination. The proportional allocation of delegates is required for events held between March 1 and 14, rather than for the entire month, as was done in 2012. Delegates are bound according to the results, either on a proportional or winner-take-all basis (permitted after March 14). Finally, the calendar window imposed for only the second time by Republicans (Democrats have imposed a window for many years) appears to have contained efforts by some state parties to \"front-load\" the calendar by scheduling events early in the year in order to attract media and candidate attention. The National Conventions The national party conventions have evolved over the past half century and now serve as the forum for officially ratifying the results of the primary season, rather than the place where the nominee is actually chosen. The last time more than one ballot was required to nominate a presidential candidate\u2014a so-called \"brokered\" convention\u2014occurred in 1952. Even so, the conventions remain important as media events that launch each major party's general election campaign. In 2016, the major parties' nominations will be officially conferred when Republicans meet in Cleveland from July 18-21 and Democrats meet in Philadelphia from July 26-28."
