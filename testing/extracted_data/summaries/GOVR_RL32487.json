    "content": "Trends in U.S. assistance to the Latin America and Caribbean region generally reflect thetrends and rationales for U.S. foreign aid programs globally. Aid to the region increased during the1960s with the Alliance for Progress and during the 1980s with aid to Central America. Since 2000,aid levels have increased, especially in the Andean region as the focus has shifted from Cold Warissues to counternarcotics and security assistance. Current aid levels to Latin America and theCaribbean comprise about 11.8% of the worldwide FY2006 bilateral aid budget. Amounts requestedfor FY2007 would reduce this ratio to 10.6%. Two countries -- Honduras and Nicaragua -- havesigned compacts for Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) funds. Aid levels to the region couldincrease further as more countries become eligible for MCA. Both Haiti and Guyana are focuscountries for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). For FY2006, U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean is estimated at $1.68billion, the largest portion of which is allocated to the Andean region -- $919 million. Mexico andCentral America are slated to receive $292 million, while the Caribbean would receive $307 million.Brazil and the Southern Cone of South America are to receive an estimated $36 million. The UnitedStates also maintains programs of a regional nature that total an estimated $133 million in FY2006. Aid programs are designed to achieve a variety of goals, from poverty reduction to economicgrowth. Child Survival and Health (CSH) funds focus on combating infectious diseases andpromoting child and maternal health. Development Assistance (DA) promotes sustainable economicgrowth in key areas such as trade, agriculture, education, the environment, and democracy. TheEconomic Support Fund (ESF) assists countries of strategic importance to the United States, andfunds programs relating to justice sector reforms, local governance, anti-corruption, and respect forhuman rights. P.L. 480 food assistance is provided to countries facing emergency situations, suchas natural disasters. Counternarcotics programs seek to assist countries to reduce drug production,interdict trafficking, and promote alternative crop development. Foreign Military Financing (FMF)provides grants to nations for the purchase of U.S. defense equipment, services and training. The annual Foreign Operations Appropriations bills are the vehicles by which Congressprovides funding for foreign assistance programs. The FY2006 Foreign Operations AppropriationsAct ( P.L. 109-102 ) provided $20.9 billion for the foreign assistance budget worldwide. In the secondsession of the 109th Congress, Members of Congress will likely continue to be interested in a numberof related issues, including the general effectiveness of foreign aid programs, and how best to addressthe HIV/AIDS problem and poverty issues. Congress may also debate the U.S. role in fightingnarcotics trafficking and illegally armed groups in Colombia and stabilizing the situation in Haiti. This report will be updated as events warrant."
