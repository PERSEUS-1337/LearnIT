    "title": "AB 1975",
    "content": "Existing law makes it an offense to drive a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Existing law requires the court to impose as a condition of probation for a conviction for a first violation of driving under the influence, in a county where the board of supervisors has approved, and the State Department of Health Care Services has licensed, a driving-under-the-influence program, that the driver successfully complete the program in the driver\u2019s county of residence or employment, as designated by the court. Existing law provides that enrollment and participation in, and completion of, an approved program shall be subsequent to the date of the current violation. This bill would require a court to impose an alcohol dependence assessment, as specified, as a condition of probation for a person in an 18-month or 30-month driving-under-the-influence program, or for a first offender who had a specified blood alcohol level. The bill would require the entity administering the assessment to advise the person, among other things, that there are medications that can address alcohol dependence, and that the person should consult his or her physician regarding the results of the assessment. The bill would state findings and declarations of the Legislature regarding driving under the influence. This bill would express the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would require American Society of Addiction Medicine assessments for certain individuals who are repeat offenders of driving under the influence of alcohol or who were driving under the influence with excessive blood alcohol levels, to determine if the individual needs treatment, and to refer the individual for additional services, as appropriate, including, but not limited to, physician services, counseling, treatment facility services, and medication-assisted treatment for alcohol abuse."
