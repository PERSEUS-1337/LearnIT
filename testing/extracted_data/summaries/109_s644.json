Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to report to specified congressional committees on progress toward implementing the N visa provisions of this Act.

Requires completion of database searches within 180 days of entry. Authorizes administrative review of a determination that an alien is ineligible for admission on criminal, security, or related grounds based on a database search.
