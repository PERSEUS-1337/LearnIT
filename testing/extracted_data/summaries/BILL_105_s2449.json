    "content": "Drug Currency Forfeitures Act - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to create a rebuttable presumption that property is subject to forfeiture if the Government offers a reasonable basis to believe that, based on specified circumstances, there is a substantial connection between the property and a drug trafficking offense. Includes among such circumstances that: (1) the property at issue is currency in excess of $10,000 that was being transported through an airport, on a highway, or at a port-of-entry and was packaged or concealed in a highly unusual manner, was being transported by a person who provided false information to any inspection officer, was found near a measurable quantity of a controlled substance, or was the subject of a positive alert by a trained dog. (2) the property at issue was acquired during a time period by a person who was engaged in a drug trafficking offense and there is no other likely source for such property. (3) the property at issue was, or was intended to be, transported, transmitted, or transferred to or from a major drug-transit country, illicit drug producing country, or money laundering country, and specified other conditions are met. Or (4) any person involved in the transaction giving rise to the forfeiture action has been convicted in any Federal, State, or foreign jurisdiction of a drug trafficking offense or a felony involving money laundering, or is a fugitive from prosecution for such an offense. Amends the Federal criminal code provisions concerning money laundering forfeitures to create a rebuttable presumption that property is the proceeds of an offense involving the felonious manufacture, importation, or other dealing in a controlled substance, and thus constitutes the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, if any of the circumstances set forth above apply."
