    "content": "The President signed H.R. 2985, the FY2006 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, into P.L. 109-55 on August 2, 2005 (119 Stat. 565). The act provides $3.804 billion in new budget authority, a 4.49% increase of $163.61 million over current budget authority. Going into conference, the House bill contained $2.87 billion, a 1.7% increase over the current budget, excluding funds for Senate items, which were determined by the Senate after House consideration of the bill. The Senate bill contained $3.83 billion, a 6.3% increase, including funds for House items. The level of funding is less than the outlay of $3.809 billion projected by the House Budget Committee. The difference is to be offset by the use of prior year funds made available primarily for projects under jurisdiction of the Architect of the Capitol. As enacted into law, H.R. 2985 contained new discretionary budget authority of $3.804 billion, exceeding the 302(b) allocation by $85 million. One of the more controversial issues, House language providing for continuity of representation in the House of Representatives pursuant to an emergency situation, was retained by conferees. The Senate bill did not contain the language. Actions on the FY2006 bill follow last year's approval by the Committees on Appropriations of a virtual funding freeze. Congress eventually agreed to a 1.2% increase, which fell below the 1.3% increase agreed to by both houses for discretionary funds. Among other issues that were under consideration during discussions on the FY2006 budget were requests by the chairman of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees for agencies to identify further their FY2006 objectives in an effort to reduce their requests to more closely mirror the President's call for a 2.1% on discretionary appropriations; funding for the U.S. Capitol Police budget (the House bill contained a 0.7% decrease; the Senate bill, a 9.6% increase; and the conference report, a 3.31% increase; funding for the Capitol Visitor Center (the House bill contained $36.9 million; the Senate bill, $44.2 million, with conferees agreeing to the Senate figure); language in the House bill terminating the Capitol Police mounted horse unit, which was retained in conference; the Senate bill did not contain the provision; language regarding management of the Capitol Police; language in both the House and Senate bill limiting the pay of a legislative branch employee to that received by a Member of Congress, which was dropped during conference; and, language in the Senate report encouraging the application of performance standards for the legislative branch similar to those now statutorily required by the executive branch."
