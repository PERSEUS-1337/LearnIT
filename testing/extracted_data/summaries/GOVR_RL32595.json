    "content": "It would be difficult for terrorists to mount a nuclear attack on a U.S. city, but such an attackis plausible and would have catastrophic consequences, in one scenario killing over a half-millionpeople and causing damage of over $1 trillion. Terrorists or rogue states might acquire a nuclear weapon in several ways. The nations ofgreatest concern as potential sources of weapons or fissile materials are widely thought to be Russiaand Pakistan. Russia has many tactical nuclear weapons, which tend to be lower in yield but moredispersed and apparently less secure than strategic weapons. It also has much highly enricheduranium (HEU) and weapons-grade plutonium, some said to have inadequate security. Many expertsbelieve that technically sophisticated terrorists could, without state support, fabricate a nuclear bombfrom HEU; opinion is divided on whether terrorists could make a bomb using plutonium. The fearregarding Pakistan is that some members of the armed forces might covertly give a weapon toterrorists or that, if President Musharraf were overthrown, an Islamic fundamentalist government ora state of chaos in Pakistan might enable terrorists to obtain a weapon. Terrorists might also obtainHEU from the more than 130 research reactors worldwide that use HEU as fuel. If terrorists acquired a nuclear weapon, they could try many means to bring it into the UnitedStates. This nation has thousands of miles of land and sea borders, as well as several hundred portsof entry. Terrorists might smuggle a weapon across lightly-guarded stretches of borders, ship it inusing a cargo container, place it in a crude oil tanker, or bring it in using a truck, a boat, or a smallairplane. The architecture of the U.S. response is termed \"layered defense.\" The goal is to try to blockterrorists at various stages in their attempts to obtain a nuclear weapon and smuggle it into the UnitedStates. The underlying concept is that the probability of success is higher if many layers are usedrather than just one or two. Layers include threat reduction programs in the former Soviet Union,efforts to secure HEU worldwide, control of former Soviet and other borders, the Container SecurityInitiative and Proliferation Security Initiative, and U.S. border security. Several approaches underliemultiple layers, such as technology, intelligence, and forensics. Many policy options have been proposed to deal with nuclear terrorism, such as developingnew detection technologies, strengthening U.S. intelligence capability, and improving planning torespond to an attack. Congress funds programs to counter nuclear terrorism and holds hearings andless-formal briefings on the topic. Several bills have been introduced in the 109th Congress relatedto nuclear terrorism. This report is intended for background, not for tracking current developments. It will beupdated occasionally.
