    "content": "United States Voluntary and Material Assistance Act of 1996 - Establishes the United States Voluntary and Material Assistance Program for the disposition of donated private sector and US Government nonlethal personal property needed by eligible foreign countries. Authorizes the President, under the Program, to: (1) receive nonlethal personal property donated to the Federal Government by any US private sector organization and retransfer it to eligible foreign countries. (2) provide the necessary transportation to assist private organizations and voluntary organizations in the United States in transferring to eligible foreign countries nonlethal personal property that is donated to them. And (3) transfer to eligible foreign countries any available surplus nonlethal personal property subject to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. Expresses the sense of the Congress that, before carrying out any other activities under the Program, the President should first conduct a pilot project in eligible countries in sub-Saharan Africa in order to demonstrate the feasibility of transferring donated nonlethal personal property under the Program. Authorizes appropriations."
