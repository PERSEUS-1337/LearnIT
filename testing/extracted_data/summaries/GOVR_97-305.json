    "content": "The United States has experienced difficulty in closing military bases to match therequirements of downsized forces with changed composition. During the decade of the 1980s, majormilitary base closures were seriously hampered by procedural requirements established by Congress,to the point that none occurred. The mismatch between real estate assets and defense requirementsgrew with the military downsizing that began late in the Reagan Administration and continued underPresidents George H. W. Bush and Clinton. After several legislative efforts to break the deadlock had failed, Congress established a newbase closure procedure in P.L. 100-526 , enacted October 24, 1988. The statute provided for abipartisan commission, appointed by the Secretary of Defense, to make recommendations toCongress on closures and realignments to be voted down or accepted as a whole. The process wassuccessfully implemented, but produced complaints of partisanship in selecting bases for closure. P.L. 101-510 , enacted November 5, 1990, provided new authority for additional base closurerecommendations by a series of presidentially appointed commissions (with the advice and consentof the Senate), commonly called Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) commissions. Thesecommissions were to operate in 1991, 1993, and 1995, after which the authority of the final baseclosure commission would end. The four commissions recommended closure of 98 major bases and hundreds of smallerinstallations, and the realignment of many other bases and facilities. These recommendations wereestimated to be implemented and completed by the year 2001. The Department of Defense at onetime estimated savings of about $57 billion over 20 years. At the community level, in turn, implementation of the base closure process commenced. Congress has amended the base closure legislation several times to protect and assist communitiesas they adjust to the social and economic stress caused by the loss of military installations. Many,but by no means all, communities appeared to be succeeding in local efforts to replace defense jobsand find new uses for former military lands and buildings. After expiration of the authorizing legislation, a number of influential leaders recommendedestablishment of a new commission and the closure of additional bases and facilities. Theseadvocates included the chairman of the 1995 commission, Alan Dixon, former Defense SecretaryWilliam Perry, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman John Shalikashvili. In Congress, many felt thatinfrastructure costs diverted money from modernization and sapped the readiness of America's armedforces. Against these pressures to cut military real estate further was caution concerning furthermilitary cuts, as well as the traditional reluctance of Senators and Representatives to lose federal jobsand disrupt communities in their state or district. Subsequently, new authorizing legislation by the Congress was required to reconstitute baseclosure and realignment through the commission approach."
