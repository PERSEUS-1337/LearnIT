    "content": "On February 18, 2007, the Washington Post published the first in a series of articles describing problems with outpatient medical care and other services provided at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC). The series noted, among other things, concerns about the processes used to evaluate disability in injured military servicemembers. Both the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) conduct disability evaluations and assign disability ratings to servicemembers or veterans under their respective authorities. An individual's disability rating, from either department, affects the scope of pay and benefits for which he or she is eligible, and the cost to the respective department of providing such benefits. There are significant differences between the disability evaluations performed by DOD and VA, as well as civilian disability evaluations conducted by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and workers' compensation programs. Most notably, the DOD disability evaluation is focused on the effect of any disabling condition on the performance of the servicemember's duties in the military, whereas the other three systems evaluate the impact of a disability on gainful employment in the civilian economy. During the 110th Congress, legislation was enacted for the care of injured servicemembers. Title XVI of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 (P.L. 110-181), contained Wounded Warrior provisions related to the care and transition of injured servicemembers, including the use of pilot programs to improve the disability evaluation process. This report will describe disability evaluation in general, including evaluations used by DOD and VA, as well as civilian evaluations used by the SSA and by workers' compensation programs. Next, the DOD and VA disability rating processes are described, respectively, in greater detail. This report emphasizes the disability evaluation systems at DOD and VA, with illustrative comparisons made to civilian systems when appropriate. It will be updated as warranted."
