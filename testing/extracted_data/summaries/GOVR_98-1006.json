    "content": "Many military health care beneficiaries, particularly military retirees, their dependents, andthose representing their interests, state that they were promised \"free health care for life at militaryfacilities\" as part of their \"contractual agreement\" when they entered the armed forces. Efforts tolocate authoritative documentation of such promises have not been successful. Congressional reportlanguage and recent court decisions have rejected retiree claims seeking 'free care at militaryfacilities' as a right or entitlement. These have stated that the medical benefit structure made up ofmilitary health care facilities, Tricare and Medicare currently provide lifetime health care to militarymembers, retirees and their respective dependents. Nevertheless, claims continue to be made,particularly by those seeking additional benefits from the Department of Defense, or attempting toprevent an actual or perceived reduction in benefits. Recent changes in the availability of military benefits and eligibility for these benefits havelead to speculation that retiree out-of-pocket costs may be increased. Growth in military health carespending, it has been argued, will lead to increased competition for defense dollars. Groupsrepresenting military retirees have stated that it is among their objectives to prevent what theydescribe as cost-shifting from the military to the beneficiaries. Although military health care isarguably among the most generous health benefit programs available, these groups see potentialincreases in out-of-pocket beneficiary payments as a part of the \"broken promise.\""
