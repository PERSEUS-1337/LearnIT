    "title": "AB 2210",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the California State University, under the administration of the Trustees of the California State University, as one of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law authorizes the trustees by rule to require all persons to pay fees, rents, deposits, and charges for services, facilities, or materials provided by the trustees to those persons. Existing law prohibits specified California State University campus-based mandatory fees from being reallocated without an affirmative vote of the majority of the members of either the student body or a specified campus fee advisory committee voting on the fee reallocation, unless the vote that established the fee authorizes an alternative or automatic reallocation mechanism for that fee. Existing law prohibits a campus of the California State University, or the Chancellor of the California State University, from imposing a student success fee, as defined, unless certain requirements are met. Among these requirements is an affirmative vote of a majority of the student body voting at a binding student election. This bill would increase the affirmative vote required for the imposition of a student success fee from a majority to 23 of the student body voting on that proposed fee. The bill would also make a technical conforming change in a related provision."
