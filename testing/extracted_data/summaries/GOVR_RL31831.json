    "content": "There is widespread belief that the likelihood of terrorist use of chemical and biological weapons (CBW) is increasing, in part as a result of publicized new evidence of terrorist interest andcapabilities, as well as the political fall-out from the war in Iraq. This is a serious present concernthat deserves examination in the broader framework provided by the patterns, motivations andhistorical context for the current terrorist threat. Although it can have a powerful psychologicalimpact, past CBW use by terrorists has been rare and has not caused a large number of casualties,especially compared to other weapons. Terrorist attacks are deliberately designed to surprise, so notrend analysis will ever perfectly predict them, especially in the contemporary international climate. This report presents the arguments for and against future nonstate terrorist acquisition and/or use ofCBW weapons against the United States, as well as a brief discussion of issues for congressconcerning how best to counter the threat. It will not be updated."
