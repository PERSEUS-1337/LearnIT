    "content": "With the on-going requirements of U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the continuing peacekeeping deployments in the Balkans have come under congressional scrutiny todetermine whether or not they could be safely reduced or terminated. This report examines thehistory and current status of U.S. military operations in the Balkans, and will be updated as eventswarrant. In Paris on December 14, 1995, the presidents of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia signed the peace settlement negotiated in Dayton, OH (Dayton Accords). The United Nations Security Council'sResolution 1031 authorized the NATO-led implementation force (IFOR) for one year. On December12, 1996, the Security Council authorized a follow-on force, dubbed the Stabilization Force (SFOR). This authorization has been renewed annually. In March 1998, the NATO allies agreed that SFORwill remain in Bosnia until significant progress has been made in the implementation of the DaytonAccords. SFOR is now a force of about 12,000 troops. The U.S. contingent has been about 1,800. It will be reduced to 800 by summer 2004, and probably withdrawn by 2005 when the European Union isexpected to take over peacekeeping duties from NATO. U.S. forces have suffered no fatal casualtiesfrom hostile action in Bosnia. SFOR continues the mission of monitoring and enforcingdemilitarized zones and weapon cantonment. These efforts have been credited a success. NATOcommanders have lent assistance to civilian authorities in their efforts to create a stable politicalenvironment (e.g., detaining war crimes suspects, and providing support for elections and limitedassistance for refugees). In Kosovo, with the failure of peace talks on March 24, 1999 NATO began Operation Allied Force airstrikes against targets in Serbia and Kosovo. In June Yugoslavia accepted a peace proposaland signed a military-technical agreement with NATO providing for the withdrawal of all Yugoslavforces from Kosovo and turning military control of the province over to NATO's peacekeepingforces (KFOR). U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244 endorsed the peace settlement and \"aninternational security presence with substantial NATO participation.\" It is expected that NATOforces will remain in Kosovo until its political status is resolved. KFOR totals about 20,000 troops in Kosovo, with the United States contributing about 2,100 troops. The U.S. has suffered no casualties from hostile action. Congress has appropriated approximately $23.5 billion for Bosnia and Kosovo operations fromFY1992 through FY2004. Congressional concerns have focused on the impact of Balkan operations on 1) military readiness and the ability to maintain military operations in Iraq, 2) whether there has been anequitable distribution of responsibilities among the NATO allies and 3) if the United States needsto participate in Balkan peacekeeping operations at all."
