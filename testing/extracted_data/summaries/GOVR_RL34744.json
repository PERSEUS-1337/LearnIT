    "content": "The President makes appointments, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to some 151 full-time leadership positions on 33 federal regulatory and other collegial boards and commissions. This appointment process consists of three distinct stages: selection, clearance, and nomination by the President; consideration by the Senate; and appointment by the President. These advice and consent positions can also temporarily be filled by the President alone through a recess appointment. Membership positions on this set of collegial bodies often have fixed terms, and incumbents are often protected from arbitrary removal by the President. The enabling statutes for most of these boards and commissions require political party balance in their membership. During the 109th Congress, President George W. Bush submitted nominations to the Senate for 84 of these 151 positions. (Most of the remaining positions on these boards and commissions were not vacant during that time.) A total of 111 nominations were submitted, of which 79 were confirmed, 6 were withdrawn, and 26 were returned to the President. The number of nominations exceeded the number of positions for reasons discussed in this report (e.g., nominations to a single position for successive terms). President Bush made 12 recess appointments to regulatory and other boards and commissions: 10 when the Senate was adjourned during a session (intrasession recess appointments) and 2 between sessions (intersession recess appointments). At the end of the 109th Congress, 12 incumbents were serving past the expiration of their terms. In addition, there were 12 vacancies among the 151 positions. This report specifies, for the 109th Congress, all nominations to full-time positions on 33 regulatory and other collegial boards and commissions. Profiles of each board and commission provide information on their organizational structures, membership as of end of the 109th Congress, and appointment activity during that Congress. The organizational section discusses the statutory requirements for the appointed positions, including the number of members on each board or commission, their terms of office, whether or not they may continue in their positions after their terms expire, whether or not political balance is required, and the method for selection of the chair. Membership and appointment activity are provided in tabular form. The report also includes tables summarizing the collective appointment activity for all 33 bodies, and identifying Senate recesses during the 109th Congress. Information for this report was compiled from data from the Senate nominations database of the Legislative Information System at http://www.congress.gov/nomis/, telephone discussions with agency officials, agency websites, the United States Code, and the 2004 edition of United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions (more commonly known as the \"Plum Book\"). This report will not be updated."
