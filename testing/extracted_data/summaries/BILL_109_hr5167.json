    "content": "Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch Protection Act of 2006 - Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to require the Secretary of Agriculture to revise the definition of food of minimal nutritional value, the sale of which in areas where school meals are sold or eaten is prohibited as a condition for federal funding of school lunch and breakfast programs. Applies such definition to all food sold outside such programs anywhere on school campuses at any time of the day, with the possible limited exemption of food sold at school fundraisers. Requires the Secretary, when revising such definition, to consider the recommendations of authoritative scientific organizations and evidence concerning the relationship between diet and health."
