Or (2) royalty due on any oil or gas production under any lease of an area located in a specified part of the Outer Continental Shelf. Declares that the requirement under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 that lands or interests exchanged must be located in the same State shall not apply to land or an interest in land in Rocky Flats that is acquired by the United States in an exchange. States that any interests acquired by the United States under this Act shall be managed by the Secretary under the standards that apply to the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge. Declares that no minerals acquired under this Act shall be subject to development or disposal by the United States or any other party under any law related to minerals owned by the United States."
