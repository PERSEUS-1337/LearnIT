    "content": "Congress passed the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) in 1993 in part to \"balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families.\" To that end, the FMLA entitles eligible employees of covered employers to set amounts of unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons. These reasons include, for example, the care of a spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious health condition, and the care of a newborn or newly adopted child. Employers who interfere with an employee's exercise of FMLA rights or retaliate against an employee for exercising her FMLA rights may face liability. This report first provides background on leave eligibility, notice requirements, and enforcement under the FMLA. Then the report discusses the U.S. Supreme Court cases\u2014Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs, and Coleman v. Court of Appeals of Maryland\u2014that have considered and clarified some provisions of the FMLA."
