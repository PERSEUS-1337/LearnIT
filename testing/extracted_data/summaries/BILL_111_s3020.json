    "content": "HUBZone Improvement Act of 2010 - Directs the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to ensure that the map used by the SBA to identify HUBZones is accurate, up-to-date, and revised as new data is made available. Requires the Administrator to: (1) implement policies for ensuring that only qualified HUBZone small businesses are participating in the HUBZone program. (2) report to the congressional small businesses concerning qualification for, and recertification of, a HUBZone small business. And (3) develop measures and implement plans to assess HUBZone program effectiveness. Amends the Small Business Act to prohibit the Administrator, during the period beginning on the date that a small business is determined qualified as a HUBZone small business and ending the day before a HUBZone program contract for which such small business submits a bid is awarded, from determining that the small business is no longer qualified based on a failure to meet the applicable employment percentage unless, among other things, the small business has not attempted to maintain such percentage."
