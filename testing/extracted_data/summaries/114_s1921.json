    "content": "Vaccinate America's Children through Complete Information amp. Education Act of 2015 This bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require a state to certify that it has established, in its pediatric vaccine distribution program, administrative procedures regarding nonmedical exemptions from state immunization requirements. These procedures must include at least two of the following prerequisites for granting a nonmedical exemption: the child's parent or guardian shall discuss the consequences of nonvaccination with the child's primary care provider, as noted in the child's medical record. The child's parent or guardian shall read, sign, and submit to the state a form discussing the risks of nonvaccination. The child's parent of guardian shall submit to the state a notarized letter describing why the exemption is being sought. Or all medical exemptions shall be granted for only a one-year period and shall be required to be renewed annually only if the child's parent or guardian wants the exemption to continue for another year. A state that does not comply with these requirements is subject to a monetary penalty."
