    "title": "SB 936",
    "content": "Existing law, the Small Business Financial Assistance Act of 2013, establishes the California Small Business Expansion Fund, a continuously appropriated fund that includes General Fund moneys. The act requires guarantees made by small business financial development corporations to be backed by funds on deposit in the corporation\u2019s trust fund account or by receivables due from funds loaned from the corporation\u2019s trust fund account to another fund in state government, as specified, and requires these loan guarantees to be secured by a reserve of at least 20, until January 1, 2018, and 25 thereafter, as specified. This bill would reduce the required reserve to 10 indefinitely and would make conforming changes with respect to related statements of legislative intent. Existing law prohibits the amount of guarantee liability outstanding at any one time from exceeding 5 times the amount of funds on deposit in the expansion fund plus any receivables due from funds loaned from the expansion fund to another fund in state government, as specified, until January 1, 2018, and 4 times thereafter. This bill would increase that maximum amount to 10 times the amount of funds on deposit in the expansion fund plus any receivables due from funds loaned from the expansion fund to another fund in state government, as specified, would apply that increased amount indefinitely, and would make conforming changes. Existing law requires the program manager under the guidance of the executive director of the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank, to, among other things, authorize the distribution, transfer, and withholding of moneys in the expansion fund and trust funds. This bill would also require the program manager to leverage moneys in the expansion fund and trust funds."
