Many analysts and energy producers argue that there is currently an oversupply of natural gas in U.S. gas-producing regions, and that supplies of certain light sweet Western crudes (notably from the Bakken region) exceed the demand of Gulf Coast refineries. The result has been a spate of applications by the U.S. natural gas industry for federal permits to export natural gas to overseas buyers. Such exports are permitted by statute, subject to a national interest determination by the Department of Energy. Perceived oversupply of Bakken crude oil has similarly led to calls by some market stakeholders and policy makers for a relaxation of the federal restrictions on crude oil exports. Numerous legislative proposals in the 113th Congress, such as the Natural Gas Export Promotion Act of 2014 (S. 2494) and the Crude Oil Export Act (H.R. 4349), would facilitate increased exports of domestic energy resources. Whether\u2014or to what extent\u2014the United States should allow overseas exports of crude oil and natural gas is the subject of ongoing Congressional debate. However, U.S. exports of both natural gas and crude oil are not new. Congress and prior presidential administrations have authorized such exports before in circumstances where they were viewed as beneficial to the United States. The case of Alaska is of particular relevance because it is a major energy producer and has a history of both crude oil and natural gas exports going back several decades. Exports of crude oil from Alaska are currently authorized by three different statutes pertaining to (1) crude transported via the Trans Alaska Pipeline System, (2) Cook Inlet crude, and (3) crude oil exported to Canada under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Export of Cook Inlet natural gas from the Kenai LNG terminal has been authorized repeatedly since 1969. Export of natural gas from Alaska's North Slope was authorized in 1988, although the applicability of this authorization to the proposed Alaska LNG Project has not been resolved. In the context of the current export debate, a review of Alaskan crude oil and natural gas exports may offer historical perspectives of value to policy makers. Alaska's experience shows that\u2014under a specific set of circumstances\u2014such exports have been viewed as in the national interest both by Congress and successive presidential administrations. Regional production trends, market prices, and local commodity demand have all been important considerations in establishing export policies for Alaska. It is also instructive to note that, even with long-standing export approvals in effect, exports of crude oil and natural gas from Alaska have been relatively modest. Production economics and competitive market forces will be the ultimate determinant of export volumes where exports are permitted. In the context of broader U.S. oil and natural gas export policy the Alaska experience may raise several key questions. To what extent does the rationale for energy exports from Alaska\u2014which is geographically isolated\u2014apply to other U.S. supply regions? What is the interplay between overseas exports and the maritime shipping industry? What are the expectations for capital investment by developers to support export production and how might they affect the nation's overall oil and gas supplies? What are the environmental impacts of increased production for export? How might international trade agreements influence the U.S. government's ability to tailor its oil and natural gas export policies by region? As Congress continues its oversight of the nation's energy resources, understanding these issues may be important."
