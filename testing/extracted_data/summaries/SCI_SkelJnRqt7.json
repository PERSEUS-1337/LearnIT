    "content": "Separating mixed distributions is a long standing challenge for machine learning and signal processing. Applications include: single-channel multi-speaker separation (cocktail party problem), singing voice separation and separating reflections from images. Most current methods either rely on making strong assumptions on the source distributions (e.g. sparsity, low rank, repetitiveness) or rely on having training samples of each source in the mixture. In this work, we tackle the scenario of extracting an unobserved distribution additively mixed with a signal from an observed (arbitrary) distribution. We introduce a new method: Neural Egg Separation - an iterative method that learns to separate the known distribution from progressively finer estimates of the unknown distribution. In some settings, Neural Egg Separation is initialization sensitive, we therefore introduce GLO Masking which ensures a good initialization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms current methods that use the same level of supervision and often achieves similar performance to full supervision. Humans are remarkably good at separating data coming from a mixture of distributions, e.g. hearing a person speaking in a crowded cocktail party. Artificial intelligence, on the the hand, is far less adept at separating mixed signals. This is an important ability as signals in nature are typically mixed, e.g. speakers are often mixed with other speakers or environmental sounds, objects in images are typically seen along other objects as well as the background. Understanding mixed signals is harder than understanding pure sources, making source separation an important research topic.Mixed signal separation appears in many scenarios corresponding to different degrees of supervision. Most previous work focused on the following settings:Full supervision: The learner has access to a training set including samples of mixed signals {y i } \u2208 Y as well as the ground truth sources of the same signals {b i } \u2208 B and {x i } \u2208 X (such that y i = x i + b i ). Having such strong supervision is very potent, allowing the learner to directly learn a mapping from the mixed signal y i to its sources (x i , b i ). Obtaining such strong supervision is typically unrealistic, as it requires manual separation of mixed signals. Consider for example a musical performance, humans are often able to separate out the different sounds of the individual instruments, despite never having heard them play in isolation. The fully supervised setting does not allow the clean extraction of signals that cannot be observed in isolation e.g. music of a street performer, car engine noises or reflections in shop windows. GLO vs. Adversarial Masking: GLO Masking as a stand alone technique usually performed worse than Adversarial Masking. On the other hand, finetuning from GLO masks was far better than finetuning from adversarial masks. We speculate that mode collapse, inherent in adversarial training, makes the adversarial masks a lower bound on the X source distribution. GLOM can result in models that are too loose (i.e. that also encode samples outside of X ). But as an initialization for NES finetuning, it is better to have a model that is too loose than a model which is too tight.Supervision Protocol: Supervision is important for source separation. Completely blind source separation is not well specified and simply using general signal statistics is generally unlikely to yield competitive results. Obtaining full supervision by providing a labeled mask for training mixtures is unrealistic but even synthetic supervision in the form of a large training set of clean samples from each source distribution might be unavailable as some sounds are never observed on their own (e.g. sounds of car wheels). Our setting significantly reduces the required supervision to specifying if a certain sound sample contains or does not contain the unobserved source. Such supervision can be quite easily and inexpensively provided. For further sample efficiency increases, we hypothesize that it would be possible to label only a limited set of examples as containing the target sound and not, and to use this seed dataset to finetune a deep sound classifier to extract more examples from an unlabeled dataset. We leave this investigation to future work. In this paper we proposed a novel method-Neural Egg Separation-for separating mixtures of observed and unobserved distributions. We showed that careful initialization using GLO Masking improves results in challenging cases. Our method achieves much better performance than other methods and was usually competitive with full-supervision."
