    "title": "SB 1418",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. The federal Medicaid program provisions prohibit payment to a state for medical assistance furnished to an alien who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law. This bill would extend eligibility for full-scope Medi-Cal benefits to individuals 19 years of age and older who are otherwise eligible for those benefits but for their immigration status if the department determines that sufficient funding is available, or for limited scope Medi-Cal benefits if funding for full-scope benefits is not available. The bill would require these individuals to enroll into Medi-Cal managed care health plans, and to pay copayments and premium contributions, to the extent required of otherwise eligible Medi-Cal recipients who are similarly situated. The bill would require that benefits for those services to be provided with state-only funds only if federal financial participation is not available. Because counties are required to make Medi-Cal eligibility determinations and this bill would expand Medi-Cal eligibility, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the department to adopt regulations by July 1, 2018, and, commencing July 1, 2016, would require the department to provide a status report to the Legislature on a semiannual basis until regulations have been adopted. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute. Existing law provides for the regulation and licensure of clinical laboratories and clinical laboratory personnel by the State Department of Public Health and makes a violation of a provision under this law a misdemeanor. Existing law authorizes a person to request, and a licensed clinical laboratory or public health laboratory to perform specified clinical laboratory tests, including pregnancy, glucose level, cholesterol, and occult blood tests. Existing law authorizes a registered clinical laboratory to perform these tests if the test is subject to a certificate of waiver under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and the laboratory has registered with the State Department of Public Health. Existing law authorizes the results of the test to be provided directly to the person requesting the test if the test is on or for his or her own body. Existing law requires that those test results be provided in a manner that presents clear information and that identifies results indicating the need for referral to a physician. This bill would repeal those provisions and instead allow a person to request, and a licensed clinical laboratory or public health laboratory to perform, any laboratory test that the laboratory offers to the public on a direct access basis without a healing arts licensee\u2019s order. If a laboratory test is conducted without an order from a healing arts licensee, the bill would require any report of the test results to be provided to the person who was the subject of the test. The bill would require the report to state in bold type that it is the responsibility of the person who was tested to arrange with his or her health care provider for consultation and interpretation of the test results. The bill would make additional conforming changes. By changing the definition of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
