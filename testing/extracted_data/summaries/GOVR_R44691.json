    "content": "This report provides an overview of actions taken by Congress and the President to provide FY2017 appropriations for accounts funded by the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (LHHS) appropriations bill. This bill provides funding for all accounts funded through the annual appropriations process at the Departments of Labor (DOL) and Education (ED). It provides annual appropriations for most agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with certain exceptions (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration is funded via the Agriculture bill). The LHHS bill also provides funds for more than a dozen related agencies, including the Social Security Administration (SSA). Readers should be aware that the FY2017 appropriations cycle occurred during a presidential transition from the Administration of Barack H. Obama to the Administration of Donald J. Trump. This transition occurred in late January 2017, well after President Obama submitted his FY2017 budget request but before the FY2017 annual appropriations process concluded with President Trump signing into law an omnibus appropriations act. FY2017 Omnibus: On May 5, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31), which provided LHHS appropriations in Division H. FY2017 LHHS discretionary appropriations totaled $173.3 billion (including amounts provided by the omnibus and certain full-year appropriations provided by the second FY2017 continuing resolution). This amount is 1.8% more than FY2016 levels and 0.5% more than the FY2017 budget request from the Obama Administration. The omnibus also provided $760.6 billion in mandatory funding, for a combined FY2017 LHHS total of $934.0 billion. The distribution of discretionary funding is as follows: DOL: $12.1 billion, 0.7% less than FY2016. HHS: $78.1 billion, 3.6% more than FY2016. ED: $68.2 billion, 0.3% more than FY2016. Related Agencies: $14.9 billion, 1.8% more than FY2016. FY2017 Continuing Resolutions: The FY2017 omnibus followed three continuing resolutions (CRs), which had provided temporary LHHS funding earlier in the fiscal year (P.L. 115-30, P.L. 114-254, and P.L. 114-223). With limited exceptions, the second and third FY2017 CRs generally funded discretionary LHHS programs at FY2016 levels, minus a reduction of 0.1901%. The first FY2017 CR temporarily funded discretionary LHHS programs at FY2016 levels, minus a reduction of 0.496%. FY2017 House LHHS Action: The House Appropriations Committee's version of the FY2017 LHHS appropriations bill was ordered reported by the full committee on July 14, 2016, by a vote of 31-19, and reported to the House on July 22, 2016 (H.R. 5926). This bill would have provided $170.2 billion in discretionary LHHS funds, the same amount as FY2016. This amount would have been 1.3% less than the FY2017 President's request. In addition, the House committee bill would have provided an estimated $760.6 billion in mandatory funding, for a combined total of $930.9 billion for LHHS as a whole. The distribution of discretionary funding would have been as follows: DOL: $11.8 billion, 2.8% less than FY2016. HHS: $77.2 billion, 2.3% more than FY2016. ED: $67.0 billion, 1.6% less than FY2016. Related Agencies: $14.2 billion, 2.5% less than FY2016. FY2017 Senate LHHS Action: The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of the FY2017 LHHS appropriations bill on June 9, 2016 (S. 3040) by a vote of 29-1. This bill would have provided $171.6 billion in discretionary LHHS funds. This would have been 0.8% more than FY2016, and 0.5% less than the FY2017 President's request. In addition, the Senate committee bill would have provided an estimated $760.6 billion in mandatory funding, for a combined total of $932.2 billion for LHHS as a whole. The distribution of discretionary funding would have been as follows: DOL: $12.0 billion, 1.1% less than FY2016. HHS: $76.8 billion, 1.9% more than FY2016. ED: $67.8 billion, 0.3% less than FY2016. Related Agencies: $14.9 billion, 1.8% more than FY2016. FY2017 President's Budget Request: On February 9, 2016, the Obama Administration released the FY2017 President's budget. The President requested $172.5 billion in discretionary funding for accounts funded by the LHHS bill, which would have been an increase of 1.3% from FY2016 levels. In addition, the President requested $760.6 billion in annually appropriated mandatory funding, for a total of $933.1 billion for the LHHS bill as a whole. The distribution of discretionary funding would have been as follows: DOL: $12.8 billion, 5.2% more than FY2016. HHS: $74.7 billion, 0.9% less than FY2016. ED: $69.4 billion, 2.0% more than FY2016. Related Agencies: $15.6 billion, 6.4% more than FY2016."
