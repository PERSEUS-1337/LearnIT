    "content": "The Modified Water Deliveries Project (Mod Waters) is a controversial ecological restoration project in south Florida designed to improve water delivery to Everglades National Park. The implementation schedule of Mod Waters is of interest to Congress partly because its completion is required before the implementation of portions of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Concerns have been raised in hearings on the Administration's FY2007 budget request regarding the cost of implementing the project, project delays, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' role in funding the project. Currently, the project is eight years behind schedule and will cost an estimated $400 million to build. Part of the delay is due to extended efforts to acquire land from private and state owners. Federal agencies have used eminent domain to acquire some lands, a process that has been contentious. Further, funding for the project in Interior appropriations acts (FY2004-FY2006) is being conditioned on the State of Florida meeting water quality standards by reducing excessive phosphorus, among other things. This report provides background on Mod Waters and discusses issues relating to its current status, funding, and land acquisition needs. This report will be updated as warranted."
