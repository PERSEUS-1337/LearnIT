    "title": "An act to add Section 7514.7 to the Government Code, relating to retirement.",
    "content": "The California Constitution commits to the retirement board of a public pension or retirement system plenary authority and fiduciary responsibility for investment of moneys and administration of the system. Existing law requires a retirement board to develop and implement a policy requiring disclosure of payments to placement agents, as defined, in connection with system investments in or through external managers that includes prescribed elements. Existing law requires disclosure of campaign contributions or gifts made by a placement agent to any member of a public pension retirement board, as specified. Existing law requires a public retirement system to obtain an actuarial valuation of the system not less than triennially and submit audited financial statements to the State Controller who then publishes a report on the financial condition of public retirement systems. This bill, for new contracts entered into on and after January 1, 2017, and for existing contracts for which a new capital commitment is made on or after January 1, 2017, would require a public investment fund, as defined, to require alternative investment vehicles, as defined, to make specified disclosures regarding fees, expenses, and carried interest in connection with these vehicles and the underlying investments, as well as other specified information. Consistent with requirements relating to public records, the bill would require a public investment fund to disclose the information received in connection with alternative investment vehicles and the gross and net rate of return of each alternative investment vehicle, as specified, at least once annually at a meeting open to the public. The bill would require a public investment fund to undertake reasonable efforts to obtain the above-mentioned information for any existing contract for which the public investment fund has not made a new capital commitment on or after January 1, 2017. The bill would make a statement of legislative intent. Because this bill would impose new requirements on local entities relating to the collection of information and its presentation at an open meeting, it would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose. This bill would make legislative findings to that effect. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
