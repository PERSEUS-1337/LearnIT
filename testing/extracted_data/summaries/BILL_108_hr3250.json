    "content": "Child Nutrition Improvement Act of 2003 - Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (NSLA) to revise school lunch program requirements relating to fluid milk. Requires school lunches to offer students a variety of flavored and unflavored milk, as determined by the school. Allows schools or institutions participating in the program to offer a la carte fluid milk products to be sold in addition to and, at the school's option, adjacent to fluid milk offered as part of a reimbursable meal. Prohibits program participants from directly or indirectly restricting the sale or marketing of fluid milk products by the school or by a person approved by the school at any time or any place on the school premises or at any school-sponsored event. Establishes a program of increased reimbursement rates for school lunches under NSLA and for school breakfasts under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (CNA), to be provided as an incentive to schools and institutions that increase consumption of fluid milk by children in their meals there. Establishes a program of grants to schools that implement healthy school environment programs with respect to the nutrition, including availability of healthy food choices, and the physical activity of the children there."
