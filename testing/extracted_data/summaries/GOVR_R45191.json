    "content": "Covert action and clandestine activities of the intelligence community and activities of the military may appear similar, but they involve different notification requirements and usually are conducted under different authorities of the U. S. Code. The requirements for notifying Congress of activities of the intelligence community originated from instances in the 1970s when media disclosure of past intelligence abuses underscored reasons for Congress taking a more active role in oversight. Over time, these requirements were written into statute or became custom. Section 3091 of Title 50, U. S. Code requires the President of the United States to ensure that the congressional intelligence committees are \"kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence activities of the United States, including any significant anticipated intelligence activity,\" significant intelligence failures, illegal intelligence activities, and financial intelligence activities. Intelligence activities also include covert action as outlined under Section 3093(e) of Title 50, U.S. Code. Section 3092 of Title 50, U. S. Code sets out the congressional notification requirements for non-covert action intelligence activities. Section 3093 of Title 50 sets out the congressional notification requirements for covert actions. Both sections 3092 and 3093 explicitly state such notification is to be provided to the \"extent consistent with due regard for the protection from unauthorized disclosure of classified information relating to sensitive intelligence sources and methods, or other exceptionally sensitive matters.\" The President and intelligence committees are responsible for establishing the procedures for notification, which are generally to be done in writing. Partly in deference to this higher standard, such notifications are sometimes limited to specific subgroups of Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives in certain circumstances, as defined by law and custom."
