    "content": "The Obama Administration's efforts to normalize relations with Cuba focused attention on U.S. policies on immigration and federal assistance that apply to Cuban migrants in the United States\u2014a set of policies that afford Cuban nationals unique immigration privileges. The November 2016 death of Cuba's Fidel Castro may lead to further consideration of these issues. \"Normal\" immigration from Cuba to the United States has not existed since the Cuban Revolution of 1959 brought Fidel Castro to power. For more than 50 years, the majority of Cubans who have entered the United States have done so through special humanitarian provisions of federal law. U.S. policy on Cuban migration has been shaped by a 1966 law known as the Cuban Adjustment Act, as amended, and U.S.-Cuban migration agreements signed in the mid-1990s, operating in conjunction with the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Among the special immigration policies presently in place is a so-called \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy toward Cuban migrants who try to reach the U.S. shore by sea. \"Wet foot\" refers to Cubans who do not reach the United States. They are returned to Cuba unless they cite a well-founded fear of persecution, in which case, they are considered for resettlement in third countries. \"Dry foot\" is a reference to Cubans who successfully reach the U.S. shore and are generally permitted to stay in the country. After one year, these individuals can apply to become U.S. lawful permanent residents (LPRs) under the Cuban Adjustment Act. In addition to entering the United States under special policies and becoming LPRs through the Cuban Adjustment Act, Cubans can gain permanent admission to the United States through certain standard immigration pathways set forth in the INA. They can be sponsored for U.S. permanent residence by eligible U.S.-based relatives who are U.S. citizens or LPRs through the U.S. family-based immigration system. They can also apply for asylum from within the United States or at a U.S. port of entry, or they can be considered for refugee status abroad. Persons granted asylum or admitted to the United States as refugees can apply for LPR status after one year. Special provisions of law also make Cuban migrants in the United States eligible for federal assistance. The Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980 defines the term \"Cuban and Haitian entrant\" for purposes of eligibility for federal assistance. It makes these entrants eligible for the same resettlement assistance as refugees. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996, as amended, makes Cuban and Haitian entrants eligible for certain federal public benefits to the same extent as refugees. The steps taken by the Obama Administration to normalize relations with Cuba have raised questions about the possibility of future changes to U.S. policy toward Cuban migrants through either executive or congressional action. Regarding the latter, legislation was introduced in the 114th Congress to repeal the Cuban Adjustment Act and eliminate the special treatment that Cuban entrants receive with respect to federal refugee resettlement assistance and other federal assistance. It remains to be seen whether Congress will act on any such measures. For an overview of current issues in U.S.-Cuban relations, see CRS Report R43926, Cuba: Issues for the 114th Congress."
