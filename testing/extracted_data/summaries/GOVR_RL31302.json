    "content": "The Treasury and General Government accounts are funded for FY2003 through the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003 ( P.L. 108-7 ; Division J). Because the accounts in thisappropriation were not funded, other than under continuing resolution, as the 107th Congressadjourned, legislation was required for that purpose early in the 108th Congress. During the interim,the accounts were funded at FY2002 enacted levels. P.L. 108-7 also requires a rescission across alldiscretionary funding within the Act. On February 4, 2002, President George W. Bush submitted his FY2003 budget to Congress. The budget documents show, for accounts funded through the Treasury, Postal Service, and GeneralGovernment appropriations bill, a proposed FY2003 discretionary budget authority of $18.7 billion,an increase over FY2002 estimates by just under $1 billion. Many of the FY2002 estimates offeredearlier in the year are no longer current because they have been affected by supplementalappropriations, largely in response to the September 11 attacks. H.R. 5120 , as passed by the House July 24, 2002, would have provided $18.5 billion in discretionary funding. The total for the bill would have been $35.1 billion. This wouldrepresent a 3.1% increase over FY2002, including supplemental and emergency funding. Afterscorekeeping adjustments, including $745 million associated with the Administration's accrualfunding proposal, the committee's mark was $147.6 million above FY2002 appropriations and$207.8 million below the Administration request. S. 2740 , as reported by the SenateCommittee on Appropriations, would have provided a total of $34.8 billion to fund the accounts. Discretionary funding under the reported measure would be $18.5 billion. The FY2002appropriation, P.L. 107-67 , totaled $32.4 billion. Congressional Budget Office scorekeeping put thetotals at $32.8 billion ($15.7 billion mandatory and $17.1 billion discretionary). Several of theaccounts were also receiving funding through the Emergency Response Fund under P.L. 107-38 and P.L. 107-117 . Accounts in the Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, U.S. Customs Service, U.S. Secret Service, and the General Services Administration usually receivefunding for functions related to countering terrorism. Emergency Response Fund allocations, asprovided by P.L. 107-38 , the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from andResponse to Terrorist Attacks on the United States, FY2001, have gone to accounts in theDepartment of the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President, and the General ServicesAdministration. Three major entities covered by the Treasury and General Governmentappropriation are being transferred to the newly created Department of Homeland Security. Thoseare the U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Federal Protective Service of theGeneral Services Administration. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms will be renamedand transferred to the Department of Justice.
