    "content": "United States Agricultural Products Market Access Act of 1997 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to direct the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to identify those foreign countries that: (1) deny fair and equitable market access to US agricultural products or apply standards for the importation of US agricultural products that are not related to public health concerns or cannot be substantiated by reliable analytical methods. And (2) are determined by the USTR to be priority foreign countries. Limits the identification of priority foreign countries to those that engage in the most onerous or egregious acts which have the greatest adverse impact on the relevant US products. Provides that if available information indicates that such action is appropriate, the USTR may at any time: (1) revoke the identification of any foreign country as a priority foreign country. Or (2) identify any foreign country as a priority foreign country. Subjects priority foreign countries to investigation by means other than a petition. Authorizes the USTR, with respect to an investigation of a country identified as denying fair and equitable market access to US agricultural products, to request the Secretary of Agriculture to direct the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture to review certifications for the facilities of such country that export meat and other agricultural products to the United States."
