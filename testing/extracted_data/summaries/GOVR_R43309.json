    "content": "This report examines the impact of Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda), which struck the central Philippines on November 8, 2013, and the U.S. and international response. Haiyan was one of the strongest typhoons to strike land on record. Over a 16 hour period, the \"super typhoon,\" with a force equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane and sustained winds of up to 195 mph, directly swept through six provinces in the central Philippines. The disaster quickly created a humanitarian crisis. In some of the hardest hit areas, particularly in coastal communities in Leyte province and the southern tip of Eastern Samar, the storm knocked out power, telecommunications, and water supplies. The humanitarian relief operation was initially hampered by a number of significant obstacles, including a general lack of transportation, extremely limited communications systems, damaged infrastructure, and seriously disrupted government services. Despite the physical and logistical challenges, regular relief activities reportedly reached most of the worst-stricken areas within two weeks of the storm. Two and a half months after the typhoon struck, United Nations (U.N.) agencies reported that 14.1 million people had been affected, with more than 4.1 million displaced. Estimates of the number killed had risen to 6,201 with more than 1,785 missing. The number of injured was unknown. In addition, assessments revealed that an estimated 1.1 million houses had been damaged or destroyed and nearly 5.6 million people required food assistance. Ongoing humanitarian relief operations and recovery efforts are being led by the Philippine government. The United Nations, along with other partners, including the United States, remains at the forefront of the on-the-ground response. Apart from U.N. agencies, those responding to the crisis include international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Agencies (PVOs), and bilateral and multilateral donors. As of January 31, 2014, international donors have contributed a total of $662.9 million to the relief efforts. U.S. assistance has included approximately $87 million in disaster aid and $59 million in private sector contributions, a massive U.S. military humanitarian effort, as well as diplomatic and legislative activity. At their peak, 66 U.S. military aircraft and 12 naval vessels were involved in relief efforts and nearly 1,000 U.S. military personnel were deployed directly to the disaster areas. The USS George Washington naval task force as well as elements of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit from Okinawa formed the majority of Joint Task Force (JTF) 505, which coordinated and carried out U.S. military relief efforts (Operation Damayan) in cooperation with the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine government. U.S. military assistance included clearing roads, transporting aid workers, distributing 2,495 tons of relief supplies, and evacuating over 21,000 people. More than two months after the storm, humanitarian assistance is still required in some affected areas, particularly food, clean water, shelter, and basic health care. The Philippine government launched an $8.2 billion, four-year plan, Reconstruction Assistance in Yolanda (RAY), which focuses on rebuilding areas affected by the typhoon and developing resilience to natural disasters. The U.N. Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), in partnership with U.N. organizations and non-governmental and international organizations, designed a Strategic Response Plan (SRP) to support the Philippines government's activities in meeting immediate humanitarian needs and reconstruction goals. The United States and the Philippines maintain close ties stemming from the U.S. colonial period (1898-1946), a security alliance, and common strategic and economic interests. Other pillars of the bilateral relationship include shared democratic values and extensive people-to-people contacts. The involvement of U.S. military forces in Haiyan relief efforts bolstered support for enhanced U.S.-Philippine military cooperation, an issue that the two sides have been discussing intensively during the past several months. Congressional concerns related to the storm and its aftermath include the short-term U.S. and international humanitarian response, the long-term U.S. foreign aid strategy for the Philippines, and how the U.S. response to the disaster may impact the U.S.-Philippines relationship as well as regional geopolitical dynamics. This report will be updated as events warrant. For background and information on the Philippines, see CRS Report RL33233, The Republic of the Philippines and U.S. Interests.
