    "title": "A bill to limit the civil liability of business entities that make available to a nonprofit organization the use of a motor vehicle or aircraft.",
    "content": "Shields a business entity from civil liability relating to any injury or death occurring as a result of the operation of an aircraft or a motor vehicle of a business entity loaned to a nonprofit organization for use outside the scope of business of the business entity if: (1) such injury or death occurs during a period that such vehicle or aircraft is used by such organization. And (2) the business entity authorized the use by the organization of the vehicle or aircraft that resulted in the injury or death. Makes this Act inapplicable to an injury or death that results from an act or omission of a business entity that constitutes gross negligence or intentional misconduct, including misconduct that: (1) constitutes a hate crime or a crime of violence or act of international terrorism for which the defendant has been convicted in any court. Or (2) involves a sexual offense for which the defendant has been convicted in any court, or misconduct for which the defendant has been found to have violated a Federal or State civil rights law. Preempts State laws to the extent that such laws are inconsistent with this Act, except State law that provides additional protection from liability. Specifies that this Act shall not be construed to supersede any Federal or State health or safety law. Makes this Act inapplicable to any civil action in a State court against a volunteer, nonprofit organization, or governmental entity in which all parties are citizens of the State if such State, citing this Act's authority and containing no other provision, enacts a statute declaring the State's election that this Act not apply to such action in the State."
