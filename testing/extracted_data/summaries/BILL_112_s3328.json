Defines at-risk youth as individuals under age 18 who are at risk of educational failure or involvement in delinquent activities.

Gives priority to grant applicants that: (1) serve at-risk youth in high crime areas. (2) have at least 60 of their youth eligible to receive funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.
