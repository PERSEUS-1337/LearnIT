    "content": "The FY2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies appropriations bill (THUD) provides funding for the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and five independent agencies related to these two departments. The Bush Administration requested $100.3 billion (after scorekeeping adjustments) for FY2008, an increase of $300 million (less than 1%) over FY2007. DOT would receive $64.5 billion, $1.3 billion more than provided in FY2007. HUD would receive $35.6 billion, $1.0 billion less than provided in FY2007. A conference agreement (H.Rept. 110-446) on H.R. 3074, the FY2008 THUD appropriations bill, followed both the House- and Senate-passed versions of the bill in recommending more funding for both DOT and HUD than requested by the Administration. The conference agreement was published on November 13, 2007, and brought to the House floor and approved on November 14. The President threatened to veto the conference agreement because it exceeded the amount requested. The Senate did not take up the agreement. On December 19, 2007, a revised THUD appropriations act was passed as Division K of H.R. 2764, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2008 (P.L. 110-161). Division K, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2008, provided $103.6 billion (after rescissions and other adjustments) in total budgetary resources for the agencies included in the THUD appropriations bill, $4.0 billion more than the FY2007 level, $3.3 billion over the Administration request, and $2.2 billion less than the amount agreed in H.Rept. 110-446. DOT received $65.5 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion over FY2007. HUD received $37.6 billion, $1.4 billion over the FY2007 level. For DOT, the agreement recommended increases in the requested level for highways, transit, Amtrak, and aviation. The agreement also included a provision included in both the House- and Senate-passed bills that would bar FY2008 funding from being used to establish a cross-border trucking demonstration program, which allows Mexican trucking companies to operate beyond the commercial zones on the United States-Mexico border. DOT has announced that it would not establish any new cross-border trucking demonstration programs, but would continue to operate the program it established on September 6, 2007 (after passage of the House and Senate THUD bills but before passage of the final appropriations act). For HUD, the agreement recommends increases in the requested level for Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance, Housing for the Elderly, Housing for the Disabled, and the Community Development Block Grant program, and recommends funding for HUD programs that were slated for elimination in the President's budget. The act includes a 2% rescission applied to funding designated for projects under certain programs whose funding is extensively earmarked. This report will not be updated."
