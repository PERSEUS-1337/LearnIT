    "content": "Student Visa Reform Act - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to require that a person coming to study at a college, university, or language training program in the United States under a nonimmigrant student F-visa must attend an institution that is accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of Education. Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to require academic institutions to be similarly accredited for F-visa purposes if: (1) the institution is not already required to be accredited, (2) an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of Education is able to provide such accreditation, and (3) 25 or more F-visa foreign students are or will be pursuing a course of study at the institution. Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive the accreditation requirement for an established college, university, or language training program that is otherwise in compliance with F-visa provisions and is making a good faith effort to satisfy the accreditation requirement. Prohibits a person convicted of certain felony offenses, including human trafficking or visa fraud relating to an academic institution's participation in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), from having subsequent ownership or substantial authority at an academic institution participating in SEVP. Provides a three-year exemption for students coming to study at a college or university that has been certified by the Secretary of Homeland Security but not yet accredited or denied accreditation by an accrediting agency."
