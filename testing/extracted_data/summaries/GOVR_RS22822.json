    "content": "The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-140) sets new performance standards for many common light bulbs. Tier I standards require a 25%-30% increase in the energy efficiency of typical light bulbs beginning in 2012, and still greater improvements through Tier II standards starting in 2020. Supporters expect these new measures to save consumers billions of dollars in electricity costs, offset the need to build dozens of new power plants, and cut millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Efficient lighting products such as compact fluorescent lights and light emitting diodes have advanced rapidly in recent years. Light quality has improved, costs have declined, and consumer choice has expanded. Still, many consumers prefer traditional incandescent lighting products. Incandescent bulbs are not banned or outlawed by the new law, but they will need to meet the new efficiency standards to remain on the market. Some new incandescent products already available can meet Tier I requirements, and at least one manufacturer claims that it will have advanced incandescent products available in time to meet the Tier II requirements. The Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act (H.R. 5616) was introduced on March 13, 2008, to repeal the new standards unless special provisions are met."
