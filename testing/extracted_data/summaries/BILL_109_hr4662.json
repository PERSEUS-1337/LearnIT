    "content": "Consumer Telephone Records Protection Act of 2006 - Prohibits any person from obtaining or causing the disclosure of, or requesting another person to obtain, customer proprietary network information relating to another person by: (1) making a false statement to a telecommunications carrier. Or (2) providing any information knowing that it is counterfeit, that it was obtained fraudulently or without the customer's consent, or that it contains a false statement. Prohibits a person from selling customer information relating to any other person knowing it was obtained in such manner. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to require each telecommunications carrier to notify a customer when proprietary network information relating to such customer is disclosed in violation of such prohibitions. Treats a violation as an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Gives all of the functions and powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under that Act to the FCC to enforce compliance. Prescribes penalties, which double for violations that are part of a pattern of illegal activity."
