    "content": "Humans easily recognize object parts and their hierarchical structure by watching how they move; they can then predict how each part moves in the future. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation that simultaneously learns a hierarchical, disentangled object representation and a dynamics model for object parts from unlabeled videos. Our Parts, Structure, and Dynamics (PSD) model learns to, first, recognize the object parts via a layered image representation; second, predict hierarchy via a structural descriptor that composes low-level concepts into a hierarchical structure; and third, model the system dynamics by predicting the future. Experiments on multiple real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our PSD model works well on all three tasks: segmenting object parts, building their hierarchical structure, and capturing their motion distributions. What makes an object an object? Researchers in cognitive science have made profound investigations into this fundamental problem; results suggest that humans, even young infants, recognize objects as continuous, integrated regions that move together BID6 BID52 . Watching objects move, infants gradually build the internal notion of objects in their mind. The whole process requires little external supervision from experts.Motion gives us not only the concept of objects and parts, but also their hierarchical structure. The classic study from BID27 reveals that humans recognize the structure of a human body from a few moving dots representing the keypoints on a human skeleton. This connects to the classic Gestalt theory in psychology BID31 , which argues that human perception is holistic and generative, explaining scenes as a whole instead of in isolation. In addition to being unsupervised and hierarchical, our perception gives us concepts that are fully interpretable and disentangled. With an object-based representation, we are able to reason about object motion, predict what is going to happen in the near future, and imagine counterfactuals like \"what happens if?\" BID52 How can we build machines of such competency? Would that be possible to have an artificial system that learns an interpretable, hierarchical representation with system dynamics, purely from raw visual data with no human annotations? Recent research in unsupervised and generative deep representation learning has been making progress along this direction: there have been models that efficiently explain multiple objects in a scene BID24 , some simultaneously learning an interpretable representation BID9 . Most existing models however either do not produce a structured, hierarchical object representation, or do not characterize system dynamics.In this paper, we propose a novel formulation that learns an interpretable, hierarchical object representation and scene dynamics by predicting the future. Our model requires no human annotations, learning purely from unlabeled videos of paired frames. During training, the model sees videos of objects moving; during testing, it learns to recognize and segment each object and its parts, build their hierarchical structure, and model their motion distribution for future frame synthesis, all from a single image. Figure 1: Observing human moving, humans are able to perceive disentangled object parts, understand their hierarchical structure, and capture their corresponding motion fields (without any annotations).Our model, named Parts, Structure, and Dynamics (PSD), learns to recognize the object parts via a layered image representation. PSD learns their hierarchy via a structural descriptor that composes low-level concepts into a hierarchical structure. Formulated as a fully differentiable module, the structural descriptor can be end-to-end trained within a neural network. PSD learns to model the system dynamics by predicting the future.We evaluate our model in many possible ways. On real and synthetic datasets, we first examine its ability in learning the concept of objects and segmenting them. We then compute the likelihood that it correctly captures the hierarchical structure in the data. We finally validate how well it characterizes object motion distribution and predicts the future. Our system works well on all these tasks, with minimal input requirement (two frames during training, and one during testing). While previous state-of-the-art methods that jointly discover objects, relations, and predict future frames only work on binary images of shapes and digits, our PSD model works well on complex real-world RGB images and requires fewer input frames. We have presented a novel formulation that simultaneously discovers object parts, their hierarchical structure, and the system dynamics from unlabeled videos. Our model uses a layered image representation to discover basic concepts and a structural descriptor to compose them. Experiments suggest that it works well on both real and synthetic datasets for part segmentation, hierarchical structure recovery, and motion prediction. We hope our work will inspire future research along the direction of learning structural object representations from raw sensory inputs."
