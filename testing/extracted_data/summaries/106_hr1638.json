    "title": "Small Business and Financial Institutions Tax Relief Act of 1999",
    "content": "Permits S corporation eligible shareholders to include individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Exempts from prohibited transaction rules any sale of stock in an IRA pursuant to a small business corporation's election to be an S corporation. Excludes from the definition of passive income for purposes of S status termination any interest income earned by or dividends on assets required to be held by a bank, a bank holding company, or a qualified subchapter S subsidiary bank. Increases from 75 to 150 the maximum number of shareholders a small business organization may have to be eligible to elect S corporation treatment. States that stock held by a bank director as required by banking regulations shall not be considered a disqualifying second class of S corporation stock. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to modify a certain regulation to permit an S corporation bank to treat certain bad debt deductions as built-in losses during the entire period during which the bank recognized built-in gains from changing its accounting method for recognizing bad debts from the reserve method to the charge-off method. Includes all banks within the three-year deduction preference rule. Repeals the current requirement that partnership rules apply to S corporations rules for health insurance costs of self-employed individuals to two-percent shareholders in S corporations, except that a two-percent shareholder's wages shall be treated as self-employed earned income. (Section 11 (sic)) Reduces from 100 percent to 90 percent the percentage of shares held by shareholders necessary for consent to election by a small business organization to be an S corporation. Prescribes rules for such consent. Revises exceptions to the criteria for the treatment of certain wholly owned subchapter S subsidiaries with reference to required information returns."
