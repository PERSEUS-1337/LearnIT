    "content": "The 109th Congress is considering legislation to reauthorize and amend programs that werecreated or revised in the 1996 welfare reform law. Early in 2005, the Senate Committees on Financeand Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) reported their welfare reauthorization legislation(respectively, S. 667 and S. 525 ). These bills have yet to see floor actionand remain pending in the Senate. The House passed welfare reauthorization as part of its spendingbudget reconciliation bill (the House-passed version of S. 1932 ). The Senate-passed spending reconciliation bill does not include welfare reauthorization provisions. Both the Senate Finance Committee bill and the House reconciliation bill would reauthorizethrough FY2010 and revise the block grant of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). They both revise TANF work participation standards aimed to require more families on the welfarerolls to work or participate in job preparation activities. The Senate committee bill would allow abroad range of activities engaged in by recipients to count toward meeting these standards, while theHouse bill would narrow the focus of activities to work or \"workfare\" outside of a four-monthperiod. Both the Senate committee and House reconciliation bills also would establish $200 millionper year in grants to promote \"healthy\" marriages. Both the Senate committee and House reconciliation bills would extend and increase fundingfor mandatory child care, though the size of the funding increase is a major difference between thetwo proposals -- $6 billion over five years in the Senate committee bill and $0.5 billion over fiveyears in the House bill. Both would also reauthorize the Child Care and Development Block Grant(CCDBG), increasing its authorization to $3.1 billion by FY2010, and would revise CCDBG rules,including those related to making school-readiness a program goal and increasing the percentage offunds to improve the quality of child care. Both the Senate committee and House reconciliation bills would revise the Child SupportEnforcement program to provide financing options for states to pay more collected child support tofamilies on TANF or who have left the rolls. (Generally, federal and state governments keep childsupport collected for TANF families as reimbursement for their welfare costs.) The Senatecommittee bill would provide partial federal funding for child support passed through to families --up to $400 per month for one child and $600 per month for two or more children. The House billwould provide partial federal funding to states that increase the amount of passed-through childsupport. The House reconciliation bill also would reduce federal funding to the states to operatetheir child support programs. Both Senate committee and House bills would also establish\"responsible fatherhood\" programs to fund activities to increase the participation of noncustodialparents in their children's lives. The Senate committee bill would provide $50 million per year inmandatory funding (and authorize another $26 million per year); the House reconciliation bill wouldauthorize (but not provide funding) for up to $20 million per year. This report will be updated asneeded."
