    "content": "When the House considers legislation, one of the last steps it takes is to consider a motion to recommit. The motion to recommit represents the last chance of the House to affect a measure. In practice, that means either to offer amendatory language or to send the bill back to committee. The motion to recommit is typically offered after the previous question has been ordered on a measure, but before the House votes on final passage. Preference in recognition for offering a motion to recommit is given to a member of the minority party who is opposed to the bill. It is not in order for the House Committee on Rules to report a special rule that would preclude the offering a motion to recommit a bill or joint resolution prior to its initial passage, including a motion to recommit which contains amendatory instructions. Motions to recommit are of two types: \"straight\" motions and motions that include instructions. If adopted, a \"straight\" motion to recommit sends a measure to committee with no requirement for further consideration by the House. A successful motion to recommit with instructions allows any amendatory language included in the motion to be adopted immediately without the measure leaving the House floor. A motion to recommit may have various procedural effects, including amending an underlying measure, sending it to one or more committees, providing additional time for its consideration, or potentially disposing of the legislation. The motion to recommit might also have political effects. During the 110th Congress, there were three significant statistical trends pertaining to motions to recommit: an increase in the total number of motions to recommit, a disproportionate increase in motions with \"non-forthwith\" instructions (a type of motion to recommit that is no longer in order under current House Rules), and a rise in the adoption of motions to recommit \"forthwith.\" When compared with the 110th Congress, the 111th Congress experienced a decrease in motions to recommit and a slight decrease in the adoption of motions to recommit. This report provides an overview of House rules and precedents governing the motion to recommit, describes procedural and political effects of the motion, and examines the use of the motion since the 100th Congress. This report will be updated to reflect any changes in House rules governing the usage of the motion to recommit."
