    "content": "Bridges from Jobs to Careers Act - Directs the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs) to improve remedial education, customize remediation to student career goals, and help remedial students progress into and through for-credit occupational programs. Gives grant priority to IHEs: (1) in which at least 50 of the first-year students are enrolled in remedial courses designed to give them collegiate reading, writing, or mathematics skills. And (2) that propose to collaborate with adult education providers and replicate practices that have proven effective with adults."
