    "content": "For several years, some Members of Congress have favored \"comprehensive immigration reform\" (CIR), a label that commonly refers to omnibus legislation that includes increased border security and immigration enforcement, expanded employment eligibility verification, revision of nonimmigrant visas and legal permanent immigration, and legalization for some unauthorized aliens residing in the country. The omnibus legislative approach contrasts with incremental revisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) that would address some but not all of these elements, and with sequential reforms that would tackle border security and interior enforcement provisions prior to revising legal immigration or enacting legalization pathways. Leaders in both chambers have identified immigration as a legislative priority in the 113th Congress. While the House Committee on the Judiciary has ordered reported several distinct pieces of legislation that aim to reform immigration law thus far in the 113th Congress, the debate in the Senate has focused on a single CIR bill: the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744). This report summarizes major provisions of S. 744, which the Senate amended and passed by a yea-nay vote of 68-32 on June 27, 2013. CRS's analysis of S. 744 focuses on eight major policy areas that encompass the U.S. immigration debate: comprehensive reform \"triggers\" and funding; border security; interior enforcement; employment eligibility verification and worksite enforcement; legalization of unauthorized aliens; immigrant visas; nonimmigrant visas; and humanitarian provisions. Among the border and enforcement-related provisions in Senate-passed S. 744 are a number of provisions aimed at strengthening border security, including increased border security personnel, equipment, and infrastructure. The bill would mandate new border security strategies and the development of new border metrics that would be designed to achieve \"effective control\" of the Southern border. Most notably, S. 744 would authorize $44.5 billion in spending for additional border patrol agents, border fencing, and an electronic exit system to collect machine readable data at air and sea ports of entry. The legislation would also authorize $750 million for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to implement a mandatory electronic employment verification system to be used by all employers. Furthermore, S. 744 would amend the INA to create additional grounds of inadmissibility and deportability, while broadening judges' discretion to waive some of these grounds. For certain immigration offenses, the bill would increase civil and misdemeanor penalties for first-time offenses and impose felony penalties when aggravating circumstances exist. The bill would amend INA provisions on unlawful reentry to increase criminal penalties. S. 744 would provide additional resources to immigration courts and would encourage alternatives to detention and strengthen detention standards and congressional oversight of immigrant detention. Special provisions would be included to protect children who are affected by immigration enforcement. In turn, S. 744 would amend the INA to provide pathways for unauthorized aliens to adjust their immigration status to one of the proposed new statuses\u2014\"registered provisional immigrant\" (RPI) status and \"blue card\" status\u2014and ultimately legal permanent resident (LPR) status after specified border security and interior enforcement criteria are met. In addition to these legalization provisions, S. 744 would also accelerate the admission of an estimated 4 to 7 million foreign nationals who have pending petitions to become LPRs. S. 744 would substantially revise the categories for the admission of LPRs, eliminating the category for siblings of U.S. citizens, shifting the allocation of the other family-based categories, permitting more categories of LPRs to enter without numerical limits, and increasing the number of employment-based LPRs. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the changes to the legal immigration system would result in an increase of 9.6 million LPRs in the first decade after enactment. Senate-passed S. 744 would revise and expand nonimmigrant (i.e., temporary immigration) programs for high- and low-skilled workers, as well as for tourists, students, and other nonimmigrants. The bill would increase the cap on professional specialty workers (H-1B workers), while also imposing new requirements on businesses that employ H-1B workers, as well as those that employ intra-company transferees (L visas). Reforms would be made to the existing H-2B visa for lower-skilled non-agricultural workers in temporary or seasonal employment, while the H-2A visa for agricultural workers would be phased out. New nonimmigrant visas (the proposed W visas) would be established for lower-skilled agricultural and non-agricultural workers that would be more flexible for employers, while also expanding certain rights for workers. Additional nonimmigrant visa changes would facilitate temporary immigration by doctors, investors, and aliens from certain countries with U.S. trade agreements; encourage tourism within the United States; and strengthen oversight of foreign students and summer-work study exchanges, among other changes. An accompanying report, CRS Report R43099, Comprehensive Immigration Reform in the 113th Congress: Short Summary of Major Legislative Proposals, offers an overview of S. 744 as well."
