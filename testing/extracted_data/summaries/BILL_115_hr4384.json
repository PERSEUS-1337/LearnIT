    "content": "Act to Sustain the Protection of Immigrant Residents Earned through TPS Act of 2017 or the ASPIRE-TPS Act of 2017 This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide six-year, renewable protected status for an alien who: (1) as of January 1, 2017, had been granted or was eligible for deferred enforced departure or temporary protected status, (2) has continuously resided in the United States for five years, (3) is admissible as an immigrant, and (4) registers as required. Aliens may work while in protected status. Protected status shall be withdrawn if an alien was not entitled to such status or fails to register with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) every 36 months. Absences from the United States of one year or less shall not break residence continuity. Absences longer than one year shall break residence continuity unless the alien establishes that he or she did not abandon US residency. DHS shall adjust the status of an alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the alien: (1) meets certain eligibility requirements. (2) establishes that removal would result in extreme hardship to the alien or to the alien's US citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse, parent, or child, and (3) submits an application."
