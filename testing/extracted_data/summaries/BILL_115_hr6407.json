    "content": "Computers for Veterans and Students Act of 2018 or the COVS Act This bill directs federal agencies to offer, through the General Services Administration (GSA), to transfer surplus computers and technology equipment to nonprofit computer refurbishers for repair and distribution to educational institutions, veterans, disabled individuals, low-income individuals, students, and seniors in need. Each nonprofit computer refurbisher to whom the GSA transfers a surplus computer or technology equipment must offer training programs for such an institution or individual on how to use the computer or equipment. The bill prohibits the GSA from requiring that a nonprofit computer refurbisher repair and distribute any surplus computer or technology equipment within a specific period of time."
