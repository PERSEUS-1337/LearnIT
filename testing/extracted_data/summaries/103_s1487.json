    "content": "Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of 1993 - Grants the President the authority to suspend specified provisions of law which prohibit foreign and United Nations assistance to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the receipt or expenditure of PLO funds, and PLO membership in the International Monetary Fund, upon certification to specified congressional committees that: (1) such waiver is in the national interest. And (2) the PLO continues to abide by commitments made in letters to Israel and the Foreign Minister of Norway and under the Declaration of Principles signed in September 1993. Makes such suspensions effective until January 1, 1994, or an earlier date specified by the President. Declares that the Congress expects that any extension of the President's authority will be conditional on the PLO: (1) renouncing the Arab League boycott of Israel. And (2) urging the Arab League, and cooperating with efforts by the President, to end such boycott. Provides that this Act supersedes similar provisions of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1994."
