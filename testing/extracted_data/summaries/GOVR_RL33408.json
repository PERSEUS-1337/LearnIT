    "content": "The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) infrastructure supports the Presidentand his combatant commanders when they direct nuclear forces. This report discusses the currentrole of the NCCS in light of the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) and the 2006 QuadrennialDefense Review (QDR), examines current issues surrounding the NCCS, reviews modernizationinitiatives, summarizes NCCS functions and characteristics, and reviews NCCS platforms. Key NCCS platforms include fixed locations such as the National Military Command Center(NMCC), the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) Global Operations Center (GOC), andSite-R, and mobile platforms such as the E-4B National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC), theE-6B Airborne Command Post (ABNCP), and the Mobile Consolidated Command Center (MCCC).The NCCS must support situation monitoring, tactical warning and attack assessment of missilelaunches, senior leader decision making, dissemination of Presidential force-direction orders, andmanagement of geographically dispersed forces. The Department of Defense's (DOD's) 2001 NPR proposed a \"new triad\" of offensive nuclearand conventional forces, passive and active defenses, and a robust infrastructure, tied together by thecommand, control, computers, communication, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, andplanning architecture to confront the new, allegedly unpredictable post-Cold War environment. Adapting to non-nuclear responses and active defenses poses additional challenges for the currentNCCS. Some might question the continued relevancy of the legacy Cold War NCCS architecture. It wasdesigned against a \"decapitation\" threat from the Soviet Union. This threat might not still exist. However, some believe China is investing in a nuclear capability to compete with the United States. Iranand North Korea might be developing nuclear capabilities that, if not used to strike directly at the UnitedStates or U.S. forces, might be used to generate an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) that could wreck U.S.infrastructure. In addition to confronting these potential catastrophic threats, the NCCS could directconventional military operations, aid continuity of government in crises, and support civil authoritiesduring natural disasters or emergencies. The Defense Department has proposed several modernization and procurement initiativesin its 2007 budget. The DOD budget requests upgrades for the Minimum Essential EmergencyCommunications Network (MEECN) links to the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs),bombers, and tanker forces. It incorporates a redesign and consolidation of the NMCC, as part ofongoing Pentagon renovation efforts. It proposes several communications and aircraft upgrades tothe E-4B NAOC and the E-6B ABNCP. It seeks funding for a sweeping upgrade to its satellitecommunications capability through the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) program andits follow-on, the Transformational Communications Satellite (TSAT) program. This report will be updated as needed."
