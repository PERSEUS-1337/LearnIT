Defines a serious adverse experience as an adverse event associated with the use of a supplement in a human that involves death or one of other serious calamities. Directs the Secretary to conduct a clinical evaluation of each such reported experience. Requires the manufacturer of a dietary supplement to report periodically on other adverse experiences and to review such occurrences. Allows the Secretary to grant a waiver from the above reporting, reviewing, and investigating requirements with respect to a dietary supplement upon determination that compliance is not necessary to protect the public health. Authorizes the Secretary to require a manufacturer to conduct postmarket surveillance for a supplement under specified circumstances. Permits the Secretary to require a manufacturer of a supplement or of an ingredient in a supplement to demonstrate that its product is safe under specified circumstances. Directs the Secretary to approve the continued marketing of such a supplement or ingredient or to disapprove it. Prohibits any introduction into interstate commerce of a supplement containing a stimulant unless it is approved by the Secretary under this Act. Amends the Act to exclude a product that bears or contains an anabolic steroid from the definition of a dietary supplement for a specified chapter of the Act.
