And (2) the owner of an AED for any harm resulting from the use of the AED, unless the harm was caused by the failure of the owner to properly maintain the AED. This immunity applies regardless of whether: (1) the AED is marked with cautionary signage or registered with any government. Or (2) the person who used the AED complied with signage, had received training on use of the AED, or was assisted or supervised, including by a licensed physician."
