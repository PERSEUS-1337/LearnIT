    "content": "This paper explores many immediate connections between adaptive control and machine learning, both through common update laws as well as common concepts. Adaptive control as a field has focused on mathematical rigor and guaranteed convergence. The rapid advances in machine learning on the other hand have brought about a plethora of new techniques and problems for learning. This paper elucidates many of the numerous common connections between both fields such that results from both may be leveraged together to solve new problems. In particular, a specific problem related to higher order learning is solved through insights obtained from these intersections. The fields of adaptive control and machine learning have evolved in parallel over the past few decades, with a significant overlap in goals, problem statements, and tools. Machine learning as a field has focused on computer based systems that improve through experience BID16 BID6 BID24 BID17 BID21 BID35 . Often times the process of learning is encapsulated in the form of a parameterized model, whose parameters are learned in order to approximate a function. Optimization methods are commonly employed to reduce the function approximation error using any and all available data. The field of adaptive control, on the other hand, has focused on the process of controlling engineering systems in order to accomplish regulation and tracking of critical variables of interest (e.g. position and force in robotics, Mach number and altitude in aerospace systems, frequency and voltage in power systems) in the presence of uncertainties in the underlying system models, changes in the environment, and unforeseen variations in the overall infrastructure BID48 BID59 \u00c5str\u00f6m & Wittenmark, 1995; BID33 BID49 . The approach used for accomplishing such regulation and tracking in adaptive control is the learning of underlying parameters through an online estimation algorithm. Stability theory is employed for enabling guarantees for the safe evolution of the critical variables, and convergence of the regulation and tracking errors to zero.Learning parameters of a model in both machine learning and adaptive control occurs through the use of input-output data. In both cases, the main algorithm used for updating the parameters is often based on a gradient descent-like algorithm. Related tools of analysis, convergence, and robustness in both fields have a tremendous amount of similarity. As the scope of problems in both fields increases, the associated complexity and challenges increase as well. Therefore it is highly attractive to understand these similarities and connections so that the two communities can develop new methods for addressing new challenges."
