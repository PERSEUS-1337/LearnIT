    "content": "The Medicaid program, which served an estimated 56.7 million people in FY2012, finances the delivery of a wide variety of preventive, primary, and acute care services as well as long-term services and supports for certain low-income populations. Benefits are available to beneficiaries through two avenues: traditional coverage and alternative benefit plans (ABPs, formerly known as benchmark plans, first established in P.L. 109-171, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005). The traditional Medicaid program covers a wide variety of mandatory services (e.g., inpatient hospital services, lab/x-ray services, physician care, nursing facility care for persons aged 21 and over), and other services at state option (e.g., prescribed drugs, physician-directed clinic services, physical therapy, prosthetic devices) to the majority of Medicaid beneficiaries across the United States. Within broad federal guidelines, states define the amount, duration, and scope of these benefits. Thus, even mandatory services are not identical from state to state. With the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010 (ACA; P.L. 111-148, as amended), benefit requirements have expanded under ABPs. At a minimum, these plans must cover essential health benefits (i.e., ambulatory patient services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance use disorder services [including behavioral health treatment], prescribed drugs, rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices, lab services, preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management, and pediatric services, including oral and vision care). In addition, at state option, a new group of citizens with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level is eligible for Medicaid as of January 1, 2014. These individuals are required to receive ABPs rather than traditional Medicaid benefits (with some exceptions for subgroups with special medical needs). This report outlines the major rules that govern and define both traditional Medicaid and ABPs. It also compares the similarities and differences between these two benefit package designs."
