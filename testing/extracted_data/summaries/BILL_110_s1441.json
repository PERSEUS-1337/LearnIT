    "content": "State Veterans Home Modernization Act of 2007 - Prohibits the Secretary of Veterans Affairs from approving any application for financial assistance for a construction project at a state veterans' home that is submitted 730 days after the enactment of this Act if the Secretary determines that the construction would result in an increase in the total number of beds in such state for which the Secretary makes per diem payments for the care of veterans residing in such homes. Expands the state home grant program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to authorize grants for noninstitutional care programs. Requires, for fiscal years after 2007, that not less than 10 of sums appropriated for VA home construction grants be used for grants to states which have submitted applications for noninstitutional care projects."
