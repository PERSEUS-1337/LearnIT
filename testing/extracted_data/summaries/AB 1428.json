    "title": "An act to amend Section 8880.5 of the Government Code, relating to education allocations: local lottery education accounts.",
    "content": "The California State Lottery Act of 1984, enacted by initiative, authorizes a California State Lottery and provides for its operation and administration by the California State Lottery Commission and the Director of the California State Lottery, with certain limitations. The act requires each school district and county superintendent of schools, as condition of receiving any moneys from the California State Lottery, to establish a separate account for the receipt and expenditure of those moneys, which is required to be clearly identified as a lottery education account. This bill would require the commission to collect, and make publicly available on the commission\u2019s Internet Web site, information related to those separate lottery education accounts of each school district and county superintendent of schools. The California State Lottery Act of 1984, an initiative measure, specifies that none of its provisions may be changed except to further its purpose by a bill passed by a 23 vote of each house of the Legislature and signed by the Governor. This bill would declare that its provisions further the purposes of the act."
