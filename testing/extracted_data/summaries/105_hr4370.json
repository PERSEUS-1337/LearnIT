    "content": "Home Health Access Preservation Act of 1998 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA), as amended by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, with respect to the computation formula of the interim system of limited payments for services provided by home health agencies. Revises such formula for cost reporting periods beginning after FY 1998 to replace the current agency-specific per beneficiary annual limits with limits based on specified base regional limits, a base national limit, and an area wage index. Eliminates the special rule for new agencies with respect to determination of the reasonable cost of home health services. Provides for a three percent increase in per-visit cost limits for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to allot grants to States, according to a specified formula, to provide for adjustment for outliers to assist in the transition to the prospective payment system for home health services. Makes necessary appropriations. Directs the Secretary to meet every 90 days with appropriate congressional committee staff to provide informal updates of progress in implementing the prospective payment system for home health agencies under Medicare."
