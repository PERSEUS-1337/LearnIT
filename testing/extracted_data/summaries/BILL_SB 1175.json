Existing law requires the employer to provide medical, surgical, chiropractic, acupuncture, and hospital treatment, as specified, that is reasonably required to cure or relieve the injured worker from the effects of his or her injury. Existing law requires a provider of those services to submit, among other documents, its request for payment with an itemization of services provided and the charge for each service. Existing law also requires the employer to reimburse the employee for his or her medical-legal expenses, as specified. This bill would require, effective for services on or after January 1, 2017, that requests for payment with an itemization of services provided and the charge for each service be submitted to the employer within 12 months of the date of service or within 12 months of the date of discharge for inpatient facility services. The bill would also require, effective for services provided on or after January 1, 2017, that all bills for medical-legal evaluation or medical-legal expense be submitted to the employer within 12 months of the date of service in the manner prescribed by the administrative director. The bill would provide that requests for payment and bills for medical-legal charges are barred unless timely submitted. The bill would require the administrative director to adopt rules to implement the 12-month limitation period, as specified."
