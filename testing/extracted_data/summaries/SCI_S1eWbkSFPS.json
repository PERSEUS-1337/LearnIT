    "content": "Graph neural networks have shown promising results on representing and analyzing diverse graph-structured data such as social, citation, and protein interaction networks. Existing approaches commonly suffer from the oversmoothing issue, regardless of whether policies are edge-based or node-based for neighborhood aggregation. Most methods also focus on transductive scenarios for fixed graphs, leading to poor generalization performance for unseen graphs. To address these issues, we propose a new graph neural network model that considers both edge-based neighborhood relationships and node-based entity features, i.e. Graph Entities with Step Mixture via random walk (GESM). GESM employs a mixture of various steps through random walk to alleviate the oversmoothing problem and attention to use node information explicitly. These two mechanisms allow for a weighted neighborhood aggregation which considers the properties of entities and relations. With intensive experiments, we show that the proposed GESM achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performances on four benchmark graph datasets comprising transductive and inductive learning tasks. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the significance of considering global information. The source code will be publicly available in the near future. Graphs are universal data representations that exist in a wide variety of real-world problems, such as analyzing social networks (Perozzi et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2017) , forecasting traffic flow (Manley, 2015; Yu et al., 2017) , and recommending products based on personal preferences (Page et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2019) . Owing to breakthroughs in deep learning, recent graph neural networks (GNNs) (Scarselli et al., 2008) have achieved considerable success on diverse graph problems by collectively aggregating information from graph structures Xu et al., 2018; Gao & Ji, 2019) . As a result, much research in recent years has focused on how to aggregate the feature representations of neighbor nodes so that the dependence of graphs is effectively utilized. The majority of studies have predominantly depended on edges to aggregate the neighboring nodes' features. These edge-based methods are premised on the concept of relational inductive bias within graphs (Battaglia et al., 2018) , which implies that two connected nodes have similar properties and are more likely to share the same label (Kipf & Welling, 2017) . While this approach leverages graphs' unique property of capturing relations, it appears less capable of generalizing to new or unseen graphs (Wu et al., 2019b) . To improve the neighborhood aggregation scheme, some studies have incorporated node information; They fully utilize node information and reduce the effects of relational (edge) information. A recent approach, graph attention networks (GAT), employs the attention mechanism so that weights used for neighborhood aggregation differ according to the feature of nodes (Veli\u010dkovi\u0107 et al., 2018) . This approach has yielded impressive performance and has shown promise in improving generalization for unseen graphs. Regardless of neighborhood aggregation schemes, most methods, however, suffer from a common problem where neighborhood information is considered to a limited degree (Klicpera et al., 2019) . For example, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) (Kipf & Welling, 2017) only operate on data that are closely connected due to oversmoothing , which indicates the \"washing out\" of remote nodes' features via averaging. Consequently, information becomes localized and access to global information is restricted (Xu et al., 2018) , leading to poor performance on datasets in which only a small portion is labeled . In order to address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel method, Graph Entities with Step Mixture via random walk (GESM), which considers information from all nodes in the graph and can be generalized to new graphs by incorporating random walk and attention. Random walk enables our model to be applicable to previously unseen graph structures, and a mixture of random walks alleviates the oversmoothing problem, allowing global information to be included during training. Hence, our method can be effective, particularly for nodes in the periphery or a sparsely labeled dataset. The attention mechanism also advances our model by considering node information for aggregation. This enhances the generalizability of models to diverse graph structures. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on four standard benchmark datasets: Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed, which are citation networks for transductive learning, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) for inductive learning, in which test graphs remain unseen during training. In addition to these experiments, we verified whether our model uses information of remote nodes by reducing the percentage of labeled data. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of GESM on inductive learning as well as transductive learning for datasets. Moreover, our model achieved enhanced accuracy for datasets with reduced label rates, indicating the contribution of global information. The key contributions of our approach are as follows: \u2022 We present graphs with step mixture via random walk, which can adaptively consider local and global information, and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on public benchmark datasets with few labels. \u2022 We propose Graph Entities with Step Mixture via random walk (GESM), an advanced model which incorporates attention, and experimentally show that it is applicable to both transductive and inductive learning tasks, for both nodes and edges are utilized for the neighborhood aggregation scheme. \u2022 We empirically demonstrate the importance of propagation steps by analyzing its effect on performance in terms of inference time and accuracy."
