    "content": "Title I: Reauthorization of Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. Related Provisions - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize appropriations to the Department of Labor through FY 2003 for: (1) trade adjustment assistance for displaced workers and for firms. And (2) the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Transitional Adjustment Assistance Program. Increases from 104 to 130 the maximum number of weeks an adversely affected worker who requires a program of remedial education may receive trade readjustment allowances. Reduces from 60 to 40 days the time within which the Secretary of Labor must respond to petitions for certification of eligibility to apply for adjustment assistance. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary, in conjunction with the States, should provide workers with more specific information about benefits, training, and other employment services, and procedures for obtaining them, under the trade adjustment assistance program. Title II: Adjustment Assistance Program for Workers Separated from Employment Due to the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001 - Directs the Secretary to establish a program to provide adjustment assistance for workers separated from employment due to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in the same manner and to the same extent as assistance provided under NAFTA. Sets forth criteria governing when groups of workers may petition for a certification of eligibility to apply for such adjustment assistance, including that: (1) a significant number or proportion of workers have become separated or threatened with separation from employment, (2) sales or production have decreased absolutely. And (3) the events of September 11, 2001, contributed importantly to such separation and decline. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2002 and 2003."
