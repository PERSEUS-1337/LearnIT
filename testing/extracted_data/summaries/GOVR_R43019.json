    "content": "On September 10, 1996, the Senate passed H.R. 3396, the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which had been cleared on July 12 by the House. On September 21, 1996, President Clinton signed DOMA and it became P.L. 104-199. On November 4, 2008, California citizens passed Proposition 8, which added new Section 7.5 to Article I of the California Constitution that reads \"Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.\" Petitions of certiorari have been granted by the United States Supreme Court in two cases resulting from these events. This report contains resources for retrieving legislative and background information for the Defense of Marriage Act, as well as the Proposition 8 ballot initiative in California. It also contains selected legal materials relevant to the cases. In addition, it includes information on CRS products and experts to assist in understanding the related legislative, legal, and policy issues. This report will be updated as needed."
