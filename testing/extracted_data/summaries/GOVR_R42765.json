    "content": "For the first time since 1998, voters in Puerto Rico went to the polls in November 2012 to reconsider the island's relationship with the federal government (a concept known as \"political status\"). Voters were asked to answer two questions: (1) whether they wished to maintain Puerto Rico's current political status; and (2) regardless of the choice in the first question, whether they preferred statehood, independence, or to be a \"sovereign free associated state.\" According to results certified by the Puerto Rico State Elections Commission, approximately 54.0% of those who cast ballots answered \"no\" to the first question. In the second question, approximately 61.2% of voters chose statehood. The island's new governor and territorial legislature contend that the results were \"inconclusive.\" The plebiscite results are potentially significant if they are interpreted to mark the electorate's desire to change the island's present political status. The significance of the plebiscite remains to be seen, however, particularly because in the same election in which voters arguably endorsed a change in the status quo and favored statehood, they also voted out the pro-statehood incumbent governor and former Resident Commissioner, Luis Fortu\u00f1o, as well as majorities in the territorial legislature believed to be generally supportive of statehood. No change in Puerto Rico's political status could occur without congressional action. Events in 2013 suggest that Congress and policymakers in San Juan are considering how to assess the plebiscite and considering next steps. In Washington, on May 15, 2013, Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi introduced H.R. 2000, a bill that proposes a second plebiscite in which voters could answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to a single question asking whether they desire statehood for Puerto Rico. The President's FY2014 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies budget request includes $2.5 million for voter education for such a \"federally sanctioned\" plebiscite. In San Juan, the new governor, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, and a May 14, 2013, concurrent resolution approved by the territorial legislature, contend that the November 2012 plebiscite results were \"inconclusive\" because a large number of voters chose not to answer the second status question. The governor and the concurrent resolution appear to suggest that if Puerto Rico's political status is to be reconsidered, various options should be available for discussion, including what some contend is an option called \"enhanced commonwealth,\" a position previously rejected by federal task forces spanning different presidential administrations. This report will be updated periodically as events warrant."
