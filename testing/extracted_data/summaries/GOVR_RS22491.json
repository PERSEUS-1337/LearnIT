    "content": "In recent years, the rising costs of prescription drugs have motivated various policymakers to implement cost-saving measures. In some cases, states have pursued programs to collect and redistribute unused medications that would otherwise be discarded. However, the ability to implement these so-called drug recycling programs may be constrained by federal or state law or both. For example, medications classified as controlled substances are regulated by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Furthermore, drugs that require prescriptions, as many controlled substances do, are regulated by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act (FFDCA). Additionally, programs may encounter logistical problems related to billing under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is not designed to accommodate drug recycling. Despite these hurdles, states have begun to implement drug recycling programs. Although the details of the laws vary among states, most contain strict rules to ensure the safety of the medications. This report provides an overview of the federal laws that may affect state drug recycling programs, as well as examples of these state programs."
