    "content": "This report provides an overview of actions taken by Congress to provide FY2010 appropriations for Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS). This report uses the House report to accompany H.R. 2847 (H.Rept. 111-149) and the text of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-32), as the source for the FY2009-enacted and the FY2010-requested amounts, and it uses the Senate report to accompany H.R. 2847 (S.Rept. 111-34) as the source for the amounts in the House-passed bill. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2847 is used as the source for the Senate-passed amounts. The joint explanatory statement to accompany the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-117, H.Rept. 111-366), is the source for the FY2010 enacted amounts. On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5; ARRA). The amounts appropriated by Congress in the ARRA were in addition to the amounts appropriated in the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-8). In this act, Congress appropriated $15.922 billion for CJS departments and agencies. For Commerce, the ARRA provided $7.916 billion, for Justice, the ARRA provided $4.002 billion, and for science agencies, the ARRA provided $4.004 billion. The Administration requested a total budget authority of $67.551 billion for CJS departments for FY2010. This amounts to a $6.904 billion, or 11.1%, increase over the $60.79 billion enacted for FY2009. The Administration's proposal included $13.789 billion for Commerce, $27.074 billon for Justice, $25.737 billion for Science, and $950.9 million for related agencies. The House-passed bill recommended a total of $67.695 billion for CJS, 11.4% more than the total appropriated for FY2009 and 0.2% more than the Administration's FY2010 request. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2847 would have provided a total of $67.953 billion for CJS. The proposed amount would have represented a 11.8% increase over what was appropriated for FY2009. The Senate-passed amount would have been a 0.6% increase over the Administration's request, and it would have been 0.4% more than what was included in the House-passed bill. On December 8, 2009, a conference committee met to resolve differences between the House- and Senate-passed versions of Transportation-Housing and Urban Development (HUD) appropriations bill (H.R. 3288). The version of H.R. 3288 reported by the conference committee\u2014now entitled the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010\u2014included six of the seven FY2010 appropriations bills that had not yet been signed into law. On December 16, 2009, President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-117) into law. The act includes a total of $68.705 billion for CJS, an amount that is 13.0% more than the FY2009-enacted amount, 1.7% more than the Administration's request, 1.5% more than the House-passed amount, and 1.1% more than the Senate-passed amount. This report will not be updated."
