On June 5, 2014, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 2438, its version of the Departments of Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill for FY2015 (THUD), which recommended $3.090 billion for activities funded under the Community Development Fund (CDF) account, including $3.020 billion for Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) formula grants. On June 10, 2014, the House approved its version of the THUD bill for FY2015, H.R. 4745, which recommended $3.060 billion for CDF activities, including $3.0 billion for CDBG formula grants. On December 16, 2014, the President signed into law the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of FY2015 (P.L. 113-235), which included $3.066 billion for the CDBG program and a $500 million loan commitment ceiling for the CDBG Section 108 loan guarantee program. On January 17, 2014, President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2014, P.L. 113-76, which included $3.100 billion in funding for the CDF, including $3.030 billion for formula allocations to CDBG entitlement communities, states, and insular areas. The act also appropriated $70 million in competitively awarded funds to Indian tribes and converted Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program. On July 30, 2013, the House began floor consideration of H.R. 2610, a bill that would have appropriated funds for THUD for FY2014. On July 31, 2013, the Senate began consideration of S. 1243, its version of the THUD Appropriations Act for FY2014. The bill, which was reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee on July 27, 2013 (S.Rept. 113-45), recommended $3.295 billion for activities funded under the CDF account. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2014, released on April 10, 2014, included $3.143 billion for activities funded under HUD's CDF account. The Administration's FY2014 budget proposal would have increased total funding for CDF activities by a modest $8 million from $3.135 billion in FY2013 to $3.143 billion. The proposed budget would have reduced funding for CDBG formula grants by $280 million to $2.798 billion and would have redirected most of those funds to two other activities within the CDF account: $75 million for regional planning grants, which was a component of the Administration's Sustainable Communities Initiative; and $200 million for a new Neighborhood Stabilization Initiative that was intended to assist local governments to identify and demolish an oversupply of abandoned and foreclosed properties. The Administration's FY2014 budget included a proposal that doubled the Section 108 loan guarantee program's loan commitment ceiling from $229 million in FY2013 to $500 million in FY2014. In addition, the Administration proposed revamping the program by charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program, which would have eliminated the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. The House Appropriations Committee report accompanying H.R. 2610 supported the Administration's Section 108 loan guarantee proposals that recommended an increase in the loan commitment ceiling and conversion of the program to a fee-based approach. The 112th Congress began, but did not complete, consideration of appropriation measures that would have provided full-year funding for THUD for FY2013, before adjourning. The 113th Congress took up consideration of HUD's FY2013 appropriations as part of a larger measure providing consolidated appropriations for a number of federal departments. On March 26, 2013, the President signed into law P.L. 113-6, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013. The act included $3.1 billion for CDF activities. In late January 2013, Congress approved and the President signed P.L. 113-2, a disaster supplemental appropriation that included $15.2 billion for CDBG disaster relief and recovery activities in response to Hurricane Sandy and other disasters. Both the CDF FY2013 regular appropriation and the CDF disaster funds were subject to 5% sequestration mandated by the Budget Control Act."
