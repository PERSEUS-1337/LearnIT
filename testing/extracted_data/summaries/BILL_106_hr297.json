Requires the Secretary to provide funds for the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, equal to 50 percent of the incremental cost of its participation in the project. Authorizes the Secretary, at the request of the water supply system, to allow the Bureau of Reclamation to provide project construction oversight to the water supply project.

Title IV: City of Roseville Pumping Plant Facilities - Directs the Secretary to credit up to a specified amount to the unpaid capital obligation of the city of Roseville, California, as such obligation is calculated in accordance with applicable Federal reclamation law and Central Valley Project rate setting policy, in recognition of future benefits to be accrued by the United States as a result of the city's purchase and funding of the installation of additional pumping plant facilities in accordance with a specified letter of agreement with the United States. Requires: (1) the Secretary to simultaneously add an equivalent amount of costs to the capital costs of the Central Valley Project. And (2) such added costs to be reimbursed in accordance with reclamation law and policy.
