    "content": "According to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 2017 was \"a historic year of weather and climate disasters\" for the United States. A combination of deadly hurricanes and wildfires were among the 57 major disasters declared under the Stafford Act in 2017. The series of supplemental appropriations requested and provided in the wake of 2017's hurricanes and wildfires are the latest exercise of one congressional role in disaster situations\u2014to exercise \"the power of the purse\" to provide relief to state and local governments overwhelmed by disaster response and recovery needs, fund certain relief for individuals and small businesses, and repair damage to federal facilities. Three supplemental appropriations bills have been enacted in response to Administration requests made in September, October, and November 2017 in the wake of these incidents, providing $120 billion in budget authority and canceling $16 billion in debt held by the National Flood Insurance Fund. This report provides a detailed breakdown of the requested and enacted supplemental funding in each of these measures, and provides a contact listing for CRS experts on the funded relief and recovery programs. As Congress considers supplemental appropriations in response to disasters and chooses how to proceed, it faces a variety of issues, including the appropriate application of budget discipline when disaster relief is requested from the federal government, the appropriate breadth and promptness of the federal investment, and how to ensure that the funding provided is not spent on wasteful or fraudulent endeavors. This report also briefly explores those issues."
