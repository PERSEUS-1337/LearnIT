    "content": "National Computer Recycling Act - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), after submitting to Congress the results of a study of waste materials in used computers that may be hazardous to human health or the environment along with related management recommendations, to require assessment of a fee on the sale to an end-user of any computer, monitor, or other designated electronic devices. Exempts nonprofit organizations from the fee requirement. Authorizes the Administrator to create additional fee exemptions for sales that will likely result in maximum reuse of significant components and the disposal of remaining components in an environmentally sound and lawful manner. Requires fees collected to be used for administration of this Act and for making grants to eligible individuals or organizations for: (1) collecting or processing used computers, monitors, or other devices for recycling, (2) reusing or reselling such devices. And (3) extracting and using, or selling for reuse, raw materials from such devices. Requires reports to Congress on the status of computer recycling, which shall include descriptions of fee collection and use."
