    "content": "The \"flag code\" is the federal law that sets forth guidelines for the appearance and display of the U.S. flag (\"flag\") by private citizens. These guidelines specify times and conditions for display of the flag, manners and methods of display, and buildings where such display should occur. The guidelines for flag display vary based on the context and occasion, and there are detailed specifications for displaying flags at \"half-staff.\" The flag code also specifies how to deliver the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag and appropriate conduct while watching a performance of the National Anthem. Most of the flag code contains no explicit enforcement mechanisms, and relevant case law would suggest that the provisions without enforcement mechanisms are declaratory and advisory only. Efforts by states to punish verbal flag disparagement or prevent disrespectful flag display (\"flag-misuse laws\") have been struck down by the Supreme Court in Street v. New York and Spence v. Washington as free speech violations under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. Federal and many state laws also specify punishments for physical mistreatment of the U.S. flag (\"flag-desecration laws\"), although under Texas v. Johnson and U nited S tates v. Eichman , the Court held that application of these laws against expressive conduct violates free speech precepts. A separate issue is that federal and many state flag-misuse laws provide punishment for placing advertising images on a U.S. flag or displaying an image of a flag on merchandise. While these laws have not been challenged on free speech grounds, the Court has reserved the question whether the Johnson and Eichman holdings would apply in a commercial context, and it seems likely these laws would survive judicial scrutiny. Finally, while federal courts of appeals have rejected Establishment Clause challenges to recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in classrooms despite language in the Pledge describing \"one Nation under God,\" the Court in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette held that a state law mandating that students participate in a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance violates free speech precepts."
