    "title": "A bill to provide for a study of the effects of hydraulic fracturing on underground drinking water sources.",
    "content": "Hydraulic Fracturing Act - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) study the effects on underground drinking water sources of hydraulic fracturing to determine whether regulation of such practice is necessary to protect such sources. And (2) promulgate such regulations as are determined to be necessary. Provides that a determination that regulation is unnecessary will relieve States from any further obligation to regulate hydraulic fracturing as an underground injection. Defines hydraulic fracturing as the process of creating a fracture in a reservoir rock, and injecting fluids and propping agents, for the purposes of reservoir stimulation related to oil and gas production activities."
