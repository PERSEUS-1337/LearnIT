    "content": "Progress in probabilistic generative models has accelerated, developing richer models with neural architectures, implicit densities, and with scalable algorithms for their Bayesian inference. However, there has been limited progress in models that capture causal relationships, for example, how individual genetic factors cause major human diseases. In this work, we focus on two challenges in particular: How do we build richer causal models, which can capture highly nonlinear relationships and interactions between multiple causes? How do we adjust for latent confounders, which are variables influencing both cause and effect and which prevent learning of causal relationships? To address these challenges, we synthesize ideas from causality and modern probabilistic modeling. For the first, we describe implicit causal models, a class of causal models that leverages neural architectures with an implicit density. For the second, we describe an implicit causal model that adjusts for confounders by sharing strength across examples. In experiments, we scale Bayesian inference on up to a billion genetic measurements. We achieve state of the art accuracy for identifying causal factors: we significantly outperform the second best result by an absolute difference of 15-45.3%. Probabilistic models provide a language for specifying rich and flexible generative processes BID5 Murphy, 2012) . Recent advances expand this language with neural architectures, implicit densities, and with scalable algorithms for their Bayesian inference BID9 BID15 . However, there has been limited progress in models that capture high-dimensional causal relationships (Pearl, 2000; BID13 Imbens & Rubin, 2015) . Unlike models which learn statistical relationships, causal models let us manipulate the generative process and make counterfactual statements, that is, what would have happened if the distributions changed.As the running example in this work, consider genome-wide association studies (GWAS) BID19 BID7 Kang et al., 2010) . The goal of GWAS is to understand how genetic factors, i.e., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), cause traits to appear in individuals. Understanding this causation both lets us predict whether an individual has a genetic predisposition to a disease and also understand how to cure the disease by targeting the individual SNPs that cause it.With this example in mind, we focus on two challenges to combining modern probabilistic models and causality. The first is to develop richer, more expressive causal models. Probabilistic causal models represent variables as deterministic functions of noise and other variables, and existing work usually focuses on additive noise models (Hoyer et al., 2009 ) such as linear mixed models (Kang et al., 2010) . These models apply simple nonlinearities such as polynomials, hand-engineered low order interactions between inputs, and assume additive interaction with, e.g., Gaussian noise. In GWAS, strong evidence suggests that susceptibility to common diseases is influenced by epistasis (the interaction between multiple genes) (Culverhouse et al., 2002; McKinney et al., 2006) . We would like to capture and discover such interactions. This requires models with nonlinear, learnable interactions among the inputs and the noise.The second challenge is how to address latent population-based confounders. In GWAS, both latent population structure, i.e., subgroups in the population with ancestry differences, and relatedness among sample individuals produce spurious correlations among SNPs to the trait of interest. Existing methods correct for this correlation in two stages BID19 BID7 Kang et al., 2010) : first, estimate the confounder given data; then, run standard causal inferences given the estimated confounder. These methods are effective in some settings, but they are difficult to understand as principled causal models, and they cannot easily accommodate complex latent structure.To address these challenges, we synthesize ideas from causality and modern probabilistic modeling. For the first challenge, we develop implicit causal models, a class of causal models that leverages neural architectures with an implicit density. With GWAS, implicit causal models generalize previous methods to capture important nonlinearities, such as gene-gene and gene-population interaction. Building on this, for the second challenge, we describe an implicit causal model that adjusts for population-confounders by sharing strength across examples (genes). We derive conditions that prove the model consistently estimates the causal relationship. This theoretically justifies existing methods and generalizes them to more complex latent variable models of the confounder.In experiments, we scale Bayesian inference on implicit causal models on up to a billion genetic measurements. Validating these results are not possible for observational data (Pearl, 2000) , so we first perform an extensive simulation study of 11 configurations of 100,000 SNPs and 940 to 5,000 individuals. We achieve state of the art accuracy for identifying causal factors: we significantly outperform existing genetics methods by an absolute difference of 15-45.3%. In a real-world GWAS, we also show our model discovers real causal relationships-identifying similar SNPs as previous state of the art-while being more principled as a causal model. We described implicit causal models, a rich class of models that can capture high-dimensional, nonlinear causal relationships. With genome-wide association studies, implicit causal models generalize previous successful methods to capture important nonlinearities, such as gene-gene and gene-population interaction. In addition, we described an implicit causal model that adjusts for confounders by sharing strength across examples. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly outperforming existing genetics methods by 15-45.3%.There are several limitations to learning true causal associations. For example , alleles at different loci typically exhibit linkage disequilibrium, which is a local non-random association influenced by factors such as the rate of recombination, mutation, and genetic drift. The implicit causal model might be extended with variables shared across subsets of SNPs to model the recombination process. Another limitation involves the data, where granularity of sequenced loci may lose signal or attribute causation to a region involving multiple SNPs. Better technology, and accounting for mishaps in the sequencing process in the model, can help.While we focused on GWAS applications in this paper, we also believe implicit causal models have significant potential in other sciences: for example, to design new dynamical theories in high energy physics; and to accurately model structural equations of discrete choices in economics. We're excited about applications to these new domains, leveraging modern probabilistic modeling and causality to drive new scientific understanding."
