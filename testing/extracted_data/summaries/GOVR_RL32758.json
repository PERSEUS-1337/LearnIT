    "content": "U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, Africa, the Philippines, and Colombia are part of theU.S.-initiated Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). These operations cover a wide variety of combatand non-combat missions ranging from combating insurgents, to civil affairs and reconstructionoperations, to training military forces of other nations in counternarcotics, counterterrorism, andcounterinsurgency tactics. Numbers of U.S. forces involved in these operations range from 19,000to just a few hundred. Some have argued that U.S. military operations in these countries areachieving a degree of success and suggest that they may offer some lessons that might be applied inIraq as well as for future GWOT operations. Potential issues for the second session of the 109thCongress include NATO assumption of responsibility for operations in Afghanistan, counterdrugoperations in Afghanistan, a long-term strategy for Africa, and developments in Colombia and thePhilippines. This report will not discuss the provision of equipment and weapons to countries wherethe U.S. military is conducting counterterrorism operations (1) nor will it address Foreign Military Sales (FMS), which are alsoaspects of the Administration's GWOT military strategy. This report will be updated on a periodicbasis."
