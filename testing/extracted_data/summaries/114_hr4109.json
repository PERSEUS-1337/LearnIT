Federal educational assistance funds include federal student aid under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, education benefits for military personnel and veterans, and grants for workforce development programs. An IHE or postsecondary educational institution must annually certify compliance with this requirement to retain eligibility to participate in title IV federal student aid programs."
