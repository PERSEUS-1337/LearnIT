    "title": "An act to\namend Sections 52061 and 52067 of, and\nadd Section 44664.5\nto,\nto\nthe Education Code, relating to school accountability.",
    "content": "Existing law required, on or before July 1, 2014, the governing boards of school districts and county boards of education to adopt a local control and accountability plan using a template adopted by the State Board of Education. Existing law requires the governing board of each school district and each county board of education to update its local control and accountability plan before July 1 of each year. Existing law requires an update to include, among other things, a listing and description of the expenditures for the fiscal year, as specified. This bill would instead require that the annual update to a school district\u2019s local control and accountability plan include a listing and description of the expenditures at the school district level and by schoolsite for the fiscal year, as specified. The bill would also require that the annual update to a county board of education\u2019s local control and accountability plan include a listing and description of the expenditures at the county level and by schoolsite for the fiscal year, as specified. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing law requires the governing board of each school district to establish standards of expected pupil achievement at each grade level in each area of study and to evaluate and assess certificated employee performance on a continuing basis as it reasonably relates to the progress of pupils toward the established standards and, if applicable, the state adopted academic content standards as measured by state adopted criterion referenced assessments, the instructional techniques and strategies used by the employee, the employee\u2019s adherence to curricular objectives, and the establishment and maintenance of a suitable learning environment, within the scope of the employee\u2019s responsibilities. This bill would require the superintendent of a school district and a county superintendent of schools to make available to the public, and post on its Internet Web site, if it has one, specified information relating to the evaluation of teachers and principals. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
