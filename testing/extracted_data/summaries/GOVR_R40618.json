    "content": "The birth rate for teenagers (ages 15 through 19) in the United States increased in 2006 and 2007 after a steady decline since 1991. In 2008 and 2009, the teen birth rate dropped below the 2007 teen birth rate, reversing the two-year upward trend. In 2009, teen births accounted for 10.1% of all U.S. births and 21.4% of all nonmarital births. In recognition of the negative, long-term consequences associated with teenage pregnancy and births, teen pregnancy prevention is a major goal of this nation. President Obama's FY2010 and FY2011 budgets supported state, community-based, and faith-based efforts to reduce teen pregnancy using models that have been rigorously evaluated. The Administration's new discretionary Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program funds models that stress the importance of abstinence while providing medically accurate and age-appropriate information to youth who have already become sexually active. The Obama Administration's FY2010 and FY2011 budgets did not provide any funding in FY2010 or FY2011 for the Title V Abstinence Education Block Grant to states (which was a mandatory program) or the Community-Based Abstinence Education (CBAE) program (a discretionary program); nor did they continue to provide funding in FY2010 or FY2011 for abstinence-only demonstration grants through the Adolescent Family Life (AFL) program. Nonetheless, P.L. 111-148, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), signed into law on March 23, 2010, by President Obama included the two teen pregnancy prevention provisions that were in the Senate version of the bill (H.R. 3590). P.L. 111-148 established a new state formula grant program and appropriated $75 million annually for each of FY2010-FY2014 to enable states to operate a new Personal Responsibility Education Program. P.L. 111-148 also restored funding to the Title V Abstinence Education formula block grant to states at the previous annual level of $50 million for each of FY2010-FY2014. P.L. 111-117, the Consolidated Appropriations for FY2010 (enacted December 16, 2009), included a new discretionary Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program that provides grants and contracts, on a competitive basis, to public and private entities to fund \"medically accurate and age appropriate\" programs that reduce teen pregnancy. The TPP program was funded at $110 million for FY2010. P.L. 111-117 also provided a separate $4.5 million to carry out evaluations of teenage pregnancy prevention approaches. After several temporary funding measures were enacted, P.L. 112-10, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (enacted April 15, 2011) included funding of $109.5 million for the TPP program for FY2011 ($105 million for the grant program and $4.455 million for program evaluation). P.L. 112-10 also included a 0.2% across-the-board rescission that is not reflected in $109.5 million funding total. This report provides a brief discussion of the debate on comprehensive sex education and abstinence education, highlights evaluations of both types of programs, describes youth programs that address teen pregnancy, and examines the new teen pregnancy prevention program established by P.L. 111-117 that was included in the Obama Administration's FY2010 budget and again in his FY2011 budget. It also describes the teen pregnancy prevention initiatives included in PPACA. In addition, it identifies teen pregnancy prevention legislation introduced during the 111th Congress (H.R. 463/S. 21, H.R. 1551/S. 611, H.R. 3288, H.R. 3293, H.R. 3312, H.R. 3590, H.R. 3962, H.R. 6283/S. 3878, and S. 1796)."
