    "content": "Short-term, small-dollar loans are consumer loans with relatively low initial principal amounts (often less than $1,000) with relatively short repayment periods (generally for a small number of weeks or months). Short-term, small-dollar loan products are frequently used to cover cash-flow shortages that may occur due to unexpected expenses or periods of inadequate income. Small-dollar loans can be offered in various forms and by various types of lenders. Banks and credit unions (depositories) can make small-dollar loans through financial products such as credit cards, credit card cash advances, and checking account overdraft protection programs. Small-dollar loans can also be provided by nonbank lenders (alternative financial service [AFS] providers), such as payday lenders and automobile title lenders. The extent that borrower financial situations would be made worse from the use of expensive credit or from limited access to credit is widely debated. Consumer groups often raise concerns regarding the affordability of small-dollar loans. Borrowers pay rates and fees for small-dollar loans that may be considered expensive. Borrowers may also fall into debt traps, situations where borrowers repeatedly roll over existing loans into new loans and subsequently incur more charges rather than completely paying off the loans. Although the vulnerabilities associated with debt traps are more frequently discussed in the context of nonbank products such as payday loans, borrowers may still find it difficult to repay outstanding balances and face additional charges on loans such as credit cards that are provided by depositories. Conversely, the lending industry often raises concerns regarding the reduced availability of small-dollar credit. Regulations aimed at reducing costs for borrowers may result in higher costs for lenders, possibly limiting or reducing credit availability for financially distressed individuals. This report provides an overview of the small-dollar consumer lending markets and related policy issues. Descriptions of basic short-term, small-dollar cash advance products are presented. Current federal and state regulatory approaches to consumer protection in small-dollar lending markets are also explained, including a summary of a proposal by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to implement federal requirements that would act as a floor for state regulations. The CFPB estimates that its proposal would result in a material decline in small-dollar loans offered by AFS providers. The CFPB proposal has been subject to debate. H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017, which was passed by the House of Representatives on June 8, 2017, would prevent the CFPB from exercising any rulemaking, enforcement, or any other authority with respect to payday loans, vehicle title loans, or other similar loans. After discussing the policy implications of the CFPB proposal, this report examines general pricing dynamics in the small-dollar credit market. The degree of market competitiveness, which may be revealed by analyzing market price dynamics, may provide insights concerning affordability and availability options for users of certain small-dollar loan products. The small-dollar lending market exhibits both competitive and noncompetitive market pricing dynamics. Some industry financial data metrics are arguably consistent with competitive market pricing. Factors such as regulatory barriers and differences in product features, however, limit the ability of banks and credit unions to compete with AFS providers in the small-dollar market. Borrowers may prefer some loan product features offered by nonbanks, including how the products are delivered, in comparison to products offered by traditional financial institutions. Given the existence of both competitive and noncompetitive market dynamics, determining whether the prices borrowers pay for small-dollar loan products are \"too high\" is challenging. The Appendix discusses how to conduct meaningful price comparisons using the annual percentage rate (APR) as well as some general information about loan pricing."
