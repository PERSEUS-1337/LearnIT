    "content": "Olympic Commemorative Coins Act - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) issue commemorative one-dollar coins in each six-month period prior to the date upon which the Summer or Winter Olympic Games are held in a nation other than the United States. And (2) develop an expanded multi-coin commemorative coins program in each year prior to a year in which such Games are held in the United States. Expresses the sense of the Congress that each coin edition should be self-sustaining and administered so as not to result in any net cost to the Numismatic Public Enterprise Fund."
