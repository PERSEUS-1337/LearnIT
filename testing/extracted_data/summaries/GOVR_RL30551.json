    "content": "Successive U.S. administrations since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution have viewed Iran as a potential threat to U.S. allies and forces in the Persian Gulf andin the broader Middle East and have sought to limit its strategic capabilities. The greater visibility of moderateelements inside Iran since 1997 led theUnited States to seek to engage Iran in a formal governmental dialogue, but the Clinton and George W. BushAdministration did not reduce U.S. efforts todeny Iran advanced conventional arms and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) technology. Iran's moderatesappear to see regional threats to Iran as doIran's hardliners and have made no apparent effort to curb Iran's efforts to acquire WMD. Even if moderate leadershad sought to do so, they have beenlargely outmaneuvered on defense and other issues by hardliners who still control the armed forces, internal securityservices, the judiciary, and keydecision-making bodies. In the past, Iran has generally lacked the indigenous skills to manufacture sophisticated conventional arms or independently develop weapons of massdestruction (WMD), and one of Iran's objectives over the past decade has been to obtain the technology and skillsto become self-sufficient. Iran has come along way toward that objective in certain areas, including ballistic missiles and chemical weapons, but in theaggregate, Iran remains reliant on foreignsuppliers. This dependence has given the United States some opportunity to work with potential suppliers to containIran's WMD capabilities. Europeanallies of the United States have agreed not to sell conventional weaponry to Iran, and the United States haspersuaded its European allies not to sell anytechnology that could have military applications (\"dual use items\") to Iranian military or security entities. To try to thwart U.S. efforts, Iran has cultivated close relationships with foreign suppliers that are not allied to the United States, especially Russia, China,and North Korea. Curtailing arms and technology supplies to Iran has formed an important part of the U.S. agendawith all three of these countries, but morepressing U.S. objectives with each of them have sometimes hampered the U.S. ability to dissuade them fromassisting Iran. Iran apparently continues toreceive critical technology from all three, but U.S. efforts appear to be limiting their supply relationships with Iran. Congress and successive Administrations have enacted several laws and executive orders, many of which are similar to each other, that impose sanctions oncountries and firms that sell WMD technology to Iran. The most recent measure enacted is the Iran NonproliferationAct ( P.L. 106-178 ), signed in March2000. The Clinton Administration generally preferred diplomacy and engagement with supplier states, and it usedthe threat of sanctions to obtain suppliercooperation. The Bush Administration has taken much the same approach, although it has appeared more willingthan its predecessor to sanction entities insome supplier states. This report will be updated as events warrant."
