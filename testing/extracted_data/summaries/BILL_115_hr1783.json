And (2) provide full practice authority to advanced practice registered nurses, physician assistants, and such other licensed VA health care professionals as is consistent with the education, training, and certification of such professionals without regard to any limitation that would otherwise be imposed on the health care practice of such professionals by a state licensing or credentialing body.
