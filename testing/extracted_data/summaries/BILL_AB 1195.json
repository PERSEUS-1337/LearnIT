    "title": "AB 1195",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee for the purpose of implementing the volume limit for the state on private activity bonds established pursuant to federal law. The committee\u2019s duties include annually determining a state ceiling on the aggregate amount of private activity bonds that may be issued, and allocating that amount among state and local agencies. Existing law defines the terms \u201cprivate activity bond\u201d and \u201cstate ceiling\u201d for those purposes with regard to an amount specified in federal law. This bill would revise the findings and declarations with regard to, and the purpose for, the provisions relating to the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee to reflect the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The bill would revise the definition of \u201cprivate activity bond\u201d and \u201cstate ceiling\u201d to also include certain amounts reserved to the state for qualified educational facilities bonds and would make conforming changes with regard to those bonds."
