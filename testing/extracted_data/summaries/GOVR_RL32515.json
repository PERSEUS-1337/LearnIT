    "content": "Although the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is the best known member of the Intelligence Community, the bulk of the nation's intelligence effort is undertaken by the intelligence agencies ofthe Department of Defense (DOD). In particular, the National Security Agency (NSA), the NationalReconnaissance Office (NRO), and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) (formerlyknown as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA)) are major collectors of informationfor DOD and non-DOD consumers and absorb a large percentage of the annual intelligence budget. (The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), albeit a large and important component of the IntelligenceCommunity, is more directly focused on DOD requirements.) Some Members of Congress and independent commissions, most recently the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, the 9/11 Commission, have argued thata lack of coordination among intelligence agencies contributed to the failure to provide warning ofthe terrorist attacks of September 2001. In response, in December 2004 Congress passed intelligencereform legislation ( P.L. 108-458 ) that modifies the existing organization of the IntelligenceCommunity and establishes more centralized leadership under a newly created Director of NationalIntelligence (DNI). As the legislation was being debated in the fall of 2004, attention focused on the extent of the budgetary and administrative authorities to be assigned to the DNI. Significant concerns wereexpressed by DOD officials, some Members of Congress, and various outside observers thatproviding the DNI with greater authority and control of intelligence agencies in DOD couldjeopardize the increasingly close relationship between these agencies and the operating militaryforces. The conference committee on intelligence reform legislation ( S. 2845 ) addressed these concerns with language that gave the DNI substantial authorities over intelligence budgets, butnot operational control over their activities. The final version of the legislation also provided thatthe details of budgetary authorities to be exercised by the DNI and other cabinet officers be workedout in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the President after the DNI is appointed. This report will be updated as circumstances warrant."
