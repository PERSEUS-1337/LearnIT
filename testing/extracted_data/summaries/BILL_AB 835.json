    "content": "Existing law defines the crime of vehicular manslaughter as the unlawful killing of a human being without malice while driving a vehicle under specified circumstances, including the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to a felony, with or without gross negligence. Existing law provides that vehicular manslaughter is punishable as a misdemeanor or felony. Existing law provides various time limits within which crimes may be prosecuted, except as specified. Existing law authorizes, if a person flees the scene of an accident that caused death or permanent, serious injury, a criminal complaint brought pursuant to specified provisions to be filed within one or 3 years after the completion of the offense, as specified, or one year after the person is initially identified by law enforcement as a suspect in the commission of the offense, whichever is later, but in no case later than 6 years after the commission of the offense. This bill would additionally authorize, if a person flees the scene of an accident, a criminal complaint brought for a violation of specified vehicular manslaughter crimes to be filed either one or 3 years after the commission of the offense, as specified, or one year after the person is initially identified by law enforcement as a suspect in the commission of that offense, whichever is later, but in no case later than 6 years after the commission of the offense."
