    "content": "On March 25, 2003, President Bush requested $74.8 billion in the FY2003 Emergency Supplemental for ongoing military operations in Iraq, postwar occupation, reconstruction and reliefin Iraq, international assistance to countries contributing to the war in Iraq or the global war onterrorism, the cost of the continued U.S. presence in Afghanistan, and additional homeland security. On April 12, 2003, the House and Senate passed the conference version of the FY2003 supplemental ( H.R. 1559 / H.Rept. 108-76 / P.L. 108-11 ). It includes $78.49 billion, $3.7billion more than requested by the President. Additions made by Congress include $3.1 billion forassistance to the airlines, $749 million more for homeland security programs, and $369 million infood aid for Iraq and other countries. The Administration asked Congress to approve funding that would be lodged in several large emergency funds where agencies could determine the actual allocation of funds to particularpurposes or specific countries. The conference version distributes most of these funds to regularappropriations accounts and generally requires additional notifications to Congress of transfers incases where the Administration is given additional flexibility. The largest fund proposed was $59.9 billion for the DOD's Defense Emergency Response Fund that would cover the costs associated with the war in Iraq, the continued U.S. presence inAfghanistan, enhanced security at U.S. military bases, and postwar occupation in Iraq. Theconference includes $15.7 billion in a new Iraq Freedom Fund but distributes the remaining fundsto specific accounts. Congress further provides $2.475 billion for an Iraq Relief and Reconstruction that will fall under the authorities of regular foreign assistance programs usually managed by the StateDepartment and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). H.R. 1559 ,however, extends considerable flexibility to the President, allowing him to directly apportion fundsto several federal agencies, including the Defense Department. The FY2003 EmergencySupplemental also includes $4.7 billion in international assistance for about 22 countries which havecontributed in some fashion to the war in Iraq or the global war on terrorism. This includessubstantial increases in current aid levels for Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, andTurkey. Israel, Egypt and Turkey would also receive U.S. government guaranteed loans. The Administration also requested that substantial appropriations be provided en bloc for homeland security, including $2 billion for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for grantsto states and enhancements of security, and $500 million for a DHS Counterterrorism Fund for investigations and operations. The conference provides $749 million more for homeland securitybut allocates funds to specific appropriation accounts."
