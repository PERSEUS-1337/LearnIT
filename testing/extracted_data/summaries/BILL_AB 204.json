    "title": "AB 204",
    "content": "Existing law dissolved redevelopment agencies and community development agencies as of February 1, 2012, and provides for the designation of successor agencies to wind down the affairs of the dissolved redevelopment agencies, subject to review by oversight boards, and to, among other things, make payments due for enforceable obligations and to perform obligations required pursuant to any enforceable obligation. Existing law authorizes, in each county where more than one oversight board was created, only one oversight board to be appointed on and after July 1, 2016. This bill would require an oversight board within the County of Los Angeles to continue to independently operate past the July 1, 2016, consolidation date, until its successor agency adopts a resolution dissolving the board and the board approves that resolution, as provided. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Los Angeles."
