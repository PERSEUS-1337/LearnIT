When combined with appropriate software, this agility can significantly increase response rate, revisit time and coverage. In prior work, we have demonstrated an algorithmic framework that combines orbital mechanics, attitude control and scheduling optimization to plan the time-varying, full-body orientation of agile, small spacecraft in a constellation. The proposed schedule optimization would run at the ground station autonomously, and the resultant schedules uplinked to the spacecraft for execution. The algorithm is generalizable over small steerable spacecraft, control capability, sensor specs, imaging requirements, and regions of interest. In this article, we modify the algorithm to run onboard small spacecraft, such that the constellation can make time-sensitive decisions to slew and capture images autonomously, without ground control. We have developed a communication module based on Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) for onboard data management and routing among the satellites, which will work in conjunction with the other modules to optimize the schedule of agile communication and steering. We then apply this preliminary framework on representative constellations to simulate targeted measurements of episodic precipitation events and subsequent urban floods. The command and control efficiency of our agile algorithm is compared to non-agile (11.3x improvement) and non-DTN (21% improvement) constellations. Response and revisit requirements for Earth Observation (EO) vary significantly by application, ranging from less than an hour to monitor disasters, to daily for meteorology, to weekly for land cover monitoring BID33 . Geostationary satellites provide frequent revisits, but at the cost of coarse spatial resolution, extra launch costs and no polar access. Lower Earth Orbit satellites overcome these shortcomings, but need numbers and coordination to make up for response characteristics. Adding agility to satellites and autonomy to the constellation improves the revisit/response for the same number of satellites Copyright \u00a9 2019. All rights reserved. in given orbits. However, human operators are expected to scale linearly with constellation nodes BID9 ) and operations staffing may be very costly."
