    "title": "AB 2655",
    "content": "Existing law generally regulates the provision of bail or bond, including forfeiture, vacation of forfeiture, and exoneration of bail or bond. Existing law requires the court to declare bail to be forfeited if, without sufficient excuse, a defendant fails to appear as specified. Existing law denies the court jurisdiction to declare a forfeiture and requires the bail to be released of all obligations under the bond if the case is dismissed or if no complaint is filed within 15 days from the date of arraignment. This bill would authorize an extension of the court\u2019s jurisdiction to declare a forfeiture and authority to release bail for not more than 90 days from the date of the arraignment if the arraignment is properly continued to allow the prosecutor time to file the complaint or if the defendant requests the extension in writing or in open court."
