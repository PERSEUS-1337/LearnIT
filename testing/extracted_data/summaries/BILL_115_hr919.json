    "content": "Portable Fuel Container Safety Act of 2017 This bill requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to promulgate a final rule for flame mitigation devices in portable flammable liquid fuel containers that impede the propagation of flame into the container, unless the CPSC publishes a determination that a voluntary standard developed by a standard development organization meets the intent of this bill. Either the promulgated standard or the voluntary standard shall be treated as a consumer product safety rule. If a standard development organization subsequently revises a voluntary standard, the organization must notify the CPSC and the revision becomes enforceable unless, within 90 days after receiving notice, the CPSC determines that the revised standard does not meet this bill's requirements. The CPSC must undertake a campaign to educate consumers about dangers associated with portable fuel containers near an open flame or other source of ignition. The bill amends the Children's Gasoline Burn Prevention Act to extend child-resistance requirements for closures on portable gasoline containers to receptacles for gasoline, kerosene, or diesel fuel produced or distributed for sale to, or use by, consumers for transport of, or for refueling of internal combustion engines with, gasoline, kerosene, or diesel fuel."
