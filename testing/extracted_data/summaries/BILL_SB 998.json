    "title": "SB 998",
    "content": "Existing law makes it unlawful for a person to stop or park a motor vehicle in specified places, including an area designated as a fire lane by the fire department or fire district, as specified. A violation of these provisions is an infraction. This bill would prohibit a person from operating a motor vehicle, or stopping, parking, or leaving a vehicle standing, on a portion of the highway designated for the exclusive use of public transit buses, subject to specified exceptions. Because a violation of these provisions would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would also require a public transit agency to place and maintain signs and traffic control devices indicating that a portion of a highway is designated for the exclusive use of public transit buses, as specified. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
