    "title": "AB 1053",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the State Department of Public Health under the direction of the State Public Health Officer. Existing law sets forth the powers and duties of the State Public Health Officer, including, but not limited to, designation as the State Registrar of Vital Statistics, having supervisory powers over local registrars and responsibility for the uniform and thorough enforcement of provisions relating to the registration of certain vital statistics. Existing law requires that each death be registered with the local registrar of births and deaths in the district in which the death was officially pronounced or the body was found. Existing law sets forth the persons responsible for completing the certificate of death and the required contents of the certificate, including, but not limited to, the decedent\u2019s name, sex, and birthplace. Certain violations of these requirements are a crime. This bill, commencing July 1, 2016, would require a person completing the certificate of death to record whether the decedent was ever in the Armed Forces of the United States and to include in the items relating to health data information, information on whether the cause of death is any manner of suicide. The bill would also require the local registrar to make information on veteran suicide available to the Department of Veterans Affairs and United States Department of Veterans Affairs. By changing the definition of existing crimes, and by increasing the responsibility of local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above. Existing law authorizes a member of the United States Military Reserve or the National Guard who is called to active duty, as specified, to defer payments on certain obligations while serving on active duty. This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to this provision."
