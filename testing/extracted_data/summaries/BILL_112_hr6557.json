    "content": "College Cost Reduction Act of 2012 - Directs the Secretary of Education to establish the Higher Education Regulatory Reform Task Force to prepare a report, that is to be submitted to Congress and made available on a publicly accessible website, on federal regulatory requirements for institutions of higher education (IHEs). Requires the report to contain: (1) a list of rules that are determined to be outmoded, duplicative, ineffective, or excessively burdensome. (2) an analysis of how the costs of such rules outweigh their benefits. (3) recommendations to consolidate, modify, simplify, or repeal such rules and a description of the justification for and impact of such recommendations. And (4) recommendations on establishing a permanent entity to review new regulatory requirements affecting IHEs. Requires the President to submit to Congress a legislative proposal for carrying out some or all of the recommendations contained in the report. Includes, as part of that proposal, a requirement that the Secretary promulgate regulations requiring IHEs to control annual tuition increases and penalizing noncompliant schools. Establishes congressional procedures to expedite consideration of the President's proposal."
