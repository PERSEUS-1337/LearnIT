    "content": "Since the collapse of Enron Corp. in late 2001, there has been a series of scandals involvingmajor U.S. corporations. Recurring elements in the scandals include improper or fraudulentaccounting, self-enrichment by corporate officers, stock trading on inside information (insidertrading), and the destruction or falsification of business records. A number of cases have resultedin criminal indictments, some followed by guilty pleas. This report tracks post-Enron criminalcharges. Companies are listed alphabetically, and individuals who have been charged, indicted, orhave pleaded guilty are identified. A longer list of companies with recent accounting problems (notall of which have resulted in criminal indictments) may be found in CRS Report RS21269 , Accounting Problems Reported in Major Companies Since Enron , by [author name scrubbed]. The 107th Congress responded to the series of corporate scandals that began with Enron bypassing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. That law created a new oversight body for corporateauditors, imposed new disclosure requirements on corporations, including a mandate that CEOspersonally certify the accuracy of their firms' public financial reports, and increased criminalpenalties for a number of offenses related to securities fraud. For a summary of the legislation, see CRS Report RL31554 , Corporate Accountability: Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (P.L.107-204) , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]. This report will be updated regularly."
