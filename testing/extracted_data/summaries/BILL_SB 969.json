    "title": "SB 969",
    "content": "Existing law, the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law, requires all manufacturers of Korean rice cakes, as defined, to place a label issued by the Korean Rice Cake Association Corporation on the Korean rice cake that indicates the date of manufacture, and requires the label to include a statement that the rice cake must be consumed within one day of manufacture. A violation of these provisions is a crime. This bill would require, except as provided, a manufacturer of Vietnamese rice cakes, as defined, to place a label, designed by the Vietnamese Rice Cake Association, Inc. on the Vietnamese rice cake that indicates the date and time the cooking process was completed, and would require the label to include a statement that the rice cake must be consumed within 24 hours of the date and time printed on the label. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing law, the California Retail Food Code, provides for the regulation of health and sanitation standards for food facilities, as defined, by the State Department of Public Health. Under existing law, local health agencies are primarily responsible for enforcing the California Retail Food Code. A violation of these provisions is a crime. Existing law authorizes a food facility to sell Korean rice cakes, as defined, that have been at room temperature for no more than 24 hours, and requires, at the end of the operating day, Korean rice cakes that have been at room temperature for no more than 24 hours to be destroyed in a manner approved by the enforcement agency. This bill would also authorize a food facility to sell Vietnamese rice cakes that have been at no more than 70 degrees Fahrenheit for no more than 24 hours and would require Vietnamese rice cakes that have been at no more than 70 degrees Fahrenheit but have been stored for more than 24 hours to be destroyed in a manner approved by the enforcement agency. By imposing new enforcement requirements on local health agencies, and by creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."
