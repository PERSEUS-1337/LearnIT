    "content": "Children's Media Protection Act of 1995 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to: (1) prescribe rules to identify and rate sexual, violent, and indecent television programming that is clearly inappropriate for children. (2) prescribe rules for the transmission by television programming distributors of signals that identify the programming rating and permit viewers to block such inappropriate programming. And (3) require television sets with picture screens of 13 inches or greater to be equipped with blocking circuitry and enable viewers to block display of all programs with a common rating. Prohibits any person from shipping, manufacturing, assembling, or importing any television not so equipped. Requires performance standards for blocking technology. Directs the FCC to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to prescribe a prohibition on the broadcast on commercial television and any public telecommunications entities between 6 o'clock a. m. and 9 o'clock p. m. of such inappropriate programming. Directs the FCC, in granting an application for a television broadcast license, to impose conditions which ensure that the applicant complies with the standards for children's television programming as established under the Children's Television Act of 1990 and otherwise serves the educational and informational needs of children through its overall programming. Prohibits a cable franchise award or renewal unless the cable operator complies with such standards."
