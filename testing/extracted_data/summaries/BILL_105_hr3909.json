    "content": "Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument Minor Boundary Adjustments Act - Modifies the boundaries of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in the State of Utah to exclude specified Federal lands and to include the East Clark Bench. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to transfer, without consideration but subject to valid existing non-Federal rights, specified Federal lands in Garfield County, Utah, to: (1) Tropic Town, Utah. And (2) the State of Utah for inclusion of such lands in Kodachrome Basin State Park. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed as constituting congressional approval, explicit or implicit, of the establishment of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Expresses the intent of the Congress that the Monument be abolished if any court finds that the President exceeded the President's authority under the Antiquities Act of 1906 in establishing the national monument."
