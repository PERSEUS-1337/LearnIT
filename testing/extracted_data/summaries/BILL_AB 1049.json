    "title": "AB 1049",
    "content": "Under existing law, a man is conclusively presumed to be the father of a child if he was married to and cohabiting with the child\u2019s mother, except as specified. Existing law also provides that if a man signs a voluntary declaration of paternity, it has the force and effect of a judgment of paternity, subject to certain exceptions. Existing law provides that these presumptions are rebuttable. This bill would state that a person\u2019s offer or refusal to sign a voluntary declaration of paternity may be considered as a factor, but shall not be determinative as to the issue of legal parentage in any proceedings regarding the establishment or termination of parental rights. Existing law requires a nonattorney surrogacy facilitator to direct his or her client to deposit client funds in an independent, bonded escrow account or a trust account maintained by an attorney, subject to specified withdrawal requirements. This bill would additionally require a nonattorney donor facilitator to direct his or her client to deposit client funds, as specified above."
