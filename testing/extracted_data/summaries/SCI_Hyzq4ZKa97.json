    "content": "Much of the focus in the design of deep neural networks had been on improving accuracy, leading to more powerful yet highly complex network architectures that are difficult to deploy in practical scenarios.   As a result, there has been a recent interest in the design of quantitative metrics for evaluating deep neural networks that accounts for more than just model accuracy as the sole indicator of network performance.   In this study, we continue the conversation towards universal metrics for evaluating the performance of deep neural networks for practical on-device edge usage by introducing NetScore, a new metric designed specifically to provide a quantitative assessment of the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture complexity of a deep neural network.   In what is one of the largest comparative analysis between deep neural networks in literature, the NetScore metric, the top-1 accuracy metric, and the popular information density metric were compared across a diverse set of 60 different deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC 2012) dataset.   The evaluation results across these three metrics for this diverse set of networks are presented in this study to act as a reference guide for practitioners in the field.  "
