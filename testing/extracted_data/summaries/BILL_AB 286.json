    "title": "AB 286",
    "content": "Existing law, the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act, requires the State Department of Developmental Services to contract with regional centers to provide services and supports, including supported living services, to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. Existing law lists the range of supported living services and supports to include, among other things, recruiting, training, and hiring individuals to provide personal care and other assistance, and requires supported living service providers to conduct comprehensive assessments for the purpose of getting to know the consumer they will be supporting. This bill would require direct care workers providing supported living services to satisfactorily complete 15 hours of training in behavioral intervention within 3 months from the date the provider was hired."
