And (2) a comprehensive effort is required to revitalize and sustain the all-volunteer force and to address the decline in the quality of life for military personnel and their families, especially with regard to military housing, pay, and retirement benefits. Increases by 4.8 percent, as of January 1, 2000, the rates of monthly basic pay for military personnel. Waives, during FY 2000, the required adjustment of such pay in conformance with the General Schedule of the Federal Government."
