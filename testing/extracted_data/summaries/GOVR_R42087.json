Heightened concern over the national debt crisis, the economic recession, and stubbornly high unemployment has resulted in renewed congressional interest in the cost and effectiveness of the system. This report reviews various reform proposals and presents several potential options for Congress, ranging from maintaining the current system to a national commission to review military compensation, benefits, and retirement. The military retirement system is a noncontributory, defined benefit plan which guarantees a specific monthly payment after 20 or more years of service. Vesting occurs at 20 years of service, regardless of age, and is therefore an \"all or nothing\" proposition. Retirement age varies, but most military retirees are young enough to pursue private-sector careers following their military service. Most observers note that ,while effective as a retention tool, military retirement is also very expensive\u2014in FY2010 there were 2,271,000 retirees and survivors receiving a total of $50.842 billion from the federal government. However, because of the way the government accounts for military retirement, the direct cost to the Department of Defense (DOD) is significantly less. In FY2009, DOD paid $17.5 billion to the Military Retirement Fund to fund the future retirement of the military cohort who entered the military during 2009. Critics of the military retirement system frequently cite several points in addition to cost: (1) It is inefficient because it defers too much compensation until the completion of a military career; (2) It is inflexible because it does not facilitate force management or encourage longer careers; and (3) It is inequitable because most servicemembers never qualify or vest. The military retirement system has evolved over time (see \"Major Legislative Reforms of Military Retirement\"). Today, active component servicemembers choose between two retirement systems at their 15th year of service (either High-3 or Redux), reservists are restricted to one system (a modified version of High-3), and disability retirees also have the opportunity to choose between two systems (High-3 or Disability retirement). Many observers have agreed that a reformed retirement system could enhance retention, provide an improved force management tool, and provide an equitable retirement regardless of component or special situation. A review of past legislative proposals finds that they have been controversial, unpopular with DOD and servicemembers, and generally focused on reducing the cost of military retirement. The Redux option, in particular, has become a less attractive option and fewer and fewer servicemembers are selecting it. The cost factor, combined with the recent emphasis on reducing costs in DOD and the overall federal deficit, resulted in a number of studies, commissions and reports in 2010. However, these efforts did not result in comprehensive policy changes. In addition to the most recent commission and think tank reports, two other efforts within the past five years included detailed recommendations for retirement reform. The 2005 Defense Advisory Committee on Military Compensation (DACMC) established a framework for a comprehensive restructuring of military retirement. This was followed in 2008 by the 10th Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation (QRMC) that further modeled, refined, and amplified on the work of the DACMC. Both efforts supported applying a reformed military retirement system to new entrants only; currently serving and already retired members would be grandfathered."
