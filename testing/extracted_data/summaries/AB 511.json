    "title": "An act to amend Section 3212.1 of, and to repeal and add Sections 3212, 3212.5, 3212.6, 3212.85, and 3212.9 of, the Labor Code, relating to workers\u2019 compensation.",
    "content": "Existing law establishes a workers\u2019 compensation system to compensate an employee for injuries arising out of, and in the course of, his or her employment. Existing law designates illnesses and conditions that constitute a compensable injury for various employees, such as California Highway Patrol members, firefighters, and certain peace officers. These injuries include, but are not limited to, hernia, pneumonia, heart trouble, cancer, meningitis, and exposure to a biochemical substance when the illness or condition develops or manifests itself during a period when the officer or employee is in service of his or her employer, as specified. This bill would expand the coverage of the above provisions relating to compensable injury, to include other, full-time peace officers described pursuant to specified provisions of law. The bill would also expand the coverage of these provisions to include, upon the approval of an ordinance or resolution adopted by the governing body of the contracting public agency, or the adoption of language to this effect in a city or county charter, or pursuant to the terms and conditions of employment set forth in a collective bargaining agreement, include a custody assistant, correctional officer, security officer, or security assistant employed by a public agency, or a peace officer other than a peace officer to whom these provisions already apply. The bill would also make technical and clarifying changes."
