    "content": "Screening Mammography Act of 2001 - Amends the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to require that a group health plan that provides coverage for diagnostic mammography for any class of participants or beneficiaries also cover annual screening mammography for that class under terms that are not less favorable. Prohibits: (1) denying screening coverage on the basis that it is not medically necessary or not pursuant to a referral or recommendation. (2) denying eligibility, enrollment, or renewal solely to avoid this requirement. (3) providing monetary incentives to participants or beneficiaries to encourage them to accept less. Or (4) penalizing or providing incentives to providers. Allows State laws providing at least these protections. Amends PHSA to apply such requirements and prohibitions to health coverage in the individual market. Amends the Social Security Act to revise title XIX (Medicaid) to mandate coverage of annual screening mammographies."
