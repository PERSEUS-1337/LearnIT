    "content": "The economy officially was considered in a recession in December 2008, but many forecasters had long recognized the downturn and some believed this economic contraction would be more severe than other post-World War II economic slowdowns. A combination of factors have combined to present policymakers with difficult decisions on how best to stimulate the economy. Troubling instability in the housing and financial services sectors have combined with weak auto manufacturing demand, and high energy costs earlier in the year to slow growth dramatically and force millions into unemployment. With declining tax revenue and increasing costs to provide unemployment and other benefits to unemployed workers, states are considering measures to rein in spending, including restricting Medicaid eligibility and services. Congress is considering legislation aimed at stimulating economic activity in selected industrial sectors to save existing and create new jobs, reduce taxes, invest in future technologies, and fund infrastructure improvements. The House-approved the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, H.R. 1) on January 22. ARRA provisions would provide temporary support to families and individuals by providing additional unemployment compensation benefits, short-term access to Medicaid, financial assistance for individuals to maintain their health coverage under provisions in the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), and temporary increases in Medicaid matching rates and disproportionate share hospital allotments. The full House amended and approved H.R. 1 on January 28, 2009. Similar legislation to H.R. 1 was introduced in the Senate (ARRA, S. 350) and referred to the Committee on Finance, among others, where provisions were approved on January 27. [See the Senate Committee on Finance website for S.Amdt. 98 at http://finance.senate.gov/sitepages/leg/LEG%202009/020209%20complete%20legislative%20text%20of%20American%20Recovery%20and%20Reinvestment%20Act.pdf.] An amendment in the nature of a substitute (SAmdt. 570) was offered as a substitute for H.R. 1 and was approved by the full Senate on February 10, 2009. The Senate version of ARRA was referred to a joint Senate and House conference committee. This report describes Medicaid provisions presented under Division B, Title III and Title V, of the House-approved version of the ARRA, and similar provisions in Titles III and V in a Senate Amendment (ARRA, S.Amdt. 570) offered in the nature of a substitute for H.R. 1. Table 1 provides a summary of major provisions in H.R. 1 and S.Amdt. 570.
