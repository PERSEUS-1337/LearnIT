    "content": "Reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other aviation programs is likely to be a high priority in the 110th Congress. Funding authorizations for aviation programs, as well as authorization of existing aviation tax structure that provides revenue for the aviation trust fund, are set to expire at the end of FY2007. Congress may consider a variety of financing options to maintain the ability of the aviation trust fund to provide a sufficient revenue stream for ongoing operational costs and planned infrastructure improvements. One particularly controversial alternative under consideration is a user fee system, which is supported by the airlines but strongly opposed by many other system users. Faced with growing operational costs and fiscal needs to support system expansion, airport capital improvements, and modernization efforts, options to control costs within the FAA and the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) may be a particular focus of reauthorization. Cost control options generally revolve around two overarching strategies: consolidation of facilities and functions, and competitive sourcing. Some have recommended that a formal process, similar to the military's Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process, be implemented to assess how the FAA could best consolidate its functions to control costs and address future system needs. Besides controlling costs, options to maintain and balance air traffic controller staffing levels are likely to be of particular interest, as the FAA is facing a large wave of controller retirements over the next five years. Options for improving and streamlining training, increasing productivity, better balancing staffing needs, and perhaps consolidating air traffic facilities over the long-term may be considered during reauthorization. Congress may examine a variety of aviation safety issues during debate over FAA reauthorization. Options for preventing runway overruns and for reducing the risk of runway collisions may be of particular interest. The adequacy of FAA safety oversight has been a continuing concern, and recent accidents may draw particular attention to oversight of contract repair facilities, smaller passenger service operators, as well as air charter and air tour operators. Other safety issues that may arise include longstanding concerns, such as mitigating the risks of fuel tank explosions, addressing concerns over aging aircraft, and addressing the unique safety issues affecting all-cargo operations. Issues regarding airliner cabin health and safety may also be considered. Options to mitigate the spread of infectious diseases among aircraft occupants and the safety-of-flight implications of cell phones and portable electronic devices may also be examined. Growing interest in alternatives to petroleum fuel may generate some debate over alternative fuel technologies for aircraft and airport ground vehicles, and growing international pressures to regulate aircraft emissions may prompt debate on aviation's environmental impacts. Longstanding aircraft noise policies may also be examined to assess whether quiet aircraft technologies and policy changes could further mitigate the community impacts of aircraft noise. This report will be updated."
