    "content": "Lawmakers incorporated the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (H.R. 1), the economic stimulus bill that the President signed into law on February 17, 2009 (P.L. 111-5). The HITECH Act is intended to promote the widespread adoption of health information technology (HIT) to support the electronic sharing of clinical data among hospitals, physicians, and other health care stakeholders. HIT is widely viewed as a necessary and vital component of health care reform. It encompasses interoperable electronic health records (EHRs)\u2014including computerized systems to order tests and medications, and support systems to aid clinical decision making\u2014and the development of a national health information network to permit the secure exchange of electronic health information among providers. The HITECH Act builds on existing federal efforts to encourage HIT adoption and use. It codifies the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONCHIT) within the Department of Health and Human Services. ONCHIT was created by Executive Order in 2004 and charged with developing and implementing a strategic plan to guide the nationwide implementation of health information technology (HIT) in the public and private health care sectors. ONCHIT has focused on developing standards necessary to achieve interoperability among varying HIT applications; establishing criteria for certifying that HIT products meet those standards; ensuring the privacy and security of electronic health information; and helping facilitate the creation of prototype health information networks. The HITECH Act provides financial incentives for HIT use among health care practitioners. It establishes several grant programs to provide funding for investing in HIT infrastructure, purchasing certified EHRs, training, and the dissemination of best practices. It also authorizes grants to states for low-interest loans to help providers finance HIT. Beginning in 2011, the legislation authorizes Medicare incentive payments to encourage doctors and hospitals to adopt and use certified EHRs. Those incentive payments are phased out over time and replaced by financial penalties for physicians and hospitals that are not using certified EHRs. The legislation further authorizes a 100% federal match for payments to certain qualifying Medicaid providers who acquire and use certified EHR technology. Finally, the HITECH Act includes a series of privacy and security provisions that expand the current requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Among other things, the legislation strengthens enforcement of the HIPAA privacy rule and creates a right to be notified in the event of a breach of identifiable health information. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that Medicare and Medicaid spending under the HITECH Act will total $32.7 billion over the 2009-2019 period. CBO anticipates, however, that widespread HIT adoption will reduce total spending on health care. Through 2019, CBO estimates that the HITECH Act will save the Medicare and Medicaid programs a total of about $12.5 billion. Under current law, CBO predicts that about 45% of hospitals and 65% of physicians will have adopted HIT by 2019. CBO estimates that the incentive mechanisms in the HITECH Act will boost those adoption rates to about 70% for hospitals and about 90% for physicians."
