    "title": "AB 302",
    "content": "Existing law requires an employer to provide a reasonable amount of break time to accommodate an employee desiring to express breast milk for the employee\u2019s infant child. Existing law requires the employer to make reasonable efforts to provide the employee with the use of a room or other location, other than a toilet stall, in close proximity to the employee\u2019s work area, for the employee to express milk in private. Existing law establishes the California School Age Families Education Program, which is a comprehensive, continuous, and community linked school-based program that focuses on youth development and dropout prevention for pregnant and parenting pupils and on child care and development services for their children. Existing federal law requires an educational institution to treat pregnancy, childbirth, recovery from childbirth, and other specified conditions in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability. Existing law also prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability, gender, or other specified characteristics in any program or activity conducted by an educational institution that receives, or benefits from, state financial assistance or enrolls pupils who receive state financial aid. This bill would require a school operated by a school district or a county office of education, the California School for the Deaf, the California School for the Blind, and a charter school to provide, only if there is at least one lactating pupil on the school campus, reasonable accommodations to a lactating pupil on a school campus to express breast milk, breast-feed an infant child, or address other needs related to breast-feeding. The bill would require that these reasonable accommodations include, but are not limited to, access to a private and secure room, other than a restroom, to express breast milk or breast-feed an infant child, permission to bring onto a school campus any equipment used to express breast milk, access to a power source for that equipment, and access to a place to safely store expressed breast milk. The bill would also require that a lactating pupil on a school campus be given a reasonable amount of time to accommodate the need to express breast milk or breast-feed an infant child. The bill would prohibit a pupil from incurring an academic penalty as a result of her use, during the schoolday, of these reasonable accommodations. The bill would authorize a complaint of noncompliance with the requirements of the bill to be filed with the local educational agency, and would require the local educational agency to respond to such a complaint, in accordance with specified procedures. The bill would also authorize a complainant to appeal a decision of the local educational agency to the State Department of Education and would require the department to issue a written decision within 60 days of its receipt of the appeal. The bill would require a local educational agency to provide a remedy to the affected pupil if the local educational agency finds merit in a complaint or if the Superintendent of Public Instruction finds merit in an appeal. The bill would also include a statement of legislative findings and declarations. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
