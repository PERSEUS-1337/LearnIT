    "content": "Federal Land Asset Inventory Reform Act of 2014 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to develop and maintain a current, accurate multipurpose cadastre of federal real property to assist with federal land management activities, including, but not limited to, resource development and conservation, travel management, agricultural use, active forest management, environmental protection, and use of real property. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cost-sharing agreements with states to include any non-federal lands in a state in such cadastre. Limits the federal share of any such agreement to 50 of the total cost to a state for the development of the cadastre of the non-federal lands in the state. Requires Interior to submit a report, covering all cadastres and inventories authorized, operated, or maintained by all executive agencies, on: (1) existing real property inventories or any components of any cadastre, (2) consolidation of inventories and components, (3) the use of existing inventories and components of any cadastre, (4) cost savings that will be achieved, and (5) recommendations for legislation. Requires Interior to: (1) make the cadastre available on the Internet in a graphically geo-enabled and searchable format. (2) ensure that the inventory required by this Act includes the identification of all lands and parcels suitable for disposal by Resource Management Plans conducted pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. And (3) prevent the disclosure of any parcels of land, buildings or facilities thereon, or related information, if this would impair or jeopardize national security or homeland defense."
