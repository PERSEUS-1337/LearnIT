    "content": "American Natural Gas Security and Consumer Protection Act Amends the Natural Gas Act to prohibit exporting natural gas from the United States to a foreign country without first having secured an order of the Secretary of Energy (DOE) authorizing the exportation. Allows DOE to: (1) authorize such exportation after determining that it is consistent with the public interest, and (2) modify the export application as DOE determines necessary. Requires the Secretary to issue: (1) an environmental impact statement (EIS) under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 on such an order, and (2) a summary of an analysis on the impact of extraction of exported natural gas upon the environment in those communities where the natural gas is extracted. Directs DOE to promulgate final regulations to establish the processes for determining whether a proposed exportation of natural gas from the United States to a foreign country is in the public interest. Exempts any export authorization order from the EIS and public interest requirements if the natural gas would be exported solely to meet certain requirements of: (1) the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, (2) the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or (3) the Trading with the Enemy Act. Authorizes DOE, furthermore, to issue such orders without modification or delay after receiving an application. States that this Act does not affect certain authority under the Natural Gas Act regarding the importation or exportation of natural gas to a nation with which a free trade agreement is in effect."
