    "content": "The 110 th Congress has been monitoring U.S. efforts to regain foreign markets that banned U.S. beef when a Canadian-born cow in Washington state tested positive for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in December 2003. The four major U.S. beef export markets, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Korea, are again open to U.S. products. However, resumption of beef trade with Japan and Korea has not gone smoothly. For example, Korea briefly readmitted but then suspended U.S. beef imports. Now, Korea's delays in implementing an April 2008 agreement to end its ban are a key issue in congressional consideration of the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement."
