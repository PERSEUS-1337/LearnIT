    "content": "Congress annually considers 12 regular appropriations measures to provide discretionary funding for federal government activities and operations. For FY2019, appropriations actions spanned two Congresses, between which there was a change in the majority party in the House. The process of drafting, considering, and enacting FY2019 appropriations began in early 2018 and included the House and Senate Appropriations Committees each marking up and reporting all 12 annual appropriations bills by the end of July. Five appropriations bills in the 115 th Congress were enacted into law by the start of the fiscal year. An additional seven appropriations bills remained in various stages of consideration. Continuing resolutions (CRs) were enacted in order to extend funding of government operations covered in these seven bills. The first CR for FY2019 provided funding through December 7, 2018. A second CR provided funding through December 21, 2018. When the second CR expired, funding lapsed for the agencies and activities covered in the remaining seven appropriations bills, and a partial government shutdown ensued. The shutdown ended on January 25, 2019, when the 116 th Congress enacted a third CR to provide funding through February 15, 2019. Appropriations actions were subsequently completed when H.J.Res . 31 , an omnibus measure covering the seven remaining appropriations measures, was signed into law on February 15, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ). These and other actions are detailed in this report to provide overview information and a chronology of FY2019 appropriations measures.
