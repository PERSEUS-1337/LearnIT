    "content": "In recent decades, the rapid growth in poor country debt has emerged as a key foreign policyconcern. Many analysts believe that this debt burden is an impediment to economic growth andpoverty reduction. Others contend that for the poorest countries, other factors such as weak politicaland economic institutions, are a greater impediment to growth than the debt burden. There have been many efforts to help reduce poor country debt. In 1988 a group of majorcreditor nations, known as the Paris Club, agreed for the first time to cancel debts owed to theminstead of refinancing them on easier terms as they had done previously. In 1996, the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the regional development banks agreed to allow aportion of debts owed to them by a select group of countries to be cancelled. This effort is knownas the Debt Relief Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC). In June 2005, the Groupof Eight (G8) nations agreed to further deepen debt relief and proposed 100% cancellation of allmultilateral debt for countries that have finished the HIPC program. Several pieces of legislation( H.R. 1130 and S. 1320 ) also have been introduced that could extend debtrelief to an even larger group of countries. As introduced, the G8 proposal raises four possibleconcerns: Scope of Debt Cancellation -- The proposed agreement is limited to the IMF,the World Bank, and the African Development Bank. Several other development banks are majorcreditors and are not included in the proposal. No Net New Assistance -- The proposed agreement specifies that HIPCcountries that receive debt reduction will have their total assistance flows reduced by the amount ofdebt forgiven. This money will then be reallocated among all low-income countries. Funding is Not Assured -- The agreement promises that G8 countries willcompensate the development banks for any debt relief they provide. However, future contributionsto the development banks are not guaranteed. Future Commitments are Unspecified -- The agreement commits G8members to cover the cost of debt relief for countries that may later enter the HIPC process. Depending on which, if any, countries are added, the potential cost of debt relief may risesignificantly. No congressional appropriations are required at this time to implement the G8 proposal. However, additional U.S. funds may need to be appropriated in the future to fund higher levels ofHIPC debt relief. This report will no longer be updated.
