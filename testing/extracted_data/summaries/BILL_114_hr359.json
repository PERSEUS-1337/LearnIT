    "content": "Veterans Dog Training Therapy Act Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to carry out a five-year pilot program to assess the effectiveness of addressing veterans' post-deployment mental health and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms through the therapeutic medium of educating those veterans in the training and handling of service dogs for veterans with disabilities. Requires: (1) the Secretary to carry out the pilot program through contracts with appropriate nongovernmental entities located in close proximity to at least three but no more than five VA medical centers, and (2) each of those entities to be certified in the training and handling of service dogs and to have a training area that would be appropriate for use in educating veterans with mental health conditions in the art and science of service dog training and handling."
