    "content": "Clean Coal Act of 2007 - Amends the Clean Air Act to require a new coal-fired electric generating unit that commences construction on or after April 26, 2007, to meet, without interruption throughout the lifetime operation of the unit, a standard of performance that, at a minimum, requires the unit to produce not more than 285 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour for supply to the grid. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to revise such standard to reduce the maximum rate of carbon dioxide emissions if a reduced level is achievable through the application of the best technological system of continuous emission reduction demonstrated at the time of the revision. Provides that carbon dioxide that is injected into a geological formation in a manner that prevents the release of the carbon dioxide into the atmosphere shall not be counted as emissions discharged from a unit for purposes of meeting the standard."
