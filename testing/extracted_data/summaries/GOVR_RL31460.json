    "content": "The Educational and Cultural Exchange Visitor program has become a gateway for foreign medical graduates (FMGs) to gain admission to the United States as nonimmigrants for the purposeof graduate medical education and training. The visa most of these physicians enter under is the J-1nonimmigrant visa. Under the J-1 visa program, participants must return to their home country aftercompleting their education or training for a period of at least two years before they can apply foranother nonimmigrant visa or legal permanent resident (LPR) status, unless they are granted a waiverof the requirement. The J-1 visa waiver program has recently undergone significant change. In February 2002, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which had historically been the largest sponsorof waivers, decided to end its participation as an interested government agency (IGA). Thisdevelopment and the pending expiration of the \"Conrad 20\" program, which allowed 20 waivers perstate, threatened the continued availability of waivers. These developments raised concerns amongmany in medically underserved areas because it is often difficult for them to find U.S. medicalgraduates willing to practice in these areas. Bills introduced in the 107th Congress proposed changesto the \"Conrad 20\" program, including expanding the program and making it permanent. In an effort to ensure the continued availability of medical care in underserved areas, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced it would assume USDA's role as asponsor of J-1 primary care physicians. This was a policy change for HHS which has historicallybeen very restrictive in its sponsorship of waivers. Prior to this announcement, HHS had limitedsponsorship to research physicians and scientists involved in research of international or nationalsignificance. On November 2, 2002, the \"Conrad 20\" program was extended until 2004 and the number of waivers available to states was increased to 30. This program, which is now referred to as the\"Conrad 30\"or \"State 30\" program, expired on June 1, 2004. Several measures, to address the expiration of the \"Conrad 30\" program were introduced in the108th Congress. On December 3, 2004, S. 2302 became P.L. 108-441 . The new lawextends the program until June 1, 2006; exempts physicians granted waivers from the H-1Bnumerical limits; allows states to hire primary and speciality care physicians; and place up to fivephysicians in shortage areas designated by the state."
