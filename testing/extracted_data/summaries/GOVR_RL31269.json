    "content": "A refugee is a person fleeing his or her country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Typically, the annual number of refugees that can be admitted into the United States, known as the refugee ceiling, and the allocation of these numbers by region are set by the President after consultation with Congress at the start of each fiscal year. For FY2019, the worldwide refugee ceiling is 30,000. The FY2019 regional allocations are, as follows: Africa (11,000), East Asia (4,000), Europe and Central Asia (3,000), Latin America/ Caribbean (3,000), and Near East/South Asia (9,000). This 30,000 ceiling is the lowest annual ceiling since the establishment of the U.S. refugee admissions program in 1980. Refugee admissions in FY2018 totaled 22,491, the lowest annual level of refugee arrivals in the United States in the history of the refugee admissions program. The Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) within the Department of State (DOS) coordinates and manages the U.S. refugee program. Generally, PRM arranges for a nongovernmental organization, an international organization, or U.S. embassy contractors to manage a Resettlement Support Center that assists in refugee processing. Overseas processing of refugees is conducted through a system of three priorities for admission. Priority 1 comprises cases involving persons facing compelling security concerns. Priority 2 comprises cases involving persons from specific groups of special humanitarian concern to the United States (e.g., Iranian religious minorities). Priority 3 comprises family reunification cases involving close relatives of persons admitted as refugees or granted asylum. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is responsible for adjudicating refugee cases. To be eligible for admission to the United States as a refugee, an individual must meet the definition of a refugee, not be firmly resettled in another country, be determined to be of special humanitarian concern to the United States, and be admissible to the United States. The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement (HHS/ORR) administers a transitional assistance program for temporarily dependent refugees, Cuban/Haitian entrants, and others. For FY2018, the Refugee and Entrant Assistance account was funded at $2.051 billion."
