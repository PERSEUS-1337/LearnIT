    "content": "The United States and Europe share a long and intertwined history, replete with many upsand downs. The modern transatlantic relationship was forged in the aftermath of World War II todeter the Soviet threat and to promote security and stability in Europe. NATO and the EuropeanUnion (EU), the latest stage in a process of European integration begun in the 1950s, are the two keypillars upon which the U.S.-European partnership still rests. The U.S. Congress and successive U.S.administrations have supported both organizations as means to nourish democracy, foster reliablemilitary allies, and create strong trading partners. Despite the changed European security environment since the end of the Cold War andcurrent transatlantic frictions, many observers stress that the security and prosperity of the UnitedStates and Europe remain inextricably linked. Both sides of the Atlantic continue to face a commonset of challenges -- from countering terrorism and weapons proliferation to ensuring the stability ofthe global financial markets -- and have few other comparable partners. The United States and theEU also share the largest trade and investment relationship in the world; annual two-way flows ofgoods, services, and foreign direct investment exceed $1.1 trillion, while the total stock of two-waydirect investment is over $1.6 trillion. Nevertheless, the transatlantic partnership has been fundamentally challenged in recent yearsas numerous trade and foreign policy conflicts have emerged. The crisis over Iraq is most notable,but the list of disagreements is wide and varied. It includes the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the EUarms embargo on China, the role of multilateral institutions and the use of force, the U.S. treatmentof prisoners in Iraq and at Guant\u00c3\u00a1namo Bay, aircraft subsidies, and trade in genetically-modifiedfood. These disputes have been driven partly by leadership frictions and European perceptions ofU.S. unilateralism, and partly by structural issues -- different policy preferences for managing threats,the U.S.-European defense capabilities gap, and the EU's political evolution -- set in motion by theend of the Cold War and September 11. These factors are also prompting some Americans andEuropeans to question whether the two sides of the Atlantic still share the same values and interests,and whether enough commonality remains to make the partnership work. This report assesses the present state of the U.S.-European relationship and the reasons forcurrent frictions. To stimulate debate and for the purposes of analysis, it also offers a spectrum ofpossible options for U.S. policymakers in considering the future shape of the political and strategicdimensions of the transatlantic partnership. These selected options should be viewed as illustrativeguideposts, however, rather than definitive, exhaustive predictions or stark choices. This report willbe updated as needed.
