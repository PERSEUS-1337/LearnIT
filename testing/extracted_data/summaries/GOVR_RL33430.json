    "content": "The estimated rate of air ambulance accidents has been steadily rising since the early 1990s,and has increased at a rapid rate since 1998 when the industry began to expand more rapidly and shifttoward a model of more independent private air ambulance services that cover larger geographicareas. Statistics indicate that the large majority of air ambulance accidents are attributable tooperational factors related to pilot situation awareness and decision making when faced with adverseenvironmental conditions such as darkness, deteriorating weather, rugged terrain, or somecombination of these factors. Initiatives to improve air ambulance safety to date have consequently focused on additionalpilot training, implementing risk management practices to improve the safety of flight operations,and using various technologies to improve pilot situation awareness in restricted visibility conditions. However, implementation of these safety measures has strictly been voluntary. The NationalTransporation Safety Board (NTSB) and other aviation safety experts are advocating the mandatoryuse of formal flight dispatch procedures and risk management practices among air ambulanceoperators as well as mandatory installation of terrain warning systems on air ambulance aircraft. TheNTSB also found that many air ambulance accidents occur when patients are not on board, such asen route to an accident scene. Present regulations allow air ambulances to operate under a lessstringent set of rules with regards to weather minimums and pilot duty times when not carryingpatients. However, the NTSB believes that air ambulance flights should operate under morestringent commercial operating rules at all times that medical personnel are carried on board. Although maintenance issues have been identified in about 20 percent of all air ambulance accidents,neither the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) nor the NTSB has placed any specific emphasison oversight of operators or repair stations that maintain air ambulance aircraft. The presentemphasis on air ambulance safety has, instead, been dominated by concerns over flight crewperformance and weather-related factors. A variety of options are available to improve safety among air ambulance operators. Theseoptions include intensified oversight of air ambulance operators and regulatory changes to bring allphases of air ambulance operations under the same set of operational rules regarding weatherminimums and pilot duty times; possible regulatory changes to provide for sharing and analysis ofsafety-related data and observations with some degree of impunity; possible aircraft designconsiderations to improve crash survivability; expanded application of system safety and formal riskmanagement principles to mission planning and flight operations; enhanced training for both pilotsand support personnel and operational procedures to improve coordination and situation awarenessamong the entire air ambulance crew and ground support team; and the use of various technologiesto improve pilot situation awareness and augment pilot vision in low visibility conditions.
