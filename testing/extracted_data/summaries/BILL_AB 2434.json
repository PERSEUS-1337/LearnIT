    "content": "Existing law, the Donahoe Higher Education Act, sets forth the missions and functions of the 4 segments comprising the state\u2019s postsecondary education system. These segments are the University of California, administered by the Regents of the University of California, the California State University, administered by the Trustees of the California State University, the California Community Colleges, administered by the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, and independent institutions of higher education. A provision of the act sets forth the missions of specified agencies charged with coordination, administration, or implementation of higher education policies and programs. This bill would delete this provision, and would express the intent of the Legislature to explore alternative ways to improve affordability, accessibility, coordination, and development of higher education policy that are consistent with the interest of the people and State of California. establish the 9-member Blue Ribbon Commission on Public Postsecondary Education, and specify its membership and duties. The bill would require the commission to publish a report on designated subjects and submit this report to designated governmental entities by March 31, 2018. The bill would require the Office of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Public Postsecondary Education to close on June 30, 2018, and would repeal the provisions of the bill on January 1, 2019. The bill would require, upon that repeal, all of the documents and working papers of the commission to become the property of the State Archives."
