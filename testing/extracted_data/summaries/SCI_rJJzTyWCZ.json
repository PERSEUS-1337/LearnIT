    "content": "Cloze test is widely adopted in language exams to evaluate students' language proficiency. In this paper, we propose the first large-scale human-designed cloze test dataset CLOTH in which the questions were used in middle-school and high-school language exams. With the missing blanks carefully created by teachers and candidate choices purposely designed to be confusing, CLOTH requires a deeper language understanding and a wider attention span than previous automatically generated cloze datasets. We show humans outperform dedicated designed baseline models by a significant margin, even when the model is trained on sufficiently large external data. We investigate the source of the performance gap, trace model deficiencies to some distinct properties of CLOTH, and identify the limited ability of comprehending a long-term context to be the key bottleneck. In addition, we find that human-designed data leads to a larger gap between the model's performance and human performance when compared to automatically generated data. Being a classic language exercise, the cloze test BID26 is an accurate assessment of language proficiency BID7 BID11 BID27 and has been widely employed in language examinations. Under standard setting, a cloze test requires examinees to fill in the missing word (or sentence) that best fits the surrounding context. To facilitate natural language understanding, automatically generated cloze datasets were introduced to measure the ability of machines in reading comprehension BID8 BID9 BID17 . In these datasets, each cloze question typically consists of a context paragraph and a question sentence. By randomly replacing a particular word in the question sentence with a blank symbol, a single test case is created. For instance, the CNN/Daily Mail BID8 take news articles as the context and the summary bullet points as the question sentence. Only named entities are considered when creating the blanks. Similarly, in Children's Books test (CBT) BID9 , the cloze question is obtained by removing a word in the last sentence of every consecutive 21 sentences, with the first 20 sentences being the context. Different from the CNN/Daily Mail datasets, CBT also provides each question with a candidate answer set, consisting of randomly sampled words with the same part-of-speech tag from the context as that of the ground truth.Thanks to the automatic generation process, these datasets can be very large in size, leading to significant research progress. However, compared to how humans would create cloze questions, the automatic generation process bears some inevitable issues. Firstly, the blanks are chosen uniformly without considering which aspect of the language phenomenon the question will test. Hence, quite a portion of automatically generated questions can be purposeless or even trivial to answer. Another issue involves the ambiguity of the answer. Given a context and a blanked sentence, there can be multiple words that fit almost equally well into the blank. A possible solution is to include a candidate option set, as done by CBT, to get rid of the ambiguity. However, automatically generating the candidate option set can be problematic since it cannot guarantee the ambiguity is removed. More importantly, automatically generated candidates can be totally irrelevant or simply grammatically unsuitable for the blank, resulting in again trivial questions. Probably due to these unsatisfactory issues, it has been shown neural models have achieved comparable performance with human within very short time BID3 BID6 BID23 . While there has been work trying to incorporate human design into cloze question generation BID30 , the MSR Sentence Completion Challenge created by this effort is quite small in size, limiting the possibility of developing powerful neural models on it.Motivated by the aforementioned drawbacks, we propose CLOTH, a large-scale cloze test dataset collected from English exams. Questions in the dataset are designed by middle-school and highschool teachers to prepare Chinese students for entrance exams. To design a cloze test, teachers firstly determine the words that can test students' knowledge of vocabulary, reasoning or grammar; then replace those words with blanks and provide three candidate options for each blank. If a question does not specifically test grammar usage, all of the candidate options would complete the sentence with correct grammar, leading to highly confusing questions. As a result, human-designed questions are usually harder and are a better assessment of language proficiency. Note that, different from the reading comprehension task, a general cloze test does not focus on testing reasoning abilities but evaluates several aspects of language proficiency including vocabulary, reasoning and grammar.To verify if human-designed cloze questions are difficult for current models, we train dedicated models as well as the state-of-the-art language model and evaluate their performance on this dataset. We find that the state-of-the-art model lags behind human performance even if the model is trained on a large external corpus. We analyze where the model fails compared to human. After conducting error analysis, we assume the performance gap results from the model's inability to use long-term context. To verify this assumption, we evaluate humans' performance when they are only allowed to see one sentence as the context. Our assumption is confirmed by the matched performances of the model and human when given only one sentence. In addition, we demonstrate that human-designed data is more informative and more difficult than automatically generated data. Specifically, when the same amount of training data is given, human-designed training data leads to better performance. Additionally, it is much easier for the same model to perform well on automatically generated data. In this paper, we propose a large-scale cloze test dataset CLOTH that is designed by teachers. With the missing blanks and candidate options carefully created by teachers to test different aspects of language phenomenon, CLOTH requires a deep language understanding and better captures the complexity of human language. We find that human outperforms state-of-the-art models by a significant margin, even if the model is trained on a large corpus. After detailed analysis, we find that the performance gap is due to model's inability to understanding a long context. We also show that, compared to automatically-generated questions, human-designed questions are more difficult and leads to a larger margin between human performance and the model's performance."
