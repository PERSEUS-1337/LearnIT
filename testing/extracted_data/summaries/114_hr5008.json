Treasury must promulgate rules and issue guidance to reclassify individuals who are not currently being treated as employees consistent with the proper classification of employees under common law standards within the construction industry. In implementing this bill, Treasury must: (1) reassign personnel and resources from other activities to carry out this bill, and (2) report to Congress on the implementation and recommendations for further congressional action. The Government Accountability Office must study the various forms of tax fraud in the construction industry, efforts to combat fraud, and recommendations for further action."
