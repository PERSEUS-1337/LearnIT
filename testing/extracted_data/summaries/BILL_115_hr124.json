Additionally, it establishes a task force in the Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide recommendations on community policing, including best practices for accountability and transparency. DOJ must study the cost to purchase and use body-worn cameras. Finally, the Government Accountability Office must study and report on the Department of Defense Excess Personal Property Program."
