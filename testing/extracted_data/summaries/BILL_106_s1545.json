    "content": "Neighborhood Children's Internet Protection Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require libraries and elementary and secondary schools receiving universal service assistance to certify that they have installed systems or implemented policies for blocking or filtering Internet access to matter inappropriate for minors. Requires the school board, library, or other responsible non-Federal authority to determine what matter is inappropriate for minors. Directs the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to initiate a notice and comment proceeding for: (1) evaluating whether or not currently available commercial Internet blocking and filtering software adequately addresses the needs of educational institutions. (2) recommending how to foster the development of products which meet such needs. And (3) evaluating the development and effectiveness of local Internet use policies that are currently in operation after community input."
