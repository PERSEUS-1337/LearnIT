    "content": "A concept that is fundamental to understanding the economy is that there is an equilibrium,market-clearing rate of unemployment determined by labor market characteristics, policy, andconditions. This rate of unemployment is referred to as the \"natural rate\" or \"full employment rate\"of unemployment or the NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment). Althoughexpansionary fiscal or monetary policy might be able to temporarily push unemployment below thenatural rate in exchange for higher inflation, eventually actual unemployment would rise back to thenatural rate without inflation falling. This concept is consistent with the view that monetary policyhas no long-run effect on real variables such as economic growth or unemployment, and affects onlyprices in the long run. If unemployment did not return to a natural rate, it would imply that monetarypolicy could permanently affect unemployment. There are periods of U.S. history when a constant natural rate concept cannot explain thebehavior of unemployment and inflation. For example, in the 1970s, inflation rose althoughunemployment was above estimates of the natural rate, and in the 1990s, inflation fell althoughunemployment was below estimates of the natural rate. A more sophisticated theory is needed toexplain these periods. Since the natural rate is determined by the characteristics of the labor market,it is possible that changes in the labor market lead to changes in the natural rate over time. Forexample, an aging workforce, unexpectedly rapid productivity growth, policy changes, and a growingtemporary workforce are some of the factors that could have led to a decline in the natural rate in the1990s. In this view, at any given moment, there is some natural rate of unemployment, below(above) which inflation will rise (fall), but that rate may be different from the natural rate in the pastor future because of labor market changes. It is estimated that the natural rate rose during the 1970sand 1980s, and fell back to earlier levels in the 1990s. Although there is no theoretical drawback to the concept of a changing natural rate,economists have been unsuccessful in empirically predicting when changes would take place. Thisleaves the theory open to the criticism that, rather than offering a meaningful explanation of theempirical record, it does little more than offer post hoc rationalization for contradictory results. Anynatural rate estimate must be accompanied by a wide range of uncertainty -- some research suggestsa natural rate of 5.9%, with a 95% confidence interval of 3.9% to 7.6%. Yet alternative theories tothe natural rate have done a little better at explaining or predicting economic outcomes. Theunpredictability of a changing natural rate suggests that excessive weight should not be placed onthe gap between actual unemployment and natural rate estimates in fiscal and monetary policydecisions. The natural rate is probably most useful to policymakers as one of many economicindicators that can predict changes in inflation or the business cycle. Although changes in the naturalrate have not been successfully predicted, it would be difficult to make systematic policy decisionswithout some notion of full employment."
