    "title": "To amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to limit assistance to the Palestinian Authority.",
    "content": "Palestinian Peace Promotion and Ant-Incitement Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that the Palestinian Authority (PA) has not lived up to its agreements with Israel to end incitement and should do more to prepare the Palestinian people for peace with Israel. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prohibit assistance to the PA. Waives such prohibition if the President certifies to Congress that the waiver is important to US national security interests. Directs the Secretary of State, upon the exercise of such waiver and prior to the obligation of funds, to certify to Congress that the PA: (1) has established a single treasury account for all PA financing and all financing mechanisms flow through this account, no parallel financing mechanisms exist, and there is a single comprehensive civil service roster and payroll. And (2) no longer engages in a pattern of incitement against the United States or Israel and is engaged in peace preparation activities aimed at promoting peace with Israel."
