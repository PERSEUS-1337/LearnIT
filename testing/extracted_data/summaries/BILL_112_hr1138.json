Permits grantees to use the funds to reimburse school social workers for expenses they incur in rendering services. Requires grant-funded social workers to target their services to the highest-need students. Directs the Secretary to provide technical assistance to high-need LEAs in applying for such grants. Prohibits the grant funds from being used to supplant other federal, state, or local funds used for hiring and retaining school social workers."
