    "content": "Proposals to limit the federal government's authority to raise taxes have been made several times in recent years. Most frequently, these proposals call for limits on Congress's ability to passrevenuemeasures. Typically, limitation proposals would allow increases in tax revenues only under one of twocircumstances. First, tax revenues could increase under existing tax laws as a result of economic upturns. Alternatively, they couldincreasebecause of a new law, but only if it were passed by a super-majority (typically two-thirds or three-fifths). Questionsabouthow such proposals might be applied in practice have not been clearly answered. Congress has previouslyconsidered suchproposals in 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001. In each case the proposal has failed to achieve the two-thirdsmajority necessary for passage. Most recently, the House considered H.J.Res. 96 on June 12, 2002. The measure failed to achieve thenecessary two-thirds, 227-178. This report will be updated to reflect any further legislative actions on suchproposals."
