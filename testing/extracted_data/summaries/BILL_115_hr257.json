    "content": "Recognition of Jerusalem as the Capital of the State of Israel Act This bill states that it is US policy to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel. The bill expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the United States should recognize the sovereign status of an undivided Jerusalem as Israel's capital, (2) recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and transferring the US Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv will signal US commitment to Israel, (3) the President and the Department of State should affirm as a matter of US policy that Jerusalem must remain Israel's undivided capital, (4) the President should implement the provisions of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 and begin the process of relocating the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and (5) US officials should refrain from actions that contradict US law on this subject. The bill states that any official US government document that lists countries and their capital cities should identify Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The President shall relocate the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem by January 1, 2019. The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 is amended to eliminate the President's authority, effective January, 1, 2018, to waive certain funding limitations for State Department acquisition and maintenance of buildings abroad until the US Embassy in Jerusalem has officially opened."
