    "title": "An act to amend Sections 124977 and 125001 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to public health, and making an appropriation therefor.",
    "content": "Existing law requires the State Department of Public Health to establish a program for the development, provision, and evaluation of genetic disease testing. Existing law establishes the continuously appropriated Genetic Disease Testing Fund (GDTF), consisting of fees paid for newborn screening tests, and states the intent of the Legislature that all costs of the genetic disease testing program be fully supported by fees paid for newborn screening tests, which are deposited in the GDTF. Existing law also authorizes moneys in the GDTF to be used for the expansion of the Genetic Disease Branch Screening Information System to include cystic fibrosis, biotinidase, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and exempts the expansion of contracts for this purpose from certain provisions of the Public Contract Code, the Government Code, and the State Administrative Manual, as specified. This bill would require the department to expand statewide screening of newborns to include screening for any disease that is detectable in blood samples as soon as practicable, but no later than 2 years after the disease is adopted by the federal Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP), or enrollment of this bill, whichever is later. By expanding the purposes for which moneys from the GDTF may be expended, this bill would make an appropriation."
