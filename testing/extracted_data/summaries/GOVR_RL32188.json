    "content": "There has been increased interest in monitoring foreign students while maintaining the longtradition of permitting international scholars to study in the United States. There are three mainavenues for students from other countries to temporarily come to the United States to study, and eachinvolves admission as a nonimmigrant. The three visa categories used by foreign students are: Fvisas for academic study; M visas for vocational study; and J visas for cultural exchange. Recently,the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implemented an electronic foreign student monitoringsystem. When Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act(IIRIRA) of 1996, it added statutory language mandating that the Attorney General, in consultationwith the Secretaries of State and Education, develop by January 1, 1998, a program to collect dataon foreign students from at least five countries, and mandated that by 2003, the data collectioninclude all countries. IIRIRA required the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) tocollect the information electronically \"where practical.\" The USA Patriot Act of 2001 includedprovisions to expand the foreign student tracking system and authorized appropriations for thesystem, which was supposed to be funded through fees, paid by the students. The Enhanced BorderSecurity and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 increased monitoring of foreign students and closedperceived loopholes. The foreign student monitoring system created by the former INS, and mandated in IIRIRA,is referred to as the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). SEVIS, whichautomated an existing manual data collection process, became operational for all incoming studentson February 15, 2003, the deadline for all institutions which had previously been approved to admitforeign students to apply for SEVIS certification and enter all new students into the SEVIS system. The educational institutions were given until August 1, 2003 to enter all continuing students into thesystem, and to have their SEVIS certification completed. Currently, there are 599,617 activestudents in SEVIS. There have been few stories in the press of foreign students having problems entering theUnited States as a result of the implementation of SEVIS. Nonetheless, schools have reportedtechnical difficulties operating SEVIS, and reported discrepancies between information receivedfrom different bureaus in DHS regarding SEVIS operations and requirements. Additionally, somehave noted delays in student visa processing. Prior to the implementation of SEVIS it was difficultto know when foreign students overstayed their visas. Through SEVIS, DHS should be able toidentify students who have violated the terms of their visas; however, some question whether DHShas the staff to locate all student visa violators, and whether it is a beneficial use of DHS resourcesto do so. Others are concerned that clerical errors will lead to unwarranted enforcement actions. This report will be updated as needed."
