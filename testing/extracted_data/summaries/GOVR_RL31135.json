    "content": "The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA), as amended, establishes a process for the federal government to designate a site for a permanent repository forcivilian nuclear waste. In February 2002, this process culminated in a presidential recommendation for a repositoryat Yucca Mountain, Nevada. On April 8, theState of Nevada exercised its authority under NWPA to disapprove the site. As a result of this state disapproval,the site may be approved only if a joint resolutionof repository siting approval becomes law after being passed by Congress during the first period of 90 days ofcontinuous session after the disapproval. Thisperiod appears likely to terminate just after the August recess. The Act establishes an expedited procedure for congressional consideration of this approval resolution. Pursuant to this expedited procedure, approval resolutionswere introduced in both houses and referred to the respective committees of jurisdiction, which had until the60th day of continuous session after the statedisapproval to report or be discharged. The House committee reported on May 1, and the Senate committee on June10. In the House, once an approval resolution has been on the calendar for 5 legislative days, a supporter may call it up if the Speaker recognizes him or her for thepurpose. After 2 hours of debate, the House then votes on the resolution without amendment or other interveningmotion. The House passed its resolution onMay 8. In the Senate, once such a resolution is on the calendar, any Senator may make a nondebatable motion toproceed to consider it. Normally, such a motionwould be offered by the majority leader. If rejected, the motion may be repeated. If adopted, the Senate debatesthe resolution for 10 hours (which may bereduced by nondebatable motion), after which a final vote occurs. The statutory procedure forestalls filibustersagainst the resolution by prohibiting mostintervening motions or other actions, but does not on its face preclude amendment of the resolution. An attemptto consider the measure in the Senate wasexpected in early July. After one house passes an approval resolution, the other takes up and debates its own measure, but takes a final vote on the measure received from the first house. This procedure facilitates clearing the resolution for presidential action. The Act provides for this action to occuronly if the two measures are identical, as thepresent House and Senate measures are. If the Senate resolution were to be amended, however, the terms of the Actwould apparently make this clearanceprocedure unavailable. An amended measure also would cease to have the form prescribed by the NWPA for anapproval resolution, and accordingly might fail toqualify for further action under the expedited procedure. Either house might overcome such difficulties by using its constitutional power over its own rules to alter the procedure by which it considered an approvalresolution. If an approval resolution were enacted in a different form from that prescribed by the NWPA, however,it might arguably fail to meet the requirementsof the Act for permitting construction of the repository."
