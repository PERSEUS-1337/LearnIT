    "content": "In the coming weeks and months the 114th Congress will debate a number of funding, governance, and constitutional issues affecting the District of Columbia, including budget and legislative autonomy, voting representation in the national legislature, federal appropriations, and congressionally supported education initiatives. In addition, Congress may consider measures intended to void or otherwise modify acts and initiatives approved by District citizens and their elected representatives. The mechanisms available to Congress in carrying out its oversight of District affairs include resolutions of disapproval, riders on appropriation acts, and stand-alone legislative proposals. The United States Constitution gives Congress exclusive authority over the legislative affairs of the District of Columbia. Congress has exercised its constitutional authority in a number of ways over the years, including granting District residents some level of self-rule. In 1973, Congress passed the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act (Home Rule Act), granting the city's residents limited home rule. The act allowed for the popular election of a mayor and city council and authorized them to legislate and manage the city's affairs. It also established a budget and legislative review process allowing Congress to disapprove the implementation of any legislative measure passed by the city's elected leaders, including the city's annual budget. The 114th Congress, as part of its oversight and legislative responsibilities, will consider a number of issues and legislative measures related to the District of Columbia. This report provides an overview of several District of Columbia-related issues and legislative proposals that Congress may review and act upon, including the following: granting the District legislative and budget autonomy; granting citizens of the District voting representation in Congress; marijuana decriminalization; gun regulation and Second Amendment issues; religious conscience clauses and reproductive health issues; and nondiscrimination exemptions for religious affiliated institutions and organizations. In addition, for each of the items above the report identifies current legislative proposals, if any, and pertinent policy questions related to each issue. This report will be updated as events warrant."
