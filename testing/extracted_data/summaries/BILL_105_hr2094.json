Directs the Administrator to conduct studies for use in developing: (1) a more complete list of potential health risks. And (2) better indicators and more expeditious methods for detecting or predicting the presence of pathogens in coastal recreational waters. Requires the Administrator to issue revised water quality criteria for pathogens in such waters that are harmful to human health.

Requires notification of local governments and the public of exceedances, or the likelihood of exceedances, of water quality criteria for such waters. Directs the Administrator to: (1) issue guidance on uniform assessment and monitoring procedures for floatable materials in such waters. And (2) specify the conditions under which the presence of floatable material constitutes a threat to public health and safety. Requires the Administrator to issue guidance establishing core performance measures for testing, monitoring, and posting programs and for the delegation of such programs to local government authorities. Makes State resources available to such authorities if the programs are so delegated. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to States to fulfill requirements under this Act.
