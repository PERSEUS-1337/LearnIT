    "content": "Hundreds of thousands of trucks and railroad tank cars transport tons of hazardous materials(hazmat) daily. There is virtually an unlimited number of ways that these shipments are at risk fromattack by terrorists. By implementing a \"layered\" system of measures affecting shippers, carriers,and drivers, many in the public and private sectors seek to reduce associated security risks. Thissystem involves incident prevention, preparedness, and response. A major challenge is to increasecost effectively the security of these shipments, especially those that pose the most danger to thepublic, while still meeting, to the extent possible, the transportation requirements of commerce. The109th Congress is considering legislation, such as H.R. 3 , H.R. 153 , H.R. 909 , H.R. 1109 , and H.R. 1414 , and S. 230 ,which includes provisions intended to promote hazmat transportation security. The Departments of Transportation (DOT) and Homeland Security (DHS) have takennumerous actions to enhance the security of hazmat transportation. For example, DOT requiresshippers and carriers to implement security plans regarding specified hazmat transportation. DOTgrants encourage states to conduct inspections of trucks transporting hazmat. Also, DOT hascontacted thousands of companies seeking to improve their security programs, and also hasestablished communication links with industry. DHS conveys threat information to law enforcementand industry, and conducts vulnerability assessments. DHS administers a grant that provides trainingand the communications infrastructure which facilitates truck drivers and others to report safety andpotential security concerns. DHS seeks to determine whether commercial drivers pose a securitythreat necessitating denial of their hazmat endorsement on their commercial drivers licenses. Despite these efforts, there remain many vulnerabilities in the current layered system of hazmattransportation security measures. At a cost, much more could be done to expand the scope,strengthen the rigor, and accelerate the pace of the federal role in this area. H.R. 153 and H.R. 1109 include a provision that would require theDHS to prepare a vulnerability assessment of freight rail transportation and to identify security risksthat are specific to the transportation of hazmats by rail. H.R. 153 would provide grantsto address threats pertaining to the security of hazmat transportation by rail. H.R. 909 would establish a research program intended to advance security measures for hazmat transportation. H.R. 3 , which the House has passed, includes a provision intended to ensure thatMexican- and Canadian-domiciled truck drivers transporting specified hazmat loads in the UnitedStates are subject to a background check similar to that required of U.S. drivers. Other optionsinclude increased security awareness training for state truck inspectors and certain employees oftruck leasing companies, and requiring enhanced security plans and communication systems forcarriers of high hazard materials shipments beyond those now required. Each of these options posescosts that need to be evaluated within the context of other investments. This report deals only withhazmat security in surface transportation and will not be updated."
