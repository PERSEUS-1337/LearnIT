    "content": "Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002 - Amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to direct the Secretary of Commerce to assign to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) responsibility for providing for the establishment, and overseeing operation, of a second-level Internet domain within the US country code domain that provides access only to materials suitable for, and not harmful to, minors. Directs NTIA to require the same registry selected to operate and maintain the US country code Internet domain to establish, operate, and maintain such second-level domain. Prohibits NTIA from renewing any contract to operate and maintain the domain with the initial registry, or to enter into or renew a contract with a successor registry, unless such registry enters into an agreement with NTIA which requires the registry to carry out, and the new domain to operate under, specified requirements. Requires NTIA to publicize the availability of the new domain and to educate parents of minors regarding the process for utilizing such domain in coordination with filtering or blocking technologies. Allows a registry, upon a showing of extreme financial hardship, to relinquish the right to operate and maintain the new domain and requires NTIA to then select, under a competitive bidding process, a contractor to operate and maintain such domain. Prohibits the registry from relinquishing such right before the end of the three-year period following the enactment of this Act. Authorizes NTIA to suspend from new domain operation a registry found not to be serving its intended purpose."
