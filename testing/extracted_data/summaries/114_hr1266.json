The FPSC shall be composed of five members serving staggered five-year terms who are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Not more than three members shall be of any one political party. The President must appoint a chair of the FPSC from among its members. The bill prohibits the chair from submitting requests for estimates related to appropriations without prior commission approval."
