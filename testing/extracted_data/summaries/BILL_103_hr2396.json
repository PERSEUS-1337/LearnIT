Prohibits such an agency from disclosing such a record for any other purpose and provides for civil damages for unauthorized disclosures. Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to permit credit reporting agencies to grant access to certain consumer reports to a State child support enforcement agency that is seeking to establish, modify, or enforce a child support obligation against the consumer. Amends part D of title IV of the Social Security Act to: (1) require State laws to provide for the use of procedures requiring child support orders to provide for coverage of the health care costs of the child in accordance with State guidelines. (2) include under the incentive payments program any dependent medical insurance coverage which is provided due to the successful application of such procedures. (3) direct HHS' Office of Child Support Enforcement to report to the Congress annually on State compliance with specified standards establishing time limits for State response to certain child support assistance requests. (4) require States to assess a penalty against any employer who fails to make timely payment of withheld wages to pay child support obligations of an employee. And (5) direct the Office to develop a national parent locator network which would build on comprehensive statewide child support enforcement systems to allow States to carry out specified parent locator activities. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to study and report to specified congressional committees on how the successful efforts of States in enforcing obligations of absent parents to pay the health and dental expenses of their children should be rewarded through an incentive payments program."
