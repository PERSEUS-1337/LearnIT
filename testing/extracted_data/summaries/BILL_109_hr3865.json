Allows such corporations to operate and function without hindrance or impedance in all states. Prohibits any medical malpractice liability action from being brought against a health care professional or provider without an affidavit from a qualified specialist or medical expert that there is a reasonable and meritorious cause for filing the action. Requires the Secretary to establish medical malpractice arbitration panels to hear and render decisions on all medical malpractice claims. Mandates participation in such panels. Allows participants dissatisfied with the results to bring a federal civil action.
