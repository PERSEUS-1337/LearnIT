    "content": "In combination, patents and marketing exclusivities provide the fundamental framework ofintellectual property incentives for pharmaceutical innovation in the United States. Patents, whichare administered by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), provide their ownerwith the ability to exclude others from practicing the claimed invention for a limited time. Incontrast, marketing exclusivities are administered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Alternatively known as \"data exclusivity\" or \"data protection,\" a marketing exclusivity preventsgeneric competitors from referencing the preclinical and clinical test data that manufacturers ofbrand-name pharmaceuticals generated in order to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of theirproducts. The FDA currently awards qualifying innovators with marketing exclusivities for thedevelopment of new chemical entities or orphan drugs, as well as for the performance of new clinicalstudies and pediatric studies. Although patents and marketing exclusivities are separate entitlements that are administeredby different federal administrative agencies and that depend upon distinct criteria, they both createproprietary rights in pharmaceutical innovation. These rights in turn allow innovators to receive areturn on the expenditure of resources leading to the discovery. Once these rights expire, themarketplace for that drug is open to generic competition. Several innovation policy issues have arisen concerning the relationship of patents andmarketing exclusivities. Some observers believe that marketing exclusivities are unnecessarybecause patents are generally available for pharmaceutical innovation. On the other hand, someobservers believe that the terms of the marketing exclusivities established by U.S. law are too short. In particular, they note that comparable European standards are often considerably longer than theirU.S. counterparts. International agreements require each World Trade Organization (WTO) member state totreat all patented inventions in the same manner. As a result, marketing exclusivities provideCongress with a more flexible option for stimulating specific sorts of desirable private activity thando patents. Indeed, the 109th Congress is currently considering expanding upon existing marketingexclusivities in order to encourage the development of bioterrorism countermeasures. WTOAgreements, as well as recent Free Trade Agreements to which the United States is a signatory, alsooblige nations to provide some manner of protection to pharmaceutical test data. Although general patent reform legislation has been the subject of significant discussionduring the 109th Congress, current legislative proposals do not appear particularly to impact therelationship between patents and marketing exclusivities. Some maintain that continued attentionto the impact of broadly oriented patent reforms upon the pharmaceutical industry is appropriate."
