    "content": "Since 2005, the Energy and Water Development (E&W) appropriations bill has funded all Department of Energy (DOE) programs, including those operated by the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). That office conducts two types of programs: research and development (R&D), usually conducted in partnership with private sector firms, and grant funds that are distributed to state governments. EERE administers a wide range of R&D programs, each with its own set of goals and objectives. President Obama has declared energy efficiency and renewable energy to be a high priority, stressing their importance to jobs, economic growth, and U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. Also, efficiency and renewables are a focus of the President's Climate Action Plan and both are key strategies for the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan regulation. DOE's FY2016 request for EERE sought $2.723 billion, an increase of $809 million (42%). Nearly half of the proposed EERE increase would have gone to two R&D programs: manufacturing ($204 million) and vehicle technologies ($164 million). For manufacturing, most of the increase ($140 million) would have supported two new Clean Energy Manufacturing Institutes\u2014part of the President's National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI). For vehicles, the increase would have mainly supported the Electric Vehicle (EV) Everywhere Grand Challenge\u2014with funds spread over several subprograms. The next largest requested increases would have gone to two more R&D programs: solar ($104 million) and building technologies ($92 million). Most of the remaining increase would have gone to three other R&D programs: geothermal ($41 million), wind ($39 million), and bioenergy ($21 million). Also, $75 million would have gone to increases for three grant programs: weatherization ($35 million), state energy ($20 million), and local energy ($20 million). At several House and Senate appropriations and oversight hearings, testimony and Member questions revealed differing views about the requested funding amount and the role of market barriers and national interests in EERE program design and funding. For the EERE portion of the FY2016 E&W bill (H.R. 2028), the House approved $1.652 billion (includes a $17 million rescission of prior year funds and $11 million added by non-program-specific floor amendments) and the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $1.933 billion (includes a $17 million rescission). However, the Administration issued a veto threat, in part because it found that H.R. 2028 would \"underfund critical activities\" at EERE. Ultimately, E&W appropriations appeared as Division D of the Consolidated Appropriations Bill (H.R. 2029). The bill was enacted as P.L. 114-113. The law provided $2.069 billion for EERE, which was $654 million below the request, but $145 million above the FY2015 level. Specific program increases included Vehicles ($30 million), Manufacturing ($29 million), Buildings ($29 million), Weatherization Grants ($22 million), Geothermal ($16 million), Water ($9 million), and Solar ($9 million). The Wind program was cut by nearly $12 million."
