    "content": "The Navy's proposed FY2012 budget requests about $2.4 billion for the procurement of 28 F/A-18E/F Super Hornet strike fighters and about $1.1 billion for the procurement of 12 EA-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft. The F-18s will be procured under a multiyear procurement contract approved by Congress in FY2011. FY2012 defense authorization bill: The House Armed Services Committee funded the F-18 program at the requested level. The Senate Armed Services Committee cut $495 million and nine aircraft from the request for F/A-18E/Fs, citing Navy projections that the fighter shortfall would be less than earlier anticipated. FY2012 DOD appropriations bill: The House and Senate Appropriations Committees both approved the requested number of aircraft, but reduced the funds available to the program. The HAC cut $77.8 million from the EA-18G request and $63.5 million from the F/A-18E/F request. The SAC cut $7 million from the EA-18G request, $99.7 million from the F/A-18E/F request, and a further $54 million from the overall program."
