    "content": "The expanded summary of the House passed version is repeated here.) This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)nbsp, to authorizenbsp, the emergency use of an otherwise unapprovednbsp, medical product if the Department of Defense (DOD)nbsp. Determines that there is a military emergency involving an agent that may cause imminently life-threatening and specific risk to US forces. If a military emergency is determined to exist, the bill allows DOD to request that the FDAnbsp, expedite certain procedures for approving medicalnbsp. Products that would be reasonably likely to diagnose, prevent, treat, or mitigate such risk. nbsp, The FDAnbsp, must take specifiednbsp. Actions to facilitate such a request by DOD. The bill repeals provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 that allow DOD, rather than the FDA,nbsp. To authorize the emergency use of an unapproved product under similar circumstances. Unless DOD determinesnbsp, such meetings to be unnecessary, the FDA shall meet withnbsp, DOD:nbsp. (1) semi-annually to conduct a full review of relevant medical products in the DOD portfolio. And (2) quarterly to discuss the development status of regenerative medicine advanced therapy, blood, and vaccine medical products and projects that DOD prioritizes."
