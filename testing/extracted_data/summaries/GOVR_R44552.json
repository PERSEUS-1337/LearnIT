    "content": "New Zealand is a close partner of the United States and welcomes a U.S. presence in the Asia-Pacific region. New Zealand and the United States engage each other across a broad spectrum of policy areas, including Islamist extremism, South Pacific regional issues, intelligence cooperation, and Antarctica. Issues for Congress related to New Zealand include oversight and appropriations related to international security cooperation, counterterrorism (CT) and countering violent extremism (CVE), and intelligence cooperation among the so-called \"Five Eyes\" nations, which include New Zealand. U.S.- New Zealand ties are bolstered by shared cultural traditions and values as well as common interests. New Zealand is a stable and active democracy that has supported liberalizing trade in the Asia-Pacific region. It is one of the 11 nations in the proposed Trans-Pacific Partership (TPP) trade grouping, from which President Trump withdrew in January 2017. New Zealand also has a history of fighting alongside the United States in major conflicts including World War I, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. New Zealand is a regular contributor to international peace and stability operations and has contributed troops to fight Islamist militants in Afghanistan, where New Zealand had a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Bamiyan Province until 2013, and more recently in Iraq where it is training Iraqi military personnel. New Zealand's foreign policy largely supports a rules-based international order, collective approaches to promote stability, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. During the mid-1980s, the United States suspended its alliance commitments to New Zealand due to differences over nuclear policy. New Zealand legislation made the country nuclear-free, which had the effect of barring visits from nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed ships. The United States had, and still has, a policy of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons on U.S. Navy ships. These differences over nuclear policy significantly constrained the relationship for many years. In November 2016, a U.S. naval ship visited New Zealand for the first time since 1983. This marked for many observers the return to a normalization of bilateral relations. The bilateral relationship between the United States and New Zealand was strengthened significantly through the signing of the Wellington Declaration in November 2010. The Wellington Declaration, and a subsequent Washington Declaration (2012), opened the way for increased military exchanges and joint participation in military exercises. With the Wellington Declaration, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former New Zealand Prime Minister John Key signaled that differences over nuclear policy had been set aside. New Zealand is now a participant in the U.S.-hosted Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) naval exercise. RIMPAC, the world's largest maritime military exercise, seeks to promote interoperability among participating militaries. New Zealand favors an open and inclusive strategic and economic architecture in the Asia-Pacific. New Zealand has shown a commitment to humanitarian assistance and conflict resolution both in the South Pacific and beyond. In the South Pacific region, it provides foreign assistance and disaster relief and is widely credited with promoting regional stability. New Zealand participates in the annual Pacific Partnership maritime operation, which seeks to improve humanitarian assistance and disaster relief preparedness in the region. New Zealand's commitment to promoting regional security is demonstrated by its past role in helping to resolve conflict in places such as Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste, and the Solomon Islands. New Zealand has also contributed to peace operations in places such as Bosnia, Sierra Leone, and Kosovo outside its region. The National Party and the Labour Party have traditionally been the two leading political parties in New Zealand. New Zealand has a Mixed-Member-Proportional (MMP) electoral parliamentary system. Labour Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern formed a coalition government with the New Zealand First Party with Green Party support following the November 2017 election."
