    "title": "A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permanently extend the estate tax as in effect in 2009, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) establish a permanent estate tax exclusion of $3.5 million and a maximum 45 tax rate for decedents dying, generation-skipping transfers, and gifts made, after December 31, 2009. (2) allow an annual inflation adjustment to the exclusion amount after 2010. And (3) allow a surviving spouse an increase in the estate tax exclusion by the unused exclusion amount of a deceased spouse. Expresses the sense of the Senate that any reduction in federal revenues resulting from this Act should be fully offset."
