    "content": "Anti-Corruption Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prescribe criminal penalties to be imposed against anyone who uses any facility of, or affects, interstate or foreign commerce to deprive or defraud the inhabitants of a State or political subdivision (State) of the honest services of a government official or employee, or of a fair and impartially conducted election process. Prescribes criminal penalties to be imposed upon any official, or person selected to be a public official, who, in order to carry out or conceal any scheme or artifice to defraud, discriminates, harasses, or takes adverse action against any employee or official of the United States or of any State. Authorizes such an adversely affected employee or official to obtain relief through a civil action, provided such person did not participate in the scheme or artifice. Specifies that: (1) to obtain recovery against a State, the employee or individual bringing the action shall establish by a preponderance of evidence that any such violation was the result of widespread violations, or conduct authorized by a senior official, within the State. And (2) in cases in which a State is sued and found liable for recovery, the State may bring an action for contribution for such recovery from any employee or official whose action led to the recovery. Amends mail fraud provisions to prohibit using, or causing the use, of any facility of interstate or foreign commerce in the execution of a scheme or artifice to defraud. Sets forth prohibitions regarding narcotics-related public corruption."
