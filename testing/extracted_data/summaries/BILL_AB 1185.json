    "title": "AB 1185",
    "content": "The Local Agency Public Construction Act requires the governing board of any school district to let any contract for a public project, as defined, involving an expenditure of $15,000 or more, to the lowest responsible bidder that gives security as the board requires, or else reject all bids. This bill would establish a pilot program to authorize the Los Angeles Unified School District to use, before December 31, 2020, a best value procurement method for bid evaluation and selection for public projects that exceed $1,000,000. The bill would establish various requirements applicable to the use of the best value procurement method under this authorization. The bill would require the school district to submit an interim and final report to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature on the use of the best value procurement method pursuant to the bill, in accordance with a specified schedule. These provisions would be repealed on January 1, 2021. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Los Angeles Unified School District."
