    "content": "Congress is again considering whether to permit drilling for oil and gas in the coastal plainof the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), Alaska, to designate the area as wilderness, or toretain the status quo of maintaining the area as a Refuge without drilling. This area is rich in wildlifeand wilderness values, but may also contain significant oil and gas deposits. H.R. 567 and S. 261 have been introduced in the 109th Congress to designate the coastal plain ofANWR a wilderness, but H.R. 6 has passed the House. Title XXII of the bill wouldauthorize oil and gas leasing in ANWR. Both the House and Senate have approved H.Con.Res. 95 , a budget resolution that may necessitate revenues from oil and gasdevelopment in the Refuge to meet the budget reconciliation targets, and allow enactment of suchlegislation without filibuster. This report provides background on the legal issues surroundingANWR development proposals, and will be updated as circumstances warrant. For an updatedsummary of current actions on bills, see CRS Issue Brief IB10136, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge(ANWR): Controversies for the 109th Congress . H.R. 6 would authorize leasing in ANWR and contains a 2,000 acre limitationon the \"footprint\" of leasing development in the Coastal Plain. However, if the current statutoryprohibition against production of oil and gas anywhere in the Refuge is repealed, then oil and gasdevelopment and related activities could occur not only on the federal lands, but also on Native landswithin the Refuge. Absent express language on the point, an acreage limitation would not apply tosome, and possibly not to any, of the Native lands, in which case some or all of the more than100,000 acres of such lands in the Refuge (inside and outside the officially designated Coastal Plain)could be developed. A 1983 Agreement with the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC), aNative Regional Corporation, would govern oil exploration on ASRC subsurface and associatedsurface rights in the Refuge, unless these provisions are superseded by statute or regulations, andsome assert that the environmental terms of the agreement are lenient. ASRC agreed to comply withstatutes and regulations to protect wildlife, habitat, and the environment of the Coastal Plain. It isunclear whether some or all of ASRC's lands are subject to the 2,000 acre limit, and how that acreagemight be allocated among ASRC and federal lessees. H.R. 6 gives primary responsibility for leasing to the Secretary of the Interioracting through the Director of the Bureau of Land Management rather than the Fish And WildlifeService, the agency that implemented the oil exploration program for the Coastal Plain. Theenvironmental standard in H.R. 6 -- \"no significant adverse effect\" -- has been used in the past, butcould allow a range of adverse effects compared to other standards that have also been used. H.R.6 also would limit the NEPA process applicable to leasing in ANWR, and limit and expedite judicialreview. The bill states that leasing is to be under the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA), yet wouldestablish a 50/50 revenue sharing formula different from the 90/10 formula in the MLA, a fact thatmight raise issues related to the Alaska Statehood Act."
