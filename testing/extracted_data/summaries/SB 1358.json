    "title": "An act\nto amend Sections 69433.5 and 69433.6 of the Education Code,\nrelating to\npostsecondary education.\nstudent financial aid.",
    "content": "Existing law, the Cal Grant Program, establishes the Cal Grant A and B Entitlement Awards, the California Community College Transfer Entitlement Awards, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B Awards, the Cal Grant C Awards, and the Cal Grant T Awards under the administration of the Student Aid Commission, and establishes eligibility requirements for awards under these programs for participating students attending qualifying institutions. The program prohibits an applicant from receiving one or a combination of program awards in excess of the amount equivalent to the award level for a total of a 4-year period of full-time attendance in an undergraduate program, except as provided. This bill would increase this generally applicable maximum for total Cal Grant awards to an applicant to the award level for a 6-year period of full-time attendance. Existing law establishes the Student Aid Commission as the primary state agency for the administration of state-authorized student financial aid programs available to students attending segments of postsecondary education. This bill would express the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would make additional student financial aid options available for students attending segments of postsecondary education."
