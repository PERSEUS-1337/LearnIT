    "content": "Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic's long reign came to an end in October 2000, whenhe was deposed from power by a popular revolt after he refused to concede defeat in an election forthe post of President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) won by his opponent, VojislavKostunica. The new government suffered a great blow in March 2003, when Serbian Prime MinisterZoran Djindjic was murdered by organized crime figures linked to the Serbian security apparatus. Organized crime, extremists within the Serbian military and security apparatus, and the linksbetween them continue to pose a threat to Serbia's democratic development. On December 28, 2003, the extreme nationalist Serbian Radical Party won a stunning victoryin early Serbian parliamentary elections, but fell short of a majority. In March 2004, a minoritygovernment of democratic parties formed a government without the Radicals. However, thegovernment depends on the parliamentary support of the Socialists (Milosevic's former party), whoare not in the government but are in a position to extract concessions from it. Democratic forces inSerbia received a boost from Serbian presidential elections in June 2004, which resulted in a victoryfor Boris Tadic, a pro-Western, pro-reform figure over a Radical Party candidate. In a years-long confrontation with Milosevic, Montenegrin leader Milo Djukanovic seizedcontrol of virtually all levers of federal power on the republic's territory. He sought to rapidlyachieve an independent Montenegro, but opposition from the United States, European Union andRussia stymied these efforts. After a largely unsuccessful three-year decentralized union with Serbia,Montenegro voted for independence in a referendum held on May 21, 2006. Montenegro'sindependence has been recognized by Serbia, the United States, the European Union, and othercountries. The United States and other Western countries have sought to encourage Serbia andMontenegro's integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions. However, these efforts have been hamperedby controversy over the future status of Serbia's Kosovo province, Serbia's failure to fully cooperatewith the Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal (in particular its failure to arrest former Bosnian Serb armychief Ratko Mladic), and Serbia's fitful progress in such areas as rule of law and military and securitysector reform. Since Milosevic's downfall, Congress has appropriated significant amounts of aid to Serbiaand Montenegro to promote reforms. In each fiscal year from FY2001 through FY2006, Congressconditioned U.S. aid to Serbia on a certification by the President that a series of conditions had beenmet by Serbia, above all cooperation with the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal. The House has passedsuch a certification provision in its version of the FY2007 foreign aid bill ( H.R. 5522 ).This report will be updated as events warrant."
