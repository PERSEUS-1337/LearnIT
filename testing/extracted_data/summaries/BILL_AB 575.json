    "title": "AB 575",
    "content": "Existing law requires the State Board of Education to adopt instructional materials for kindergarten and grades 1 to 8, inclusive, and to adopt procedures for the submission of instructional materials, and provides that instructional materials may be submitted for adoption in specified subject areas every 8 years. This bill would instead provide that instructional materials may be submitted for adoption at least once but no more than twice every 8 years. The bill, until January 1, 2024, would require the State Department of Education, before conducting a followup adoption, as defined, in a given subject area to post a notice on the department\u2019s Internet Web site and notify all publishers or manufacturers known to produce basic instructional materials in that subject area that each publisher and manufacturer choosing to participate in the followup adoption shall be assessed a fee, as specified."
