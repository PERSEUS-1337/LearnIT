    "content": "Existing law prohibits an operator of a skateboard park from permitting a person to ride a skateboard at the park, unless the person is wearing a helmet, elbow pads, and knee pads. Existing law provides that a skateboard facility owned or operated by a local public agency that is not supervised on a regular basis may satisfy the above requirement if it complies with certain things, including the adoption of an ordinance that requires a person riding a skateboard in the facility to wear a helmet, elbow pads, and knee pads, as provided. Existing law provides that a public entity is not liable to a person who participates in a hazardous recreational activity, and that skateboarding at a facility owned or operated by a public entity as a public skateboard park is a hazardous recreational activity, if certain conditions are met. This bill would apply the above provisions, and others relating to skateboard safety and liability, to other wheeled recreational devices, as defined, until January 1, 2020."
