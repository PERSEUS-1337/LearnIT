    "content": "Medically Underserved Access to Care Act of 2001 - Directs a managed care organization offering a managed care plan to establish and maintain adequate arrangements with a sufficient number, mix, and distribution of health care professionals and providers to assure that covered items and services are available and accessible to each plan enrollee in the organization's service area at a variety of sites within reasonable proximity to the enrollee, and in a manner that accounts for enrollee needs and reasonably assures care continuity. Treats as meeting such requirements any managed care organization serving a medically underserved area that has similar arrangements with health care professionals and providers having a history of serving such areas. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a program in the Office of Minority Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to award competitive grants to enable eligible nongovernmental agencies to develop outreach programs with regard to medically underserved areas. Requires a study to examine the participation of African-American and other minority physicians in managed care organizations and steps that can be taken to increase such participation."
