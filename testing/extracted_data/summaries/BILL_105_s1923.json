Absolves Federal employees of personal liability for civil penalties under water pollution control laws for acts or omissions within the scope of official duties. Makes Federal employees subject to criminal sanctions under Federal or State water pollution control laws, but prohibits applying criminal sanctions to Federal agencies. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of the Army, and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to pursue enforcement actions against Federal agencies under the Act. Requires States, unless a State law or constitution requires otherwise, to use penalties collected from the Federal Government under the Act only for projects to improve or protect the environment or to defray the costs of environmental protection or enforcement. Includes Federal agencies within the definition of person for purposes of the Act."
