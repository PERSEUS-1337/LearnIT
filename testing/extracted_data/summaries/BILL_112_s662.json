And (2) compensating such trustees for the loss of natural resource services from April 20, 2010, to the date the natural resources are fully restored.

Requires special assessments to be: (1) paid by the responsible parties. (2) used by trustees to conduct projects to restore natural resources injured by such spill. And (3) credited toward any other natural resource damages assessed against the responsible parties for such spill.
