Establishes an MTBE research grants program within EPA. Authorizes grants to eligible grantees to pay the Federal cost share of research on: (1) the development of more cost-effective and accurate MTBE groundwater testing methods. (2) the development of more efficient and cost-effective remediation procedures for water sources contaminated with MTBE. Or (3) the potential effects of MTBE on human health.
