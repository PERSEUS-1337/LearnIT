    "title": "A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify the tax treatment of certain contributions made pursuant to veterans' reemployment.",
    "content": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to prescribe rules regarding limitations on employer contributions under defined contribution plans and eligible deferred compensation plans which are required by reason of veterans' reemployment rights. Treats an employer of a veteran entitled to such rights as meeting such reemployment requirements if the employer permits certain additional elective deferrals from the date of reemployment and makes a matching contribution which would have been required during the period of military service."
