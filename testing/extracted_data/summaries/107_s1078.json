    "content": "Brownfields Economic Development Act of 2001 - Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to make grants to eligible public entities and federally recognized Indian tribes for the redevelopment of brownfield sites, independent of notes or obligations guaranteed for the acquisition of property. Defines a brownfield site, with exceptions, as real property the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance or pollutant. Allows inclusions of sites otherwise excluded from consideration: (1) on a site-by-site basis if financial assistance will protect human health and the environment and promote economic development or facilitate the protection of parks, greenways, or other property used for nonprofit purposes, (2) that were contaminated by a controlled substance, (3) that are certain low-risk petroleum-contaminated sites, or (4) that are mine-scarred land."
