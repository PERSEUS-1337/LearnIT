Or (2) any other person who has made reasonable efforts to protect its system, program, or software from computer date failure, has conducted reasonable tests to prevent a computer date failure by July 1, 1999, and has notified its customers and the President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion by August 1, 1999, of efforts to avoid such failure. Makes the antitrust laws inapplicable to conduct engaged in between the enactment date of this Act and December 31, 2001, solely for the purpose of establishing responses designed to mitigate the impact of computer date failure in a computer system, with an exception for conduct that results in a boycott."
