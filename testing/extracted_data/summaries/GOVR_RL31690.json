    "content": "Established in 1950, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) provides legal protection, implements long-term solutions, and coordinates emergency humanitarian relief for refugees and other displaced persons around the world. At the beginning of 2002, the populations of concern to UNHCR totaled 19.8 million people, which included 12 million refugees. Currently, UNHCR faces a series of challenges: the protection of displaced populations that are not technically refugees and thus fall outside the mandate of UNHCR; availability of resources; a worldwide asylum crisis; accusations of misconduct by UNHCR employees; and the security of refugees and U.N. workers. Issues of particular concern to Congress are funding shortages at UNHCR, burdensharing, and avenues for U.S. influence within UNHCR. This report will be updated periodically."
