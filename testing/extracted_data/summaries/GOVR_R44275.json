    "content": "Puerto Rico's financial circumstances, including uncertainty about its ability to service its large public debt, have drawn attention in recent months. As Congress examines Puerto Rico's finances, questions have arisen about how federal health care programs (Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program [CHIP]) and private health insurance requirements apply to Puerto Rico. Is Puerto Rico treated like a state, or is it treated differently? This report provides answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about Puerto Rico's health care system. The FAQs are divided into the following sections: Demographic and Economic Overview Medicare Part A Part B Part C, Medicare Advantage Part D Medicaid CHIP Private Health Insurance The FAQ provides examples, which illustrate that in many circumstances, health programs in Puerto Rico differ from programs in the 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), whereas in other circumstances, Puerto Rico is treated the same as the states. As such, these FAQs should be viewed as a discussion of the complexity of health care financing as it relates to Puerto Rico under current law. This report does not provide a comprehensive overview of how federal health care programs and requirements apply in Puerto Rico. Instead, the report answers questions about health care financing that have arisen in light of Puerto Rico's financial circumstances. This report will be updated as additional relevant questions and answers arise."
