    "content": "Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to prohibit the Export-Import Bank of the United States from guaranteeing, insuring, or extending credit to an entity with respect to the export of any good or service to China unless the Board of Directors of the Bank determines that such entity is adhering to certain environmental and fair employment principles under a corporate code of conduct. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Bank and the Clearinghouse on Corporate Responsibility that is being developed by the Department of Commerce should work together to ensure that businesses are made aware of, and have access to, resources and organizations that can assist them in developing and monitoring global codes of corporate conduct."
