    "content": "Methamphetamine (meth), a drug with limited medical use and high potential for abuse andaddiction, is a subject of widespread concern. Once associated mainly with the West Coast andwhite, male, blue-collar workers, illicit meth is now used by diverse population groups nationwide,with concentrations in the West, Southwest, and Midwest. Meth is supplied primarily by clandestinelabs in California and Mexico. The drug is relatively simple to make from easily obtained recipes,but access to certain ingredients has become more difficult. Meth production in small, toxic labs(STLs) increased initially due to the successful closure of some \"super-labs\" (labs capable of makingmore than 10 pounds of meth in a 24-hour cycle), relative ease of making meth, continuing demandfor the drug, and desire for potential wealth and involvement in a criminal underground socialactivity. Although the greater fraction of meth used and distributed across the nation comes fromsuper-labs, the sheer number of STLs, their geographic diffusion, and their residual impacts haveprompted concern in Congress, state and local governments, law enforcement agencies, and realestate and other groups. Meth labs have many significant and widespread residual impacts. According to the UnitedStates Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), there were 9,092 STLs and related meth sites in2000 and 17,356 in 2003; the number has been declining since. These sites can be found in a widerange of places, such as apartments, motel rooms, abandoned buildings, and packed in car trunks inparks and other locations. Meth makers can use common items such as mason jars, coffee filters,hot plates, over-the-counter medications containing pseudoephedrine or ephedrine (e.g., Sudafed andsome other nonprescription decongestants), acetone, hydrochloric acid, and anhydrous ammonia. Making meth can result in eye and respiratory irritations, chemical burns, explosions and fires, toxicwastes, and contaminated surroundings. Some residual impacts of meth production threaten thehealth and welfare of children removed from meth sites. This report focuses on the residualenvironmental impacts of STLs. Cleaning and remediating a meth site can cost more than $200,000, depending on themagnitude of contamination. State and local governments that incur expenses cleaning a site canapply to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for reimbursement, up to $25,000 perincident. Alternatively, rather than incur costs and apply for a capped reimbursement, state and localgovernments can notify DEA of a site, and DEA will perform and pay for cleaning. In addition,funds have been available from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) toredevelop a former meth production site. No uniform federal guidelines or standards exist governing the process or the endpoint forcleaning or remediating STLs. Across various states, acceptable levels of meth residue, afterremediation, range from 0.05 to 0.1 micrograms of meth per 100 square centimeters of surface. Twelve congressional bills, one enacted into law in March, relate broadly to meth site cleaning orremediation. This report will be updated as warranted."
