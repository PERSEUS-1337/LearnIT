    "title": "An act to amend Section 12022.53 of the Penal Code, relating to sentencing.",
    "content": "Existing law provides for specified enhancements for the use or discharge of a firearm, or discharge of a firearm that causes serious bodily injury or death, in connection with certain offenses, as specified. This bill would also make those enhancements applicable if the weapon used or discharged is a crossbow. By expanding the scope of an enhancement, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
