    "content": "Social Security Administration Services Preservation Act - Amends title VII (Administration) of the Social Security Act to require the Social Security Administration (SSA) to provide advance public notice of a determination to close, consolidate, or recategorize an SSA office. Requires the SSA, when making such determination, to consider: (1) the effect of such change on the community served. (2) the community's need for personal as opposed to mail or telephone service, (3) the effect of such determination on office employees. And (4) SSA'S economic savings attributable to such change. Directs the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner of Social Security to personally approve all preliminary and final determinations to close full-time offices that provide a full range of services. Requires that a public hearing on a preliminary determination to close, consolidate, or recategorize an office be held upon written request at or near the location of the affected office. Directs SSA to issue a final report within 30 days after such hearing or 90 days after public notice of its preliminary determination, whichever is later, to the local press and appropriate Members of Congress specifying its final determination. Provides the public with notice of and access to such final report. Authorizes persons served by an affected office to appeal a final determination to close, consolidate, or recategorize an office after adequate public notice of such determination. Requires SSA to include in its annual budget submission to the Congress a list of its offices and contact stations which were closed or discontinued during the preceding year and those scheduled to be closed or discontinued and the date such action is planned."
