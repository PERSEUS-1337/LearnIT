    "content": "This report describes the FY2011 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Administration requested a net appropriation of $45.0 billion in budget authority for FY2011. This amounts to a $1.1 billion, or a 2.4% increase from the $43.9 billion enacted for FY2010. Total budget authority requested by the Administration for DHS for FY2011 amounts to $52.6 billion as compared to $51.7 billion enacted for FY2010. Net requested appropriations for major agencies within DHS were as follows: Customs and Border Protection (CBP), $9,809 million; Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), $5,524 million; Transportation Security Administration (TSA), $5,729 million; Coast Guard, $9,867 million; Secret Service, $1,570 million; National Protection & Programs Directorate, $2,362 million; Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), $7,294 million; Science and Technology, $1,018 million; and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, $306 million. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported its version of the FY2010 DHS Appropriations bill on July 15, 2010. This report uses Senate-reported S. 3607 and the committee report (S.Rept. 111-222) accompanying S. 3607 as the source for the Senate-reported numbers. The Senate-reported S. 3607 recommends a net appropriation of $45.2 billion for DHS for FY2011. This amounts to a $195 million increase as compared to the Administration's request, and a nearly $1.3 billion increase as compared to the $43.9 billion enacted for FY2010 (not including FY2010 supplemental funding). The House did not mark up its bill in the full Appropriations Committee, and therefore did not make public its official position on funding levels and direction for DHS. Congress did not enact the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2011 before the start of the fiscal year. As a result, seven interim continuing resolutions for FY2011 became law: P.L. 111-242 (124 Stat. 2607), P.L. 111-290 (124 Stat. 3063), P.L. 111-317 (124 Stat. 3454), and P.L. 111-322 (124 Stat. 3518) in the 111th Congress, and P.L. 112-4 (125 Stat. 6), P.L. 112-6 (125 Stat. 23), and P.L. 112-8 (125 Stat. 34). P.L. 112-4 and P.L. 112-6 rescinded unobligated funds from several specific DHS programs as they continued to fund the department. On April 15, 2011, the President signed H.R. 1473 into law as P.L. 112-10. This public law represents the final appropriations act for FY2011. P.L. 112-10 includes roughly $41.6 billion in non-emergency discretionary spending for the Department of Homeland Security, while mandating a 0.2% across-the-board rescission for all departmental appropriations except for narrowly delineated funding for Coast Guard \"overseas contingency operations directly related to the global war on terrorism.\" As is often the case with continuing resolutions, P.L. 112-10 provides more limited direction than is given through a traditional bill and conference report as to how appropriations should be divided among individual programs, projects, and activities, but instead requires the department to provide spending plans to outline how DHS chooses to allocate those funds. This report will not be updated further."
