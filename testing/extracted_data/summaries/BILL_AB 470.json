    "title": "AB 470",
    "content": "Existing law, the Swimming Pool Safety Act, provides that it does not apply to any pool within the jurisdiction of any political subdivision that adopts an ordinance for swimming pools, as specified. The act further requires, when a building permit is issued for construction of a new swimming pool or spa, or the remodeling of an existing pool or spa, at a private, single-family home, that the pool or spa be equipped with at least 1 of 7 drowning prevention safety features. The act requires the local building code official to inspect and approve the drowning safety prevention devices before the issuance of a final approval for the completion of permitted construction or remodeling work. This bill would instead require, when a building permit is issued, that the pool or spa be equipped with at least 2 of the 7 drowning prevention safety features. By imposing additional duties on local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would remove the exemption for the above-described political subdivisions. Existing law defines terms related to paid home inspections, establishes a standard of care for home inspectors, and prohibits certain inspections in which the inspector or the inspector\u2019s employer, as specified, has a financial interest. This bill would require a home inspection for real property with a swimming pool or spa to include a noninvasive physical examination of the pool or spa and dwelling for the purpose of identifying which, if any, of the specified 7 drowning prevention safety features the pool or spa is equipped with. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
