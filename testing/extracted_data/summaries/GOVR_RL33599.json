    "content": "Energy efficiency issues include research and development (R&D) priorities, funding for climate-related efficiency programs, implementation of equipment efficiency standards, regulation of vehicle fuel efficiency, and electricity industry ratemaking for energy efficiency profitability. The Bush Administration has proposed an Advanced Energy Initiative (AEI) to accelerate hydrogen programs. For the Department of Energy's (DOE's) energy efficiency R&D programs, the Administration seeks $484.7 million, with increases for Hydrogen and Hybrid/Electric Propulsion. The request would cut $74.8 million from the Weatherization Program and eliminate controversial funding earmarks. The House-passed version of the FY2007 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill (H.R. 5427) would fund AEI and cut earmarks. The Senate Appropriations Committee has also approved AEI funding and would cut earmarks even further than the House. Energy efficiency programs have long been justified for the ability to reduce petroleum use and curb environmental impacts such as air pollution. This made it economically and administratively convenient to have them also serve as part of a low cost \"no regrets\" policy to reduce greenhouse gas (especially CO2) emissions. In addition to DOE funding, H.R. 5386 would provide about $100 million for the Environmental Protection Agency's energy efficiency program, and the Senate Appropriations Committee's version of H.R. 5522 would provide about $200 million for energy efficiency-related programs in developing countries. DOE's implementation of equipment efficiency standards has been a subject of some congressional criticism. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT, P.L. 109-58) directed DOE to report to Congress on actions taken to address the concern. In response, DOE issued a schedule for rulemakings on 30 products. EPACT also raised the goals for energy efficiency in federal agencies and provided modest tax incentives for efficiency in certain vehicles and buildings. Automobile fuel efficiency regulation has been one of the most controversial aspects of energy efficiency policy. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program for new cars and light trucks achieved significant energy savings through 1985 but has remained relatively flat since then. Critics say that recent CAFE increases for light trucks are too small, given concerns about high gasoline prices, air pollution, and CO2 emissions. Proponents counter that larger CAFE increases would compromise safety and cause hardship for manufacturers. The National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency aims to defer the need for 20,000 megawatts of new electric power plant capacity. Its success will depend mainly on the ability of state regulators to make energy efficiency profitable for electricity companies, by addressing the link between profits and sales. This report will be updated as events warrant."
