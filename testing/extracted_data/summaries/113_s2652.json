    "title": "A bill to improve the design-build process in Federal contracting.",
    "content": "Modifies design-build selection procedures for civilian and defense contracts for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work to require the contracting officer to provide written documentation of how more than five finalists in a solicitation for a contract is consistent with the purposes and objectives of the two-phase selection process . Requires the use of two-phase selection procedures for civilian or defense contracts when a contracting officer determines that the contract has a value of $750,000 or greater, adjusted for inflation. Requires: (1) agencies to report on contracts for which more than five finalists were selected for phase-two requests or for which the contract was awarded without using two-phase selection procedures, and (2) the Comptroller General (GAO) to report on the compliance of executive agencies with design-build contract procedures."
