    "title": "An act to amend Section 71093 of the Education Code, relating to postsecondary education.",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges. Existing law requires the board of governors to appoint a chief executive officer, known as the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges. Existing law provides for the establishment of community college districts throughout the state, including the Compton Community College District. Existing law authorizes these districts to provide instruction to students at the campuses operated by these districts. Existing law authorizes the board of governors to suspend the authority of the Board of Trustees of the Compton Community College District for a period lasting until June 30, 2011, plus a period lasting until the chancellor, the Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team, the Director of Finance, and the Secretary for Education concur with the special trustee that the district, for 2 consecutive academic years, has met the requirements of the comprehensive assessment conducted, and the recovery plan prepared, pursuant to existing law. Existing law, in the event of a suspension, authorizes the chancellor to appoint a special trustee to manage the district, as specified. This bill would require the special trustee chancellor to report to the Legislature concerning the priorities identified in each Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team report and to provide a response on how the special trustee chancellor intends to resolve the issues identified in the Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team report in a timely manner, not to exceed 150 days from receipt of the report. manner. The bill would require the chancellor to submit the report to the Legislature within 150 days following the issuance of each Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team report. In any instance that there is a decline in performance identified in a report, the special trustee chancellor would be required to also specifically identify strategies for ensuring progress in its response to that report. By imposing additional duties on a community college district, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
