    "content": "Amends the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to require employers at critical infrastructure sites to participate in the basic pilot program. Defines such employers as those employing individuals in a location that: (1) is a Federal, State, or local government building, a military base, a nuclear energy site, a weapon site, or an airport. Or (2) contains critical infrastructure as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Makes it unlawful for such employers to: (1) authorize an alien employee's access to critical infrastructure after receiving a notification of nonconfirmation from the commissioner of Social Security. Or (2) fail to notify any other person or entity that has or may issue documentation authorizing the alien's access of such notification. Authorizes the use of information obtained pursuant to the basic pilot program for enforcement of the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Social Security Act. Allows the Secretary to authorize or require any person or entity responsible for granting access to, protecting, securing, operating, administering, or regulating critical infrastructure to use the basic pilot program for individuals seeking access if doing so will assist in protecting such infrastructure. Establishes enforcement procedures for noncompliance."
