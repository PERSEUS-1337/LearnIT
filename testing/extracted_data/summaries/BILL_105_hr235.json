    "content": "War Crimes Disclosure Act - Requires disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) of any matter in the possession or control of specified Federal agencies that relates to any individual who participated in the persecution of any person because of race, religion, national origin, or political opinion at the direction of, or in association with, the Nazi government of Germany. Provides disclosure exceptions, such as for: (1) personnel and medical files and similar files, (2) the protection of intelligence agents, (3) informants, (4) compelling national security reasons. Or (5) any portion of any matter that does not relate to any individual who committed Nazi war crimes and is reasonably segregable from other portions of the matter that relate to such individual. Requires disclosure of information that can be reasonably separated from excepted information. Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to provide that the exemption from public disclosure authorized under such Act for operational files of the Central Intelligence Agency required to be disclosed under FOIA shall not apply to information regarding Nazi war crimes participants."
