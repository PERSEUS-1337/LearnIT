    "title": "SB 1124",
    "content": "Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. Existing law requires an independent solar energy producer, as defined, contracting for the use or sale of electricity or the lease of a solar energy system, as defined, to an entity or person for use in a residence to make certain disclosures to the buyer or lessee, including a plain language explanation of the contract provisions regulating the disposition or transfer of the contract in the event of a transfer of ownership of the residence, as well as the costs or potential costs associated with the disposition or transfer of the contract. This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to those provisions."
