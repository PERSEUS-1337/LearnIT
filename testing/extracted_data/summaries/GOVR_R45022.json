    "content": "The House and Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittees are charged with providing annual appropriations for the Department of Transportation (DOT), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and related agencies. THUD programs receive both discretionary and mandatory budget authority; HUD's budget generally accounts for the largest share of discretionary appropriations in the THUD bill, but when mandatory funding is taken into account, DOT's budget is larger than HUD's budget. Mandatory funding typically accounts for around half of the THUD appropriation. The Trump Administration requested net new budget authority of $106.65 billion (after scorekeeping adjustments), including $47.9 billion in discretionary funding, for the departments and agencies funded in the THUD bill for FY2018, $9.65 billion (8%) less than the FY2017 level. The House Appropriations Committee reported its version of an FY2018 THUD appropriations bill on July 17, 2017 (H.R. 3353). It recommended $115.3 billion ($56.5 billion in discretionary funding), less than 1% below the FY2017 level. The text of that bill was incorporated into a consolidated appropriations bill (H.R. 3354), amended (with no change in total funding for THUD, but changes in some accounts within THUD), and passed by the House on September 14, 2017. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of an FY2018 THUD bill on July 27, 2017 (S. 1655). It recommended $119.1 billion ($60.1 billion in discretionary funding), 2.4% more than FY2017. With inflation forecast at 1.9% for FY2018, the House bill would result in a roughly 3% decrease in real THUD funding, while the Senate bill would result in a slight increase in real funding, compared to FY2017. With no agreement on FY2018 funding, Congress passed a continuing resolution (H.R. 601) to provide funding through December 8, 2017, for federal agencies. That act extended FY2017 funding levels for the THUD agencies, less an across-the board rescission 0.6791%. DOT: The Trump Administration requested $75.1 billion in net new budgetary authority for DOT for FY2018. That was about $2 billion less than the comparable figure ($77.1 billion) for FY2016, with significant cuts requested for transit and rail programs. Both the House and Senate bills largely rejected the proposed cuts; the House approved $77.5 billion in new funding, and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $78.6 billion. HUD: The Trump Administration requested $31.4 billion in net new budget authority for HUD for FY2018, $7.4 billion less than FY2017 (-19%). It requested no funding for several major grant programs, including the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program and the HOME Investment Partnership program. The House bill proposed $38.3 billion, a small increase in overall funding relative to FY2017 (-1.3%), and did not include the proposed eliminations of HOME and CDBG funding. The Senate committee bill recommended $40.2 billion, a 4% increase over FY2017. Related Agencies: The Trump Administration requested $226 million for the agencies in Title III of the THUD bill (the Related Agencies). This was about $113 million less than was provided in FY2017. The major change in funding from FY2017 levels in the request was proposals to terminate funding for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (NRC) and the Interagency Council on Homelessness (ICH). The President's budget requested only enough funding to close out the commitments of those two entities. Neither the House nor Senate committee bills included the President's proposal to wind down funding for the NRC; the House bill, but not the Senate committee-passed bill, would eliminate funding for the ICH."
