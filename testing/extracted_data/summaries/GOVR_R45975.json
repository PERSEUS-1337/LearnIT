    "content": "For more than 50 years, the United States has taken an interest in the eradication of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) in children worldwide, as well as vaccine research and development, particularly since playing a vital role in the global campaign to eradicate smallpox in the 1960s. Since then, vaccinating children against VPDs has been a major U.S. foreign policy effort. Vaccinations are one of the most cost-effective ways to prevent infectious disease and associated morbidity and mortality. According to UNICEF, immunizations save around 3 million lives per year. As of 2019, VPDs continue to cause high levels of morbidity (illness) and mortality (death), and the World Health Organization (WHO) notes that the adoption of new vaccines by low- and middle-income countries (which often have the highest disease burdens) has been slower than in high-income countries. Receiving a vaccination during childhood can protect the recipient from VPDs, decrease the spread of related diseases, and improve child survival prospects (as children, particularly those under five years old, are more likely than adults to die from VPDs). Recently, a global resurgence of certain VPDs has caused concern among public health officials and drawn attention to the challenges of vaccine hesitancy and stigma. For example, polio continues to elude global eradication and remains endemic in three countries. In 2019 measles has seen a resurgence in some middle- and high-income countries due to a variety of factors, including reluctance among some individuals and religious communities to vaccinate their children. In April 2019, the WHO reported a n increase in global measles cases compared to the same period in 2018, with the greatest surges in cases in the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe. A number of European countries are at risk of or have lost their measles eradication certificate from the WHO, raising questions about global consensus on the use of vaccines, participation in and support for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI, now called GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance) and other global immunization efforts. Prompted in part by this global resurgence, the WHO has listed \"vaccine hesitancy\" as one of the 10 biggest global public health threats. The U.S. government is the second-leading government donor to global vaccination campaigns. Through annual appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of State, Congress funds global immunization activities through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and GAVI. In recent years, annual appropriations by Congress for multilateral immunizations campaigns led by GAVI have averaged $290 million and $226 million for bilateral campaigns led by CDC. USAID works to support routine immunization overseas through health systems strengthening, and Global Polio Eradication Initiative Activities. The authorization, appropriation, and oversight of U.S. funding for global child vaccination is thus an ongoing area of concern for many in Congress. Other key issues for Congress include the extent of donor coordination and burden-sharing for such efforts, and the extent to which global child vaccination promotes U.S. foreign policy, development, and domestic health security (i.e., pandemic preparedness) goals."
