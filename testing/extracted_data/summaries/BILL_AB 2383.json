    "title": "AB 2383",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the California State University, under the administration of the Trustees of the California State University, and the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as 2 of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law states the intent of the Legislature that the public postsecondary institutions request, and the state provide, through the state budget process, funds to cover the actual cost of providing services and instruction, consistent with specified principles, to disabled students in their respective postsecondary institutions. This bill would establish the Autism Employment and Education Program, which would establish a residential, occupational, and living skills program at each participating community college and California State University campus to help students with mental disabilities, including autism, live independently, obtain employment, and become otherwise self-sufficient after they graduate or withdraw from the college or university. The bill would establish the Autism Employment and Education Fund in the State Treasury and allocate moneys in the fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the board of governors and the trustees for the development, implementation, and administration of the program. The bill would only become operative upon appropriation by the Legislature for the implementation and administration of the program."
