    "content": "In most cases, the success or failure of U.S. foreign aid programs is not entirely clear, in part because historically, most aid programs have not been evaluated for the purpose of determining their actual impact. Many programs are not even evaluated on basic performance. The purpose and methodologies of foreign aid evaluation have varied over the decades, responding to political and fiscal circumstances. Aid evaluation practices and policies have variously focused on meeting program management needs, building institutional learning, accounting for resources, informing policymakers, and building local oversight and project design capacity. Challenges to meaningful aid evaluation have varied as well, but several are recurring. Persistent challenges to effective evaluation include unclear aid objectives, funding and personnel constraints, emphasis on accountability for funds, methodological challenges, compressed timelines, country ownership and donor coordination commitments, security, and agency and personnel incentives. As a result of these challenges, aid agencies do not undertake evaluation of all foreign aid activities, and evaluations, when carried out, may differ considerably in quality. The Obama Administration has taken several steps to enhance foreign assistance evaluation. 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) resulted in, among other things, a stated commitment to plan foreign aid budgets \"based not on dollars spent, but on outcomes achieved.\" USAID introduced a new evaluation policy in January 2011. The State Department, which began to manage a growing portion of foreign assistance in the 21st century, introduced a new evaluation policy in February 2012, which was updated in January 2015. The Millennium Challenge Corporation revised its evaluation policy in 2012, and soon after began releasing its first evaluation reports. The agency evaluation policies differ in several respects, including their support for impact evaluation, but reflect a common emphasis on evaluation planning as a part of initial program design, transparency and accessibility of evaluation findings, and the application of data to inform future project design and policy decisions. Aspects of the three evaluation policies are compared in the Appendix. Recent reports and policy reviews suggest that aid evaluation frequency and quality have improved in recent years, though progress has been uneven. Attention to this issue remains strong, both within the Administration and among Members of Congress. The 2015 QDDR reemphasizes the role of evaluation, calling for more evaluation training, more strategic use of data, and more timely analysis of lessons learned, among other things. Though recent evaluation reform efforts have been agency-driven, Congress has considerable influence over their impact. Legislators may mandate a particular approach to evaluation directly through legislation (e.g., the Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act, P.L. 114-191, enacted in July 2016), or may support or fail to support Administration policies by controlling the appropriations necessary to implement the policies. Furthermore, Congress will largely determine how, or if, any actionable information resulting from the new approach to evaluations will influence the nation's foreign assistance policy priorities."
