    "content": "A well-managed border is central to maintaining and improving the security of the UnitedStates against terrorist threats. Border security entails regulating the flow of goods and people acrossthe nation's borders so that dangerous and unwanted goods or people are denied entry. Transportation security entails screening and protecting people and goods as they move betweendifferent locations within the country. The overall appropriations over the past three years for Borderand Transportation Security, as defined in this report, are as follows: in FY2004, Congressappropriated $18,106 million; in FY2005, Congress appropriated $20,313 million; in FY2006, thePresident requested $19,586 million; House-passed H.R. 2360 provides $21,015million; and Senate-passed H.R. 2360 provides $21,283 million. Determining which goods and people are permitted and which are denied entry into theUnited States involves a system of sophisticated border management. This system must balance theneed for securing the nation's borders while facilitating the essential commerce and legitimate freeflow of citizens and authorized visitors. The system must be capable of a detailed examination ofthe goods and people seeking entry, but must still fit within budgetary constraints and beadministratively feasible. Improving transportation security has meant an expanded federal role inscreening passengers and baggage traveling through airports and also increasing the presence offederal officers aboard domestic and international flights. Plans exist to expand the presence offederal officers in other modes of transportation. Finally, these management systems mustaccomplish their functions with a minimum of disruption of legitimate activities, and withoutunnecessary intrusion into the civil liberties of persons affected by them. Within the federal government, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been givenprimary responsibility for securing the nation's borders and for increasing the security oftransportation, among other responsibilities. The locus of border and transportation security activitywithin DHS is in the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security, which houses the Bureauof Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement(ICE), and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The U.S. Coast Guard is a stand-aloneagency within DHS but plays an important role in border and transportation security, as does theFederal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC). This report includes appropriations for thefunctions and agencies of BTS, the U.S. Coast Guard and FLETC. Major issues include the numberof available detention beds and investigators at ICE; the number of Border Patrol agents in CBP; theappropriate level of funding for the Deepwater program within the Coast Guard; and non-aviationsecurity spending within TSA. This report will be updated to reflect the Conference Agreement between the House and theSenate and final passage. Key Policy Staff: Border and Transportation Security"
