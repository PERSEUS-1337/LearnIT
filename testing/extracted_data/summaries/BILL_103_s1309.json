Directs the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to determine whether: (1) each coastal State has adopted measures necessary to implement the Interstate Fisheries Management Plan for Weakfish in its coastal waters. And (2) the enforcement by the Plan by each State is satisfactory. Requires the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to declare a moratorium on fishing for weakfish in States that are not in compliance with the Plan."
