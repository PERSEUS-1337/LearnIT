    "content": "Promoting New Manufacturing Act This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to publish on its website, with respect to FY2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, estimates of: the total number of preconstruction permits issued annually under the Clean Air Act's New Source Review Program for the construction or modification of a major stationary source. The percentage of permits issued within one year of the application. And the average length of time for the EPA's Environmental Appeals Board to decide appeals of decisions to grant or deny a permit. A new or revised national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) may not apply to the review and disposition of a preconstruction permit application unless the EPA publishes implementation guidance with the NAAQS. The EPA must submit annually a report on actions to expedite the process for review of preconstruction permits."
