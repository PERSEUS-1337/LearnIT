    "content": "This report analyzes the FY2014 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Administration requested $39.0 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2014, as part of an overall budget of $60.0 billion (including fees, trust funds, and other funding that is not appropriated or does not score against the budget caps). Net requested appropriations for major agencies within DHS were as follows: Customs and Border Protection (CBP), $10,833 million; Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), $4,997 million; Transportation Security Administration (TSA), $4,857 million; Coast Guard, $8,051 million; Secret Service, $1,546 million; National Protection and Programs Directorate, $1,267 million; Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), $3,984 million; and Science and Technology, $1,527 million. The Administration also requested an additional $5.6 billion for FEMA in disaster relief funding as defined by the Budget Control Act. H.R. 2217, the House-passed DHS appropriations bill, would have provided $39.0 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. The Senate-reported version of the same bill would have provided $39.1 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. Both bills also would have provided the $5.6 billion in disaster relief requested by the Administration. Congress did not enact annual FY2014 appropriations legislation prior to the beginning of the new fiscal year. From October 1, 2013, through October 16, 2013, the federal government (including DHS) operated under an emergency shutdown furlough due to the expiration of annual appropriations for FY2014. More than 31,000 DHS employees were furloughed. Tens of thousands of others who were excepted from furlough, and those whose salaries were paid through annual appropriations, worked without pay until the lapse was resolved by passage of a short-term continuing resolution. From October 17, 2013, to January 17, 2014, the federal government operated under the terms of two consecutive continuing resolutions: P.L. 113-46, which lasted until its successor was enacted on January 15, 2014; and P.L. 113-73, which lasted until the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76), was enacted on January 17, 2014. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014, was included as Division F, and provided $39.3 billion in net discretionary budget authority, as well as the requested disaster relief funding. This report will be updated as events warrant."
