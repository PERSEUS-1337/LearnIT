This report summarizes and analyzes the issues of conflicts of interest that are addressed in federal law and regulation regarding officers and employees in the executive branch of the federal government. Federal conflict of interest laws and regulations deal for the most part with the potential conflict between the official duties and responsibilities of a public officer on the one hand, and the outside, personal economic or financial interests of that individual (including the financial interests of that individual's spouse and minor children) on the other. When a particular governmental matter may have a real and predictable impact on an officer's or employee's personal financial interests or assets, that officer's or employee's work on such a matter for the government would raise conflict of interest issues. The concern in such cases is that the judgment of the officer or employee could be influenced and affected, even subtly or unconsciously, by his or her own personal financial stake in the matter, as opposed to decisions, advice, and official actions of public officers being based solely on the overall, general public interest. Although federal officials may have many and varied outside, personal \"interests,\" federal conflict of interest law and regulation focuses specifically on regulating outside, personal financial interests of the officer. The regulatory scheme for conflicts of interest in the executive branch of the federal government may generally be summarized in three broad categories: disqualification, disclosure, and divestiture. The principal conflict of interest statute under federal law is a criminal provision which requires federal executive branch officials to disqualify or \"recuse\" themselves from working personally and substantially on any particular matter before the government in which that official (or those close enough to the official that their interests may be imputed to the official) has any \"financial interest.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208. There are certain financial interests which are considered either de minimis, or too remote or inconsequential to affect the duties expected of employees, and such interests are exempted from the prohibition by regulations of the Office of Government Ethics. Most high-ranking federal officials must file public annual financial disclosure reports, as well as periodic disclosure reports on certain financial transactions, which detail financial holdings, assets, property, and financial transactions of the official, the official's spouse, and dependent children. Additionally, there may be confidential financial disclosure reports required from certain rank-and-file employees who do not file publicly. All of these disclosure reports are reviewed by agency ethics personnel, and are intended to facilitate conflict of interest regulation by identifying assets, property, and ownerships with a conflict potential, and to resolve any such conflicts of interest. Although there is no overall, general divestiture requirement in federal law, the divestiture of assets may be one method of conflict of interest resolution or avoidance that could be required by agency ethics personnel for assets with conflict of interest potential. Additionally, there are particular statutes and regulations applicable to certain officers and agencies which may prohibit the ownership of a range or category of particular assets. These provisions, in addition to prohibiting the acquisition of such assets, may also require the divestiture of such assets already held by incumbent officers or nominees to certain positions."
