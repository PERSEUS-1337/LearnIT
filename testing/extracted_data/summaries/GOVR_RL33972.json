    "content": "Senate Rule XXVI spells out specific requirements for Senate committee procedures. In addition, all Senate committees are required to adopt rules that govern their organization and operation. Those committee rules then elaborate, within Senate rules, how the committee will handle its business. Rules adopted by a committee may \"not be inconsistent with the Rules of the Senate\" (Senate Rule XXVI, paragraph 2). Committees may add to the basic rules, but they may not add anything that is in conflict with Senate rules. This report first provides a brief overview of Senate rules as they pertain to committees. The report then compares the different approaches Senate committees have taken when adopting their rules. A committee's rules can be extensive and detailed or general and short. The tables at the end of this report compare selected, key features of the rules by committee. The tables, however, represent only a portion of each committee's rules. Provisions of the rules which are substantially similar to, or which are essentially restatements of, the Senate's standing rules are not included. This report will review the requirements contained in Senate rules pertaining to committees; it will then explore how each Senate committee addresses 11 specific issues: Meeting Day; Hearing and Meeting Notice Requirements; Scheduling of Witnesses; Hearing Quorum; Business Quorum; Amendment Filing Requirements; Proxy Voting; Polling; Nominations; Investigations; and Subpoenas. In addition, the report looks at the unique provisions some committees have included in their rules in the Miscellaneous category. This report will be updated during the first session of each Congress after all Senate committees have printed their rules in the Congressional Record."
