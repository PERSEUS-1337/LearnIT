    "title": "SB 1057",
    "content": "Existing law provides that every person has, subject to the qualifications and restrictions provided by law, the right of protection from bodily harm, and from injury to his or her personal relations. Existing law authorizes the California Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board to compensate a victim of a crime from the Restitution Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, for pecuniary loss incurred as a direct result of the crime, when the board determines it will best aid the person seeking compensation. This bill would authorize a person who is injured by an act of terrorism, as defined, to bring an action to recover damages against a person or entity who committed the act of terrorism, aided the person or entity to commit the act or terrorism, or coerced, induced, or solicited the person or entity to commit the act of terrorism. The bill would provide that the amount awarded may be up to 3 times the damages actually incurred, but in no event less than $10,000. The bill would permit a civil action or proceeding under this section to be commenced at any time within 5 years after the injury caused by the act of terrorism is suffered, as specified."
