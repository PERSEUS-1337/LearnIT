    "content": "Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Expansion, Protection, and Access Act of 1997 - Amends Federal law to revise provisions regarding motorized portage in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, Minnesota. Provides that nothing shall prevent the operation of a motorized vehicle and associated equipment necessary to assist in the transport of a boat across Prairie Portage from the Moose Lake chain to Basswood Lake, and from Lake Vermilion to Trout Lake across the Trout Lake Portage. Prohibits such vehicles from exceeding the dimensions of a three-quarter ton pickup truck and requires them to be clean-emission and energy efficient. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to terminate special use permits for tow boats in Basswood or South Farm Lakes. Increases the number of motorboat permits for September on Basswood Lake to take into account the removal of tow boats. Requires the costs of operating motorized vehicles to be borne by a concessionaire without government subsidies. Makes provisions regarding motorized portage ineffective if there is no operation of such vehicles for a significant part of the ice-free season for three consecutive years. Adds lands to the Wilderness. Prohibits the use of motorboats on Canoe Lake in Cook County. Requires the Secretary to make funds available annually to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources for activities such as campsite restoration, trail and campsite maintenance, law enforcement, management plan monitoring, and user education. Makes a specified executive order regarding an airspace reservation applicable to lands added to the Wilderness under this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
