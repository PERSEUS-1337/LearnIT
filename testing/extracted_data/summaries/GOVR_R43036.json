    "content": "Enacted in 1998, the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) is the primary federal legislation that supports basic education for out-of-school adults. Commonly called \"adult education,\" the programs funded by AEFLA typically support educational services at the secondary level and below, as well as English language training. Actual services are typically provided by local entities using a combination of federal and non-federal funds. Specific curricula vary based on the needs and objectives of the local student population. In FY2013, approximately $575 million was appropriated for AEFLA. Of this sum, approximately $21 million was set aside for national activities and incentive grants. The remaining $554 million was allocated to the states via formula grants. To receive a federal grant, states are required to provide a match so that non-federal resources account for at least 25% of the total resources dedicated to adult education. Many states contribute well beyond their required match, though there is substantial variation among the states. The statute specifies that 82.5% of each state's grant must be subgranted to local providers of educational services. These local providers are most commonly local education agencies (typically school districts) or institutions of higher education (typically community, junior, or technical colleges). Nonprofit agencies, correctional institutions, and other entities may also receive grants. Adult education activities provided at the local level are divided into three broad categories: Adult Basic Education (ABE), which includes instruction for adults whose literacy and numeracy skills are below the high school level; Adult Secondary Education (ASE), which includes instruction for adults whose literacy skills are approximately at the high school level, including adults who are seeking to pass the General Education Development (GED) test; and English literacy (EL), which includes instruction for adults who are not proficient in the English language. In program year 2011-2012 (the most recent year for which complete data are available), approximately 1.8 million individuals participated in state adult education activities for an average of 124 hours each. A plurality of the students (47%) participated in ABE while a smaller share (40%) participated in EL activities. The remaining share of adult education students (13%) participated in ASE activities. Non-federal funds accounted for the majority of spending on these activities. The authorization of appropriations for AEFLA expired at the end of FY2003, though the programs it supports have continued to be funded through the annual appropriations process. AEFLA was enacted as Title II of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) and AEFLA reauthorization debate has also been part of broader efforts to reauthorize WIA."
