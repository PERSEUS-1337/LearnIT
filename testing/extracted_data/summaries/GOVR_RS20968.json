    "content": "The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement (FTA), implemented as P.L. 107-43, which went into effect December 17, 2001, breaks new ground by including multiple worker rights provisions inthe bodyof a U.S. trade agreement, rather than as a side agreement, for the first time. For this reason, it adds somecontroversy to thecongressional debate over whether worker rights provisions should be included in future trade agreements. Someobserverseye this configuration of worker rights protections as a model for future trade agreements; others view it as aone-timeoccurrence justified only because Jordan has a strong tradition of labor protections; still others oppose the inclusionof laborprovisions in trade agreements under any circumstances. This report will be updated as events warrant."
