    "content": "In February 2013, the House of Representatives announced that there will be an annual Congressional Academic Competition for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education. The aim of the competition is to promote entrepreneurship and innovation. The annual competition is open to any enrolled high school or homeschooled student in a participating congressional district. The first Congressional Academic Competition focuses on developing applications for mobile, tablet, and computer platforms. The 2014 competition is known as the House Student App Challenge. Recognizing that technology changes over time, the focus of the competition is intended to evolve in the future. This report includes a brief history of the Congressional STEM Education Caucus, the legislation that created the competition (H.Res. 77), and the rules and regulations for conducting the competition in a congressional district."
