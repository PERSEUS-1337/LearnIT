    "content": "State Department funding, formerly in the House Science, State, Justice, Commerce (SSJC) Appropriations Subcommittee, is now aligned in both the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on State-Foreign Operations. In addition to passing annual appropriations, foreign relations authorization legislation is required authorizing the Department of State to spend its appropriations. The 110th Congress is expected also to work on foreign authorization legislation this year. The President sent his FY2008 budget to Congress on February 5, 2007. Included was the Department of State FY2008 budget request for $10,013.8 million\u20144.3% below the FY2006 level of $10,467.9 million, including rescissions and supplementals, but 10.5% above the FY2007 estimate of $8,964.1 million. The international broadcasting FY2008 budget request totals $668.2 million\u2014a 1.7% decline from the FY2006 level, including rescissions and supplementals, but a 3.8% increase over the FY2007 estimate of $644 million. Along with the regular budget request, the Administration is requesting two emergency supplementals: an FY2007 supplemental request including $1,168 million for State and $10 million for international broadcasting and an FY2008 emergency funding request of $1,934.6 million for the Department of State. Both supplementals are largely for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. In March, 2007, both the House and the Senate passed separate versions of the FY2007 supplemental funding (H.R. 1591, H. Rept 110-60 and S. Rept 110-37) including more than $1,168.0 million dollars for the Department of State operations and $10 million for international broadcasting. On April 25th and 26th, Congress passed H.R. 1591, including $1,265.2 million for State Dept operations in Iraq and $10.0 million for international broadcasting. The President vetoed the supplemental on May 1st. Congress was unable to override the veto. For FY2007, the President sent his budget request to Congress on February 6, 2006, seeking $9,502.4 million for the Department of State and $671.9 million for international broadcasting. The House passed its bill (H.R. 5672) on June 29, 2006. The Senate did not pass its bill (H.R. 5522). After several continuing resolutions, the 110th Congress enacted appropriations by passing the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, FY2007 (H.J.Res. 20). It was signed into law (P.L. 110-5) on February 15, 2007. In January 2006, Secretary of State Rice presented her \"Transformational Diplomacy\" vision of the way the State Department will conduct foreign policy. Among other things, decisions have been made to reposition more than 200 jobs primarily from Europe and Washington, DC, to more challenging locations worldwide."
