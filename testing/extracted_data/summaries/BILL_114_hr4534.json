    "content": "Protecting Our Security Through Utilizing Right-Sized End-Strength Act of 2016 or the POSTURE Act This bill expresses the sense of Congress that given the uncertain world and the need for trained and ready US land force, the planned drawdown of land forces should be stopped. The bill sets forth: FY2016 Army, Marine Corps, and Selected Reserve strength levels. And Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force permanent active duty end strength minimum levels. Any proposal to lower the end strength levels established by this Act must first be approved by Congress through enactment of a law to that effect."
