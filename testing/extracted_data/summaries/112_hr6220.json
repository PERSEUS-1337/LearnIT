    "title": "To prohibit an employer from inquiring whether an applicant for employment has been convicted of a criminal offense, except in certain circumstances.",
    "content": "Ban the Box Act - Makes it an unlawful employment practice for certain employers to seek information concerning a job applicant's conviction for a criminal offense. Sets forth exceptions authorizing an employer to seek such information: (1) after a conditional offer for employment has been extended to an applicant, or (2) where the granting of employment may involve an unreasonable risk to the safety of specific individuals or the general public. Directs the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to issue rules indentifying factors to be considered by employers in assessing whether an individual's past criminal history poses such an unreasonable risk within defined categories of employment. Sets forth enforcement procedures and remedies under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, Government Employee Rights Act of 1991, and the rights and protections extended to presidential offices."
