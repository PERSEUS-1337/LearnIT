    "content": "For the past 22 years, Afghanistan has been embroiled in conflict. Humanitarian assistance programs have been a key partof the overall multilateral effort to relieve human suffering and assist refugees and internally displaced persons(IDPs). Since September 11, 2001, while actions are still being taken to eliminate Taliban and Al Qaeda forces and otherssupporting terrorism, the needs have only become more urgent. The case of Afghanistan may present a special category of crisis, in which the United States and others play a significantrole in the war on terrorism while simultaneously providing humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to theinnocentcivilians caught in the crossfire. Moreover, the conditions in Afghanistan represent a challenging mix ofinfrastructuredestruction, ongoing security concerns, and humanitarian needs requiring an immediate response. So far, theinternationalcommunity has recognized that large amounts of aid and resources will be required in the reconstruction effort. Inaddition,a long-term commitment will be necessary to ensure a stable, democratic Afghanistan emerges and will not fall preyto thetwin evils of drugs and terrorism. While continuing to hunt down Al Qaeda forces within Afghanistan, transitional and reconstruction assistance has alsomoved ahead. An examination of the progress of reconstruction efforts and aid priorities in the last year reveals thecomplexity of the tasks ahead and raises questions about the the long-term role to be played by the United States. Congress may continue to look at the contributions by and responsibilities of key allies partnering in the effortswithinAfghanistan. The current operating environment demonstrates ongoing challenges for the government and peopleofAfghanistan and for the international community, such as security issues, population movements, food security,environment and infrastructure, health, and education. While the international donors conference in January 2001indicateda strong willingness on the part of the international community to assist in the restoration of Afghanistan, it alsorevealedthe cost could amount to more than $15 billion over the next decade. A total of $1.8 billion was pledged for 2002,althoughsome pledges have not yet been fulfilled. The many moving parts of the war on terrorism coupled with the uncertainty of developments within Afghanistan makelong-term planning and exit strategies impossible at this stage. Still, of potential, immediate interest to Congressaresecurity concerns, support of the transitional administration, oversight and coordination of aid projects, and theplight ofwomen and children."
