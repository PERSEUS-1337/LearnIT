    "content": "Trade remedies are government measures to minimize the adverse impact of imports ondomestic industries. Antidumping duties are used to counter the effects of imports sold at unfairlylow prices on the domestic market. Countervailing duties are used to counter the price effects ofimports that benefit from government subsidies in the exporting countries. Safeguard remedies (alsocalled Section 201 and escape clause remedies) are used to reduce the injurious impact of surges infairly trade imports. Some of the bills introduced in the 108th Congress would revise safeguard remedies. Otherswould change antidumping and countervailing-duty remedies. The congressional proposals followdifferent approaches to the same goal -- to ease the procedural burden in obtaining relief andimprove the chances that U.S. industries would obtain relief. In so doing, the legislation would make it less likely that industries would press Congress to directly restrict imports throughprotectionist legislation. The 106th Congress did pass one change to U.S. trade remedy law, the so-called Byrdamendment. The 107th Congress did not act on trade remedy legislation, but treatment of traderemedy laws in trade negotiations was a major point of contention during the debate over legislationto grant the President trade promotion authority. Several bills that would amend U.S. trade remedylaws have been introduced in the 108th Congress. Trade remedy legislation is largely supported by those industries, such as steel, that are mostsensitive to foreign competition. The legislation is generally opposed by those industries and groupsthat use imports as inputs or consume them as final products. Increased trade relief would likelyresult in higher prices to these latter groups. This report will be revised as congressional actionwarrants."
