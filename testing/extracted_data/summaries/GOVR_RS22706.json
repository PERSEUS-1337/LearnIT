    "content": "The Federal Protective Service (FPS)\u2014within U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014is responsible for protecting federal government property, personnel, visitors, and customers, including property leased by the General Services Administration (GSA). FPS currently employs over 15,000 contract security guards to protect federal property. DHS continued the use of contract security guards to focus FPS activities on maintaining security policy and standards, conducting building security assessments, and monitoring federal agency compliance with security standards in FY2009. P.L. 110-329 (the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act of 2009) included provisions on FPS maintaining a certain number of police officers. The 110th Congress also enacted P.L. 110-356 (the Federal Protective Service Guard Contracting Reform Act of 2008) which addressed the issue of awarding federal contracts to privately owned contract security guard businesses. The 111th Congress has yet to take any legislative action on FPS, however, the Administration's FY2010 budget request proposes to transfer FPS from ICE to the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) within DHS, which the Senate-passed version of H.R. 2892 supports. This report will be updated as developments warrant."
