    "title": "AB 1361",
    "content": "Existing law, the Ortiz-Pacheco-Poochigian-Vasconcellos Cal Grant Program, establishes the Cal Grant A and B Entitlement awards, the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement awards, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B awards, the Cal Grant C awards, and the Cal Grant T awards under the administration of the Student Aid Commission, and establishes eligibility requirements for awards under these programs for participating students attending qualifying institutions. Under the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement Program, a student who transfers from a California community college to a qualifying institution that offers a baccalaureate degree and who was not awarded a Cal Grant A or B Entitlement award, receives a Cal Grant A or B award if, at the time of the transfer, the student meets specified requirements, among which is a requirement that the student not be 28 years of age or older by December 31 of the award year. This bill would provide that the requirement that a student not be 28 years or older by December 31 of the award year, as described above, would not apply to a current or former member of the Armed Forces of the United States, as defined, who was seeking a Cal Grant A or B award under this provision, unless he or she is a former member who received a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge. The bill would prohibit a qualifying institution from accepting award funds under the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement Program and Title 38 of the United States Code in the same award year for a current or former member of the Armed Forces of the United States who is 28 years of age or older."
