    "content": "Some in the 112th Congress view the foreign affairs budget as a place to cut funds in order to reduce the budget deficit. Foreign affairs expenditures typically amount to about 1% of the annual budget. Others, including Members of Congress of both political parties, view a robust foreign affairs budget as essential for America's national security and foreign policy interests. The State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies appropriations bills, in addition to funding U.S. diplomatic and foreign aid activities, have been the primary legislative vehicle through which Congress reviews the U.S. international affairs budget and influences executive branch foreign policy making in recent years. (Congress has not amended foreign policy issues through a complete authorization process for State Department diplomatic activities since 2003 and for foreign aid programs since 1985.) After a period of general decline in the late 1980s and 1990s, funding for State Department operations, international broadcasting, and foreign aid rose steadily from FY2002 to FY2010, largely because of ongoing assistance to Iraq and Afghanistan, new global health programs, and increasing assistance to Pakistan. It declined again in FY2011 when Congress passed a continuing resolution (P.L. 112-10) significantly reducing U.S. government-wide expenditures, including foreign affairs. On February 14, 2011, the Obama Administration submitted its FY2012 budget proposal before enactment of the final FY2011 appropriations and the current congressional emphasis on budget reductions. The FY2012 request sought $61.5 billion for the international affairs budget, including a core State-Foreign Operations budget of $59.65 billion plus $8.70 billion for extraordinary Overseas Contingency Operations in frontline states. The total request represented an increase of 21.8% over the enacted FY2011 funding level for State Department and Foreign Operations accounts and sought significant increases for State Department's administration of foreign affairs accounts, security assistance, and various multilateral environmental accounts. Funding for international affairs programs was expected by many to decline in FY2012 as the 112th Congress focuses on budget reduction measures to meet objectives in the Budget Control Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-25). The House subcommittee mark of the FY2012 State-Foreign Operations appropriation recommended $47.58 billion in total funding, and the Senate committee-passed bill (S. 1601) recommended $53.97 billion. The enacted total funding level of $53.88 billion is nearly 10% less than the Administration's request, but is 10% more than the enacted total for FY2011. However, $11.20 billion of the FY2012 enacted total is designated for Overseas Contingency Operations (more than the $8.70 billion requested by the Administration) and does not count toward enacted discretionary spending caps. This report analyzes the FY2012 request and congressional action related to FY2012 State-Foreign Operations legislation. The Summary, \"Introduction\" and \"Recent Developments\" sections, and appendix tables in this version of the report have been updated to reflect enactment of P.L. 112-74, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2012."
