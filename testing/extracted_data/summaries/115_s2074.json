    "content": "This bill directs the Bureau of Reclamation to provide to the holder of a permit for any cabin site located on specified federal land associated with the Jamestown Reservoir, North Dakota, the first option to purchase that property for fair market value, provided that the permittee pays to the Stutsman County Park Board any outstanding permit fees. Reclamation shall convey such property and sole use perpetual easements for access to such property to a permittee who elects such option. The conveyance shall end five years after this bill's enactment. If a permittee fails to exercise the option to purchase within five years, the commissioner shall transfer the property to the board without cost. If the board sells such a property within three years after such a transfer, it shall pay all proceeds in excess of its costs to Reclamation. Five years after the date of enactment of this bill, Reclamation shall transfer, without cost: (1) to the board federal land associated with the reservoir and managed by the board on which no cabin is located. And (2) to the North Dakota Game and Fish Department land leased by such department as of that date. Each conveyance to a permittee, and each transfer to the board or department, shall be made subject to specified oil, gas, and other mineral rights, and specified permits, reversions, and easements. Any revenues from a sale of federal land shall be made available to the commissioner, without further appropriation, for: (1) the costs to the commissioner of carrying out this bill, and (2) deferred maintenance activities relating to the operation of the dam in the reservoir."
