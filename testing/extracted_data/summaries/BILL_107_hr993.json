Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to promulgate or amend sentencing guidelines for alien smuggling-related activities so as to: (1) double specified minimum prison terms for smuggling, transporting, harboring, or inducement, (2) increase minimum fines. And (3) increase by at least two offense levels sentencing for intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury or causing bodily injury or death. Exempts from such provisions offenses: (1) committed other than for profit. Or (2) involving the smuggling, transporting, or harboring only of the defendant's spouse, child, or both.

And (2) subject specified alien smuggling and harboring crimes under the Act committed by an armed person to enhanced penalties.
