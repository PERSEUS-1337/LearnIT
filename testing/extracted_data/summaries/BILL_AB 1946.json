    "content": "Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue a driver\u2019s license to an applicant when the department determines that the applicant is lawfully entitled to a license. Existing law allows an applicant for a driver\u2019s license or identification card to request the word \u201cVETERAN\u201d be printed on the face of the driver\u2019s license or identification card, subject to certain requirements, including, among others, payment of an additional $5 fee. This bill would make a technical, nonsubstantive change to those provisions. repeal the $5 fee requirement and make additional conforming changes."
