    "title": "AB 1673",
    "content": "Existing law generally regulates the transfer and possession of firearms. Existing law defines the term \u201cfirearm\u201d for various regulatory purposes, including, among others and subject to exceptions, the requirement that firearms be transferred by or through a licensed firearms dealer, the requirement of a 10-day waiting period prior to delivery of a firearm by a dealer, the requirement that firearm purchasers be subject to a background check, and the prohibition on certain classes of persons, such as felons, possessing firearms. Under existing law, the term \u201cfirearm\u201d includes the frame or receiver of the weapon. Existing law makes a violation of certain of these prohibitions a crime. This bill would define a frame or receiver as that part of a firearm which provides housing for the hammer, bolt, or breechblock, and firing mechanism, and which is usually threaded at its forward portion to receive the barrel, and would include within this definition a frame or receiver blank, casting, or machined body that requires further machining or molding to be used as part of a functional weapon so long as it has been designed and is clearly identifiable as being used exclusively as part of a functional weapon. By expanding the scope of existing crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 16520 of the Penal Code proposed by SB 894, SB 1407, and AB 857 which would become operative if this bill and those bills are enacted, as specified, and this bill is enacted last. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
