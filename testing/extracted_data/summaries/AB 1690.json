    "title": "An act to add Section 87482.3 to the Education Code, relating to community colleges.",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges. Existing law authorizes the establishment of community college districts under the administration of community college governing boards, and authorizes these districts to provide instruction at community college campuses throughout the state. Existing law requires that a person employed to teach adult or community college classes for not more than 67 of the hours per week of a full-time employee having comparable duties, excluding substitute service, be classified as a temporary employee and not a contract employee. This bill would require community college districts without a collective bargaining agreement with part-time, temporary faculty in effect as of January 1, 2017, to, on or after January 1, 2017, commence negotiations with the exclusive representatives for part-time, temporary faculty regarding the terms and conditions required by the bill. The bill would specify minimum standards for the treatment of part-time, temporary faculty to be met by community college collective bargaining agreements negotiated on or after January 1, 2017, that are not exempt, as specified. These standards would relate to, among other issues, evaluation procedures, workload distribution, and seniority rights. To the extent that this bill would impose new duties on community college districts, it would constitute a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
