    "title": "AB 1535",
    "content": "Existing law authorizes a voter who has signed an initiative, referendum, or recall petition to remove his or her name from the petition by filing a written request to do so with the appropriate county elections official prior to the day the petition is filed. This bill would require the written request filed with the elections official to include the voter\u2019s name, residence address, and signature. Existing law sets forth procedures for voting by military or overseas voters, as defined, and permits a military or overseas voter to return his or her ballot by facsimile transmission, accompanied by an oath of voter declaration that includes the voter\u2019s signature. Existing law prescribes the contents of the oath of voter declaration and requires, among other things, the voter to provide his or her current mailing address. The bill would modify the oath of voter declaration form to indicate that the residence address is the last US residence for voter qualification purposes. Existing law permits a district to conduct an election by all-mailed ballots. Existing law also permits political subdivisions to consolidate their elections in certain circumstances. The bill would permit a district conducting an election by all-mailed ballots to consolidate its election with one or more other political subdivisions that are also conducting their elections wholly by mail, if certain conditions are satisfied. Existing law permits the governing body of a special district to consolidate its elections of governing body members in November of odd-numbered years with the statewide general election. The bill would expand that authorization to special district elections of governing body members in any month of odd-numbered years."
