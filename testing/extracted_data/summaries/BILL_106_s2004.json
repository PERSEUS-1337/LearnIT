    "content": "Provides that State pipeline safety agreements may permit the State authority to: (1) require inspections and tests of pipeline facilities in addition to Federal pipeline safety requirements, (2) enforce those Federal requirements. (3) require, by regulation, the owner or operator of a pipeline facility to certify to the State that its safety procedure and accident response plans comply with such Federal requirements. And (4) regulate activities related to the safety of pipeline facilities provided certain conditions are met. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to approve an agreement submitted by a State authority not later than 90 days after its submission. Prohibits the Secretary from approving an agreement that would unduly burden interstate commerce or if the State authority lacks the resources or expertise necessary to carry out the agreement. Authorizes the Secretary, subject to specified conditions, to end an agreement if it is found that the State authority has not complied with the agreement. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary should aggressively pursue entry into pipeline safety agreements with States. Recognizes the State role in specified activities related to accident response and prevention. Directs the Secretary to include in Federal minimum safety standards for pipeline facilities a requirement that owners or operators of interstate pipeline facilities notify appropriate Federal, State, and local entities and individuals likely to be impacted by an accident of any inspection, testing, or rupture of a pipeline facility, or any release of a hazardous liquid or gas from such facility, including any related information. Directs the Secretary, not later than December 1, 2000, to set forth new Federal standards requiring the inspection of the internal and external condition of a pipeline facility at least once every five years. Requires the Secretary to notify those entities and individuals likely to be impacted by an accident involving an inspected pipeline facility of the results of such inspection. Revises Federal minimum safety standards for pipeline facilities to require pipeline operators to be: (1) tested for qualification to perform enumerated functions related to the installation, testing, and maintenance of a pipeline. And (2) certified as qualified by the Secretary of Transportation to perform such functions. Allows such standards to include a requirement that such individuals obtain additional education and training to qualify to perform such functions. Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the inspection and placement of pipeline facilities. Authorizes appropriations for: (1) research and development of inspection devices and leak detection for pipeline facilities, and (2) State pipeline safety grants."
