    "content": "Spoofing Prevention Act of 2016 This bill amends the Communications Act of 1934 to expand the prohibition against knowingly transmitting misleading or inaccurate caller identification information to apply to: (1) persons outside the United States if the recipient of the call is within the United States, and (2) text messages. Existing caller identification requirements that apply to calls made using a telecommunications service or IP-enabled voice service are revised to apply to voice communications using resources from the North American Numbering Plan. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) must publish on its website a report that identifies existing technologies that consumers can use to protect against misleading or inaccurate caller identification information. The Government Accountability Office must report on: (1) actions taken, or actions that could be taken, by the FCC or the Federal Trade Commission to combat the fraudulent provision of misleading or inaccurate caller identification information. And (2) any recommendations to combat the fraudulent provision of such information."
