    "content": "Mercury Pollution Reduction Act of 2009 - Declares that the United States should develop policies and programs that will reduce: (1) mercury use and emissions. (2) mercury releases from the reservoir of mercury currently in use or circulation. And (3) exposures to mercury, particularly of women of childbearing age and young children. Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to prohibit: (1) the manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells. And (2) the export of any mercury, mercury cells, mercury compounds, and mixtures containing mercury. Requires the Secretary of Energy to develop a system for the storage of all mercury, mercury cells, mercury compounds, and mixtures containing mercury from a chlor-alkali facility. Requires the owner or operator of each chlor-alkali facility to report to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator and the state in which the facility is located on mercury waste, emissions, and content in products. Requires the Administrator to: (1) conduct a comprehensive mercury inventory covering the life and closure of chlor-alkali facilities that cease operations on or after January 1, 2009. And (2) obtain mercury purchase records and such other information from each such facility as are necessary to determine the magnitude and nature of mercury releases from the facility into air and other environmental media."
