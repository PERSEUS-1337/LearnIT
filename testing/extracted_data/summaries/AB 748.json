    "title": "An act to amend Sections\n75.21,\n271\n,\nand 271.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation.",
    "content": "Existing law, with respect to supplemental property tax assessments, specifies various limitation periods for assessments on the supplemental tax roll. Existing law provides for the application of property tax exemptions to those supplemental assessments provided, among other things, that an assessee file an exemption application within a specified time. Existing property tax law allows taxes, penalties, and interest imposed for late filings of property tax exemption applications for the supplemental roll that exceed $250 in total to be canceled or refunded up to 85 or 90, as applicable, in the case of the exemption for a college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, or veterans\u2019 organization. This bill would expand this reduction to be applied to exemptions for public schools, as provided. Existing property tax law provides, with respect to property as to which the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans\u2019 organization, free public libraries, free museums, public schools, community colleges, state colleges, state universities, tribal housing, or welfare exemption was available but for which a timely application for exemption was not filed, that 90 of any tax or penalty or interest on that property shall be canceled or refunded if an appropriate application for exemption is filed on or before the lien date in the calendar year next succeeding the calendar year in which the exemption was not claimed by a timely application. Existing property tax law requires, if an appropriate application for exemption is filed within 90 days from the first day of the month following the month in which the property was acquired or by February 15 of the following calendar year, whichever occurs first, any tax or penalty or interest imposed upon property owned by any organization qualified for the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans\u2019 organization, tribal housing, or welfare exemption that is acquired by that organization during a given calendar year, after the lien date but before the first day of the fiscal year commencing within that calendar year, if the property is of a kind that would have been qualified for the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans\u2019 organization, tribal housing, or welfare exemption if it had been owned by the organization on the lien date, to be canceled or refunded. This bill would add public schools to the list of entities eligible for the cancellation or refund of any tax or penalty or interest imposed on property acquired in a given calendar year after the lien date but before the first day of the fiscal year commencing within that calendar year. The bill also would make conforming changes. By increasing the duties of local officials relative to the administration of taxes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions."
