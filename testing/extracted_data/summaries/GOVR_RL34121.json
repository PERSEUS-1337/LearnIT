    "content": "Child welfare services are intended to prevent the abuse or neglect of children; ensure that children have safe, permanent homes; and promote the well-being of children and their families. The largest amount of federal child welfare funding is provided to states for assistance to children who have been removed from their homes (due primarily to abuse or neglect). In the past decade, the share of this support provided for children who remain in foster care has been on the decline, while the share provided for those who leave foster care for permanent homes (primarily via adoption) has increased. Congress first authorized Title IV-E support for kinship guardianship assistance in FY2009. Although the number of children receiving this assistance remains relatively small, it is growing. Final FY2013 funding provided for child welfare programs was $7.868 billion (P.L. 113-6, and after application of the March 1 sequestration order). Final FY2012 funding provided for those same child welfare programs was $8.009 billion (P.L. 112-74). Of the $141 million in reduced child welfare funding (compared to FY2012), about $55 million resulted from the automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration. Those cuts largely affected funding to states for child welfare-related services to children and their families, including the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services program, the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program, Education and Training Vouchers (for youth who age out of foster care), grants under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), funding for Adoption Incentives, and several competitive grant programs supporting child welfare purposes. The remaining roughly $86 million difference in appropriated funding authority is tied to a change in the expected cost of the program that provides federal support for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship (authorized under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act). That program is exempt from sequestration and receives mandatory funding to meet a part of all eligible foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance costs incurred by states. The President's FY2013 budget sought $8.175 billion for the child welfare programs and related initiatives described in this report, including $250 million annually (beginning with FY2013) to provide incentives to states that improve their performance with regard to child outcomes and service quality. The Administration also sought legislative authority to end federal and state \"cost recovery\" of child support payments made on behalf of children in foster care and to instead require that these funds be spent in the child's best interest. This change to the Child Support Enforcement program was estimated to cost the federal treasury $2 million in FY2013, and a total of $303 million across 10 years. As part of its FY2013 budget, the Administration also proposed continued funding of a national survey of well-being for children in foster care, sought increased research funds ($5 million in FY2013) for competitive grants to improve coordination between entities serving young victims of domestic sex trafficking, and proposed re-purposing certain previously appropriated funding that was expected to go unused (an estimated $12 million to $15 million in FY2013) for competitive grants to fund and evaluate programs to reduce pregnancy among youth in foster care. Congress did not authorize, fund, or otherwise enable any of these FY2013 proposals. Finally, the Administration sought to eliminate funding for three programs, authorized under the Victims of Child Abuse Act (Children's Advocacy Centers, Court Appointed Special Advocates, and Child Abuse Training for Judges and Judicial Practitioners). Congress did not follow this proposal, choosing instead to provide a combined $25 million for the programs."
