    "content": "Instructs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to impose just and reasonable load-differentiated demand rates or cost-of-service based rates on sales by public utilities of electric energy at wholesale in the western energy market . Authorizes a State public utility commission in such market to prohibit any utility under its jurisdiction from making any sale of electric energy to a purchaser outside the utility's service area if the commission believes that its delivery would impair the utility's ability to meet the demand for electric energy in its own service area. Instructs FERC to require a seller of natural gas to disclose the commodity portion and transportation portion of the sale price if it is sold in a bundled transaction under which it is to be transported into the State of California from outside the State. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the Bonneville Power Administration should: (1) take steps to reduce its wholesale electric power purchase needs in the rate period beginning October 1, 2001. And (2) undertake other actions to minimize its potential wholesale electric rate increase due to take effect October 1, 2001."
