    "content": "Business Supply Chain Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2014 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) legislation is necessary to provide consumers information on products that are free of child labor, forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking. And (2) businesses and consumers, by means of publicly available disclosures, can avoid inadvertently promoting or sanctioning these crimes through production and purchase of goods and products that have been tainted in the supply chains. Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), within one year after enactment of the Global Supply Chain Transparency for Trafficking, Forced Labor, and Child Labor Eradication Act, to promulgate regulations requiring that mandatory annual reports include a disclosure whether the covered issuer has taken any measures during the year to identify and address conditions of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and the worst forms of child labor within the issuer's supply chains. Requires any business entity filing such disclosures to make them available on its Internet website. Directs the Secretary of Labor to develop and publish annually on the Internet website of the Department of Labor a list of top 100 companies adhering to supply chain labor standards, as established under federal and international guidelines."
