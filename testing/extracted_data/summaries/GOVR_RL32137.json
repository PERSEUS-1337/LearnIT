With the six-party talkscurrently at a standstill, the United States and its allies are seeking ways to pressure economicallyand politically the Pyongyang regime to abandon its nuclear weapons program. The Chosen Sorenorganization has long supported North Korea by facilitating trade, remitting cash donations,establishing personal contacts, and possibly coordinating illicit transfers of narcotics and weaponparts. Japanese officials have recently indicated more willingness to crack down on Chosen Soren'sillegal activities. U.S. officials may be prepared to cooperate with Japan in dealing with theorganization as part of a broader strategy of influencing North Korean actions. Congress has been actively engaged in its oversight of the Administration's North Korean policy, including a hearing held by the Financial Management, Budget, and International SecuritySubcommittee of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on May 20, 2003, in which a NorthKorean defector testified that Chosen Soren had coordinated shipments of missile parts to theregime. This report provides a background on Chosen Soren and its membership in Japan and explores its relationship with the Japanese government. It goes on to discuss documented links, both legaland illegal, with the North Korean government, including weapons, drugs, and cash transfers. Athird section outlines changes to Japan's policy towards Chosen Soren, ranging from taxation policyto shipping surveillance to restructured credit unions. The report concludes with a brief discussionof possible options for Congress and U.S. officials. This report will be updated as necessary."
