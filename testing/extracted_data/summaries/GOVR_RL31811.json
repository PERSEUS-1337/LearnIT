    "content": "The annual Foreign Operations appropriations bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which Congress reviews the U.S. foreign aid budget and influences executive branch foreign policymaking generally. It contains the largest share -- about two-thirds -- of total U.S. internationalaffairs spending. President Bush asked Congress to appropriate $18.89 billion for FY2004 Foreign Operations. The budget proposal was $2.7 billion, or 16.7% higher than regular (non-supplemental) ForeignOperations appropriations for FY2003. If enacted, the President's recommendation would haveresulted in one of the largest increases of regular Foreign Operations funding in at least two decades. Congress subsequently approved in mid-April an additional $7.5 billion FY2003 supplementalforeign aid spending in P.L. 108-11 , for Iraq reconstruction, assistance to coalition partners, andother activities supporting the global war on terrorism. Including the supplemental, ForeignOperations appropriations totaled $23.67 billion in FY2003. The FY2004 budget blueprint continued to make funding in support of the war on terrorism as the highest priority, with about $4.7 billion recommended. The submission also sought funding forfour new aid initiatives which together accounted for most of the $2.7 billion increase over regular FY2003 levels. Combined, the Millennium Challenge Account, a new foreign aid concept, the StateDepartment's Global AIDS Initiative, and two new contingency funds, totaled $2.05 billion. OtherForeign Operations programs were left with a more modest 4% increase. In total, the request included $1.2 billion for HIV/AIDS, about $350 million more than enacted for FY2003, and $7.1 billion for military and security-related economic aid, up nearly $650 millionor 10% from regular FY2003 appropriations. \"Core\" bilateral development assistance funding,however, would have fallen by 8%, although recipients of these accounts would be expected tobenefit significantly from the new Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) and Global AIDSInitiative. On July 23, the House passed H.R. 2800 , appropriating $17.12 billion. The Senate passed the legislation on October 30, providing $18.4 billion. Foreign Operations was merged into H.R. 2673 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, a bill that passed the House onDecember 8 and the Senate on January 22, 2004. The enacted measure provides $17.48 billion, atotal that includes a 0.59% across-the-board rescission. This is about $1.4 billion, or 7.4% less thanthe President requested. The enacted measure increases resources for international HIV/AIDS byabout $400 million and cuts the request for the MCA by $300 million. The FY2004 Foreign Operations debate has included discussion of several significant policy issues, including foreign aid as a tool in the global war on terrorism, the Millennium ChallengeAccount, programs to combat HIV/AIDS, international family planning programs, and Afghanreconstruction.
