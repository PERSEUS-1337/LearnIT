The bill also requires DHS to: ensure that each CBP officer is equipped with a secure two-way communication and satellite-enabled device that allows communication between ports of entry and inspection stations and with other law enforcement entities. Award grants for the purchase of identification and detection equipment and mobile, hand-held, two-way communication devices for state and local law enforcement officers serving on the southern border. Develop a strategic plan for standardized collection of vehicle wait times at land ports of entry and update it to reflect new practices, time lines, tools, and assessments. Develop a standardized model for the allocation of CBP officers and support staff at land ports of entry. And identify and adopt at least two new, outcome-based performance measures that support the trade facilitation goals of the CBP."
