    "title": "An act to add Section 6060.1.5 to the Business and Professions Code, relating to the State Bar Act.",
    "content": "Existing law, the State Bar Act, requires an applicant for admission and a license to practice law, to meet certain requirements, including, but not limited to, having completed certain legal education in a law school, law office, or judge\u2019s chambers, passed an examination in professional responsibility, and passed the general bar examination. Existing law prohibits a person from practicing law in this state unless he or she is an active member of the State Bar. This bill would additionally require an applicant, prior to admission, to complete at least 50 hours of supervised pro bono legal service, as specified, in order to supplement the applicant\u2019s legal education with practical legal work experience. Upon completion of the pro bono legal service requirement, the bill would require an applicant and the supervisor, as defined, to complete and sign a form confirming completion of the pro bono service. The bill would require the State Bar to adopt rules for the retention of the certification forms. The bill would authorize the State Bar to create the form upon which an applicant can report completion of pro bono service. The bill would require the State Bar to randomly audit submitted forms to ensure compliance with these provisions. The bill would provide that these provisions apply to all applicants who enter law school on or after January 1, 2018."
