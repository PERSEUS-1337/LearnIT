    "content": "This report shows in tabular form how much the Administration requested and how much Congress appropriated for U.S. payments to the multilateral development banks (MDBs) since 2000. Multilateral development banks provide financial assistance to developing countries in order to promote economic and social development. The United States belongs to several multilateral development banks, including the World Bank and four regional development banks (the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development). It also belongs to the North American Development Bank, which is a binational (U.S.-Mexico) development bank; the International Fund for Agricultural Development, which focuses on poverty and hunger in developing countries; and several trust funds administered by the World Bank, which focus on specific global issues, such as food security and the environment. The United States appropriates funding on an annual basis to various multilateral development banks and related funds. In FY2018, U.S. appropriations for MDB programs totaled $1.5 billion. Most of the FY2018 funding (about 90%) went to the concessional lending facilities at the MDBs, which provide grants and low-cost loans to the world's poorest countries. Congress also provided funding for the African Development Bank, IFAD, and the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), administered by the World Bank. The Treasury Department manages U.S. participation in the MDBs, and the Administration's request is submitted as part of Treasury International Programs. For FY2019, the Administration has requested $1.4 billion for the MDBs and related funds. Most of the funding would go to the concessional lending facilities at the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. It would also provide funding for the African Development Bank. The Administration has proposed cutting U.S. contributions to IFAD and reducing U.S. contributions to the GEF.
