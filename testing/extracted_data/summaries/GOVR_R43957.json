    "content": "Congress has played an active role in U.S. policy toward Sudan for more than three decades. Efforts to support an end to the country's myriad conflicts and human rights abuses have dominated the agenda, as have counterterrorism concerns. When unified (1956-2011), Sudan was Africa's largest nation by area, bordering nine countries and stretching from the northern borders of Kenya and Uganda to the southern borders of Egypt and Libya. Strategically located along the Nile River and the Red Sea, Sudan was historically described as a crossroads between the Arab world and Africa. Domestic and international efforts to unite the country's ethnically, racially, religiously, and culturally diverse population under a common national identity fell short, however, and in 2011, after decades of civil war and a six-year transitional period, Sudan split in two. Mistrust between the two Sudans\u2014Sudan and South Sudan\u2014lingers, and unresolved disputes and related security issues still threaten to pull the two countries back to war. The north-south split did not resolve other simmering Sudanese conflicts, notably in Darfur, Blue Nile, and Southern Kordofan. Roughly 3.7 million people are displaced, internally or as refugees, by violence in these areas. Like the rest of the Sahel, Sudan is susceptible to drought and food insecurity, despite significant agricultural potential in some areas. Civilians in conflict zones are particularly vulnerable. Instability and government restrictions limit relief agencies' access to conflict-affected populations. Logistical challenges, particularly during seasonal rains, also constrain access to those who have fled to remote refugee camps in South Sudan. The internal conflict that unfolded in South Sudan in late 2013 further threatens access to those refugees, and has led more than 146,000 South Sudanese to flee into Sudan. Harassment of aid workers is a problem in both countries, further hindering aid responses. The peaceful separation of Sudan and South Sudan was seen by some as an opportunity to repair relations between Sudan's Islamist government and the United States. Those ties have long been strained over Khartoum's human rights violations and history of relations with terrorist groups. Among the arguments in favor of normalizing relations has been the notion that the United States, given robust sanctions already in place, has few additional unilateral \"sticks\" to apply. Advocates have argued that certain \"carrots,\" such as easing sanctions or elevating the level of diplomatic engagement, might advance U.S. policy goals. Efforts by the Obama Administration to improve relations, given Sudan's reported counterterrorism cooperation and acceptance of South Sudan's separation, have been impeded by reports of ongoing abuses, including allegations that Sudan continues to commit war crimes against civilians. Diplomatic relations are also complicated by the fact that several Sudanese officials, notably President Omar al Bashir, stand accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide at the International Criminal Court. In 2014, under domestic and international pressure to address calls for reform and to resolve ongoing conflicts, President Bashir announced a National Dialogue, under which the government would engage opposition and civil society groups on the development of a new constitution. The African Union, the United Nations, the Obama Administration and other international actors expressed cautious support for the initiative, although the extent of the government's commitment to major political reforms remains unclear, and efforts to facilitate the participation of armed opposition groups in the process have been, to date, unsuccessful. Major opposition parties boycotted elections held in April 2015; President Bashir was reelected with 94% of the vote. This report provides an overview of political, economic, and humanitarian conditions, examines conflict dynamics in the country, and outlines U.S. policy and congressional engagement."
