    "title": "An act to add and repeal Sections 17053.50 and 23650 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation, to take effect immediately, tax levy.\nAn act to amend Section 44559.11 of, and to add Section 44559.14 to, the Health and Safety Code, relating to seismic safety, and making an appropriation therefor.",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the Capital Access Loan Program to assist small businesses in financing the costs of complying with environmental mandates and the remediation of contamination on their properties, and also establishes within the program the California Americans with Disabilities Act Small Business Capital Access Loan Program to assist small businesses in financing the costs of projects that alter or retrofit existing small business facilities to comply with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. Under existing law, both programs are administered by the California Pollution Control Financing Authority (authority). This bill would establish within the Capital Access Loan Program the California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program to assist residential property owners and small business owners in seismically retrofitting residences and small businesses by covering losses on qualified loans for those purposes, as specified. The bill would require the authority to administer the program, including regulations and funds received for the program, as specified. The bill would also authorize the authority to, by regulation, implement loan loss reserve programs to benefit any individual person engaged in qualifying activities that require financing, as specified. This bill would establish the California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program Fund and would continuously appropriate that fund to the authority to carry out the purposes of the California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program. The Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law allow various credits against the taxes imposed by those laws. This bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2022, would allow a tax credit under both laws in an amount equal to 30 of the qualified costs paid or incurred by a qualified taxpayer for any seismic retrofit construction on a qualified building, as provided. The bill would require a taxpayer, in order to be eligible for the credit, to obtain 2 certifications from the appropriate jurisdiction with authority for building code enforcement of the area in which the building is located: one prior to seismic retrofit construction that certifies that the building is an at-risk property, and a second subsequent to construction that certifies that the completed construction is seismic retrofit construction, as defined, and specifies a dollar amount of qualified costs. The bill would further require the taxpayer to provide the second certification to, and apply for the allocation of the credit with, the Franchise Tax Board. The bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to allocate credits on a first-come-first-served basis. The bill would provide that the credit would have an aggregate cap under both laws of $12,000,000 plus the amount of previously unallocated credit for each calendar year, as provided. Existing law requires a bill that would authorize a new credit against the tax imposed by the Personal Income Tax Law or the Corporation Tax Law to contain specific goals, purposes, and objectives that the new credit will achieve and detailed performance indicators and data collection requirements for determining whether the new credit achieves these goals, purposes, and objectives. This bill would make findings specifying the goals, purposes, and objectives of the above-described tax credits and detailing the performance indicators and data collection requirements for determining whether the credits meet these goals, purposes, and objectives. This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."
