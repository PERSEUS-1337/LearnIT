And (3) prohibit post-cancellation increases in interest rates and fees on the outstanding balance of any canceled cards. Mandates disclosure to a credit card account holder of the fees and interest rates imposed upon credit advances through the use of third party checks. Proscribes over-the-limit fees in creditor-approved transactions, and two-cycle billing.
