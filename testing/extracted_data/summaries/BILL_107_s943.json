    "content": "United States-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement Act of 2001 - Declares it to be US policy to seek the elimination of tariff and nontariff barriers in order to achieve more open market access, on a reciprocal basis, to internationally-traded goods and services, through bilateral free trade agreements with like-minded countries. Authorizes the President to enter into a free trade agreement with New Zealand. Requires the inclusion of trade-related labor and environmental protection standards in any bill submitted to Congress implementing such agreement. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to apply fast-track procedures or trade promotion authority to any implementing bill for an agreement entered under this Act."
