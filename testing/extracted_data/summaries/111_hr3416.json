    "content": "Disaster Assistance Voting Act of 2009 - Applies certain protections for absent military and overseas voters to individuals evacuated as a result of a major disaster. Requires any eligible evacuee to be treated in the same manner as an absentee uniformed services voter and overseas voter for purposes of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. Deems such an individual to be entitled to vote by absentee ballot for purposes of the National Voter Reigistration Act of 1993 and the Help America Vote Act of 2002. Directs the Election Assistance Commission to make grants to eligible states to: (1) restore and replace supplies, materials, and equipment used in the state election administration which were damaged as a result of a major natural disaster. And (2) conduct outreach and education for voters displaced for the same reason. Amends the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to require delay for at least three consecutive federal general elections before removal of eligible evacuees from the official list of voters by reason of their not voting or appearing to vote in several consecutive such elections. Requires each motor vehicle authority and each voter registration agency in a state to take necessary steps to notify individuals to whom their services are provided of the protections afforded by this Act and of the requirements for obtaining them, including submission of an affidavit stating that the individual intends to return to the place of residence where the individual is otherwise qualified to vote. Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to direct the President to send a similar notice to each individual and household receiving assistance under that Act."
