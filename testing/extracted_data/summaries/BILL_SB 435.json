    "title": "SB 435",
    "content": "Existing law, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996, an initiative measure enacted by the approval of Proposition 215 at the November 5, 1996, statewide general election, authorizes the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Existing law, enacted by the Legislature, provides for the licensing and regulation by both state and local entities of medical marijuana and its cultivation. Existing law requires the Department of Food and Agriculture to establish a Medical Cannabis Cultivation Program. The program prohibits a person from cultivating medical marijuana without first obtaining a state license issued by the department and a license, permit, or other entitlement specifically permitting cultivation pursuant to the program from the city, county, or city and county in which the cultivation will occur, as specified. Existing law exempts certain persons from these licensure requirements under specified conditions, but authorizes a city, county, or city and county to regulate or ban the cultivation, storage, manufacture, transport, provision, or other activity by the exempt person. This bill would instead provide that an exemption from these licensure requirements does not limit or prevent a city, county, or city and county from exercising its police power authority under a specified provision of the California Constitution. Existing law requires the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development to perform various functions and duties with respect to health policy and planning and health professions development. Existing law states the Legislature\u2019s finding that there is a need to improve the effectiveness of health care delivery systems. Existing law generally defines a medical home as a single provider, facility, or team that coordinates an individual\u2019s health care services. This bill would require the Secretary of California Health and Human Services to convene a working group of public payers, private health insurance carriers, 3rd-party purchasers, health care providers, and health care consumer representatives to identify appropriate payment methods to align incentives in support of patient centered medical homes. The bill would prescribe the powers and duties of the working group, including consulting with, and providing recommendations to, the Legislature and relevant state agencies on matters relating to the implementation of the patient centered medical home care model. The bill would require the secretary to convene the working group only after making a determination that sufficient nonstate funds have been received to pay for all costs of implementing the bill. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations regarding the intent of the Legislature to exempt and immunize activities undertaken in connection with patient centered medical homes from state and federal antitrust laws, as specified."
