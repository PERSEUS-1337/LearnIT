    "title": "An act to amend Sections 51, 205.5, and 5813 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation, to take effect immediately, tax levy.",
    "content": "The California Constitution generally limits ad valorem taxes on real property to 1 of the full cash value, as defined, of that property, and provides that the full cash value base may be adjusted each year by the inflationary rate not to exceed 2 for any given year. Existing property tax law implementing this constitutional authority provides that the taxable value of real property is the lesser of its base year value compounded annually by an inflation factor not to exceed 2, as provided, or its full cash value. Existing property tax law also provides that the taxable value of a manufactured home is the lesser of its base year value compounded annually by an inflation factor not to exceed 2 or its full cash value. This bill, for any assessment year commencing on or after January 1, 2017, would provide that the inflation factor shall not apply to the principal place of residence, including a manufactured home, of a qualified veteran, as defined, who is 65 years of age or older on the lien date, was honorably discharged from military service, and meets specified requirements. By changing the manner in which local tax officials calculate the taxable value of real property owned by senior veterans, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing property tax law provides, pursuant to the authorization of the California Constitution, a disabled veteran\u2019s property tax exemption for the principal place of residence of a veteran or a veteran\u2019s spouse, including an unmarried surviving spouse, if the veteran, because of injury incurred in military service, is blind in both eyes, has lost the use of 2 or more limbs, or is totally disabled, as those terms are defined, or if the veteran has, as a result of a service-connected injury or disease, died while on active duty in military service. Existing law exempts that part of the full value of the residence that does not exceed $100,000, or $150,000, if the veteran\u2019s or spouse\u2019s household income does not exceed $40,000, adjusted for inflation, as specified. This bill, for property tax lien dates on an after January 1, 2017, would instead exempt the full value of the principal place of residence of a veteran or veteran\u2019s spouse if the veteran\u2019s or spouse\u2019s household income does not exceed $40,000, adjusted for inflation. The bill would also make technical and conforming changes to the disabled veteran\u2019s property tax exemption. By changing the manner in which local tax officials administer the disabled veteran\u2019s property tax exemption, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires the Legislature to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation. This bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions. This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."
