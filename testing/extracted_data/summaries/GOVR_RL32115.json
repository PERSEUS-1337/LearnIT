    "content": "This report analyzes the policy implications of missile proliferation in South Asia, providing information on India's and Pakistan's missile programs and their role in regional security. Thereport also provides background on the India-Pakistan conflict and the U.S. role, and reviews theregion's strategic security dynamics. The report concludes with a review of key issues and optionsfor U.S. policy. The United States has long been concerned about the proliferation of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems in South Asia. This concern became acute after May 1998, when both India andPakistan tested nuclear explosive devices. Since that time, both countries have continued testingnuclear-capable ballistic missiles, and both have established command and control authorities tooversee their nuclear arsenals. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 and havesignificant unsettled territorial disputes. Although the status of weaponization is unclear, aslow-speed arms race appears to be underway on the Asian Subcontinent, and the proliferation ofmissile capabilities in South Asia has been identified as a potentially major threat to regional stabilityand to key U.S. foreign policy goals. A persistent aspect of U.S. engagement in the region has been the difficulty of maintaining a balanced approach toward two antagonistic countries while simultaneously promoting perceived U.S.interests. During the 1990s, U.S. security policy toward South Asia focused on preventing weaponsproliferation, but the Bush Administration shifted to a more \"pragmatic\" approach emphasizing\"restraint\" in this area. For perhaps the first period in history the United States currently enjoyssimultaneously positive relations with both countries. While relationships between the United States, India, and Pakistan have taken on a positive hue, potential for regional instability persists. The strategic capabilities of India and Pakistan couldprovide a ready catalyst for transforming disputes or terrorist incidents into potentially cataclysmicconfrontations. Both countries also are pursuing the development or acquisition of missile defensesystems. It is unknown at this early stage if missile defenses will offer a degree of stability to theregion or if they will create an imbalance, thus prompting the other country to build more missilesto compensate for the disparity. Key issues for Congress addressed in this report are the extent to which missile proliferation in South Asia enhances or upsets regional stability and the role of U.S. policy in promoting suchstability, as well as in tension reduction and nonproliferation. Levels of U.S. foreign assistance toIndia and Pakistan, the establishment of aid restrictions, the transfer of conventional weaponsplatforms (possibly including missile defense systems), the setting of export control parameters andnonproliferation goals, and the maintenance of policy and intelligence oversight of U.S. relationswith India and Pakistan constitute additional issues of concern to Congress. This report will beupdated as warranted by events."
