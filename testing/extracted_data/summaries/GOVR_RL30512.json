When the Senate took up the bill it approved anoverall 3.7 % increase. The House later restored most of the funds cut at the committee level whenit adopted a manager's amendment containing an additional $95.7 million in funding during floorconsideration of the House bill. The compromise bill approved by the conference committeeprovided for a 2.1% over FY2000.
