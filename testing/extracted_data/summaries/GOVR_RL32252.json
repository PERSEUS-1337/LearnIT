    "content": "Since HIV/AIDS was discovered in 1981, more than 20 million people have lost their livesto the virus. According to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), nearly 40million are currently living with HIV/AIDS, including nearly 2.2 million children under the age of15. In 2004, 4.9 million people acquired the virus, and 3.1 million died from AIDS. Sub-SaharanAfrica remains the most affected region with 25.4 million people living with HIV/AIDS at the endof 2004, 1.9 million of whom were children under the age of 15. The United States Agency forInternational Development (USAID), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and UNAIDSestimate that at the end of 2003, 15 million children under the age of 18 had lost one or both parentsto AIDS, with the majority (82%) in sub-Saharan Africa. In just two years, from 2001 to 2003, theglobal number of children orphaned by AIDS increased from 11.5 million to 15 million. By 2010,it is expected that more than 25 million children will be orphaned by this deadly virus. Due to the10-year time lag between HIV infection and death, officials predict that orphan populations willcontinue to rise for a similar period, even after the HIV rate begins to decline. Experts say onlymassive spending to prolong the lives of parents could be expected to change this trend. The impact of HIV/AIDS on children is just beginning to be explored. Not only are childrenorphaned by AIDS affected by the virus, but those who live in homes that have taken in orphans,children with little education and resources, and those living in areas with high HIV rates are alsoimpacted. Children who have been orphaned by AIDS may be forced to leave school, engage inlabor or prostitution, suffer from depression and anger, or engage in high-risk behavior that makesthem vulnerable to contracting HIV. Children who live in homes that take in orphans may see adecline in the quantity and quality of food, education, love, nurturing, and may be stigmatized. Impoverished children living in households with one or more ill parent are also affected, as healthcare increasingly absorbs household funds, which frequently leads to the depletion of savings andother resources reserved for education, food, and other purposes. Congress passed P.L. 108-25 (\"The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS,Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003\") in the 108th Congress, which authorizes 10% of HIV/AIDSfunds to be used for children orphaned or made vulnerable by the virus. In the 109th Congress, H.R. 1408 , \"Assistance for Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children in DevelopingCountries Act of 2005,\" passed the House and Senate on October 18, 2005, and October 25, 2005,respectively. Ultimately, the bill was enacted on November 8, 2005. The act, P.L. 109-95 ,established a monitoring and evaluation system to measure the effectiveness of related assistanceactivities; directed the appointment of a Special Advisor for Assistance to Orphans and VulnerableChildren within USAID; and required an annual report on project implementation. This reportexplores some of the challenges facing children affected by HIV/AIDS, outlines U.S. andinternational efforts to assist those children, and outlines some key issues that may be considered byCongress in the 109th session. This report will be updated."
