    "content": "In Paul v. Virginia (75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 168 (1868)), the Supreme Court ruled that \"[i]ssuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of [interstate] commerce.\" United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Ass'n. (322 U.S. 533 (1944)) held that the federal antitrust laws were applicable to an insurance association's interstate activities in restraint of trade. Although the 1944 Court did not specifically overrule its prior determination, the case was viewed as a reversal of 75 years of precedent and practice, and created significant apprehension about the continued viability of state insurance regulation and taxation of insurance premiums. Congress' response was the 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act. It prohibits application of the federal antitrust laws and similar provisions in the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act, as well as most other federal statutes, to the \"business of insurance\" to the extent that such business is regulated by State law\u2014except that the antitrust laws are applicable if it is determined that an insurance practice amounts to a boycott. Early McCarran-Ferguson decisions mostly favored insurance companies. After 1969, however, the exemption for the \"business of insurance\" was generally limited to activities surrounding insurance companies' relationships with their policyholders. In 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that McCarran case law prohibiting the indirect application of federal antitrust (or other) laws to the \"business of insurance\" would no longer control with respect to those areas over which Congress has unquestionable legislative authority (e.g., ERISA, civil rights, securities), notwithstanding insurance-company involvement. The issue of amending McCarran Ferguson so as to further limit the scope of the exemption for the \"business of insurance\" continued to receive attention in the 110th Congress, with the introduction of at least two bipartisan measures. S. 618 would not only have eliminated the antitrust exemption provided by McCarran-Ferguson, it would also have restored the FTC's authority to investigate the insurance industry. An identical bill, H.R. 1081, was introduced in the House. Both bills would have retained the exemption for the applicability of the FTC Act, \"as it relates to areas other than unfair competition.\" It is not known at this time whether the issue will be revisited in the 111th Congress. Even in the event the McCarran exemption were to be severely limited or totally eliminated, however, the state-action doctrine in antitrust law has the potential to mitigate the consequences of either. State action stands for the proposition that the federal antitrust laws do not apply to the states, nor to private individuals acting either under state order or authorization. To the extent that state regulation of insurance embodies \"clearly articulated\" state policy, and regulators \"actively supervise\" the activities of insurance companies, the industry's antitrust exemption could actually be broadened to include actions not clearly \"the business of insurance.\" (Those phrases have been firmly embedded in the state-action-doctrine jurisprudence in the antitrust law for more than 25 years.)
