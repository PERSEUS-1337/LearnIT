    "content": "The Everglades is a unique network of subtropical wetlands in South Florida that is approximately half of its historical size, due in part to degradation from federal water projects built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps). In 2000, Congress authorized a plan, termed the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), as a comprehensive framework for the restoration of the Everglades ecosystem in southern Florida. When originally authorized, it was estimated that CERP would cost a total of $8.2 billion and take approximately 30 years to complete. More recent estimates indicate that the plan will cost $16.4 billion and will take approximately 50 years to implement. At issue for Congress is oversight and implementation of this commitment. Under CERP, the federal government (through the Corps and various bureaus within the Department of the Interior) is required to fund half of the costs for restoration, with an array of state, tribal, and local agencies paying the other half. In addition to activities under CERP, a number of ongoing federal and state efforts that predate CERP (known collectively as \"non-CERP\" or \"Foundation\" activities) also factor into Everglades restoration. Although non-CERP efforts technically are not part of CERP, the two sets of activities are widely viewed as complementary. Since passage of CERP in 2000, the federal investment in Everglades restoration has increased. As of the end of FY2016, the federal government had provided in excess of $1.2 billion in funding for CERP, with the state providing matching funds for CERP projects, as well as advanced funding for land acquisition and construction for expected future CERP projects. Federal funding for non-CERP activities has also continued over this period. Together with CERP, all federal Everglades restoration efforts are estimated to have totaled in excess of $5 billion from FY1993 to FY2016. While estimates of nonfederal funding contributions to CERP vary depending on what methodology and assumptions are used, observers agree that to date, the state of Florida has spent more on Everglades restoration than has the federal government. Although overall progress has fallen short of initial timelines, progress has been made on a number of Everglades restoration projects. The majority of the land necessary for restoration projects under CERP has been acquired, and significant progress has been made on non-CERP activities (including improved water deliveries to Everglades National Park). Of the nine CERP projects that had been authorized by the end of 2016 (not including pilot projects), construction was ongoing or complete at eight projects and studies were completed or under way for a number of other projects. Despite this progress, some projects have seen setbacks in the form of schedule delays and cost escalations. Assuming that the plan does not change significantly and most of the 50 projects included in the original CERP plan are eventually required to complete the effort, many new authorizations and significant additional funding would be necessary. Reviewers of the restoration program have pointed out that at current rates of project authorization and funding, additional delays would be likely. Reductions to state funding and the enactment of new CERP project authorizations in 2014 and 2016 legislation have brought renewed attention to Everglades restoration. Restoration of the Everglades is one of the largest and most mature efforts of its kind; thus, debate and resolution of Everglades restoration issues has implications not only for South Florida but also for large-scale restoration initiatives elsewhere. This report provides an overview of the federal role in Everglades restoration. It discusses background, funding history, and major accomplishments and challenges to date in federal efforts to restore the Everglades."
