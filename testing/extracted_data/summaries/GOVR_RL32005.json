The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that thelegislation for H.R. 1 would increase direct (or mandatory) spending by $394.3 billionfrom FY2004 through FY2013. Prescription drug spending is estimated at $409.8 billion over the10-year period and Medicare Advantage spending at $14.2 billion.
