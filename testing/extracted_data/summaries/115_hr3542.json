    "content": "Hamas Human Shields Prevention Act This bill states that it is US policy to condemn Hamas's use of human shields and act against those engaging in or supporting the use of human shields. The President is urged to direct the US Permanent Representative to the United Nations (U. N.) to use US influence at the Security Council to secure support for a resolution: (1) imposing multilateral sanctions against Hamas's use of human shields. And (2) specifying steps to prevent, and consequences for, the use of U. N. employees as human shields or facilities that enable that use. The President shall prohibit property transactions and US entry with respect to: (1) each foreign person or entity that is a member of or acting on behalf of Hamas and that is responsible for or complicit in Hamas's unlawful attempt to use civilians, civilian property, or other protected persons to shield military objectives from lawful attack. And (2) each foreign person or entity and each agency or instrumentality of a foreign state that has significantly facilitated or attempted to facilitate such an act. The President may waive a sanction for 180 days with prior congressional certification that such waiver is in US national security interests."
