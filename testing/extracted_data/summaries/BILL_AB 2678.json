    "title": "AB 2678",
    "content": "Existing law establishes the Fair and Exposition Fund to, among other things, allocate moneys for the support of the network of California fairs. The balance of moneys in that fund, after appropriation by the Legislature for specified oversight and auditing costs, are continuously appropriated for capital outlay for specified fair projects. Existing sales and use laws impose taxes on retailers measured by the gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property sold at retail in this state, or on the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property purchased from a retailer for storage, use, or other consumption in this state measured by sales price, and requires that revenues, less refunds, derived from a specified rate of that tax be transferred to specified funds and then the balance to the General Fund. This bill would require a tax return filed for the purposes of the Sales and Use Tax Law to segregate the gross receipts of the seller and the sales price of the property on a form prescribed by the State Board of Equalization when the place of sale or use in this state is on or within the real property of a state-designated fair, as defined, which excludes any fair located in the County of Los Angeles, or any real property of a state-designated fair that is leased to another party. The bill would require, except as specified, that 30 of all revenues, less refunds and costs of administration, derived from those segregated sales and use tax amounts that would have been deposited into the General Fund instead be deposited into the Fair and Exposition Fund and continuously appropriated for allocation by the Secretary of Food and Agriculture for specified fair projects. projects and subject to certain conditions. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2022."
