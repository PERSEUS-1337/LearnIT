(2) does not engage in activities that undermine US security or foreign policy. (3) does not engage in gross violations of human rights or activities in support of international terrorism. And (4) is meeting specified enforcement conditions aimed at preventing tariff or quota avoidance, customs evasion, unlawful transshipment, or false information or false document use in order to obtain such preferential treatment.
