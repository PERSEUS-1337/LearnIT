    "content": "Three Higher Education Act (HEA) student financial aid programs\u2014the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) program, the Federal Work-Study (FWS) program, and the Federal Perkins Loan program\u2014collectively are referred to as the campus-based programs. The campus-based programs were reauthorized under the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA; P.L. 110-315), which amended and extended authorization for programs funded under the HEA. The campus-based programs' authorizations of appropriations, along with many other provisions under the HEA, were set to expire at the end of FY2014 and were automatically extended through FY2015 under Section 422 of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA). Congress provided appropriations for the FSEOG and FWS programs beyond FY2015 under a series of appropriations measures, most recently through March 23, 2018, under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-123). The Perkins Loan program was amended and extended through FY2017 under the Federal Perkins Loan Program Extension Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-105). The authority for institutions to make new Perkins Loans expired on September 30, 2017. Under the campus-based programs, federal funding is provided to institutions of higher education for the provision of need-based financial aid to students. Institutions participating in the programs are required to provide matching funds equal to approximately one-third of the federal funds they receive. The campus-based programs are unique among the need-based federal student aid programs in that the mix and amount of aid awarded to students are determined by each institution's financial aid administrator according to institution-specific award criteria (which must be consistent with federal program requirements), rather than according to nondiscretionary award criteria, such as those applicable for Pell Grants and Direct Subsidized Loans. Each program provides students with a distinct type of aid. The FSEOG program provides grant aid only to undergraduate students. The FWS program provides undergraduate, graduate, and professional students the opportunity for paid employment in a field related to their course of study or in community service. The Perkins Loan program provided low-interest loans with favorable terms and conditions to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. For FSEOG and FWS, funding is provided to institutions separately for each program according to formulas that take into account both the allocation institutions received in past years (their base guarantee) and their proportionate share of eligible students' need that is in excess of their base guarantee (their fair share increase). From these funds, institutions' financial aid administrators award aid to eligible students who have financial need. The Perkins Loan program operated in a similar manner. The programs are among the oldest of the federal postsecondary aid programs; however, they now operate amid a host of other aid programs and tax benefits, some of which are not need-based. At present, a relatively small proportion of all students receive campus-based financial aid. This report describes the FSEOG, FWS, and Federal Perkins Loan programs. It also presents historical information on appropriations provided for the programs and the federal student aid that has been made available to students through the programs."
