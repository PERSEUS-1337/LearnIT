    "content": "The FY2009 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies appropriations bill (THUD) provides funding for the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and five independent agencies related to those two departments. The Bush Administration requested net budgetary authority of $102.5 billion (after scorekeeping adjustments) for FY2009, a cut of $36 million (less than 1%) from the comparable FY2008 level. DOT would receive a net total of $63.5 billion, a cut of $1 billion from the comparable FY2008 level. HUD would receive $39.1 billion, an increase of 4% ($1.4 billion) over the comparable FY2008 level. However, the requested increase in net budget authority for HUD is largely attributable to a decline in the amount available to offset new funding in the HUD budget. The President's budget request would actually result in an overall decline in non-emergency appropriations for HUD's programs and activities of just over 1% from the FY2008 level. The House Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on THUD reportedly marked up a draft FY2009 THUD appropriations bill on June 20, 2008. The details of that draft have not been made public. The full committee has not yet marked up the bill, and it is not clear that it will do so. The Senate Committee on Appropriations marked up an FY2009 THUD bill, S. 3261, on July 10, 2008. The Senate committee recommended $109.4 billion, $6.6 billion more than the Administration requested. Congressional leaders have been quoted in press reports indicating that they will not try to enact most of the FY2009 appropriations bills, including the THUD bill, until sometime after the next Administration has taken office in 2009. In the meantime, they reportedly intend to provide FY2009 funding for most federal agencies, including those in the THUD bill, through one or more continuing resolutions. Among the THUD appropriation issues facing Congress is the impending deficit in the Highway Trust Fund. The portion of the Fund that provides money for federal highway programs has long been projected to have a $3 billion deficit by the end of FY2009; the portion that provides money for transit projects is projected to run a deficit in FY2011. The House passed separate legislation (H.R. 6532) to transfer $8 billion from the general fund to the Highway Trust Fund to prevent the FY2009 shortfall. This legislation was opposed by the Administration. However, on September 5, 2008, the Administration announced that revenues to the Fund had declined more than expected in recent months, resulting in the Fund facing a shortfall as early as October 2008. The Administration is now urging Congress to immediately pass the legislation transferring money to the Highway Trust Fund. This report will be updated."
