    "title": "A bill to implement the recommendations of the Federal Communications Commission report to the Congress regarding low-power FM service.",
    "content": "Local Community Radio Act of 2005 - Repeals provisions in the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001, that required the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to: (1) modify rules authorizing the operation of low-power FM radio stations to prescribe minimum distance separations for third-adjacent channels. (2) prohibit applicants who have engaged in the unlicensed operation of any station from obtaining a low-power FM license. And (3) conduct a program to test whether low-power FM radio stations will result in harmful interference to existing FM radio stations if minimum distance separations for third-adjacent channels are not required. Requires the FCC to modify its rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements between specified stations. Requires the FCC to retain rules that provide third-adjacent channel protection for full-power noncommercial FM stations that broadcast radio reading services via a subcarrier frequency from potential low-power FM station interference. Requires the FCC when licensing FM translator stations to ensure: (1) that licenses are available to both FM translator stations and low-power FM stations. And (2) that such decisions are made based on the needs of the local community."
