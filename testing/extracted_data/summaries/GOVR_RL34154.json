    "content": "The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171) authorized an array of agricultural, rural, and nutrition programs. Many provisions of the 2002 farm bill were scheduled to expire in 2007. If a new farm bill or year-long extension were not enacted before the 2008 harvest, permanent law would have taken effect. Under permanent law, eligible commodities would be supported at levels much higher than they are now, and many of the currently supported commodities might not be eligible (including soybeans and peanuts). Permanent law for the commodity programs is so radically different from current policy and inconsistent with today's farming, marketing, and trade agreements\u2014as well as costly to the federal government\u2014that Congress was unlikely to let it take effect. Lack of new legislation would have reduced or eliminated some conservation, domestic nutrition assistance, trade and foreign food aid, and rural development programs. Six temporary extensions continued the authority of most programs in the 2002 farm bill until May 23, 2008. A new farm bill was enacted on May 22, 2008 (P.L. 110-234), when the Senate joined the House in overriding the presidential veto of H.R. 2419. However, a clerical error omitted Title III, the trade and foreign aid title from the enrolled version sent to the President. To resolve the absence of Title III, another complete version of the farm bill (H.R. 6124) was passed, vetoed and overridden. The final enacted version of the 2008 farm bill is P.L. 110-246. Prior to enactment of the farm bill, programs that were not extended in the temporary extensions included the direct, counter-cyclical, and marketing loan programs for the 2008 crop year for the major crops (such as corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, and rice), peanut storage, community food projects authorized under the Food Stamp Act, the rural broadband program, value-added market development grants, and certain renewable energy programs. However, the dairy, sugar, and wool and mohair programs were extended. Most of the long-standing USDA conservation programs were permanently authorized and had a current appropriation. Other conservation programs that pay farmers to remove fragile crop land from production were authorized and received mandatory funding from the 2002 farm bill but awaited renewal. Two conservation programs that pay farmers for adopting resource stewardship practices (the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Conservation Security Program) were extended beyond FY2007 by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-171). USDA's domestic food assistance programs (for example, food stamps) generally were permanently authorized, and, in most cases, they were not affected by the possible expiration of the farm bill, since they received a full-year FY2008 appropriation. However, two major provisions of the law could have been affected: nutrition assistance grants to Puerto Rico and American Samoa and authority to reduce food stamp administrative payments to states. This report will not be updated."
