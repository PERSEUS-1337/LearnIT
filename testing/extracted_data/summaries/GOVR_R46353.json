    "content": "The legislative response to the global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has included the enactment of laws to provide authorities and supplemental funding to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the pandemic. This report focuses on supplemental FY2020 discretionary appropriations provided to programs and activities traditionally funded by the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (LHHS) appropriations bill. As of the date of this report, LHHS supplemental appropriations for COVID-19 response have been provided in four separate supplemental appropriations measures: Title III, Division A, of the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-123 ), enacted on March 6, 2020, provided approximately $6.4 billion in supplemental LHHS funds. Title V, Division A, of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA, P.L. 116-127 ), enacted on March 18, 2020, provided $1.25 billion in supplemental LHHS funds. Title VIII, Division B, of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act, P.L. 116-136 ), enacted on March 27, 2020, provided $172.1 billion in supplemental LHHS funds. Title I, Division B, of the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (PPPHCEA, P.L. 116-139 ), enacted on April 24, 2020, provided $100 billion in supplemental LHHS funds. In total, LHHS has received roughly $280 billion in supplemental discretionary appropriations from these COVID-19 response measures. These supplemental funds are in addition to roughly $195 billion in regular FY2020 LHHS discretionary appropriations provided in Division A of P.L. 116-94 , the FY2020 omnibus appropriations act containing full-year LHHS appropriations that was enacted on December 20, 2019. Unlike the annual discretionary appropriations, however, these additional funds were designated as an \"emergency requirement\" and thus were effectively exempted from otherwise applicable budget enforcement requirements (such as the statutory discretionary spending limits). Overall, the COVID-19 supplemental funds have increased FY2020 LHHS discretionary appropriations by approximately 143%. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) received funding in all four COVID-19 supplemental appropriations acts, whereas the Department of Labor (DOL), Department of Education (ED), and entities funded under the \"Related Agencies\" heading received funding in the third supplemental only. In total, HHS received $248 billion, or 89% of all COVID-19 LHHS supplemental appropriations. ED received the second-largest share at $31 billion, or 11%. DOL and the Related Agencies received approximately 0.1% and 0.2% of the LHHS COVID-19 supplemental funds, respectively."
