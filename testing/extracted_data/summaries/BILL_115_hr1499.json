    "content": "Remedies for Refusal of Repatriation Act This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish procedures for determining whether a foreign government systematically and unreasonably refuses or delays the repatriation of its nationals who: (1) have been ordered removed from the United States. And (2) have been convicted of a felony or a crime of violence or are a threat to national security or public safety. Upon determining that a country does refuse or delay repatriation of its nationals, DHS shall notify the Department of State and the two departments shall meet with the country's representatives and notify them that the United States may deny visas to their nationals. If the country continues to refuse or delay the repatriation of its nationals, the State Department shall discontinue the issuance of visas, unless DHS determines that such discontinuance is not in US interests. DHS and the State Department shall list such countries on their websites."
