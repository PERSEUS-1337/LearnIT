    "title": "To state the sense of Congress on the production, possession, transfer, and use of antipersonnel landmines, to place a moratorium on United States production of antipersonnel landmines, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the President should seek an international agreement prohibiting the production, possession, transfer, and use of antipersonnel landmines. And (2) a moratorium by the United States on the purchase and production of antipersonnel landmines would encourage other nations to adopt similar measures. Prohibits the US Government from purchasing or producing such landmines effective 90 days after this Act's enactment date. Continues such moratorium for one year from this Act's enactment date. Urges the President to encourage other nations which are major producers of such landmines to adopt similar moratoria. Authorizes the President to extend the moratorium if other nations have adopted similar moratoria. Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Defense for: (1) humanitarian activities relating to the clearing and disarming of landmines and the protection of civilians from landmines. And (2) contributions to United Nations funds and nongovernmental organizations to support such activities. Directs the Administrator of the Agency for International Development and the Secretary of State to submit to the Congress a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the social, economic, and environmental costs and effects of antipersonnel landmines. Requires the Secretary of Defense to report to the Congress on the total number of members of the armed forces killed or wounded by antipersonnel landmines during World War II, the Korean conflict, the Vietnam era, and the Persian Gulf War."
