    "content": "Maximize Offshore Resource Exploration Act of 2008, or the MORE Act of 2008 - Declares without force or effect all federal prohibitions against the expenditure of appropriated funds to conduct natural gas leasing and pre-leasing activities for any area of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Revokes all withdrawals of federal submerged lands from leasing for oil and natural gas exploration and production. Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from granting an oil or natural gas lease for any OCS located within 25 miles of a state coastline unless the state has enacted a law approving the issuance of such leases by the Secretary. Sets forth an allocation schedule for a 75 state share of revenues derived from US royalties under qualified oil and gas leases on submerged lands located within the seaward boundaries of a state. Extends the jurisdiction of state civil and criminal law, as appropriate, to the Alaska, Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, and Atlantic OCS Region State Adjacent Zones and OCS Planning Areas."
