    "title": "AB 1794",
    "content": "Existing law, the Municipal Water District Law of 1911, provides for the formation of municipal water districts and grants to those districts\u2019 specified powers. Existing law permits a district to acquire, control, distribute, store, spread, sink, treat, purify, recycle, recapture, and salvage any water for the beneficial use of the district, its inhabitants, or the owners of rights to water in the district. Existing law requires the board of directors of a district to consist of 5 members and each director to be a resident of the division from which the director is elected. This bill would require the board of directors of the Central Basin Municipal Water District to be composed of 8 directors until the directors elected at the November 8, 2022, election take office, when the board would be composed of 7 directors, as prescribed. By imposing new duties on the district, this bill would create a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions. This bill would make its operation contingent on the enactment of SB 953 of the 2015\u201316 Regular Session."
