And (3) grants to enable institutions of higher education to establish, operate, or improve programs in foreign languages, area studies, and other international fields in which minority students, educators, and Government employees are deficient in learning. Requires a recipient of any fellowship, or scholarship that provides assistance for periods that aggregate 12 months or more, to maintain satisfactory academic progress and to work for the Federal Government or in the field of education in the area of study for which the scholarship or fellowship was awarded for a period specified by the Secretary.
