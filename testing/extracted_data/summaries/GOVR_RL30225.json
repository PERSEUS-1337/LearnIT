    "content": "Particularly since--and to some extent despite--the Tiananmen Square incident of June 4, 1989, the U.S. Congress has considered two diametrically opposedtypes of action regarding China's nondiscriminatory, or most-favored-nation (MFN; normal-trade-relations) tariffstatus in trade with the United States. One hasbeen its total withdrawal, the other--of more recent origin--its extension on a permanent basis. After having beensuspended in 1951, China's MFN tariff statuswith the United States was restored in 1980 conditionally under Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974, includingcompliance with the Jackson-Vanikfreedom-of-emigration amendment, which must be renewed annually, and the existence in force of a bilateral tradeagreement between the two countries. Thisstatus would be either terminated or changed into a permanent one. China's loss of MFN tariff status would result principally in the imposition of substantially higher U.S. customs duties on--and in higher, often prohibitive, costsof--over 95% of U.S. imports from China ($99,580.5 million total in 2000) and a likely cutback in such imports aswell as possible retaliatory reduction by Chinaof its imports from the United States. A significant economic disadvantage might result for Hong Kong and Macau,which, despite their political reunificationwith China, remain separate economic entities with permanent U.S. MFN status. Sundry legislation introduced in earlier Congresses to withdraw or severely restrict China's MFN status failed to be enacted, in two instances for failure tooverride the President's veto. In the 105th Congress, legislation was introduced, but not passed, to grant permanentMFN status to China outright or upon itsaccession to the World Trade Organization. Some of the permanent-MFN bills would have placed additionalconditions or restrictions on the grant of the MFNstatus. Legislation in the 106th Congress reflected China's prospective accession to the WTO. On one hand, it prohibited U.S. support of China's admission to the WTOwithout Congress's legislative approval and, moreover, in two instances required the United States to withdraw fromthe WTO if China was admitted to it withoutthe U.S. support. On the other hand, like in prior years, Congress failed to pass legislation disapproving thePresident's mid-year renewals of China'sJackson-Vanik waiver and, moreover, enacted legislation (Title I, P.L. 106-286 ) approving permanentnondiscriminatory status for China upon its accession to theWTO. On January 30, 1998, the President extended the trade agreement with China for 3 years, and on June 1, 2001, renewed for one year China's Jackson-Vanik waiverand, thereby, its temporary nondiscriminatory status. Legislative action to disapprove the waiver renewal wasdefeated in the House."
