    "content": "Beginning in 1986, Congress required the President to certify annually, subject to congressional review, that drug producing or drug transit countries hadcooperated fully with the United States in drug control efforts to avoid a series of aid and trade sanctions. Mexicohas been fully certified each year, but Congressclosely monitored these certification decisions and submitted resolutions of disapproval in some years. In 1987 and 1988, Congress took some initial steps on resolutions to disapprove the certification of Mexico, and, in 1989 and 1996, it passed some drug-relatedrestrictions on Mexico. In 1997, congressional efforts to overturn the President's certification of Mexico advancedthe furthest when both houses passed separateresolutions of disapproval, and President Clinton provided additional reports on Mexican and U.S. efforts inspecified areas in compliance with the Senate-passedversion. In 1998, resolutions of disapproval were introduced in both houses, but S.J.Res. 42 was defeatedby a vote of 45 to 54 in the Senate, and nofloor action was taken in the House. In 1999, resolutions of disapproval were introduced in the House, but no actionwas taken, and no resolutions of disapprovalwere introduced in the Senate. In 2000, despite some congressional criticism, no resolutions of disapproval were introduced in either house to overturn the presidential certification of Mexico. Following the mid-year election of opposition candidate Vicente Fox as President of Mexico, measures wereintroduced but not passed to exempt Mexico fromthe drug certification requirements in FY2001. In 2001, no resolutions of disapproval were introduced in either house, and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported out two measures ( S. 219 and S. 1401 ) that would have modified the certification requirements for three years. By the end of theyear, the only measure that passed wasthe Foreign Operations Appropriations for FY2002 ( H.R. 2506 / P.L. 107-115 ) that waived the drugcertification requirements for FY2002 only, butrequired the President, with some waiver authority, to designate and withhold assistance from the worst offendingcountries that had failed demonstrably to adhereto international counter-narcotics agreements. In 2002, both houses passed the Foreign Relations Authorization for FY2003 ( H.R. 1646 / P.L. 107-228 ) that permanently modified the drugcertification requirements. Section 706 requires the President, with some waiver authority, to designate andwithhold assistance from the worst offendingcountries that have \"failed demonstrably\" to make substantial counter-narcotics efforts. At the same time, it permitsthe President to use his discretion to withholdassistance and apply previous sanctions against countries that are failing to cooperate fully with the United Statesin counter-narcotics efforts whenever hedetermines that such actions would be helpful."
