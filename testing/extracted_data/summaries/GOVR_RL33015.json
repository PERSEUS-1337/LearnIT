    "content": "On June 29, 2004, the United States and Mexico signed a Social Security totalizationagreement, the effects of which depend on the yet to be disclosed language of the agreement. Atotalization agreement coordinates the payment of Social Security taxes and benefits for workers whodivide their careers between two countries. The agreement has not been transmitted to Congress forreview, which is required under law before the agreement can go into effect. This report does notattempt to estimate the potential cost of a totalization agreement with Mexico, or reach a conclusionon the effects of such an agreement on U.S. workers and employers. Instead this report explores oneof the issues concerning such an agreement. Using different socio-economic characteristics, thereport compares persons born in Mexico and living in the United States (both naturalized U.S.citizens and noncitizens) with persons born in the current totalization countries and living in theUnited States. The Social Security program provides monthly cash benefits to qualified retired and disabledworkers, their dependents, and survivors of deceased workers. Generally, a worker must have 10years of Social Security-covered employment to be eligible for retirement benefits (less time isrequired for disability and survivor benefits). Most jobs in the United States are covered underSocial Security. Noncitizens (aliens) who work in Social Security-covered employment must paySocial Security payroll taxes, including those who are in the United States working temporarily andthose who may be working in the United States without authorization. There are some exceptions. Generally, the work of aliens who are citizens of a country with which the United States has a\"totalization agreement\" is not covered by Social Security if they work in the United States for lessthan five years. In addition, by statute, the work of aliens under certain visa categories is not coveredby Social Security. Currently, since Mexico meets the definition of a \"social insurance country,\" aMexican worker may receive U.S. Social Security benefits outside the United States. Familymembers of the Mexican worker must have lived in the United States for at least five years to receivebenefits outside the United States, but typically under a totalization agreement this requirement iswaived. This report concludes that the Mexican population in the United States has a differentsocio-economic profile than both U.S. citizens and persons (both naturalized U.S. citizens andnoncitizens) from current totalization countries. Workers from totalization countries tend to havemore education and higher earnings than workers born in the United States or in Mexico. Noncitizens from Mexico tend to be younger and have higher labor force participation rates thannaturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico, and other U.S. citizens. In addition, Mexican noncitizensand naturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico in the U.S. labor force tend to have more dependents intheir U.S. households. Because Mexican workers may have lower lifetime earnings, they mayreceive a higher replacement rate, relative to the payroll taxes they pay, than workers with higherlifetime earnings, such as U.S. citizens and noncitizens from the totalization countries. This reportwill not be updated."
