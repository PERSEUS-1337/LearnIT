    "title": "SB 760",
    "content": "The Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, approved by the voters as Proposition 1 at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election, authorizes the issuance of general obligation bonds in the amount of $7,545,000,000 to finance a water quality, supply, and infrastructure improvement program. Proposition 1 makes available $100,000,000 of the bond proceeds, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for projects to protect and enhance an urban creek and its tributaries that meets certain requirements. This bill would require a public agency receiving an appropriation from the $100,000,000 to give priority to projects that are located in, or directly adjacent to, a disadvantaged community within a distressed watershed and that may also provide greenspace or other venues for physical activities. Existing law establishes the Strategic Growth Council consisting of specified members and requires the council to, among other things, develop and administer the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through projects that implement land use, housing, transportation, and agricultural land preservation practices to support infill and compact development and that support other related and coordinated public policy objectives. This bill would require the council to develop and implement the Disadvantaged Community Enhancement Program to award grants to disadvantaged communities, as defined, to facilitate projects for community enhancement improvements that provide to eligible applicants multiple environmental benefits."
