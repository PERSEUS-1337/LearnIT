    "content": "Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination against an otherwise qualified individual with a disability solely by reason of disability in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by an executive agency or the U.S. Postal Service. Section 504 was the first federal civil rights law generally prohibiting discrimination against individuals with disabilities. This report examines Section 504, recent amendments to the definition of disability, Section 504's regulations, and Supreme Court interpretations. Section 504's differences with the ADA, and its relationship to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), are also discussed."
