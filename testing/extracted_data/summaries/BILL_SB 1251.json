    "title": "SB 1251",
    "content": "Existing law requires a local agency, if it maintains an Internet Web site and is required to report specific financial information to the Controller, to post, in a conspicuous location on its Internet Web site, information on the annual compensation of its elected officials, officers, and employees. Existing law authorizes a local agency to meet this requirement by posting a link to the Controller\u2019s Government Compensation in California Internet Web site in a conspicuous location on its Internet Web site. This bill would establish the California Financial Transparency Act of 2016 and would require an entity of state government the Legislative Analyst to create and maintain a dedicated Internet Web page, page that is hyperlinked to the homepage of its the Internet Web site, site of the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office that lists specific state financial obligations. The Political Reform Act of 1974 and the Elections Code each require the Secretary of State to prepare a ballot pamphlet that contains specific information. This bill would require the Secretary of State to include in a ballot pamphlet a copy of all the information posted on a the dedicated Internet Web page, page that is hyperlinked to the homepage of the Internet Web site of an unspecified entity in state government, the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office pursuant to the California Financial Transparency Act of 2016. The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act\u2019s purposes with a 23 vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements. The act also provides that, notwithstanding this vote requirement, the Legislature may amend specified provisions to add to the ballot pamphlet information regarding candidates or other information. This bill, which would require additional information to be included in the ballot pamphlet, without making other changes to the act, would therefore require a majority vote."
