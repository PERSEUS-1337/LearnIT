    "title": "AB 1626",
    "content": "Existing law with respect to claims against public entities authorizes the \u201cboard,\u201d as defined, to assess a surcharge to the state entity against which an approved claim was filed in an amount not to exceed 15 of the claim. Existing law requires the surcharge to be deposited into the General Fund and provides that it may be appropriated in support of the board in the annual Budget Act. This bill would specify that the Department of General Services may assess this surcharge, would require the surcharge to be deposited into the Service Revolving Fund, and would specify that the surcharge may be appropriated to the department in the annual Budget Act. Existing law defines a human trafficking caseworker to mean a human trafficking caseworker as defined by the Evidence Code. This bill would expand that definition to include a human trafficking caseworker who is employed by a homeless services provider that serves homeless children or youth and has completed a minimum of 8 hours of training focused on victims of human trafficking from the Runaway and Homeless Youth Training and Technical Assistance Center. Existing law authorizes the State Public Works Board to issue up to $270,000,000 in revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes to finance the acquisition, design, and construction of approved adult local criminal justice facilities, and authorizes $20,000,000 to be awarded to Napa County. This bill would require that $20,000,000 of the amount issued by the board in revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes be awarded to Napa County without the submission by it of any further adult local criminal justice facility proposal. The bill would also authorize those funds to be utilized in conjunction with a partial award made to Napa County pursuant to other specified provisions. This bill would appropriate $3,000,000 from the Gambling Control Fund to the Department of Justice for the purposes of addressing the backlog in investigations related to cardroom licensing. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill."
