    "content": "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes funding for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation(BOR), most of the Department of Energy (DOE), and a number of independent agencies. The BushAdministration requested $25.5 billion for these programs for FY2003 compared with $25.2 billionappropriated in FY2002. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a bill, H.R. 5431 , with $26.0billion on September 5, 2002. On July 24, 2002, the Senate Appropriations Committee had reportedout its own bill, S. 2784 , providing $26.3 billion in funding. However, neither of thesebills reached the floor. Before adjourning sine die, the 107th Congress passed H.J.Res. 124 ( P.L. 107-294 ), making continuing appropriations for FY2003 for Energy and Water, and otherprograms, through January 11, 2003. The 108th Congress extended temporary funding until February 20 ( H.J.Res. 1 , P.L. 108-2 , and H.J.Res. 18 , P.L. 108-5 ), and on January 23 the Senate passed an omnibusappropriations resolution ( H.J.Res. 2 ), including all 11 unpassed appropriations billsfor the rest of FY2003. After a House-Senate conference the omnibus measure passed both HousesFebruary 12 and was signed by the President February 20, 2003 ( P.L. 108-7 ). The final bill fundedEnergy and Water Development programs at $26.7 billion (less an across-the-board reduction of0.65%, approximately $173 million). Key issues involving Energy and Water Development appropriations programs included: Matching budget request amounts with ongoing Corps construction schedules (\"full capability funding\") and congressional priorities; Funding for major water/ecosystem restoration initiatives such as Florida Everglades and California \"Bay-Delta\"; Increased funding for DOE's civilian nuclear waste management program as the Department prepares a construction permit application for a waste repository under Nevada'sYucca Mountain; A proposed $1.1 billion Environmental Management Cleanup Reform account in DOE, focused on radioactive sites where environmental regulators would allow alternativecleanup methods; and DOE's \"Nuclear Power 2010\" initiative, to \"identify the technical, institutional and regulatory barriers to the deployment of new nuclear power plants by2010.\" Key Policy Staff Division abbreviations: RSI = Resources, Science, and Industry; FDT= Foreign Affairs, Defense,and Trade."
