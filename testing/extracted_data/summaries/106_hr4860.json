    "title": "North Korea Nonproliferation Act of 2000",
    "content": "Authorizes the President to reinstate any or all of specified restrictions on commerce with North Korea any time a proliferation report indicates credible information that North Korea transferred nuclear goods, services, or technology to an outside destination. Requires a detailed justification to Congress in any such instance where the President decides not to reinstate restrictions. Requires a minimum two-year reinstatement of such restrictions if there is credible information that North Korea took an action inconsistent with: (1) compliance with the September 12, 1999, commitment to suspend launches of long-range missiles, or with any international agreement limiting testing, deployment, or transfer to other countries of missiles or missile technology. Or (2) transferred any of specified nuclear goods, services, or technology to any country whose government has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism, or has tested any long-range missile incorporating goods or technology knowingly transferred to such government by North Korea. Declares that reinstatement requirements shall not apply if the President reports to the relevant congressional committees that there is substantial doubt that North Korea knowingly took such an action. Encourages the President to seek to negotiate a binding international agreement with North Korea that satisfies US concerns regarding the transfer by North Korea to other countries of missiles and missile technology. Authorizes the President, if North Korea enters into such an agreement, to: (1) waive specified sanctions under the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act of 1979. And (2) use certain funds to support the commercial launch in the United States or other countries of satellites for North Korea ."
