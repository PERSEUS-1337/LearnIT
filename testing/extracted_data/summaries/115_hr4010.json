    "content": "Congressional Subpoena Compliance and Enforcement Act of 2017 This bill amends the federal judicial code to establish certain rules that apply in a civil action by the Senate, House of Representatives, or a congressional committee or subcommittee against an individual who receives, but fails to comply with, a congressional subpoena. Specifically, the rules: allow the action to be filed in a US district court, require expedited disposition of the action and any appeals. And authorize court-imposed monetary penalties against the head of a government agency or component who willfully fails to comply with a congressional subpoena. Additionally, the bill amends the Revised Statutes of the United States to establish requirements for the recipient of a subpoena from a congressional committee or subcommittee, including: to appear and testify or produce records8212, books, papers, documents, data, or other objects8212, in a manner consistent with the subpoena. And to provide a privilege log containing certain information about records that are withheld, such as the type of record and the legal basis for withholding it."
