    "title": "SB 545",
    "content": "Under existing law, the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources in the Department of Conservation regulates the drilling, operation, maintenance, and abandonment of oil and gas wells in the state. Existing law requires the State Oil and Gas Supervisor to supervise the drilling, operation, maintenance, and abandonment of wells and the operation, maintenance, and removal or abandonment of tanks and facilities related to oil and gas production within an oil and gas field, so as to prevent damage to life, health, property, and natural resources, as provided. To permit owners and operators of wells to utilize all known methods and practices to increase the ultimate recovery of hydrocarbons. And to perform the supervisor\u2019s duties in a manner that encourages the wise development of oil and gas resources to best meet oil and gas needs in this state. This bill would no longer require the supervisor to perform his or her duties in that manner. The bill would instead require the supervisor to authorize supervise the exploration and production of hydrocarbons, including, among other things, the drilling, operation, maintenance, and abandonment of wells, and the use of enhanced oil recovery methods, as defined, and stimulation, as provided, and would authorize the supervisor to allow an owner or operator of a well to drill, operate, maintain, and abandon wells utilizing all known methods and practices to increase the ultimate recovery of hydrocarbons if the supervisor finds that those methods and practices are consistent with existing law. Existing law requires the operator of a well to file a written notice of intention to commence drilling with, and prohibits any drilling until approval is given by, the supervisor or district deputy. Under existing law, the notice is deemed approved if the supervisor or district deputy fails to respond to the notice in writing within 10 working days from receipt and is deemed canceled if operations have not commenced within one year of receipt. This bill would require an owner or operator of a well to file an application for approval to commence drilling, containing specified information, and would prohibit any drilling until written approval is given by the supervisor or the district deputy containing specified findings. The bill would authorize the supervisor, upon request, to grant a one-year extension if operations have not commenced within one year of the approval. The bill would require the applications and approvals by the supervisor or the district deputy to be posted on the division\u2019s Internet Web site within 10 working days. The Permit Streamlining Act requires any public agency that is the lead agency for a development project to approve or disapprove of a project, as specified. Under that act, if the lead agency or responsible agency is required to provide public notice of the development project or to hold a public hearing on the development project, or both, and the agency has not provided the public notice or held the hearing, or both, at least 60 days prior to the expirations of specified time periods, the applicant may file an action to compel the agency to provide the public notice or hold the hearing, or both, as specified. This bill would require the supervisor to perform his or her duties in conformance with that act. Existing law generally provides that well records filed by owners or operators with the supervisor are public records. However, existing law authorizes the supervisor, upon written request of an owner or operator, to maintain well records of exploratory wells, or other wells if the supervisor determines that there are extenuating circumstances, as confidential information. Under existing law, the confidential period for an onshore or offshore well is up to 2 or 5 years, respectively, from the cessation of drilling operations, as defined. Existing law authorizes the supervisor to extend the period of confidentiality of a well for 6 months upon written request documenting extenuating circumstances and requires that the total period of confidentiality, including all extensions, for onshore and offshore wells not exceed 4 or 7 years, respectively, from the cessation of drilling operations. This bill would limit the authorization to maintain the confidentiality of well records to exploratory wells and only if the owner or operator includes specified information in the written request. The bill would deem both the request for, and the granting of, confidential well status to be public records and would require that information to be accessible on the division\u2019s Internet Web site. The bill would require all well records of a confidential well, as defined, to be posted on the division\u2019s Internet Web site within 10 working days once the confidential well period has ended. The bill would require that the confidential period for an offshore well not exceed 3 years from the cessation of drilling operations and would authorize the supervisor to extend the period of confidentiality for confidential wells for only 6 months, upon receiving a written request documenting extenuating circumstances. Existing law requires an owner or operator of a well to keep a log, core record, and history of the drilling of wells to be provided to the district deputy within 60 days after the date of cessation of drilling, rework, or abandonment operations or the date of suspension of operation. Under existing law, a person who fails to comply with this and other requirements relating to the regulation of oil or gas operations is guilty of a misdemeanor. This bill would in addition require an owner or operator of a well to report specified information to the applicable regional water quality control board within 5 days of any loss of well and well casing integrity. Because a violation of this requirement would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Existing law recognizes the Conservation Committee of California Oil and Gas Producers and authorizes it or any other committee of oil producers to make voluntary recommendations to the supervisor regarding, among other things, maximum efficient rates of production, as defined, if specified conditions are satisfied. This bill would instead authorize any committee of oil producers to make recommendations to the supervisor regarding oil and gas exploration and production, as specified, and would require the division to post any recommendations received by the supervisor on the division\u2019s Internet Web site. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
