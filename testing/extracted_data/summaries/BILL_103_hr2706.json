Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the President should submit the 1980 Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed To Be Excessively Injurious or To Have Indiscriminate Effects to the Senate for ratification. And (2) the United States should negotiate a modification of the Landmine Protocol under United Nations auspices or another international agreement to limit the sale, transfer, manufacture, and use of landmines. Prohibits for three years after this Act's enactment: (1) sales, financing, transfers, and the issuance of licenses under the Arms Export Control Act with respect to antipersonnel landmines. And (2) assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 with respect to the provision of such landmines."
