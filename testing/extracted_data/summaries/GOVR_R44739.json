    "content": "Current U.S. farm program participants\u2014whether individuals or multi-person legal entities\u2014must meet specific eligibility requirements to receive benefits under certain farm programs. Some requirements are common across most programs while others are specific to individual programs. In addition, program participants are subject to annual payment limits that vary across different combinations of farm programs. Federal farm support programs, along with their current eligibility requirements and payment limits, are listed in Table 1. Since 1970, Congress has used varying policies to address the issue of who should be eligible for farm payments and how much should an individual recipient be permitted to receive in a single year. In recent years, congressional policy has focused on tracking payments through multi-person entities to individual recipients (referred to as direct attribution); ensuring that payments go to persons or entities actively engaged in farming; capping the amount of payments that a qualifying recipient may receive in any one year; and excluding farmers or farming entities with large average incomes from payment eligibility. Current eligibility requirements that affect multiple programs include identification of every participating person or legal entity\u2014both U.S. and non-U.S. citizens; the nature and extent of an individual's participation (i.e., actively engaged in farming criteria) including ownership interests in multi-person entities and personal time commitments (whether as labor or management); means testing\u2014persons with combined farm and nonfarm adjusted gross income (AGI) in excess of $900,000 are ineligible for most program benefits; and conservation compliance requirements. In general, if a foreign person or legal entity meets a program's eligibility requirements, then they are eligible to participate. One exception is the four permanent disaster assistance programs created under the 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) and the noninsured crop disaster assistance program (NAP) whereby non-resident aliens are excluded. The process of tracking payments to an individual through various levels of ownership in single or multi-person legal entities is critical for assessing an individual's cumulative payments against their annual payment limit. Current law requires direct attribution through four levels of ownership in multi-person legal entities. Current payment limits include a cumulative limit of $125,000 for all covered commodities under major Title I revenue support programs, with the exception of peanuts, which has its own $125,000 limit. The permanent disaster assistance programs also have a $125,000 per crop year limit, with some exceptions. Supporters of payment limits contend that large payments facilitate consolidation of farms into larger units, raise the price of land, and put smaller, family-sized farming operations and beginning farmers at a disadvantage. In addition, they argue that large payments undermine public support for farm subsidies and are costly. Critics of payment limits counter that all farms need support, especially when market prices decline, and that larger farms should not be penalized for the economies of size and efficiencies they have achieved. Further, critics argue that farm payments help U.S. agriculture compete in global markets, and that income testing is at odds with federal farm policies directed toward improving U.S. agriculture and its competitiveness. As part of the next farm bill debate, Congress may again address these concerns, as well as the following questions: How does policy design of payment limits relate to their distributional impact on crops, regions, and farm size? Is there an optimal aggregation of payment limits across commodities or programs? Do unlimited benefits under the marketing assistance loan program's forfeiture or commodity certificate exchanges reduce the effectiveness of overall payment limits?"
