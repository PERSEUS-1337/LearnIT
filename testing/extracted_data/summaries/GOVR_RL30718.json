    "content": "While largely comprised of Medicare provisions, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIPBenefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 ( H.R. 5661 ), a compromiseagreement between House and Senate committees and the leadership, includes a number of importantchanges to Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). It also includesmajor provisions amending other programs. The provisions of H.R. 5661 areincorporated, by reference into H.R. 4577 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2001. H.R. 4577 was passed by the House and Senate on December 15, 2000 and was signedinto law on December 21 ( P.L. 106-554 ). Among the major Medicaid modifications are several provisions affecting disproportionateshare hospital (DSH) payments provided to hospitals that treat a disproportionate share of uninsuredand Medicaid enrollees. The agreement increases the disproportionate share hospital allotments forstates. It also extends a special DSH payment rule for public hospitals in California to qualifyingfacilities in all states, and provides additional funds to certain public hospitals not receiving DSHpayments. In addition to these DSH provisions, the bill replaces cost-based reimbursement with aprospective payment system for Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural HealthCenters (RHCs). The agreement also modifies proposed rules governing upper payment limits oninpatient and outpatient services provided by certain types of facilities, and requires that the finalregulations be issued by the end of 2000. One major SCHIP provision extends the availability of unused funds from FY1998 andFY1999 and redistributes these unused funds among both those states that spend and those that donot spend their full original allotments for these years. Current law requires that these unused fundsbe distributed only to those states that spend their allotments. Among other major provisions, the agreement requires that outreach efforts be implementedto identify individuals who may be eligible for Medicaid payment of Medicare cost-sharing and tonotify these persons of the availability of such assistance. It increases the authorization of annualappropriations for the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant under Title V. In addition,the bill extends for 1 year, to FY2003, the authority for grants to be made for both the SpecialDiabetes Program for Type I Diabetes and the Special Diabetes Programs for Indians and increasestotal funding for FY2001 through FY2003.
