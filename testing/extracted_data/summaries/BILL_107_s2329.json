    "content": "Ship, Seafarer, and Container Security Act - Requires certain vessels to be equipped with an automatic identification system when operating in US navigable waters. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to initiate a rulemaking to implement such requirement. Urges the Secretary to negotiate an international agreement that: (1) provides for a uniform, comprehensive, international system of identification for seafarers that will enable the United States and other countries to establish the identity of any seafarer aboard a vessel within the jurisdiction, including the territorial waters, of the United States or such other country. (2) provides greater transparency with respect to the registration and ownership of vessels entering or operating in US territorial waters. And (3) establishes marine container integrity and anti-tampering standards for marine containers. Requires the Secretary to submit draft legislation to specified congressional committees if negotiations do not result in an agreement or the amendment process fails within a specified period after enactment of this Act. Directs the Commandant of the Coast Guard to establish: (1) a risk-based system for use in evaluating the potential threat to the national security of the United States of vessels entering US territorial waters. And (2) a system of security zones for US ports, territorial waters, and waterways."
