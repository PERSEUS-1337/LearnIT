    "content": "Domestic Pet Turtle Market Access Act of 2007 - Prohibits the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from restricting the sale by a turtle farmer or other commercial retail seller of a turtle that is less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter as a pet if: (1) the turtle is raised, shipped, and sold using methods proven to keep the turtle free of salmonella, using salmonella safety standards comparable to standards for other animals allowed for sale as pets or animal products allowed for sale as food products. (2) the FDA has approved a plan submitted by the turtle farmer or seller relating to compliance with this Act. And (3) the farmer or seller makes certain disclosures to the buyer. Sets forth required disclosures, which include: (1) information regarding the dangers that could result if the turtle is not properly handled and safely maintained, the proper handling of the turtle, and the proven methods of treatment that keep the turtle safe from salmonella. (2) a detailed explanation of how to properly treat the turtle to keep it safe from salmonella. And (3) a statement that buyers of pet turtles should not abandon the turtle or abandon it outside, but should instead return them to a commercial retail pet seller or other organization that would accept turtles no longer wanted as pets. Requires the turtle farmer or seller to submit a plan to the FDA that includes use of non-antibiotic compounds that suppress or eliminate the presence of salmonella in turtle hatchlings. Directs the FDA to accept or reject such a plan within 30 days."
