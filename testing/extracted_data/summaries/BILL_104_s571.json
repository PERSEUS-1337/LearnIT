    "content": "Amends the Uniform Code of Military Justice to deny a member of the armed forces sentenced by a court-martial to confinement and a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge or dismissal entitlement to military pay and allowances for any period after such sentence. Restores such entitlement if the sentence is disapproved or set aside. Authorizes the Secretary of the executive department concerned to pay transitional compensation to any spouse, dependent child, or former spouse of a member during any period in which the member's entitlement to pay and allowances is terminated under this Act. Allows such Secretary to pay emergency transitional assistance to a person for up to 45 days while the person's application for transitional compensation is pending approval."
