    "content": "Partnering to Detect and Defeat Tunnels Act This bill expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) it is in the best interests of the United States to develop technology to detect and counter tunnels, and the best way to do this is to partner with other affected countries. And (2) Israel is facing serious threats posed by tunnels and should be the first US partner in addressing this challenge. The Secretary of Defense: (1) shall seek to enter into an agreement with Israel to partner in developing and deploying technologies to detect and counter tunnels, (2) may seek to enter into similar agreements with US allies, and (3) shall report to Congress annually through 2020."
