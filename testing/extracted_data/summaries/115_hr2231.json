Coordinate sub-cabinet level political discussions on contingency responses to such violations. Facilitate technical discussions among the Departments of State, Defense (DOD), Energy, and the Treasury, the Intelligence Community, and their counterparts in countries in the region on technical aspects of North Korea's nuclear program and accompanying US sanctions. Coordinate information sharing among the intelligence services of the participating countries to identify immediate threats. And create guidelines for coordinating multilateral direct action against shared threats. The bill declares that it is US policy: (1) to continue to maintain robust and multifaceted diplomatic engagement in the region, to include promoting US values and economic interests and a strong military posture. And (2) that diplomacy, development, and defense should be used to enhance US national security, promote US interests, reassure US allies, deter aggression, and respond swiftly to crises. DOD may conduct routine and enhanced ports of call with key allies in the region."
