    "title": "SB 587",
    "content": "The California Constitution generally limits ad valorem taxes on real property to 1 of the full cash value, as defined, of that property, and provides that the full cash value base may be adjusted each year by an inflationary rate not to exceed 2 for any given year. Existing property tax law implementing this constitutional authority provides that the taxable value of real property is the lesser of its base year value compounded annually by the inflation factor not to exceed 2, as provided, or its full cash value. Existing property tax law also provides that the taxable value of a manufactured home is the lesser of its base year value compounded annually by an inflation factor not to exceed 2 or its full cash value. This bill would provide that the inflation factor shall not apply to the principal place of residence residence, as specified, of a \u201cqualified taxpayer,\u201d defined by the bill to mean a person who owns a dwelling as his or her principal place of residence, or a person who owns a manufactured home as his or her principal place of residence, who is 65 years of age or older on the lien date who meets specified requirements. By changing the manner in which local tax officials calculate the taxable value of real property owned by senior citizens, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires the Legislature to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation. This bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions. This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."
