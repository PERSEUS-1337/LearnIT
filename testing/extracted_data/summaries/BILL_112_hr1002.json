    "content": "Wireless Tax Fairness Act of 2011 - Prohibits states or local governments from imposing any new discriminatory tax on mobile services, mobile service providers, or mobile service property for five years after the enactment of this Act. Defines new discriminatory tax as a tax imposed on mobile services, providers, or property that is not generally imposed on, or that is generally imposed at a lower rate on, other types of services, providers, or property, unless such tax was imposed and actually enforced prior to the enactment of this Act. Amends the federal judicial code to grant jurisdiction to federal district courts to grant injunctive and other appropriate relief to prevent, restrain, or terminate any acts in violation of this Act. Requires the Comptroller General to conduct a study, throughout the five-year moratorium imposed by this Act, to determine how, and the extent to which, taxes on mobile services, providers, or property impact the costs consumers pay for mobile services and the extent to which such moratorium has any impact on the costs consumers pay for mobile services."
