    "content": "Executive permission in the form of a Presidential Permit has long been required for the construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of certain facilities that cross the United States borders with Canada and Mexico. The constitutional basis for the President's cross-border permitting authority has been addressed by the courts, but questions remain about the manner in which this authority is exercised among the agencies to which it has been delegated. In particular, some Members of Congress and affected stakeholders seek greater clarity about how Presidential Permit applications are reviewed for various kinds of cross-border energy projects. Agency Authorities and Decisionmaking Congress has shown particular interest in the Presidential Permit review processes for cross-border energy infrastructure as implemented by The Department of State for pipelines that transport petroleum, petroleum products, and other hazardous liquids; The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for natural gas pipelines; and The Department of Energy (DOE) for electricity transmission lines. The State Department makes its permitting decisions primarily in accordance with directives in Executive Order 11423 (E.O.), as amended by E.O. 13337. FERC and DOE make permitting decisions in accordance with E.O. 10485, as amended by E.O. 12038. Broadly speaking, each executive order requires the respective agency to gather necessary project-specific information from the applicant; seek input from specific outside federal agencies; and decide whether to seek input from additional local, state, tribal, or federal agencies or from members of the public. Under the applicable executive order, each agency is required to issue a Presidential Permit if, after evaluating all relevant project information, the agency determines that the project would \"serve the national interest\" (pursuant to E.O. 13337) or be \"consistent with the public interest\" (pursuant to E.O. 10485). For the most part, agencies gather, evaluate, and consider project-related information within the framework of conducting an environmental review. Such reviews are generally conducted in accordance with each agency's process for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). In documenting compliance with NEPA, each agency evaluates the direct and indirect effects, including any cumulative impacts, of issuing the permit. To do so, each agency generally looks at the effect of constructing the entire project, not just the portions that would cross the border (i.e., the action for which the Presidential Permit is required). Historically, evaluating impacts of the entire project would not necessarily involve a complex or particularly time-consuming review. With few exceptions, past applications for Presidential Permits have been for pipelines or transmission lines that extend a relatively short distance into a U.S. border state. Recently, however, several pipeline projects\u2014Enbridge Energy's Alberta Clipper and TransCanada's Keystone and Keystone XL pipeline\u2014have involved projects that are hundreds of miles long and cross multiple states. It was the larger scope of such projects that, in part, resulted in increased national attention to the most recent proposal, the Keystone XL pipeline. In 2015, the State Department under President Obama denied TransCanada's application for a Presidential Permit for the project, finding that it did not serve the national interest. However, a new permit application was approved on March 23, 2017, when the State Department, under the Trump Administration, found that the project did serve the national interest. Issues for Congress From 2011 through 2015, as the State Department considered permit applications for the Keystone XL pipeline project, Congress proposed a number of bills intended to affect the State Department's decisionmaking process. Although a permit has been issued for that project, Congress may again consider legislative options to expedite agency decisions on future permit applications. Congress may choose to address issues that arose during the Keystone XL permitting process. For example, during the review, some stakeholders questioned the scope of the NEPA review\u2014some were concerned that it was too broad, others that it was too narrow. Some also argued there was uncertainty over criteria the State Department used to determine whether the project would serve the national interest. Congress could potentially clarify these issues through legislation aimed at defining federal agency roles in authorizing cross-border projects."
