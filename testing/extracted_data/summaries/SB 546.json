    "title": "An act to amend Section 1374.21 of, and to add Section 1385.045 to, the Health and Safety Code, and to amend Section 10199.1 of, and to add Section 10181.45 to, the Insurance Code, relating to health care coverage.",
    "content": "Existing law, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), requires the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a process for the annual review of unreasonable increases in premiums for health insurance coverage in which health insurance issuers submit to the secretary and the relevant state a justification for an unreasonable premium increase prior to implementation of the increase. The PPACA imposes an excise tax on a provider of applicable employer-sponsored health care coverage, if the aggregate cost of that coverage provided to an employee exceeds a specified dollar limit. Existing state law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law also provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires a health care service plan or health insurer in the individual, small group, or large group markets to file rate information with the Department of Managed Health Care or the Department of Insurance. For large group plan contracts and policies, existing law requires a plan or insurer to file rate information with the respective department at least 60 days prior to implementing an unreasonable rate increase, as defined in PPACA. Existing law requires the plan or insurer to also disclose specified aggregate data with that rate filing. Existing law authorizes the respective department to review those filings, to report to the Legislature at least quarterly on all unreasonable rate filings, and to post on its Internet Web site a decision that an unreasonable rate increase is not justified or that a rate filing contains inaccurate information. Existing law requires prior notice, as specified, of changes to premium rates or coverage in order for those changes to be effective. This bill would add to the existing rate information requirement to further require large group health care service plans and health insurers to file with the respective department the weighted average rate increase for all large group benefit designs during the 12-month period ending January 1 of the following calendar year. The bill would require the notice of changes to premium rates or coverage for large group health plans and insurance policies to provide additional information regarding whether the rate change is greater than average rate increases approved by the California Health Benefit Exchange or by the Board of Administration of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, or would be subject to the excise tax described above. The bill would require the plan or insurer to file additional aggregate rate information with the respective department on or before October 1, 2016, and annually thereafter. The bill would require the respective department to conduct a public meeting regarding large group rate changes. The bill would require these meetings to occur annually after the respective department has reviewed the large group rate information required to be submitted annually by the plan or insurer, as specified. The bill would authorize a health care service plan or health insurer that exclusively contracts with no more than 2 medical groups to provide or arrange for professional medical services for enrollees or insureds to meet this requirement by disclosing its actual trend experience for the prior year using benefit categories that are the same or similar to those used by other plans or health insurers. Because a willful violation of the bill\u2019s requirements by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."
