    "content": "Freedom to Travel Act of 1995 - Prohibits the President from restricting US citizens or legal residents from traveling abroad, except to countries with which the United States is at war, where armed hostilities are in progress, or where there is imminent danger to the public health or physical safety of US travelers. Revises the areas which the President is expressly denied authority to regulate or prohibit under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Adds to such areas specifically excluded from Presidential regulatory authority: (1) normal banking transactions incident to specified travel activities, including the issuance, clearing, processing, or payment of checks, drafts, travelers checks, credit or debit card instruments, or similar instruments. And (2) financial or other transactions, or travel, incident to activities of scholars, educational or academic activities, exchanges, cultural activities, and public exhibitions or performances by the nationals of one country in another country, with exceptions. Adds similar provisions restricting presidential authority to regulate or prohibit transactions incident to travel by US citizens or residents under the Trading With the Enemy Act. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to state the Presidential authority under such Act does not include authority to regulate activities which may not be regulated under specified provisions of the Trading With the Enemy Act."
