    "title": "An act to add Part 1.87 (commencing with Section 34191.30) to Division 24 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to local government.",
    "content": "Existing law requires, from February 1, 2012, to July 1, 2012, inclusive, and for each fiscal year thereafter, the county auditor-controller in each county to allocate property tax revenues in the county\u2019s Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund, established to receive revenues equivalent to those that would have been allocated to former redevelopment agencies had those agencies not been dissolved, towards the payment of enforceable obligations and among entities that include, among others, a city, county, or city and county. This bill would authorize a city or county to reject its allocations of property tax revenues that it would otherwise receive pursuant to specified statutory provisions governing the dissolution of redevelopment agencies. The bill would except from this authorization a city, county, or city and county that became the successor agency to the redevelopment agency and did not receive a finding of completion from the Department of Finance, as specified, and any designated local authority of a redevelopment agency, formed as specified, that did not receive the finding of completion from the Department of Finance. The bill would direct those rejected distributions of property tax revenues to an affordable housing special beneficiary district, established as a temporary and distinct local governmental entity for the express purposes of receiving rejected distributions of property tax revenues and providing financing assistance to promote affordable housing within its boundaries. The bill would require a beneficiary district to be governed by a 5-member board and comply with specified open meeting and public record laws. The bill would automatically require a beneficiary district to cease to exist on a specifically calculated date and prohibit a beneficiary district from undertaking any obligation that requires its action past that date. The bill would transfer any funds and public records of a beneficiary district remaining after the date the beneficiary district ceases to exist to the city or county that rejected its distributions of property tax revenues that were thereafter directed to that beneficiary district, as specified."
