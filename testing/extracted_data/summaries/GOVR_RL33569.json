    "content": "The sunset concept provides for programs and agencies to terminate automatically on apredetermined schedule, following a systematic evaluation of past performance, unless explicitlyrenewed by law. In each Congress since the 105th, bills to create a federal sunset commissionmodeled on the sunset commission in Texas have been introduced by Representative Kevin Brady,including H.R. 3282 in the 109th Congress. President Bush supports creation of afederal sunset commission. In May 2006 the House leadership announced plans to bring sunset legislation quickly to theHouse floor, along with other budget process reforms favored by the Republican Study Committee,in return for the group's backing of the FY2007 budget resolution. In the effort to craft a consensusbill, attention came to focus on H.R. 3282 , and on H.R. 2470 , sponsoredby Representative Todd Tiahrt, which would create a \"Commission on the Accountability andReview of Federal Agencies (CARFA),\" modeled on the Base Realignment and Closure Commission(BRAC) approach. On July 14, 2006, Representative Tiahrt introduced a revised version of H.R. 2470 as H.R. 5766 , the Government Efficiency Act, to provide for the establishmentof Federal Review Commissions (FRCs) which would apparently address concerns similar to thoseenvisaged for the sunset commission in H.R. 3282 . Although H.R. 5766 isoften referred to as a sunset bill, this is technically inaccurate, since it contains no action-forcingmechanism. Under H.R. 3282, an agency would be abolished within one year of theCommission's review, unless the agency received statutory extension. If Congress passed areauthorization bill, the measure would then go to the President to be signed into law. If thePresident instead vetoed the bill, a two-thirds majority in both chambers would be necessary tooverride the veto and extend the life of the program or agency. On July 20, 2006, the Committee on Government Reform voted to report H.R. 3282 favorably, and at the same time, voted to report favorably H.R. 5766 , as amended. The votes to order the bills reported were largely along party lines. Supporters of the bills contendthat there are too many overlapping and ineffective federal programs that contribute to the growingfederal deficit and that the commission would assist Congress in performing its oversight function,thereby reducing fraud, waste, and abuse. Critics of the measures counter that the bills would cedetoo much power to the executive branch, would burden Congress with a tremendous workload withmandatory reauthorization of every agency and program, and would facilitate elimination of federalprograms that provide a safety net for the most vulnerable in society. This report examines the two bills and compares selected features, such as membership,powers of the commission, criteria for program review, public participation, and provisions forimplementing commission recommendations. This report will be updated as events warrant."
