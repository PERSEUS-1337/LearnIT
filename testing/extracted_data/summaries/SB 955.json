    "title": "An act to amend Section 1026 of, and to add Sections 1370.015 and 2977 to, the Penal Code, and to add Section 4146 to the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to criminal procedure.",
    "content": "Existing law requires, when a defendant pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, that a jury determine whether the defendant was sane or insane at the time the offense was committed. Under existing law, if a defendant is found to be not guilty by reason of insanity, the court is required to commit the person to a state hospital, or a public or private treatment facility, or place him or her on outpatient status, as specified. Existing law, subject to exceptions, authorizes the release of a prisoner from state prison if the court finds that the prisoner is terminally ill with an incurable condition caused by an illness or disease that would produce death within 6 months, as determined by a physician employed by the department, and that conditions under which the prisoner would be released or receive treatment do not pose a threat to public safety. This bill would establish similar compassionate release provisions for a defendant who has been committed to a state hospital because, among other reasons, the defendant is incompetent to stand trial or to be adjudged to punishment, or the defendant is a mentally disordered offender, including a person who has been found not guilty by reason of insanity. The bill would make additional conforming changes and would authorize the director to adopt emergency regulations to implement these provisions."
