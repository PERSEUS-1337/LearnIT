Requires the program to be administered by the National Ocean Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management. Authorizes the Secretary to make Program grants to coastal states with approved coastal zone management plans or National Estuarine Research Reserve units for the purpose of acquiring property that will further the goals of an approved Coastal Zone Management Plan or Program, a National Estuarine Research Reserve management plan, a regional or state watershed protection or management plan, or a state coastal land acquisition plan. Provides that grant awards may be used to purchase land, including an easement, only from a willing seller. Provides that grant funds under the Program shall require a 100 match from nonfederal sources, subject to a waiver. Reserves 15 of program funds for acquisitions benefiting the National Estuarine Research Reserve."
