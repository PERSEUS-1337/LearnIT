An AU Interim Commission, created to transfer theinstitutional andreal assets and liabilities of the OAU to the AU, and establish the AU's organizational structure, is the focal pointof AU activitiesduring its inaugural year. The AU's policy agenda overlaps substantially with that of the OAU, but more stronglyemphasizes a needfor greater economic growth and for governance reforms. The AU is likely to confront many of the same policy andfiscal challengesfaced by the OAU (see CRS Report RS20945(pdf), The Organization of African Unity). H.Res. 155,introduced in March2003, urges U.S. support of the AU and its diverse economic and political goals. This report will be updated asevents warrant."
