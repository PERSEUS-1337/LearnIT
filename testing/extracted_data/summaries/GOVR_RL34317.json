    "content": "Trafficking in persons (TIP) for the purposes of exploitation is believed to be one of the most prolific areas of contemporary international criminal activity and is of significant interest to the United States and the international community as a serious human rights concern. TIP is both an international and a domestic crime that involves violations of labor, public health, and human rights standards, and criminal law. In general, the trafficking business feeds on conditions of vulnerability, such as youth, gender, poverty, ignorance, social exclusion, political instability, and ongoing demand for cheap labor and sex workers. Actors engaged in human trafficking range from amateur family-run organizations to sophisticated transnational organized crime syndicates. Trafficking victims are often subjected to mental and physical abuse in order to control them, including debt bondage, social isolation, removal of identification cards and travel documents, violence, and fear of reprisals against them or their families. According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), in June 2012, some 20.9 million individuals were estimated to be victims of forced labor, including TIP. The most recent estimate from the U.S. government noted that as many as 17,500 people were believed to be trafficked into the United States each year, and some have estimated that 100,000 U.S. citizen (USC) children were victims of trafficking within the United States during the course of each year. Human trafficking is of great concern to the United States and the international community. Anti-TIP efforts have accelerated in the United States since the enactment of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA, Division A of P.L. 106-386) and internationally since the passage of the U.N. Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, adopted in 2000. Through the TVPA and its reauthorizations (TVPRAs), Congress has aimed to eliminate human trafficking by creating international and domestic grant programs for both victims and law enforcement, creating new criminal laws, and conducting oversight on the effectiveness and implications of U.S. anti-TIP policy. In March 2013, the TVPA was reauthorized through FY2017 in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (Title XII, P.L. 113-4). The United States engages in anti-TIP efforts internationally and domestically. The bulk of U.S. anti-trafficking programs abroad is administered by the State Department, United States Agency for International Development, and Department of Labor (DOL). In keeping with U.S. anti-trafficking policy, these programs have emphasized prevention, protection, and prosecution (the three \"Ps\"). Prevention programs have combined public awareness and education campaigns with education and employment opportunities for those at risk of trafficking, particularly women and girls. Protection programs have involved direct support for shelters, as well as training of local service providers, public officials, and religious groups. Programs to improve the prosecution rates of traffickers have helped countries draft or amend existing anti-TIP laws, as well as provided training for law enforcement and judiciaries to enforce those laws. However, it is difficult to evaluate the impact of international U.S. anti-trafficking efforts since few reliable measures of TIP have been identified. Domestically, anti-TIP efforts also include protection for victims, education of the public, and the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenses. The Departments of Justice (DOJ), Health and Human Services (HHS), and DOL have programs or administer grants to other entities to provide assistance specific to the needs of victims of trafficking. These needs include temporary housing, independent living skills, cultural orientation, transportation needs, job training, mental health counseling, and legal assistance. Both HHS and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) administer public awareness campaigns on recognizing human trafficking victims. In addition, within the United States at the federal level, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in DOJ and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the Department of Homeland Security both have primary responsibility for investigating and prosecuting traffickers. Some of the issues surrounding U.S. policy to combat human trafficking include whether there is equal treatment of all victims\u2014both foreign nationals and U.S. citizens, as well as victims of labor and sex trafficking; whether current law and services are adequate to deal with the emerging issue of minor sex trafficking in the United States (i.e., the prostitution of children in the United States); and whether U.S. efforts to stem human trafficking internationally are efficacious. In addition, the current budget situation has heightened interest in Congress on the funding and oversight of current efforts to fight TIP, to make sure that the grant programs authorized under the TVPA as amended do not duplicate efforts and that funding is being used in the most efficacious manner. Obligations for global and domestic anti-TIP programs, not including operations and law enforcement investigations, totaled approximately $82.5 million in FY2011. The TVPRA of 2013 authorized $127.75 million in global and domestic anti-TIP programs for FY2014. The 113th Congress has made TIP a priority. In February 2013, Congress passed S. 47 (P.L. 113-4), which amended and reauthorized the TVPA. Among other things, P.L. 113-4 modified some of the grant programs, expanded reporting requirements, created new criminal penalties for trafficking offenses, and reauthorized appropriations from FY2014 through FY2017. It is expected that Congress will consider other TIP legislation during the 113th session dealing with the child welfare system's response to minor sex trafficking, trying to limit demand for prostitution, and addressing the issue of online advertisements for the commercial sexual exploitation of minor trafficking victims.
