    "content": "This fact sheet summarizes selected highlights of the military construction and military family housing portions of the FY2017 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. The act is associated with three separate bill numbers: H.R. 4974, S. 2806, and H.R. 2577. Congressional action on FY2017 military construction appropriations legislation has been heavily influenced by the statutorily mandated discretionary spending caps established by P.L. 114-74, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA). A significant issue before Congress is the extent to which Congress and the President will agree on budgetary authority that (1) exceeds the established BBA limit, and (2) is exempt under 2 U.S.C. \u00a7901 from being counted toward that limit by virtue of categorization as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds. The 2015 BBA temporarily increased statutory funding limits on defense and non-defense appropriations for FY2016 and FY2017 above those established by the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011 (P.L. 112-25). New budget authority (funding not previously appropriated) for military construction and military family housing totaled $8,171.0 million for FY2016. For FY2017, the House authorized $7,616.5 million, and the Senate authorized $7,866.0 million. The conference committee recommended $7,898.0 million. The FY2017 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act originated in the House as H.R. 4974, introduced on April 15, 2016. A similar bill, S. 2806, was introduced in the Senate on April 18, 2016. On May 19, 2016, the Senate combined the versions of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (T-HUD), Military Construction and Veterans Affairs (MILCON/VA), and Zika Response and Preparedness appropriations bills into H.R. 2577 (a T-HUD appropriations bill for FY2016 that the House had passed in June, 2015), passed the amended bill, and sent it to the House. The House substituted its own amendment in three divisions (Division A: MILCON/VA, Division B: Zika Response Appropriations, and Division C: Zika Vector Control), removing the T-HUD portion for H.R. 2577, passed the bill, and requested a conference. The conference met on June 15, 2016, and filed its report (H.Rept. 114-640) the next day. The conference bill contained four divisions: (1) Division A: MILCON/VA, (2) Division B: Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations, (3) Division C: Zika Vector Control, and (4) Division D: Rescission of Funds ($750.0 million from three sources). The House agreed to the report on June 23, 2016. Further action in the Senate is pending."
