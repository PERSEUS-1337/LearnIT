    "content": "We present Optimal Transport GAN (OT-GAN), a variant of generative adversarial nets minimizing a new metric measuring the distance between the generator distribution and the data distribution. This metric, which we call mini-batch energy distance, combines optimal transport in primal form with an energy distance defined in an adversarially learned feature space, resulting in a highly discriminative distance function with unbiased mini-batch gradients. Experimentally we show OT-GAN to be highly stable when trained with large mini-batches, and we present state-of-the-art results on several popular benchmark problems for image generation. Generative modeling is a major sub-field of Machine Learning that studies the problem of how to learn models that generate images, audio, video, text or other data. Applications of generative models include image compression, generating speech from text, planning in reinforcement learning, semi-supervised and unsupervised representation learning, and many others. Since generative models can be trained on unlabeled data, which is almost endlessly available, they have enormous potential in the development of artificial intelligence.The central problem in generative modeling is how to train a generative model such that the distribution of its generated data will match the distribution of the training data. Generative adversarial nets (GANs) represent an advance in solving this problem, using a neural network discriminator or critic to distinguish between generated data and training data. The critic defines a distance between the model distribution and the data distribution which the generative model can optimize to produce data that more closely resembles the training data.A closely related approach to measuring the distance between the distributions of generated data and training data is provided by optimal transport theory. By framing the problem as optimally transporting one set of data points to another, it represents an alternative method of specifying a metric over probability distributions and provides another objective for training generative models. The dual problem of optimal transport is closely related to GANs, as discussed in the next section. However, the primal formulation of optimal transport has the advantage that it allows for closed form solutions and can thus more easily be used to define tractable training objectives that can be evaluated in practice without making approximations. A complication in using primal form optimal transport is that it may give biased gradients when used with mini-batches (see BID1 and may therefore be inconsistent as a technique for statistical estimation.In this paper we present OT-GAN, a variant of generative adversarial nets incorporating primal form optimal transport into its critic. We derive and justify our model by defining a new metric over probability distributions, which we call Mini-batch Energy Distance, combining optimal transport in primal form with an energy distance defined in an adversarially learned feature space. This combination results in a highly discriminative metric with unbiased mini-batch gradients.In Section 2 we provide the preliminaries required to understand our work, and we put our contribution into context by discussing the relevant literature. Section 3 presents our main theoretical contribution: Minibatch energy distance. We apply this new distance metric to the problem of learning generative models in Section 4, and show state-of-the-art results in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method, as well as directions for future work. We have presented OT-GAN, a new variant of GANs where the generator is trained to minimize a novel distance metric over probability distributions. This metric, which we call mini-batch energy distance, combines optimal transport in primal form with an energy distance defined in an adversarially learned feature space, resulting in a highly discriminative distance function with unbiased mini-batch gradients. OT-GAN was shown to be uniquely stable when trained with large mini-batches and to achieve state-of-the-art results on several common benchmarks.One downside of OT-GAN, as currently proposed, is that it requires large amounts of computation and memory. We achieve the best results when using very large mini-batches, which increases the time required for each update of the parameters. All experiments in this paper, except for the mixture of Gaussians toy example, were performed using 8 GPUs and trained for several days. In future work we hope to make the method more computationally efficient, as well as to scale up our approach to multi-machine training to enable generation of even more challenging and high resolution image data sets.A unique property of OT-GAN is that the mini-batch energy distance remains a valid training objective even when we stop training the critic. Our implementation of OT-GAN updates the generative model more often than the critic, where GANs typically do this the other way around (see e.g. BID11 . As a result we learn a relatively stable transport cost function c(x, y), describing how (dis)similar two images are, as well as an image embedding function v \u03b7 (x) capturing the geometry of the training data. Preliminary experiments suggest these learned functions can be used successfully for unsupervised learning and other applications, which we plan to investigate further in future work."
