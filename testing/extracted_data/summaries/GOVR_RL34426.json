Targeted Case Management (TCM) refers to case management for specific Medicaid beneficiary groups or for individuals who reside in state-designated geographic areas. Over the past seven years of available data (1999-2005), total expenditures on Medicaid TCM increased from $1.4 billion to $2.9 billion, an increase of 107%. In comparison, over the same period, total Medicaid spending increased by 87%, from $147.4 billion to $275.6 billion. TCM has been an active concern for both the executive and legislative branches. For instance, the Bush Administration proposed legislative changes to reduce Medicaid TCM expenditures in recent annual budget submissions. In the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L. 109-171), Congress added new statutory language to clarify the definition of case management and directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations to guide states' claims for federal Medicaid matching funds for TCM. As a result of DRA requirements, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued an interim final rule on December 4, 2007 for case management, which took effect March 3, 2008. In the interim final rule, CMS estimated that the new case management rules would reduce federal Medicaid expenditures by approximately $1.3 billion between FY2008 and FY2012. In April, the Economic Recovery in Health Care Act of 2008 (S. 2819), was introduced in the Senate, which would impose a moratorium on implementation of the TCM regulation until April 1, 2009. On May 22, 2008, the Senate passed the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008 (H.R. 2642). H.R. 2642 included a moratorium until April 1, 2009, on implementation of the TCM and other Medicaid regulations. H.R. 2642 was amended by the House and passed on June 19, 2008. The House amendments to H.R. 2642 included moratoria on implementation of six Medicaid regulations, including case management and TCM, until April 1, 2009. On June 26, 2008, the Senate passed H.R. 2642 without changes to the House legislation, so that implementation of six Medicaid regulations, including case management and TCM, would be delayed until April 1, 2009. The President signed P.L. 110-252 into law on June 30, 2008. Earlier, on June 4 and 5, 2008, the Senate and House, respectively, adopted the final version of the budget resolution (H.Rept. 110-659 accompanying S.Con.Res. 70). The conference agreement established budget-neutral reserve funds that could be used to impose moratoria on Medicaid rules and administrative actions and also includes a sense of the Senate provision on delaying Medicaid administrative regulations including case management and TCM. This report describes Medicaid case management services, presents major provisions of the proposed Medicaid case management regulation, and provides various perspectives on the TCM interim final rule. This report will be updated to reflect legislative and regulatory activity."
