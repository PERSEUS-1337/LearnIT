    "title": "AB 2770",
    "content": "The Cigarette and Tobacco Products Licensing Act of 2003 requires the State Board of Equalization to administer a statewide program to license manufacturers, importers, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers of cigarettes and tobacco products, and imposes various licensing fees. That act requires a retailer to have a license to engage in the sale of cigarette and tobacco products, and requires a separate license for each retail location. Existing law imposes a fee for each license and provides that the license is valid for a 12-month period. On and after January 1, 2017, existing law requires a license to be renewed annually and imposes a renewal fee. This bill would require a retailer that adds an additional retail location to renew the license for that location based on a 12-month period beginning in the month the retailer obtained its license for its first retail location. This bill would prohibit any license fee or renewal fee from being prorated. The Cigarette and Tobacco Products Licensing Act of 2003 requires the moneys collected pursuant to the act to be deposited in the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Compliance Fund, which are available for expenditure, upon appropriation by the Legislature, solely for the purpose of implementing, enforcing, and administering the licensing program under the act. The act requires the board to report to the Legislature no later than January 1, 2019, regarding the adequacy of funding for the licensing program . This bill would instead require the board to report to the Legislature, Governor, and Department of Finance on or before January 1, 2019, and on and before January 1 annually thereafter. The Cigarette and Tobacco Products Tax Law imposes a tax on distributors of cigarettes and tobacco products, and authorizes the reimbursement of the State Board of Equalization for expenses incurred in the administration and collection of the tax. This bill would prohibit, on or after July 1, 2019, the appropriation of revenues derived from the taxes imposed upon the distribution of cigarettes and tobacco products to the board for the purpose of implementing, enforcing, or administering the California Cigarette and Tobacco Products Licensing Act of 2003."
