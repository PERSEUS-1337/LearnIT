    "content": "Turkish Human Rights Compliance Act - Requires the President, from the funds available for FY 1996 for assistance for Turkey under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act, to withhold, first from grant assistance and then from loan assistance, $500,000 for each day that Turkey does not meet the conditions of this Act. Authorizes a presidential waiver of this Act if it is in the national security interest. Considers conditions to be met when the President certifies to the Congress that the Turkish Government: (1) allows free monitoring of the human rights situation within its territory by human rights monitoring organizations. (2) recognizes the civil, cultural, and human rights of its Kurdish citizens, ceases military operations against Kurdish civilians, and takes steps toward a peaceful resolution of the Kurdish issue. (3) takes steps toward the total withdrawal of military forces from Cyprus and supports a settlement recognizing the sovereignty and independence of Cyprus, with a constitutional democracy. (4) removes its blockade of US and international assistance to Armenia. And (5) removes official restrictions on Christian churches and schools and offers sufficient protection against acts of violence, harassment, and vandalism in connection with the clergy and such churches and schools."
