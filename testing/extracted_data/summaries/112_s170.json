    "content": "Helping Responsible Homeowners Act - Directs the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation each to carry out a one-year program providing for the refinancing of qualified single-family housing mortgages it owns through a refinancing mortgage in accordance with this Act and the policies and procedures of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Defines a qualified mortgage as one that: (1) is an existing first mortgage for purchase of, or refinancing another first mortgage on, a one- to four-family dwelling, including a condominium or a share in a cooperative ownership housing association, that is occupied by the mortgagor as principal residence, (2) is owned or guaranteed by the particular GSE. And (3) the mortgagor is current on payments due under the mortgage. Specifies the terms and conditions of a refinancing mortgage, including a 40-year term to maturity and a prohibition on borrower fees. Requires waiver or forgiveness of all fees and penalties related to any default or delinquency on the original mortgage. Prohibits the GSEs from charging a mortgagee any up-front fee beyond the standard guarantee fee for the refinancing of the qualified mortgage. Makes ineligible for purchase or guarantee by either GSE of any new mortgage originated by a servicer or creditor holding a second lien on a qualified mortgage who refuses to resubordinate that lien, and thereby prevents the refinancing of the qualified mortgage. Directs the GSEs to require each servicer of a mortgage owned or guaranteed by the GSE to inform each mortgage borrower of the refinancing program authorized and established under this Act."
