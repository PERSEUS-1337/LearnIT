    "content": "Sharing borders with Kosovo and Serbia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) managed to avoid becoming directly involved in the drawn-out wars in Bosnia andKosovo in the 1990s. Inter-ethnic relations between the Slav majority and ethnic Albanian minorityin Macedonia, while often tense, never reached the crisis state of Albanian-Serb relations in theprovince of Kosovo. Since Macedonia's independence in 1991, ethnic Albanian political parties inMacedonia have been represented in government and in parliament. However, in early 2001, ethnic Albanian rebels calling themselves the National Liberation Army (NLA) stepped up attacks on Macedonian security forces first in several villages near the cityof Tetovo and by the western border with Kosovo, and later near the capital, Skopje. The NLA wasthought to have ties to the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and rebel Albanian forces operating insouthern Serbia. In March, the Macedonian government began a counter-insurgency campaign. Itopened talks on political reforms with elected ethnic Albanian representatives, but refused tonegotiate with the rebels themselves. Clashes between the rebels and government forces continuedthrough the summer of 2001, notwithstanding intermittent cease-fire agreements and ongoingpolitical talks. With U.S. and European diplomatic intervention, the parties signed a frameworkagreement on August 13, amidst the deadliest violence of the conflict. Implementation of theagreement has progressed slowly and with difficulty. Substantial recent progress enabled the holdingof a long-delayed international donors' conference on March 12, 2002. In spite of recentachievements, some observers continue to fear the prospect of a new uprising by ethnic Albanianextremists or armed provocations by forces supporting Macedonian hardliners. In June 2001, NATO formulated and approved plans to launch a limited operation in Macedonia to oversee the disarmament of the ethnic Albanian rebel forces. On August 22, NATO gave finalapproval for the deployment of Operation Essential Harvest comprising about 4,500 troops in total. The operation completed collection of a targeted amount of rebel weapons (nearly 4,000) onSeptember 26, 2001. NATO then deployed a smaller follow-on force (Task Force Fox) to providesecurity for international civilian monitors. NATO's peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR) has alsobeen involved in patrolling and reinforcing the Kosovo border in order to try to cut off Albanianrebel supply routes. The United States maintains some KFOR support forces in Macedonia, but didnot contribute forces to either the Task Force Harvest or Task Force Fox missions in Macedonia. In early 2002, the European Union agreed to consider taking over the military mission in Macedoniafrom NATO."
