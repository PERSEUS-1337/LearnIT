    "content": "On August 3, 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized regulations that address carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the electric power sector. The Clean Power Plan (CPP) final rule requires states to submit plans that would reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions or emission rates\u2014measured in pounds of CO2 emissions per megawatt-hour of electricity generation\u2014from existing fossil fuel electricity generating units. EPA estimates that in 2030, the CPP will result in CO2 emission levels from the electric power sector that are 32% below 2005 levels. The CPP is the subject of ongoing litigation in which a number of states and other entities have challenged the rule. On February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court stayed the CPP for the duration of the litigation. The CPP therefore currently lacks enforceability or legal effect, and if the rule is ultimately upheld, at least some of the deadlines would have to be delayed. For example, the final rule established a deadline of September 6, 2016, for states to submit to EPA plans to comply with the rule with the option for a two-year extension (September 6, 2018). If a state fails to submit a satisfactory plan by EPA's regulatory deadline, the Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe a plan for the state, often described as a federal implementation plan. Emission reductions are scheduled to begin in 2022, giving the states two additional years (compared to the proposed rule) before their plans must go into effect. The 2015 final rule's state-specific targets are substantially different from those in the 2014 EPA proposed rule. For example, EPA's final rule establishes uniform national CO2 emission performance rates for each of the two subcategories of electricity generating units\u2014fossil-fuel-fired electric steam generating units (whether coal, oil, or natural gas) and stationary combustion turbines (natural gas combined cycle)\u2014affected by the rule. These standards are the underpinnings for the state-specific emission rate and mass-based targets, which, as a result, are considerably different from the proposed rule. The final rule's state targets imply lower percentage reductions for some states, while implied percentage reductions are higher for others states compared to the proposed rule. The state-specific targets differ, because EPA altered its methodology (i.e., underlying calculations and assumptions) compared to the proposed rule. For example, EPA eliminated \"building block\" 4 (energy efficiency improvements) and other \"building blocks.\" In the final rule, EPA continues to use 2012 data as the baseline for calculated state targets. However, the agency made several state-specific adjustments to address concerns raised by stakeholders. EPA also modified its treatment of nuclear power in the final rule, removing both \"at risk\" and under-construction nuclear power from the emission rate calculations. EPA clarified that the final rule would allow the generation from under-construction units, new nuclear units, and capacity upgrades to help states meet their compliance objectives. EPA would allow states to use \"qualified biomass\" as a means of meeting state-specific reduction requirements. This appears to be a narrower approach to biomass than in the proposed rule. The final rule contains a provision for a reliability \"safety valve\" for individual power plants. This mechanism would allow for a 90-day reprieve from emissions limits in an emergency situation. In addition, EPA created a new program to encourage states to support renewable energy and energy efficiency projects (in low-income communities) in 2020 and 2021."
