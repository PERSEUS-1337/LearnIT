    "content": "The Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill includes funds for the Department of the Interior (DOI), except for the Bureau of Reclamation, and funds for some agencies or programswithin three other departments--Agriculture, Energy, and Health and Human Services. It also fundsnumerous smaller related agencies. On February 4, 2002, President Bush submitted his FY2003budget for Interior and related agencies, totaling $18.94 billion compared to $19.17 billion enactedfor FY2002 ( P.L.107-63 ). While the House passed an Interior funding bill in the 107th Congress, theSenate did not. Thus, a series of resolutions were enacted to continue funding at FY2002 levels. On January 23rd, 2003, the Senate passed H.J.Res. 2 , the omnibus appropriations bill for FY2003 that included funding for Interior and related agencies and 10 other regularappropriations bills not enacted for FY2003. For Interior and related agencies, the Senate billcontained $18.97 billion for FY2003, plus an $825 million fire supplemental for FY2002, for a billtotal of $19.80 billion. The Senate bill required an across-the board cut of 2.852% that the numbersin this report do not reflect, as it is unclear how they were to be calculated for the Interior and relatedagencies. The House-passed measure ( H.R. 5093 , 107th Congress) contained $19.71billion for FY2003, plus a $700 million fire supplemental for FY2002, for a bill total of $20.41billion. The conference report on the measure ( H.Rept. 108-10 ) was signed into law on February20, 2003 ( P.L. 108-7 ). The FY2003 law contained $19.08 billion for Interior and related agencies, plus $825.0 million for fire fighting to repay transferred amounts for fire fighting in FY2002. It provides that an acrossthe board 0.65% cut be applied on a proportionate basis to each account, and to each program,project, and activity within an account. Again, the figures in this report do not reflect proportionatecuts, as it is unclear how they too would be calculated for the Interior and related agencies. The lawdoes not specifically fund the Conservation Spending Category, although the House bill hadrecommended $1.44 billion for FY2003, higher than the Administration ($1.32 billion). It providesincreases over the Administration's request for some agencies, including the U.S. GeologicalSurvey, Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, Indian Health Service, and Energy Departmentprograms, while providing decreases from the request for other agencies. Controversial issues addressed during Interior bill consideration included: fire management, stewardship contracting, and wilderness in the Tongass National Forest (see FS); development in theArctic National Wildlife Refuge and renewal of grazing permits and leases (see BLM); MissouriRiver flows (see FWS); Everglades restoration; (see NPS and cross-cutting issues); funding for landacquisition and conservation (see cross-cutting issues); development of oil and gas leases off theCalifornia coast (see MMS); management of the Indian tribes' trust funds and assets (see BIA andOST); and drought assistance.
