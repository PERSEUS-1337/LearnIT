    "content": "Developing Resources Immediately and Long-Term through Leases on Our Nation's Offshore Waters Act of 2009 or DRILL NOW Act of 2009 - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to revoke existing presidential authority to withdraw any unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf (OCS) from disposition for exploration, development, or production of oil and gas, except as necessary for national security. Prohibits the President from making any such withdrawals. Authorizes a state governor to petition the Secretary of the Interior to issue leases for oil and natural gas exploration and extraction in any area within 50 miles of the coastline of the state and the lateral seaward boundaries of the state extended. Prohibits the Secretary from approving a petition for a drilling activity: (1) unless the state enacts a statute authorizing the issuance of leases. (2) if it would conflict with a military operation or national security. Or (3) in any area withdrawn for national security purposes. Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit 30 of qualified revenues into a separate Clean and Alternative Energy Fund in the Treasury, to be made available to the Secretary of Energy for grants for research and development of clean and alternative energy. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) deposit into the Clean and Alternative Energy Fund 30 of any funds that would be received by the United States as royalties under any existing federal OCS oil and gas lease of an area located within 50 miles of the coastal zone of the states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, or Alabama. And (2) pay 40 of such funds in proportional amounts to states with respect to which a lease tract is located in such an area."
