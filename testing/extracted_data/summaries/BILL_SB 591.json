    "title": "SB 591",
    "content": "The Cigarette and Tobacco Products Tax Law, the violation of which is a crime, imposes a tax of $0.87 per package of 20 cigarettes on every distributor of cigarettes and a tax on the wholesale cost of tobacco products distributed at a tax rate that is equivalent to the combined rate of all taxes imposed on cigarettes, and at a rate equivalent to $0.50 per pack cigarette tax. Revenues from taxes imposed under this law are deposited in specified accounts. These taxes are inclusive of the taxes imposed under the Tobacco Tax and Health Protection Act of 1988 and the California Children and Families Act of 1998 . This bill, beginning January 1, 2016, would impose an additional tax on the distribution of cigarettes at the rate of $0.10 for each cigarette distributed, which would be $2.00 per pack. Would require a dealer and a wholesaler to file a return with the State Board of Equalization showing the number of cigarettes in its possession or under its control on that date, and impose a related floor stock tax. And would require a licensed cigarette distributor to file a return with the board and pay a cigarette indicia adjustment tax at the rate equal to the difference between the existing tax rate and the tax rate imposed by this bill for cigarette tax stamps in its possession or under its control on that date. Because the bill would impose an additional tax on cigarettes under the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Tax Law, it would increase the tax upon the distribution of tobacco products under that law. The bill would provide that the revenues collected from the additional tax be deposited in the California Tobacco Tax Act of 2015 Fund created by this bill, and transferred into accounts within that fund, which are created by this bill, the Tobacco Prevention and Education Account, the Tobacco Disease Related Health Care Account, and the Tobacco Law Enforcement Account. The bill would provide that revenue from this tax would not be considered General Fund revenue, and would limit the use or loan of those revenues, as provided. Because this bill would impose new requirements under the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Tax Law, the violation of which is a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. This bill would include a change in state statute that would result in a taxpayer paying a higher tax within the meaning of Section 3 of Article XIII A of the California Constitution, and thus would require for passage the approval of 23 of the membership of each house of the Legislature. This bill would become operative only if AB 1396 of the 2015\u201316 Regular Session is also enacted and takes effect on or before January 1, 2016."
