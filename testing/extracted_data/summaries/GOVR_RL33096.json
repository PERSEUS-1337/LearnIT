    "content": "Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in late August 2005, causing catastrophic winddamage and flooding in several states, and a massive dislocation of victims across the country. Thestorm was one of the worst natural disasters in the nation's history. Estimates are that more than1,200 people were killed and about 2 million displaced. Hurricane Rita, which made landfall alongthe Gulf Coast in late September 2005, was ultimately less lethal than Katrina, but promptedaggressive preparedness efforts by governments and citizens shaken by the devastation of the earlierstorm. In response to a series of disasters and terrorist attacks over the past decade, in particular theterror attacks of 2001, Congress, the Administration, state and local governments and the privatesector have made investments to improve disaster preparedness and response. New federalauthorities and programs to strengthen the nation's public health system were introduced incomprehensive legislation in 2002. Congress also created the Department of Homeland Security(DHS) in 2002 to provide national leadership for coordinated preparedness and response planning. A new National Response Plan (NRP), launched by DHS in December 2004, met its first major testin the response to Hurricane Katrina. According to the NRP, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is tasked withcoordinating the response of the public health and medical sectors following a disaster. HHS workswith several other agencies to accomplish this mission, which includes assuring the safety of food,water and environments, treating the ranks of the ill and injured, and identifying the dead. HHSactivities are coordinated with those of other lead agencies under the overall leadership of DHS. Congress and others will review the response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita with an eyetoward assessing how well the NRP worked as an instrument for coordinated national response, andhow well various agencies at the federal, state and local levels carried out their missions under theplan. Hurricane Katrina dealt some familiar blows in emergency response. The failure ofcommunication systems, and subsequent difficulties in coordination, challenged response efforts inthis disaster as with others before it. Hurricane Katrina also pushed some response elements, suchas surge capacity in the healthcare workforce, to their limits. The response to Hurricane Katrina hasalso called attention to the matter of disaster planning in healthcare facilities, and the potential roleof health information technology in expediting the care of displaced persons. Policymakers will nodoubt study these elements of the Katrina response and seek options for continued improvement innational disaster preparedness and response. This report discusses the NRP and its components for public health and medical response,provides information on key response activities carried out by agencies in HHS and DHS, anddiscusses certain issues in public health and medical preparedness that have been raised by theresponse to the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. This report will be updated as circumstances warrant."
