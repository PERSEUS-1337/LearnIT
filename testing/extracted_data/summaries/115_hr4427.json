    "content": "Protecting America and American Workers Act This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to eliminate the diversity immigrant program effective on the first day of the first fiscal year after the date on which the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security jointly determine that such immigrant visas are no longer necessary to offset certain status adjustments under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. Until such time and effective on October 1, 2018, the annual number of diversity program visas is reduced from 55,000 to 5,000. Beginning in FY2019, 8,000 of such former diversity visas shall be allocated annually to each of three employment-based immigrant categories for a total of 24,000 additional visas each year."
