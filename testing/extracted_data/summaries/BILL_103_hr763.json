    "content": "Directs the President to initiate consultations with each Pacific Rim country to determine the feasibility of negotiating the elimination of tariffs and nontariff barriers, including barriers to investment, trade in services, and protection of intellectual property rights, through a bilateral free trade agreement. Requires the President, at each ministerial meeting convened for such consultations, to recommend establishment of a council to review and report on the existing bilateral relationship and the prospects for negotiating a free trade agreement. Authorizes the President to enter into such agreements after expiration on June 1, 1993, of fast track authority which provides procedures for their congressional passage under the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 and the Trade Act of 1974. Requires the President to achieve specified negotiating objectives with each country, including: (1) improving bilateral relationships through trade expansion and greater economic efficiency. (2) removing trade barriers, particularly in agricultural products and manufactured components in an effort to reduce government subsidies and injurious dumping practices. (3) providing mechanisms for the development of rules in nontraditional areas such as services, trade-related investment, and the protection of intellectual property rights. (4) encouraging US firms to take greater advantage of opportunities in Pacific Rim countries and to compete more effectively there, and (5) improving market access in such countries."
