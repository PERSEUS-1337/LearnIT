    "content": "GEAR UP GO Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to revise specified requirements for Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs to facilitate the transition of low-income high school students into postsecondary education. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to carry out a GEAR UP GO grants program to provide low-income high school students participating in GEAR UP partnerships or State programs opportunities for dualconcurrent enrollment in college courses while still enrolled in high school. Provides that students in such program: (1) shall not be required to apply for admission to the institution of higher education. And (2) may receive college credit. Requires up to 25 percent of GEAR UP GO program funds to be reserved for grants to earlymiddle college high schools designed to provide 9th through 12th grade low-income and first-generation college students with a coherent course of study enabling them to earn simultaneously a high school diploma and college credit toward a postsecondary degree."
