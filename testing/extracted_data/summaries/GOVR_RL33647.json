    "content": "The Bush Administration is expected to submit a proposal for a civilian reserve with the February 2008 budget request. On June 1, 2006, CRS gathered a group of experts on the recruitment and deployment of civilians to peacekeeping operations, now generally referred to by the broader term \"stabilization and reconstruction\" operations. The purpose of the three-hour workshop was to clarify issues that might be involved in the formation of a civilian reserve force for such operations. The Bush Administration is developing proposals for a civilian reserve. Shortly before the workshop was held, the Senate passed the Reconstruction and Stabilization Civilian Management Act of 2006 (S. 3322) to establish such a civilian reserve. The workshop began with a presentation by State Department official, Christopher J. Hoh, who explained Administration plans for a civilian reserve. As outlined by Mr. Hoh, these plans called for the creation of a reserve of civilians from the private and public sector to deploy with or soon after permanent government employees and before contractors. Reservists would train together with U.S. military and civilian government personnel before deployments, and would be mobilized as federal employees. They would be provided a range of benefits and incentives. The workshop included speakers from the U.N. and from two national agencies that recruit civilians for peacekeeping and related missions: the German Center for International Peace Operations (known by its German acronym, ZIF) and Canada's CANADEM, as well as from the Alexandria, VA-based Institute for Defense Analysis. The U.N., ZIF, and CANADEM all have rosters of professionals in rule of law and civil administration to send on missions. The rosters are not equivalent to the reserve force proposed by the Bush Administration or by a Senate bill (S. 3322), the Reconstruction and Stabilization Civilian Management Act of 2006, but all candidates are pre-screened and provided predeployment training. The recruitment and other problems they have faced may be similar to those that the United States may encounter if it forms a reserve. Participants pointed to several needs to attract and retain highly qualified people: (1) proactive recruitment methods; (2) in-depth screening; (3) sufficient training; and (4) retention incentives. To meet the needs of requester organizations, participants agreed on the need for (1) sizable rosters, (2) sophisticated databases, and (3) insulation from political pressures. To enhance the prospects for mission success, participants agreed that deployments should be set for at least a year in order to provide continuity. The workshop discussion raised several questions about the desirability of Bush Administration plans. Among the questions are whether recent plans and proposals on roster size and recommendations by a private firm regarding the screening process and deployment length are adequate. This report will not be updated."
