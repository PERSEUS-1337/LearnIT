    "content": "VA Billing Accountability Act This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to waive the requirement that a veteran make copayments for medication, hospital care, nursing home care, or medical services if the veteran received copayment notification more than 180 days after the medical service or receipt of medication and such delay was caused by VA error. In requiring a veteran to make a copayment for medical services, the VA shall notify the veteran within 180 days of the service. If the VA does not provide such notification, it may not collect the payment unless the veteran is provided with an opportunity to apply for a waiver or establish a payment plan. The VA shall review and improve its copayment billing internal controls and notification procedures."
