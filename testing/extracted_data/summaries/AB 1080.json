    "title": "An act to amend Section 34171 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to redevelopment.",
    "content": "Existing law dissolved redevelopment agencies and community development agencies as of February 1, 2012, and provides for the designation of successor agencies to wind down the affairs of the dissolved redevelopment agencies, subject to review by oversight boards, and to, among other things, make payments due for enforceable obligations and to perform obligations required pursuant to any enforceable obligation. Existing law defines \u201cenforceable obligation\u201d for these purposes to generally exclude any agreements, contracts, or arrangements between the city, county, or city and county that created the redevelopment agency and the former redevelopment agency. The Military Base Reuse Authority Act authorizes the creation of a military base reuse authority to plan, finance, and manage the transition of a military base from military to civilian use, as specified. This bill would authorize the Department of Finance to find that an agreement between a former redevelopment agency and a joint powers authority that was created to exercise the powers provided by the Military Base Reuse Authority Act is an enforceable obligation."
