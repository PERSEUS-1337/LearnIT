    "content": "The war on terrorism has put a high premium on a primary mission of UAVs, intelligencegathering. Furthermore, the military effectiveness of UAVs in recent conflicts such as Iraq (1990)and Kosovo (1999) opened the eyes of many to both the advantages and disadvantages provided byunmanned aircraft. Long relegated to the sidelines in military operations, UAVs are now makingnational headlines as they are used in ways normally reserved for manned aircraft. Conventionalwisdom states that UAVs offer two main advantages over manned aircraft: they are considered morecost-effective, and they minimize the risk to a pilot's life. However, the current UAV accident rate(the rate at which the aircraft are lost or damaged) is 100 times that of manned aircraft. UAVs range from the size of an insect to that of a commercial airliner. DOD currentlypossesses five major UAVs: the Air Force's Predator and Global Hawk, the Navy and MarineCorps's Pioneer, and the Army's Hunter and Shadow. Other key UAV developmental efforts includethe Air Force and Navy's unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), Navy's vertical takeoff and landingUAV (VTUAV), and the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance UAV(BAMS), and the Marine Corps'sDragon Eye and Dragon Warrior. The services continue to be innovative in their use of UAVs. Recent examples include arming UAVs (Predator, Hunter), using UAVs to extend the eyes ofsubmarines, and teaming UAVs with strike aircraft and armed helicopters to improve targeting. In the past, tension has existed between the services' efforts to acquire UAVs andcongressional initiatives to encourage a consolidated DOD approach. Some observers argue that theresult has been a less than stellar track record for the UAV. However, reflecting the growingawareness and support in Congress and the Department of Defense for UAVs, investments inunmanned aerial vehicles have been increasing every year. DoD spending on UAVs has increasedfrom $284 million in Fiscal Year 2000 to $2.1 billion in FY2005. Congressional considerations include the proper pace, scope, and management of DoD UAVprocurement; appropriate investment priorities for UAVs versus manned aircraft; UAV future rolesand applications; personnel issues; industrial base issues; and technology proliferation. This reportwill be updated as necessary."
