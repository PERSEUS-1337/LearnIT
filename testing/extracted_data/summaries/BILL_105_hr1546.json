    "content": "Government Secrecy Act of 1997 - States that it is the purpose of this Act to promote the effective protection of classified information and the disclosure of information where there is not a well-founded basis for protection or where the costs of maintaining a secret outweigh the benefits. Authorizes the President, in accordance with this Act, to protect from unauthorized disclosure, information in the possession and control of the executive branch, when there is a demonstrable need to do so in order to protect the national security of the United States. Directs the President to ensure that the amount of information classified is the minimum necessary to protect the national security. Sets forth requirements for the establishment of standards and procedures for classifying and declassifying information. Requires each head of an agency that is responsible for the classification and declassification of information to submit to the Congress each year a report that describes the application of the classification and declassification standards and procedures of that agency during the preceding fiscal year. Directs the President to establish within an existing agency a National Declassification Center to: (1) coordinate and oversee the declassification policies and practices of the Federal Government. And (2) provide technical assistance to agencies in implementing such policies and practices, in accordance with this Act. Establishes the National Declassification Advisory Committee to provide advice to the Center and make recommendations concerning declassification priorities and activities. Mandates annual reports by the Center to the President and the Congress on its activities during the preceding fiscal year, and on the implementation of agency declassification practices and its efforts to coordinate those practices."
