    "title": "SB 523",
    "content": "Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the State Air Resources Board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of a market-based compliance mechanism relative to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, commonly known as cap and trade revenues, to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for specified purposes. Existing law provides various programs to fund the acquisition of schoolbuses. This bill would create the Schoolbus Replacement for Small and Disadvantaged Communities Grant Program, and would appropriate $5 million annually from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to the State Department of Education for the program. The program would be administered by the department in conjunction with the State Air Resources Board, and would provide schoolbus replacement grants to school districts or county offices of education with an average daily attendance of less than 2,501 and with more than 50 of the pupil population qualifying for free or reduced-rate lunch programs, and to certain other eligible applicants. The bill would impose various requirements in that regard. The bill would also make legislative findings and declarations. Under existing law, fees required by the Vehicle Code are delinquent when a vehicle is operated on a highway without those fees first having been paid and when those fees have not been paid within 20 days of the vehicle\u2019s first operation, subject to specified exceptions. This bill would increase that amount of time to 30 days."
