    "content": "Federal advisory committees are established to allow experts from outside the federal government to provide advice and recommendations to Congress, the President, or an executive branch agency. Federal advisory committees can be created either by Congress, the President, or an executive branch agency. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) requires agencies to report on the structure, operations, and costs of qualifying federal advisory committees. The General Services Administration (GSA) is authorized to collect, retain, and review the reported information, and does so using an online tool called the FACA Database. Generally, the data show that the number of active FACA committees has remained relatively stable over time, hovering around 1,000 committees in any given fiscal year. Around 70,000 people serve as members of FACA committees and subcommittees in any given year. The Department of Health and Human Services consistently operates the greatest number of federal advisory committees, with 248 active committees in FY2015. The Department of Agriculture had the second greatest number of active committees in FY2015 with 163. In any given year, around half of the active FACA committees are established by statute. In FY2015, Congress established 20 new FACA committees by statute. Costs to operate federal advisory committees have varied over time and ranged from a low of $334.7 million in FY2014 to a high of $451.3 million in 2006. Federal advisory committee operating costs dropped from FY2010 to FY2014. In FY2015, however, costs to operate federal advisory committees rose 9.8% from FY2014 levels. The increase in costs from FY2014 to FY2015 coincides with increases in the number of members serving on federal advisory committees as well as the number of meetings held by those committees. In FY2015, 1,009 federal advisory committees held 7,421 meetings with 72,200 members and cost more than $367 million to operate. This report provides an in-depth examination of FACA committee operations and costs, using the data collected by GSA. The report also analyzes policy options that Congress can consider when deliberating current or future legislation to amend FACA, including clarifying FACA data reporting requirements, changing FACA committee member pay, and removing advisory committees that assist the grant making process from the FACA Database."
