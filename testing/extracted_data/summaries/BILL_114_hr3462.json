    "content": "Sport Fish Restoration and Recreational Boating Safety Act of 2015 This bill amends the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act to reauthorize through FY2020 appropriations from the Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund for various fish, boating, and coastal wetlands restoration programs. The bill also revises amounts allocated from the Fund to various programs, including amounts for programs concerning: (1) coastal wetlands, (2) boating safety, and (3) boating infrastructure. A separate amount is set aside each fiscal year through FY2020 for the Coast Guard's administration of the national recreational boating safety program. When the President submits a budget for FY2017 and each fiscal year thereafter, the US Fish and Wildlife Service must submit an assessment of the administrative services it provides under the Act to states and the sportfishing community."
