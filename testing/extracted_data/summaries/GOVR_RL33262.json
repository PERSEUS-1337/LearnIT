    "content": "There have been sharp debates over the past three decades concerning the appropriate levelof funding for U.S. foreign policy programs, and it is likely that these debates will continue asCongress reviews the President's FY2007 budget proposal. The past 30 years have witnessed wideswings in the amounts of U.S. resources committed to advancing foreign policy and national securityinterests, reflecting changes in global challenges faced by the United States. Efforts to promotepeace in the Middle East, to confront Soviet influence, to support new democracies in the post-ColdWar era, to fight poverty and disease affecting poor nations, to combat global terrorism, and tostabilize fragile or failed states have had a substantial impact on levels of foreign policy resources. Key highlights of international affairs spending trends include: After a substantial decline during the mid-1990s, total foreign policy spendinghas grown significantly since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Not only has the UnitedStates allocated large amounts of resources for fighting the global war on terror, the BushAdministration has launched two major new foreign aid initiatives -- the Millennium ChallengeAccount and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The $53.8 billion(constant FY2006 dollars) budget for FY2004, which included Iraq reconstruction funds, representedby far the highest level of spending during the past three decades. Although the amount of spending for international activities has grownsignificantly since September 11, compared to changes in the overall size of the federal budget, theshare allocated for foreign policy programs has declined (with the exception of FY2004) due toincreases in defense, homeland security, and, in FY2005 and FY2006, Hurricane Katrinarelief. \"Core\" bilateral development assistance funding accounts -- those focusing onlong-term poverty reduction and economic growth -- have more than tripled sinceFY2000. The $5.9 billion in U.S. aid to Africa estimated for FY2006 is the largest levelin three decades and totals over two and a half times the $2.2 billion annual average since FY1977. President Bush pledged to double U.S. assistance to Africa between 2004 and2010. Funding for State Department personnel, embassy security, public diplomacy,and dues for international organizations has increased steadily over the past three decades, peakingin FY2006 at $12.2 billion (constant dollars), including operational costs inIraq. This report will be updated as new data become available."
