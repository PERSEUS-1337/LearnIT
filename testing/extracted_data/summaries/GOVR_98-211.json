    "content": "The annual Foreign Operations appropriations bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which Congress reviews the U.S. foreign aid budget and influences executive branch foreign policymaking generally. It contains the largest share -- over two-thirds -- of total U.S. internationalaffairs spending. For Foreign Operations programs, President Clinton sought $13.6 billion indiscretionary budget authority for FY1999, nearly $800 million, or 6% higher than available forFY1998. But unlike a year ago, when the President concentrated most of the added funds requestedon a few high priority areas, the FY1999 request asked for increases across a wide array of ForeignOperations programs, including export promotion agencies, development assistance, debt reductioninitiatives, the Peace Corps, drug control aid, arrearage payments for multilateral development banks,and others. Israel, Egypt, Russia, Ukraine, and Bosnia would be the largest recipients of bilateralaid, as has been the case in the recent past. Beyond these regular Foreign Operations programs, thePresident also sought $17.9 billion for U.S. contributions to two IMF facilities and $502 million forU.S. arreage payments to multilateral development banks. In addition to funding questions, the Foreign Operations debate also included important policy issues, such as priorities of development aid strategies, abortion restrictions on international familyplanning programs, adjusting Middle East aid allocations, policy restrictions on aid to Russia andUkraine, and the use of American assistance as a tool in the Armenian-Azerbaijan dispute overNagorno-Karabakh. Foreign Operations is one of eight appropriation bills incorporated and enacted in H.R. 4238 , the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental AppropriationsAct, 1999. As passed on October 20/21, H.R. 4328 includes $12.827 billion fordiscretionary Foreign Operations. In addition, the omnibus bill includes $539 million to clear U.S.arrears at multilateral development banks, $399 million in \"emergency\" Foreign Operationssupplementals, and $17.9 billion for the IMF, funds that are not \"scored\" against the ForeignOperations budget cap, but which provide additional resources for U.S. foreign aid activities. Intotal, H.R. 4328 provides $31.63 billion for Foreign Operations in FY1999. Although this still falls about $385 million below the President's request, it provides a substantial increase from what the House and Senate had approved in bills ( H.R. 4569 and S. 2334 ) passed in September. Senior executive branch officials had advised thePresident to veto these earlier measures because of inadequate funding. Compared with theSenate-passed bill, the higher of the two, budget negotiations between congressional leaders and theWhite House during the final days of the 105th Congress resulted in $880 million more for ForeignOperations in FY1999. Much of the additional money included in H.R. 4328 isallocated for former Soviet aid, USAID operating expenses, disaster relief, the Peace Corps and U.S.contributions to the Global Environment Facility. The bill caps international family planning aid at$385 million, but drops House-passed abortion restrictions. The enacted legislation also initiates aten year process to phase out economic aid to Israel and trim by half Egypt's aid, reducing totalcombined assistance for FY1999 by $100 million to just over $5 billion.
