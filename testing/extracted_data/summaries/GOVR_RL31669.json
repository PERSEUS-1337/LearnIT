    "content": "The catastrophic terrorist attack of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent anthrax mailings have sensitized the nation to acts of domestic terror. The confirmation of terrorist interest inweapons of mass destruction and the vulnerability of the United States to such attack havehighlighted the potential that these weapons may be used as weapons of terror. The framework ofweapons of mass destruction (WMD) includes chemical, biological, and toxin weapons. Chemical, biological, and toxin weapons can produce mass casualties if effectively disseminated, but have varying and different effects. Chemical weapons, predominantly man-madechemicals, require the largest amounts of material to be effective and cause their effects in minutesto hours. Biological weapons made of naturally occurring pathogens require the least material to beeffective, but generally have an incubation period of several days before symptoms show themselves. Toxin weapons, such as ricin, chemical agents formed by biological processes, are intermediatebetween the two in both amount and timescale. Treatment protocols for chemical, biological, andtoxin weapons vary by agent, ranging from weapons with effective treatment and prophylaxis toweapons which have no known cure nor protection. Chemical, biological, and toxin weapons pose additional concerns beyond mass casualties. These weapons may contaminate the area in which they are used, emergency vehicles, and firstresponders. The wide array of potential symptoms from chemical, biological, and toxin weaponsmakes identification of the causal agent difficult and complicates treatment. Additionally, publicfears relating to disease and poisoning could increase the effect of a chemical, biological, or toxinattack, as worried, unexposed people request treatment from medical facilities. In extreme cases,public hysteria has been postulated as an outcome from mass dissemination. Several initiatives are underway to reduce the potential value of chemical, biological, and toxin weapons. One approach has been through funding significant increases in the public health system'spreparedness and response capacity. Additionally, facilities and researchers possessing \"selectagents\" have been registered in a national database. Non-governmental agencies, such as theNational Academy of Sciences, and professional societies have also been active in developingpolicies and options to lower the threat of terrorist attack. Potential options to further decrease the odds of chemical, biological, and toxin terrorism include regulating and registering domestic purchase of \"dual-use\" equipment; further developmentof the public health system; federal incentives for research and development into chemical,biological, and toxin medicines, vaccines, countermeasures and detectors; informational publicoutreach programs to properly inform the public about the risks involved; and voluntary mediacodes. This report will be updated as circumstances warrant."
