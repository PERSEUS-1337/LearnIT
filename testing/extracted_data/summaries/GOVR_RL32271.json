    "content": "The new Medicare legislation, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, andModernization Act ( P.L. 108-173 ), addresses the importation of prescription drugs for all U.S.consumers, not just for Medicare-eligible individuals. These provisions are rooted in consumer andcongressional concern with the high cost of prescription drugs in the United States. Internationalcomparisons of drug prices have confirmed that American consumers, particularly the elderly anduninsured, often pay more for prescription drugs than do citizens in other countries. The importationof lower-priced prescription drugs is one strategy to reduce U.S. consumer spending. The new Act, despite being structured as a replacement to the importation provisions in theMedicine Equity and Drug Safety (MEDS) Act of 2000, does not effectively change U.S.prescription drug importation policy. The details it adds will not be implemented unless theSecretary of Health and Human Services (hereafter referred to as the Secretary) certifies to Congressthat such imports do not threaten the health and safety of the American public and do provide costsavings. That certification requirement, continued from prior law, has effectively haltedimplementation of existing import provisions because no Secretary has been willing to provide therequired certification. The Act changes the law in four basic ways: it (1) directs the Secretary to allow imports fromCanada only (the MEDS Act had allowed imports from a specific list of industrialized countries,including Canada); (2) includes a shift in approach to the importation of prescription drugs byindividuals, by codifying the discretion in enforcement that the Food and Drug Administration(FDA) has exercised to allow the \"personal use\" imports of prescription drugs; (3) eliminates theprohibition against a manufacturer's entering into agreements to prevent the sale or distribution ofimported products; and (4) includes a mechanism, based on evidence, by which the Secretary canterminate the import program. Following enactment of the Medicare bill in December 2003, some Members of Congresshave moved to amend the importation of prescription drugs provisions. Some states and localitieshave set up websites to facilitate individuals' purchase of prescription drugs from Canadianpharmacies. FDA has responded. In letters to state officials, FDA has warned that states could facetort liability suits and charges of assisting in criminal activity if citizens suffer injury from thesedrugs. FDA, via the Department of Justice, has gone to the courts to stop the Canadian and U.S.distributors of drugs imported from Canada."
