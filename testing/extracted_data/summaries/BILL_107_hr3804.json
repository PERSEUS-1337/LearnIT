    "content": "Preservation of Antibiotics for Human Treatment Act of 2002 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to refuse to approve an application for an antimicrobial new animal drug when the applicant fails to demonstrate to a reasonable certainty that human health will not be harmed because of the development of antimicrobial resistance attributable to the nontherapeutic use of such drug. Rescinds within a specified period existing approvals and exemptions concerning the nontherapeutic use of certain antimicrobial drugs until the applicant meets the same standard of lack of harm to human health as required for new animal drugs, including the use of penicillins, tetracyclines, macrolides, lincomycin, bacitracin, virginiamycin, aminoglycosides, and sulfonamides in an animal and fluroroquinolones in poultry."
