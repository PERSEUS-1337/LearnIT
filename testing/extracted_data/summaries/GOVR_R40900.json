    "content": "The 111th Congress has devoted considerable effort to health reform that seeks to increase health insurance coverage for more Americans and help to control costs, while improving quality and patient outcomes. The Affordable Health Choices for America Act (H.R. 3962) was introduced in the House of Representatives on October 29, 2009. H.R. 3962 is based on H.R. 3200, America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, originally introduced on July 14, 2009, and reported separately on October 14, 2009, by three House Committees\u2014Education and Labor, Energy and Commerce, and Ways and Means. H.R. 3962 was further modified by the manager's amendment posted on November 3, 2009. H.R. 3962, as passed by the House on November 7, 2009, proposes sweeping reforms of the health care delivery system, described in the three divisions. Division A, \"Affordable Health Care Choices,\" focuses on reducing the number of uninsured, restructuring the private health insurance market, setting minimum standards for health benefits, and providing financial assistance to certain individuals and small employers. Division B, \"Medicare and Medicaid Improvements,\" proposes modifications to the largest two public health insurance programs to make them consistent with provisions in Division A and to amend other provisions in existing federal statute. Division C, \"Public Health and Workforce Development,\" would amend and expand existing health professions and nursing workforce programs. A Republican alternative amendment in the nature of a substitute, dated November 3, 2009, is addressed in a separate CRS report. This report summarizes the major provisions affecting Medicaid and CHIP in H.R. 3962 (as passed), including modifications made by the manager's amendment. The report focuses primarily on provisions in Division B, Title VII\u2014Medicaid and CHIP, plus selected provisions in Title IX\u2014Miscellaneous Provisions. It also describes selected sections of Titles I and II of Division D, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2009, related to improving access to Medicaid and CHIP for American Indians and Alaskan Natives. Due to the breadth of the changes proposed in H.R. 3962, some provisions of Divisions A and C also could affect Medicaid, but these are not Medicaid-specific. The Division B provisions would modify existing law and add new provisions affecting Medicaid eligibility; benefits; financing; waste, fraud, and abuse; payments to territories; demonstrations and pilot programs; and other miscellaneous Medicaid components. A major provision in Division B would expand Medicaid eligibility for traditional and non-traditional beneficiary categories up to 150% of the federal poverty level. The federal government would fully finance the costs for certain of these expanded beneficiary categories for periods before 2015, decreasing to 91% beginning in 2015. With respect to benefits, Medicaid programs would be required to cover preventive services, and would be allowed to cover nurse home visitation and birthing center services. There are a number of financing changes that would affect Medicaid under H.R. 3962, including reducing Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments by $10 billion by FY2019, increasing prescription drug rebates, and raising provider payments for certain primary care services. Additional waste, fraud, and abuse provisions affecting Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) include requirements to deny payment for health care acquired conditions, require new Medicaid Integrity Program evaluations and reports, and require states to implement a national correct coding initiative, similar to the Medicare program. Under H.R. 3962, spending caps for the territories would be increased, and a series of demonstrations would be approved, including a medical home program, an accountable care organization program, and a program for stabilization of emergency medical conditions by mental disease institutions."
