    "title": "AB 65",
    "content": "Existing law generally requires local agencies to provide each newly hired police officer and deputy sheriff with a pistol and other specified equipment. This bill would appropriate an unspecified sum from the General Fund to the Department of Justice for purposes of matching federal funds available to purchase body-worn cameras and related equipment for use by local peace officers. The bill would require the department to develop a matching grant program for local jurisdictions that would either allow the state to apply for federal matching funds on behalf of a local law enforcement entity, or to reimburse a local law enforcement entity that has expended its funds for purposes of obtaining federal matching funds for body-worn cameras, as described. This bill would require the Board of State and Community Corrections to develop a grant program to make funds available to local law enforcement entities to purchase body-worn cameras and related data storage and equipment, and to hire personnel necessary to operate a local body-worn camera program. The bill would create the Body-worn Camera Fund, that would continuously appropriate funds to the board for those purposes. Existing law creates the State Penalty Fund into which moneys collected by the courts from the imposition of fines, forfeitures, or penalties on criminal offenses are deposited. Once a month, certain percentages of money in that fund are transferred into other funds, including, among others, the Driver Training Penalty Assessment Fund. This bill would delete the transfer requirement for the Driver Training Penalty Assessment Fund and instead require a transfer to the Body-worn Camera Fund. By transferring general fund moneys into a continuously appropriated fund, this bill would make an appropriation."
