    "title": "An act to amend Sections 1490, 1600, and 1601 of, and to add Section 1510.1 to, the Probate Code, relating to juveniles.",
    "content": "Existing federal law, the Immigration and Nationality Act, establishes a procedure for classification of certain aliens as special immigrants who have been declared dependent on a juvenile court, and authorizes those aliens to apply for an adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident within the United States. Under federal regulations, an alien is eligible for special immigrant juvenile status if he or she is under 21 years of age. Existing state law provides that the juvenile, probate, and family divisions of the superior court have jurisdiction to make judicial determinations regarding the custody and care of juveniles within the meaning of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act. Existing law also requires the court, upon request, to make the necessary findings regarding special immigrant juvenile status if there is evidence to support those findings, as specified. Existing law also establishes the jurisdiction of the probate court. Existing law regulates the establishment and termination of guardianships in probate court, and specifies that a guardian has the care, custody, and control of a ward. Existing law provides that a relative or other person on behalf of a minor, or a minor if he or she is 12 years of age or older, may file a petition for the appointment of a guardian of the person or estate of the minor. Existing law also provides that a guardianship of the person or estate terminates when the ward attains majority or dies, or is adopted or emancipated, as specified. This bill would authorize a court to appoint a guardian of the person of an unmarried individual who is 18 years of age or older, but who has not yet attained 21 years of age in connection with a petition to make the necessary findings regarding special immigrant juvenile status, as specified, if the proposed ward consents. This bill would also authorize a court to extend a guardianship of the person of a ward beyond 18 years of age, as specified, if the ward so requests or consents. The bill would also provide that a guardianship of the person terminates after the ward attains majority unless the ward consents to, or requests the extension of, the guardianship of the person until he or she is 21 years of age, as specified."
