    "content": "Several European countries currently contribute military forces to U.S.-ledcoalition operations to stabilize Iraq, one year after the start of the war against former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Many European governments have sent troops to Iraq despite strong domestic opposition, although the level ofopposition, as measured by opinion polls, varies from country to country and can show changes over time. TheMarch2004 terrorist attacks in Madrid and the announcement by the new Spanish government that it would likely removeSpanish troops from Iraq by July 2004 have raised questions about the sustainability of other countries' troopdeployments. This report surveys selected public opinion indicators in key European coalition countries. It maybeupdated as new polling data becomes available.
