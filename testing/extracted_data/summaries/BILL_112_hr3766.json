    "content": "Jeremy Bell Act of 2011 - Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit an employer from directing, causing, persuading, inducing, or enticing the travel of an employee in one state to employment in another state if the employer knows that the employee engaged in sexual conduct with a person under age 18 that would constitute a felony where such conduct occurred during the course of employment. Sets penalties for violations. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize a private or public elementary or secondary school, a local educational agency, or a state educational agency to receive funds under such Act only if it has in effect a policy that ensures that every individual employed by it has undergone a fingerprint-based check of the national crime information databases and, where possible, of state criminal history databases. Conditions a state's receipt of funds under such Act on enforcement of a state law and policy that ensures that: (1) individuals employed at a school located in the state report to law enforcement officials any incidents of sexual conduct involving a minor and an individual employed at any school in the state, (2) employees who fail to report such incidents are penalized. (3) the state makes available in an interstate clearinghouse to schools, local educational agencies, and state educational agencies the identity of any individual who was so reported and whose employment was terminated as a result. And (4) such information is only made available to schools, local educational agencies, and state educational agencies, not the general public."
