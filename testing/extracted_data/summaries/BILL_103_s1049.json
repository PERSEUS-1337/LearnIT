    "content": "Lechuguilla Cave Protection Act of 1993 - Withdraws the Lechuguilla Cave Protection Area, New Mexico, from all forms of appropriation or disposal under the public land, mining, and material disposal laws and from operation of mineral and geothermal leasing laws. Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from permitting any new drilling within the Protection Area until the earlier of the effective date of a record of decision regarding the proposal to drill analyzed in the Dark Canyon Environmental Impact Statement or 12 months after enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to suspend other activities under mineral or geothermal leases to prevent an adverse impact on significant cave resources of Carlsbad Caverns National Park and the Protection Area. Requires the Secretary to seek the agreement of the holder of a mineral or geothermal lease for termination of such lease or for restrictions on activities on covered lands to protect significant cave resources and, if an agreement is not reached, to take appropriate protective steps. Directs the Secretary to take additional steps to protect significant cave resources of Carlsbad Caverns National Park and the Protection Area, such as limiting or prohibiting access to or across Federal lands or prohibiting removal of any mineral, geological, or cave resources except for scientific purposes. Requires the Secretary to inform specified congressional committees of the need of additional protection authority."
