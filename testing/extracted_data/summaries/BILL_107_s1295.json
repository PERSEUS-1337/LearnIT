    "content": "Amends the Federal criminal code to revise the requirements for procurement of products of Federal Prison Industries (FPI). Directs a Federal agency that has a requirement for a specific product listed in the current edition of the FPI catalog to: (1) provide a copy of the required notice to FPI at least 15 days before the issuance of a solicitation of offers for procurement of such product, (2) use competitive procedures. And (3) consider a timely offer from FPI for award in accordance with the specifications and evaluation factors specified in the solicitation. Requires the agency to: (1) enter into negotiations with FPI on a contract for the purchase of the product on a non-competitive basis if the Attorney General determines it is unreasonable to expect that FPI would be selected on a competitive basis and it is necessary to award the contract to FPI to maintain essential work opportunities or to permit diversification under specified circumstances. And (2) award the contract to FPI if the contracting officer determines that FPI can meet the agency's requirements in a timely manner, at a fair and reasonable price. Directs FPI to concentrate any effort to produce a new product, or to expand significantly the production of an existing product, on products that are otherwise produced with non-US labor. Prohibits: (1) the board of FPI from approving a proposal for inmates to provide a service in which an inmate worker has access to specified sensitive information, and (2) requiring subcontracting with FPI."
