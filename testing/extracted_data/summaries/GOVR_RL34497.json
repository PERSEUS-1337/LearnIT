    "content": "In August 2007, Congress authorized the establishment of the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E) within the Department of Energy (DOE) as part of the America COMPETES Act (P.L. 110-69). Modeled on the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), ARPA-E would support transformational energy technology research projects with the goal of enhancing the nation's economic and energy security. Congress authorized $300 million for ARPA-E in FY2008 and \"such sums as are necessary\" for FY2009 and FY2010. Congress subsequently appropriated no funds for FY2008. The Bush Administration requested no funds for ARPA-E in FY2009, and took no actions to begin its operations. In the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5), Congress provided ARPA-E initial funding of $400 million which supplemented FY2009 funds of $15 million (P.L. 111-8). As a result, ARPA-E's received its initial funding of $415 million in FY2009. The ARRA funds are available for obligation until September 30, 2010. The Obama Administration requested $10 million for ARPA-E in FY2010. The House Committee on Appropriations declined to provide this funding. No Senate action has taken place. Now that ARPA-E has received its initial funding, concerned members of Congress might wish to oversee its implementation to ensure that it achieves its goals. Several management design elements to monitor include the timely appointment of a director for ARPA-E, recruitment of highly qualified technical Program Managers familiar with the DARPA process, maintenance of autonomy from DOE's current activities, and sufficient funding and organizational flexibility. One concern is that the minimum number of scientific, engineering, and professional personnel required by the America COMPETES Act, 70, may be too high, at least in the initial stages, given ARPA-E's budget of $415 million. On April 27, 2009, the Obama Administration announced the \"launch\" of ARPA-E and its initial solicitation for concept papers due June 2009. DOE expects to award $150 million of its $415 million FY2009 budget in response to this solicitation. No information was provided regarding ARPA-E's organization or staffing, or the amount of its $415 million FY2009 budget that will be used to fund those activities. Besides overseeing the establishment of ARPA-E and its funding, an issue for Congress is how ARPA-E will differ from existing DOE Office of Science activities, including the new Energy Frontier Research Centers, the DOE energy technology offices, and the Energy Innovation Hubs proposed in the FY2010 budget. In addition, several bills introduced in Congress would either provide ARPA-E with additional authority or a source of funds, or require the Secretary of Energy to monitor its interaction with other proposed DOE research and development organizations."
