    "content": "P.L. 106-58 (H.R. 2490), signed by the President September 29, 1999, to fund the Department of the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President, several independent agencies and to providepartial funding for the U.S. Postal Service. The act funds the accounts at $27.99 billion, includingmandatories (before scorekeeping by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)). The consolidatedFY2000 funding measure, P.L. 106-113 , signed November 29, 1999, requires a cut by 0.38% in allaccounts. The administration's budget, to be submitted in early February, will contain a report onthe exact amounts of cuts for each of the accounts. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2490 would have funded the accounts at $27.77 billion and the House at $27.8 billion. The President's FY2000 budget, submitted February 1, 1999, requesteda funding level of $27.997 billion for the mandatory and discretionary accounts. This is an increaseover the FY1999 level enacted at just under $27 billion in regular appropriations, with additionalemergency funding. CBO scores the total for the FY2000 funding at $28.2 billion. The mandatoriesare $14.5 billion and the discretionary funding are $13.7 billion. In summary, P.L. 106-58 , prior to the across-the-board cut, funds the Department of Treasury at $12,354.6 million, which is $ 282.6 million less than the FY1999 enacted (which includedemergency funding), $21.5 million less than requested, $165 million more than the House passed,and $120 million more than the Senate passed for FY2000. One principle point of difference is thefunding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Both the House and Senate would have substantiallycut funding in several of the IRS accounts (See Table 4 for specifics). Although the total appropriation for the U.S. Postal Service equals the request by the Administration, only $29 million of the $93.4 million is available in FY2000. The remainder willbe delayed until FY2001. Title III of the Treasury appropriation funds the Executive Office of the President and accounts entitled, \"Funds Appropriated to the President.\" Under the act, those accounts total $645.5 million. That funding level is $6 million more than the President's request, $9.3 million less thanHouse-enacted, and $75.4 million more than Senate-enacted. Both the House- and Senate-passedversions would have funded the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) at about $10million over the request. The major differences between the chamber action and the act are in theFunds Appropriated to the President, which are funds the ONDCP transfers to other entities for drugcontrol efforts. The independent agencies are funded at $14.9 billion. That is $9.1 million less than requested, $16.6 million more than House-enacted and $2.5 million more than Senate-enacted. Funding for theGeneral Services Administration and the National Archives and Records Administration representthe largest differences.
