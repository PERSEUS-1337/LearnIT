    "title": "An act to add Part 9.5 (commencing with Section 2500) to Division 2 of the Labor Code, relating to grocery workers.",
    "content": "Existing law regulates various aspects of the workplace and employee safety and health. This bill, upon a change in control of a grocery establishment, would require an incumbent grocery employer to prepare a list of specified eligible grocery workers for a successor grocery employer, and would require the successor grocery employer to hire from this list during a 90-day transition period. The bill would require the successor grocery employer to retain eligible grocery workers for a 90-day period, prohibit the successor grocery employer from discharging those workers without cause during that period, and, upon the close of that period, require the successor grocery employer to consider offering continued employment to those workers. The bill would exempt a grocery establishment located in a food desert from the bill\u2019s requirements, as provided. The bill would provide that a collective bargaining agreement may supersede these requirements and that these provisions do not preempt any local ordinances that provide equal or greater protection to eligible grocery workers. This bill would provide that its provisions are severable."
