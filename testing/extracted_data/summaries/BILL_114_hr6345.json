    "content": "TPS Reform Act of 2016 This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to revise the criteria for designation of a foreign state as eligible to have its citizens be given temporary protected status (TPS) in the United States. Such revisions include the following: (1) such a foreign state shall be designated by an Act of Congress rather than by the Department of Justice. (2) such Act must find that an environmental disaster in such a foreign state is immediately life-threatening. (3) such Act may provide for early termination of a foreign state's designation. (4) such Act shall include an estimate of the number of a foreign state's nationals who are TPS eligible, their US immigration status, and a time period for the effectiveness of the designation of not more than 18 months. And (5) an alien lacking lawful immigration status shall be ineligible for TPS."
