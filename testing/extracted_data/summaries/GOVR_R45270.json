    "content": "Child welfare services are intended to prevent the abuse or neglect of children; ensure that children have safe, permanent homes; and promote the well-being of children and their families. For FY2018, an estimated $9.5 billion in federal support was made available for child welfare purposes. Comparable funding for FY2017 is estimated at $9.3 billion. At least $100 million of the FY2018 increase was provided as discretionary appropriations intended to address the impact of parental substance abuse on children and the child welfare system and to help implement the Family First Prevention Services Act (Div. E., Title VII, of P.L. 115-123). About $37 million in additional discretionary funding was provided to enable the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to provide full incentive payments to states that are increasing the rate at which children who are otherwise expected to remain in temporary foster care are placed in permanent adoptive families or with a legal guardian. Finally, mandatory funding made available under the Title IV-E foster care, prevention, and permanency program is expected to increase by some $111 million in FY2018. The bulk of this increase is expected to provide ongoing assistance to children who leave foster care for permanent adoptive or guardianship families. Spending on foster care is not projected to grow and Title IV-E funding for prevention activities (as provided for by the Family First Prevention Services Act) is not available before FY2020. FY2018 began on October 1, 2017, but full funding levels for it were not determined until enactment, on March 23, 2018, of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141). In the interim, funding to continue child welfare programs in FY2018 was provided via short-term funding measures, including P.L. 115-56 (through December 8, 2017), P.L. 115-90 (through December 22, 2017), P.L. 115-96 (through January 19, 2018), P.L. 115-120 (through February 8, 2018), and P.L. 115-123 (until March 23, 2018)."
