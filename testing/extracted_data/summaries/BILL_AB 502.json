    "content": "Existing law, the Dental Practice Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of registered dental hygienists, registered dental hygienists in extended functions, and registered dental hygienists in alternative practice by the Dental Hygiene Committee of California. Existing law authorizes a registered dental hygienist in alternative practice to practice pursuant to specified provisions of law as, among other things, an independent contractor or an employee of a specified clinic. Existing law, the Moscone-Knox Professional Corporation Act, prohibits a professional corporation from rendering professional services in this state without a currently effective certificate of registration issued by the governmental agency regulating the profession in which the corporation is or proposes to be engaged and excepts any professional corporation rendering professional services by persons duly licensed by specified state entities from that requirement. Existing law authorizes specified healing arts licensees to be shareholders, officers, directors, or professional employees of a designated professional corporation, subject to certain limitations relating to ownership of shares. However, existing law specifies that it does not limit employment by a designated professional corporation to only those healing arts licensees and authorizes any healing arts licensee to be employed to render professional services by a designated professional corporation. This bill would additionally except any professional corporation rendering professional services by persons duly licensed by the Dental Hygiene Committee of California from the certificate of registration requirement. The bill would authorize registered dental assistants, licensed dentists, registered dental hygienists, and registered dental hygienists in extended functions to be shareholders, officers, directors, or professional employees of a registered dental hygienist in alternative practice corporation. The bill would, in the Dental Practice Act, authorize a registered dental hygienist in alternative practice to practice as an employee of a professional corporation, as specified. The bill would make it unprofessional conduct to violate, attempt to violate, assist in or abet the violation of, or conspire to violate, specified provisions regarding registered dental hygienists in alternative practice corporations, the Moscone-Knox Professional Corporation Act, or any regulations adopted under those laws. The bill would require a licensee employed by, or practicing in, a registered dental hygienist in alternative practice corporation to practice within the scope of their license and be subject to all applicable licensure provisions in their respective practice act. The bill would require the bylaws of a registered dental hygienist in alternative practice corporation to include a provision requiring the capital stock of a disqualified or deceased person to be sold to specified parties within a specified period of time. The bill would also require such a corporation to provide security for claims by patients."
