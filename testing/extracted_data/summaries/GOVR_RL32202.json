    "content": "When the Soviet Union collapsed in late 1991, it reportedly possessed more than 27,000 nuclear weapons, and these weapons were deployed on the territories of several of the former Sovietrepublics. All of the nuclear warheads have now been moved to Russia, but Russia still has around5,500 strategic nuclear weapons and perhaps as many as 12,000 warheads for nonstrategic nuclearweapons. Many analysts in the United States and Russia have expressed concerns about the safety, security, and control over these weapons. Some of these concerns focus on Russia's nuclearcommand and control structure. Financial constraints have slowed the modernization andreplacement of many aging satellites and communications links, raising the possibility that Russiamight not be able to identify a potential attack or communicate with troops in the field if an attackwere underway. Some fear that the misinterpretation of an ambiguous event might lead to thelaunch of nuclear weapons. Some also expressed concern that the year 2000 computer bug couldaffect Russia's command and control system, but it did not. Some concerns are also focused on the safety and security of nuclear warheads in storage facilities in Russia. Press reports and statements by Russian officials about possible missingwarheads have added to these concerns. However, General Eugene Habiger, former Commander-in-Chief of theU.S. Strategic Command, stated that he had no major concerns about security at Russiannuclear storage facilities after he visited several storage sites in Oct. 1997 and June 1998. The United States and Russia are cooperating in many fora to improve the safety, security, and control over Russia's nuclear weapons and materials. Through the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative ThreatReduction (CTR) Program, the U.S. Department of Defense has provided assistance worth nearly$2 billion to help Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus safely transport and store weapons andeliminate launchers under the START Treaties. The Department of Energy's Materials Protection,Control and Accounting Program is helping Russia and other former Soviet republics secure nuclearmaterials at research and other facilities in the former Soviet Union. The nations have also heldbilateral meetings to identify ways in which they might cooperate to improve security and resolveconcerns. This report will not be updated. For current information on U.S. and Russian efforts to address concerns about the safety and security of Russian nuclear weapons and materials see CRS Report RL31957 , Nonproliferation and Threat Reduction Assistance: U.S. Programs in the Former SovietUnion."
