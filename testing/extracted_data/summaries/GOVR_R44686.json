    "content": "The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is the lead federal agency charged with administering and enforcing federal laws related to firearms and explosives commerce. ATF is also responsible for investigating arson cases with a federal nexus, and criminal cases involving the diversion of alcohol and tobacco from legal channels of commerce. As an agency within the Department of Justice (DOJ), ATF is funded through an annual appropriation in the Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations Act. For FY2017, Congress has appropriated $1.259 billion for ATF in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31), about $47.5 million less than the Obama Administration's budget request and $18.6 million more than the FY2016 appropriation. This report chronicles the FY2017 appropriations cycle for ATF and other gun control initiatives, including legislative histories for several ATF funding limitations related to firearms. It also includes discussion of year-to-year data trends that could affect ATF workloads, such as the number and type of federal firearms licensees (FFLs), growth in the civilian gun stock, and firearms-related violent crime. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request included $1.306 billion for ATF. This amount was $66.1 million above the FY2016 appropriation. This proposed increase included $11.8 million in technical and base adjustments to anticipate inflation and other variable costs and $54.3 million in budget enhancements. As part of President Barack Obama's gun safety initiative, these budget enhancements included $35.6 million for ATF to hire 80 additional special agents and 120 industry operations investigators; $4 million (including 8 positions) to upgrade the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN) hardware and software; $5.7 million and 22 positions to process firearms and explosives licenses and National Firearms Act (NFA) applications, and expand the use of firearms trace data by ATF and other federal and state law enforcement agencies; and $9 million to integrate ATF's case management systems into a single system. The FY2017 budget request called for the repeal of two limitations that prevent ATF from (1) requiring FFLs to inventory their gun stocks prior to inspection and (2) changing an administrative definition of \"curios and relics.\" In P.L. 115-31, Congress maintained these and other firearms-related limitations/provisos (appropriations riders) described in an Appendix to this report. Two additional provisos appear to have been made permanent law by the inclusion of \"words of futurity,\" like \"hereafter,\" \"henceforward,\" and \"this and any other fiscal year.\" In addition, President Obama's gun safety initiative included $35 million for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to address an increase in firearms background checks through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS); $55 million for grants to state, local, tribal, and territorial authorities under the National Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP) and NICS Amendments Record Improvement Program (NARIP; P.L. 110-180); and $10 million for gun violence prevention research. NICS was established in 1998 by the FBI to facilitate an electronic background check process to determine firearms eligibility of unlicensed, private persons seeking to acquire firearms from FFLs, or firearms permits and licenses from state authorities. Through both NCHIP and NARIP, the DOJ provides grants to states, tribes, and territories to improve NICS access to records on persons prohibited from acquiring firearms under federal or state law. According to the Explanatory Statement accompanying H.R. 244 (P.L. 115-31), Congress provided funding to support NICS fully, and $73 million for NICS improvement grants. However, Congress did not provide the funding requested for gun violence prevention research. In addition, Congress maintained a limitation in P.L. 115-31 that continues to prohibit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other agencies from using appropriated funding to advocate or promote gun control."
