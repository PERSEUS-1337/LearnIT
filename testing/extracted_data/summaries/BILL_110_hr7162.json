    "content": "Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative Improvement Act of 2008 - Directs the Secretary of State to adjudicate US passport applications in an individualized, evidence-based manner. Requires the passport application adjudicatory process to be based on an assessment of individual circumstances and evidence. Prohibits an applicant's race, ethnicity, or ancestry from being taken into account in the passport application adjudicatory process. Requires: (1) an applicant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the applicant is a US citizen or national. (2) the preponderance of the evidence standard to be applied in a uniform and consistent manner to all passport applications. And (3) any determination that an applicant has not met the burden of proving US citizenship or nationality by a preponderance of the evidence to be made in writing, state the reasons for the determination, and be provided to the applicant in a timely manner. States that a birth certificate signed by a person authorized under state law to sign such a document, or a previously-issued US passport, shall constitute prima facie evidence of US citizenship or nationality and, absent individualized evidence that a birth did not take place in the United States, shall satisfy the preponderance of the evidence standard."
