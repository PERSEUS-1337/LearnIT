    "content": "District of Columbia Emergency Highway Relief Act - Requires the Federal share of the costs of certain highway projects within the District of Columbia during FY 1995 and 1996 to be up to 100 percent, as requested by the District. Includes as eligible a project for a route proposed for inclusion in, or designated as part of, the National Highway System or of regional significance for which the United States is or, before September 30, 1996, becomes obligated to pay the Federal share and with respect to which the District of Columbia certifies that sufficient funds are not available to pay the full non-Federal share of costs. Requires the District, by December 31, 1995, to establish a dedicated highway fund to pay the cost-sharing requirements under the Federal-aid highway program and to repay the increased Federal share of costs of eligible projects paid pursuant to this Act. Provides that such fund shall be comprised of receipts from motor fuel taxes and, if necessary, motor vehicle taxes and fees collected by the District. Requires the District to make repayments, by the end of each of FY 1996 through 1998, of the increased Federal share paid for such project or the Secretary of Transportation shall not approve any federal-aid highway project in the District. Requires the Comptroller General to audit and report to the Congress each year on the financial condition and operations of the fund. Requires the District to: (1) expeditiously process and execute contracts to implement the Federal-aid highway program in the District. (2) establish an independent revolving fund account for Federal-aid highway projects for the prompt payment of contractors completing Federal-aid highway projects in the District. And (3) ensure that necessary expertise and resources are available for planning, design, and construction of such projects. Authorizes the Secretary to require administrative and programmatic reforms by the District to ensure efficient management of the Federal-aid highway program in the District. Requires the Comptroller General to review and report to the Congress on the implementation of the requirements of this section."
