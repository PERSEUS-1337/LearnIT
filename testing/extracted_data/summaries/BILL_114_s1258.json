    "content": "Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2015 This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish certain programs to support distributed energy systems, which are energy sources and systems that: (1) produce electric or thermal energy close to the point of use using renewable energy resources or waste thermal energy, (2) generate electricity using a combined heat and power system, (3) distribute electricity in microgrids, (4) store electric or thermal energy, or (5) distribute or transfer thermal energy to building heating and cooling systems through a district energy system. DOE must establish: (1) a loan program to provide funding for deploying distributed energy systems to states and other government entities, institutions of higher education, and electric utilities. And (2) a technical assistance and grant program to disseminate information and provide technical assistance to nonprofit and profit entities for identifying, evaluating, planning, and designing distributed energy systems."
