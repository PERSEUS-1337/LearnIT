    "content": "The current debate about consular identification cards in the United States has centeredaround the matr\u00c3\u00adcula consular, the consular identification card issued by Mexican consulates toMexican citizens in the United States. In May 2003, the Treasury Department issued regulationsallowing acceptance of the cards as proof of identity for the purpose of opening a bank account, andthe cards are accepted for other purposes as well, including issuance of drivers licenses. Consular identification cards raise issues for domestic policy and foreign policy. Withrespect to domestic policy, supporters argue that acceptance of the cards is necessary in apost-September 11, 2001 America, where photo identification is required to conduct daily business. They maintain that the card is a secure and fraud-resistant document that improves security andbrings people into the open financial community where transactions can be monitored more easily. Opponents argue that the cards are not secure and are needed only by aliens who are illegally presentin the United States and serve to undermine U.S. immigration policy. In the area of foreign policy, supporters maintain that U.S. acceptance of the cards hasimproved bilateral relations with an important neighboring country. They argue that the cards helpU.S. officials to notify consulates of the detention of foreign nationals and improve the likelihoodthat U.S. citizens will have the benefit of consular notification. Opponents contend that regulationof the cards is necessary to reinforce immigration policy and to defend against terrorism. On February 10, 2005, the House passed H.R. 418 , the REAL ID Act of 2005 that would, among other things, establish standards for the issuance of drivers' licenses that wouldseem to preclude the acceptance of consular ID cards, The bill includes provisions that require adetermination that the applicant is lawfully present in the United States and that specify that anofficial passport is the only acceptable foreign identity document. This measure was attached by theHouse to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for FY2005 ( H.R. 1268 ) asDivision B on March 16, 2005. Following conference, H.R. 1268 was passed with thespecified provisions by the House and Senate in early May 2005, and it was signed into law ( P.L.109-13 ) on May 11, 2005. Last year, in November 2004, Congress passed the Transportation-Treasury Appropriationsfor FY2005 in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005 ( H.R. 4818 / P.L.108-447 ), after restoring funding for Treasury Department implementation of regulations permittingfinancial institutions to accept consular ID cards as identity documents for banking purposes. InDecember 2004, Congress also passed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of2004 ( S. 2845 / P.L. 108-458 ), with requirements that the Secretary of HomelandSecurity propose minimum standards for identification documents to be used by airline passengersand minimal standards for the issuance of drivers' licenses. This report will be updated as legislativedevelopments occur."
