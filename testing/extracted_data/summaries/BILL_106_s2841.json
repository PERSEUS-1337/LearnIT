    "content": "Prohibits agency heads from entering any service contracts until the OMB Director: (1) determines that the agency is making substantial progress toward meeting the requirements in the certification. Or (2) waives suspension of contracting authority in the interest of national security, extraordinary economic harm, or patient care. Requires the Comptroller General to monitor the compliance of any agency operating under a suspension of contracting authority. Requires each agency to establish, according to OMB guidelines, a centralized reporting system with respect to both contracting out and contracting in. Specifies frequency and contents on such reports. Requires every agency to file a separate annual report on the number of Federal employee positions and positions held by non-Federal employees under a contract that has been subject to public-private competition during the past fiscal year. Requires OMB to compile and submit all such reports to specified congressional committees for eventual publication on the Internet. Requires any agency decision to initiate or continue a privatization, outsourcing, contracting in, or contracting out for the performance of a function to be based on the results of a public-private competition process meeting certain requirements. Requires an agency to commence or continue the performance of a function by Federal employees if, under a specified cost comparison, the agency determines that at least a ten-percent cost savings would not be achieved by contractor performance of the function. Requires an agency either to conduct a new public-private competition or to convert the function to Federal employee performance, if a report indicates that, for two consecutive years, the actual cost of privatization, outsourcing, contracting in, or contracting out of a particular function exceeds the anticipated cost of contractor performance, or fails substantially to meet quality control standards. States that any resulting terminations for convenience may be undertaken without cost to the US Government. Requires an agency to subject to public-private competition each fiscal year an equivalent number of Federal employee positions and positions held by non-Federal employees under a contract. Directs the Secretary of Labor to survey the wages and quantifiable benefits provided by contractors to non-Federal personnel working in various occupations under contracts entered into during the two fiscal years immediately preceding enactment of this Act. Requires the OMB Director to review the survey and report to specified congressional committees on the extent to which the wages and quantifiable benefits paid by contractors are comparable to the wages and quantifiable benefits earned by Federal employees."
