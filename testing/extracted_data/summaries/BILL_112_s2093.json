    "content": "Preserving American Homeownership Act of 2012 - Requires the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Federal Housing Commissioner each to establish a pilot program to encourage the use of shared appreciation mortgage modifications that: (1) are designed to return greater cash flow to investors than other loss-mitigation activities, including foreclosure. And (2) result in positive net present value for the investor. Requires a shared appreciation mortgage modification to: (1) reduce by specified action the loan-to-value ratio of a covered mortgage to 95 within 3 years. (2) reduce the interest rate if such a principal reduction would not result in an affordable reduced monthly payment. (3) reduce to a specified amount any periodic payment the homeowner is required to make. (4) require the homeowner to pay the investor, after refinancing or selling the real property securing a covered mortgage, up to 50 of the amount of any increase in the value of the real property during a specified period. And (5) result in a positive net present value for the investor after taking into account the principal reduction and, if necessary, any interest rate reduction."
