    "content": "U.S. soybean growers and trade officials charge that Argentina and Brazil -- the UnitedStates' two major export competitors in international soybean markets -- gain an unfair trade advantage by routinelysavinggenetically-engineered (GE), Roundup Ready (RR) soybean seeds from the previous harvest (a practice prohibitedin the UnitedStates) for planting in subsequent years. These groups also argue that South American farmers pay no royalty feeson the saved seed,unlike U.S. farmers who are subject to a technology fee when they purchase new seeds each year. The cost savingto South Americansoybean growers on the technology fee alone nets out to about $8 to $9 per metric ton -- a considerable costadvantage over U.S.soybeans in the highly competitive international soybean market. This practice also raises concerns about theintellectual propertyrights (IPR) of Monsanto (the developer of RR technology). Commercial use of RR soybeans in Brazil remains illegal despite apparent widespread planting. A 1998government approval of theircommercial use remains suspended by court injunction, and resolution over their commercial legality is beingconsidered by anappellate court. However, two recent Presidential decrees have given temporary reprieve to the ban on planting andmarketing GEsoybeans through December 2004. The eventual outcome on commercial legalization of GE crops in Brazil mayhave importantconsequences for intellectual property rights, as well as for international trade in GE crops. This report will beupdated as needed."
