    "content": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148, PPACA) was signed into law on March 23, 2010. On March 30, 2010, PPACA was amended by P.L. 111-152, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. This report summarizes the key provisions in PPACA (hereafter referring to PPACA as amended by P.L. 111-152) that affect private health insurance. PPACA imposes new requirements on individuals, employers, and health plans; restructures the private health insurance market; sets minimum standards for health coverage; and provides financial assistance to certain individuals and, in some cases, small employers. In general, PPACA requires individuals, beginning in 2014, to maintain health insurance, with some exceptions. Individuals will be required to maintain minimum essential coverage, which includes eligible employer coverage, individual coverage, grandfathered plans, and federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, among others. Employers are not explicitly required to provide health benefits, although certain employers with more than 50 employees may be required to pay a penalty if either (1) they do not provide insurance, under certain circumstances, or (2) the insurance they provide does not meet specified requirements. Several insurance market reforms will be implemented, including some prior to full implementation in 2014, such as prohibition against lifetime benefit limits and coverage for preexisting health conditions for children. In addition to establishing new federal private health insurance standards, PPACA will enable and support states' creation by 2014 of \"American Health Benefit Exchanges.\" An exchange cannot be an insurer, but will provide eligible individuals and small businesses with access to insurers' plans in a comparable way. The exchange will consist of a selection of private plans as well as \"multi-state qualified health plans,\" administered by the Office of Personnel Management. Individuals will only be eligible to enroll in an exchange plan if they are not enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, or acceptable employer coverage as a full-time employee. Based on income, certain individuals may qualify for a tax credit toward their premium costs and a subsidy for their cost-sharing; the credits and subsidies will be available only through an exchange. States will have the flexibility to establish basic health plans for low-income individuals not eligible for Medicaid. Individual and small group coverage will be allowed to be offered through nonprofit, member-run health insurance companies. Such nonprofit insurers will be eligible for grants and loans distributed through the new Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program."
