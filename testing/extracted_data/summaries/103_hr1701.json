    "content": "Drinking Water and Public Health Enhancement Amendments of 1993 - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to enter into agreements with States having primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems to make capitalization grants to be deposited in drinking water treatment revolving funds. Permits such funds to be used only for providing financial assistance to public water systems for expenditures that will facilitate compliance with national primary drinking water regulations. Allocates 15 percent of amounts in such funds solely for assistance to systems which regularly serve fewer than 10,000 individuals. Permits assistance to systems not owned by governmental agencies, nonprofit organizations, or Indian tribes based on public health and financial needs and repayment ability. Sets forth requirements for agreements, including that no financial assistance will be provided to a public water system if expenses could be avoided or significantly reduced by consolidation of such system with another system. Sets forth provisions concerning State contributions to grants and fund administration. Directs the Administrator to conduct and report to the Congress on a financial needs assessment of all public water systems. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to Indian tribes and Alaskan Native villages which are ineligible for funding under this Act for public water system expenditures. Authorizes appropriations."
