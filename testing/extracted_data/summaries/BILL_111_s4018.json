And (2) certain corporations a tax deduction for dividends received which are reinvested in the United States to hire scientists and researchers engaged in life science research, fund life science research at research consortia, eligible small businesses, universities, and federal laboratories, or build or lease new facilities to be used primarily for qualified life sciences research. Terminates such tax incentives after 2015. Defines qualified initial life sciences research expenses as amounts, up to $150 million, attributable to the study of biology, biochemistry, biophysics, bioengineering, microbiology, genetics, or physiology, but excluding sociology or psychology. Directs the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to take necessary steps to ensure full compliance with the provisions of this Act and to report to Congress on the status of such compliance and related enforcement."
