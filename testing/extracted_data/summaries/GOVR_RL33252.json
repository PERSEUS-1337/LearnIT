    "content": "A \"grand coalition\" government of Germany's two largest parties, the Christian DemocratUnion/Christian Socialist Union (CDU/CSU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) led by CDUcandidate Angela Merkel took office on November 22, 2005, after the German federal election ofSeptember 18, 2005, had produced no clear winner. Some experts believe that the coalition will befragile, short lived, and will accomplish little with each side trying to gain political advantage overthe other. Such negative expectations are not shared by other analysts who believe that only sucha large coalition can implement potentially painful but needed economic and social reforms,assuming that it can overcome partisan politics. The most difficult and crucial areas on which the coalition must cooperate if the governmentis to succeed involve social and economic policy. Government success will be important, not justfor Germany, but also for Europe and global economic health. Experts believe that Angela Merkel,as Chancellor, wants to speed domestic social and economic reforms. It is not clear whether she willhave broader domestic support to do so, especially among the SPD base. Many observers expect more continuity than change in German foreign policy under the\"grand coalition\" government. On most issues, the CDU/CSU and the SPD are not far apart.Germany is expected to continue to give priority to multilateral approaches to solving internationalproblems. Many expect Chancellor Merkel to balance traditional strong Franco-German cooperationwithin the EU with closer ties to the United Kingdom, and other countries such as Italy, Spain, andPoland. She is expected to pursue European integration as a corollary rather than in opposition to thetransatlantic partnership. U.S. officials and many experts hope for improvement in U.S.-German bilateral relationsunder the Merkel-led government. Merkel has given priority to reducing the strains in transatlanticrelations, as well as improving negative German public opinion regarding the United States. The newGerman government is unlikely to fundamentally change the German stand on Iraq, meaning thatit will provide some financial and training assistance outside Iraq, but no military personnel on theground. It is likely to continue to take a lead in efforts to stabilize Afghanistan. Chancellor Merkelis expected to continue Germany's domestic and international efforts to combat terrorism. TheUnited States, Germany, and the EU are working together to oppose Iran's development of nuclearweapons. Chancellor Merkel has indicated that she will not support a lifting of the EU armsembargo against China, which the United States also opposes. A number of differences are likelyto continue even under the Merkel government, such as on the treatment of terror suspect prisoners,extra-judicial \"renditions,\" environmental policy, and the International Criminal Court. ChancellorMerkel's first official visit to Washington and her talks with President Bush on January 13, 2006,were designed to demonstrate that a new positive chapter had opened in bilateral relations, althoughdifferences were discussed candidly. The two leaders agreed on most points, including the urgencyof addressing Iran's nuclear ambitions. This report will be updated."
