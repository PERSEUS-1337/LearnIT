    "title": "SB 407",
    "content": "Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services, including comprehensive perinatal services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. Existing law, to the extent that federal financial participation is available, requires that midwifery services provided by a licensed midwife be covered under the Medi-Cal program. Existing law, the Licensed Midwifery Practice Act of 1993, provides for the licensure of midwives by the Medical Board of California. Existing law authorizes a licensed midwife to assist a woman only in normal pregnancy and childbirth, which is defined as meeting specified conditions, including, among others, a pregnancy in which there is an absence of any preexisting maternal disease or condition likely to affect the pregnancy and of significant disease arising from the pregnancy. Existing law requires the board to adopt regulations further specifying those conditions. Existing law establishes the Comprehensive Perinatal Services Program, administered by the State Department of Public Health, to maintain, to the extent resources are available, a permanent statewide community-based comprehensive perinatal system to provide care and services to low-income pregnant women and their infants who are considered underserved in terms of comprehensive perinatal care. Existing law generally authorizes a health care provider to employ or contract specified practitioners, including physicians and certified nurse midwives, for the purpose of providing comprehensive perinatal services. This bill would additionally authorize a health care provider to employ or contract licensed midwives for the purpose of providing comprehensive perinatal services. The bill would provide that, on the effective date of the regulations adopted by the board pursuant to the provisions described above, a licensed midwife shall be eligible to serve as a \u201ccomprehensive perinatal provider,\u201d as defined. The bill would declare that its provisions shall not be construed to revise or expand the scope of practice, as defined, of licensed midwives. The bill would require the State Department of Health Care Services to commence, no later than March 1, 2016, the revision of existing regulations as it determines are necessary for the implementation of this bill."
