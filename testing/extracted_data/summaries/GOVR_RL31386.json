    "content": "The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), signed by President George Bush on December 17, 1992, has been in effect since January 1994. After eight years of implementation, thefull effects of NAFTA on the U.S. economy are still unclear. There are numerous indications thatNAFTA has achieved many of the trade and economic benefits that proponents claimed it wouldbring, although there have been adjustment costs. However, there is not enough evidence to quantifythe impacts on specific U.S. industries. Some studies show that the agreement has had an overallpositive effect on the U.S. economy, but that some industries have experienced losses. As the UnitedStates considers further free trade initiatives with Latin American countries, the effects of NAFTAmay provide policymakers some indication of how these initiatives might affect U.S. industries andthe overall U.S. economy. Most of the trade effects related to NAFTA are due to changes in U.S. trade and investment patterns with Mexico. At the time of NAFTA implementation, the U.S.-Canada Free TradeAgreement already had been in effect for five years and some industries in the United States andCanada were already highly integrated. Since NAFTA, the automotive, textile, and apparelindustries have experienced some of the more significant changes in trade flows, which may alsohave affected U.S. employment in these industries. U.S. trade with Mexico has increasedconsiderably more than U.S. trade with other countries, and Mexico has become a more significanttrading partner with the United States since NAFTA implementation. Consequently, Mexico's shareof total U.S. trade has increased while that of other countries has decreased. Some data on U.S.imports suggest that Mexico may be supplying the U.S. market with goods that may have otherwisebeen supplied by Asian countries. Not all changes in trade patterns since 1994, however, can be attributed to NAFTA becausetrade was also affected by other unrelated economic factors such as economic growth in the UnitedStates and Mexico, and currency fluctuations. Also, trade-related job gains and losses since NAFTAmay have accelerated trends that were ongoing prior to NAFTA and may not be totally attributableto the trade agreement. To address concerns about worker dislocations related to NAFTA, Congress included two employment adjustment assistance programs in the implementing legislation: the NAFTATransitional Adjustment Assistance (NAFTA-TAA) Program and the U.S. Community Adjustmentand Investment Program (USCAIP). The NAFTA-TAA program is now part of a new consolidatedTrade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program passed under the Trade Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-210 ). The NAFTA-TAA program provides assistance, such as employment services and training, toworkers who have lost their jobs because of increased import competition or by production shifts. The USCAIP provides assistance to communities with significant job losses due to changes in tradepatterns with Canada or Mexico. While the programs have been successful in providing assistanceto communities who have had significant job losses, the overall effectiveness of the programs hasbeen limited. This report will be updated as events warrant."
