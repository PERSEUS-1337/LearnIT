    "content": "On November 26, 2007, President Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki co-signed the Declaration of Principles for a Long-Term Relationship of Cooperation and Friendship Between the Republic of Iraq and the United States of America, which set out a number of issues concerning, among other things, a security agreement between the United States and Iraq. On November 17, 2008, the Bush Administration concluded a security agreement providing the legal basis for the continued presence, operation, and eventual withdrawal of U.S. armed forces in Iraq once the U.N. Security Council mandate expired on December 31, 2008, and a strategic framework agreement to cover the overall bilateral relationship between the two countries. After the Bush Administration announced its intention to enter into these agreements, several Members of Congress demanded that Congress be involved in creating the planned agreements, from negotiation to implementation, and took action to ensure such involvement. Members proposed numerous pieces of legislation that would increase Congress's role in creating these agreements, and, after the agreements were finalized, their implementation, from calling for executive-branch consultation and reporting to requiring formal congressional approval. Congress has also conducted multiple hearings that have concerned the agreements, receiving clarification on many important issues from Bush and Obama Administration officials, and subject-matter experts. This has equipped Congress with information pertinent to deciding what further action can be taken to involve Congress more in the implementation and continued oversight of the agreements. Several options remain available to Congress to pursue a significant role in the agreements. The purpose of this report is to provide detailed information and analysis on the specific oversight activities of Congress concerning the U.S.-Iraq agreements signed on November 17, 2008. This report is divided into three main parts: the first provides context both in the United States and Iraq concerning the negotiation, execution, and early implementation of the agreements; the second describes in detail the actions taken by Congress thus far in response to the announcement, negotiation, and execution of the Iraq Agreements, consisting of legislative initiatives and congressional hearings; and the third provides options for further congressional action concerning Congress's role in (1) the implementation of the Iraq Agreements, and (2) the possible negotiation and execution of amendments to the Iraq Agreement and new agreements directly related to the implementation of the Iraq Agreements. For analysis of the U.S.-Iraq agreements within the context of U.S. constitutional law of international agreements, and the law of congressional oversight over international agreements, see CRS Report RL34362, Congressional Oversight and Related Issues Concerning the Prospective Security Agreement Between the United States and Iraq, by [author name scrubbed], [author name scrubbed], and [author name scrubbed]. This report will be updated when events warrant."
