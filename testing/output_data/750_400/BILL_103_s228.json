    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that 90 million Americans ride bicycles, with 20 million riding more than once a week. Between 1984 and 1988, 2,985 bicyclists in the United States died from head injuries, and 905,752 suffered head injuries treated in hospital emergency rooms. 41% of bicycle-related head injury deaths and 76% of injuries occurred among American children under age 15, costing society $7.6 billion annually. A child with a head injury will cost society $4.5 million on average. Universal use of bicycle helmets in the United States could have prevented 2,600 deaths and 757,000 injuries from head injuries, costing society $7.6 billion annually. However, only 5 percent of children in the nation who ride bicycles wear helmets. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration can provide grants to promote bicycle helmet use among individuals under 16. Grantees have flexibility in designing effective programs. Grants can be used to enforce helmet laws, provide helmets, educate on helmet importance for bicycle safety, or a combination of these activities. Bicycle helmets manufactured 9 months after this Act must conform to interim standards like the ANSI standard \"Z90.4-1984\" and the Snell Memorial Foundation standard \"B-90\" until a final standard is established. The interim standards for bicycle helmets include the ANSI standard \"Z90.4-1984\" and the Snell Memorial Foundation standard \"B-90\", with the Consumer Product Safety Commission having the authority to determine additional appropriate standards. A final standard must be established within 60 days of the enactment of this Act. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will establish a final standard for bicycle helmets within 60 days of the Act, including provisions to prevent helmets from coming off riders' heads. The final standard for bicycle helmets will be established based on interim standards, including provisions to prevent helmets from coming off riders' heads and address the risk of injury to children. Additional provisions may also be included. Sections 7 and 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act will not apply to this proceeding. The final standard for bicycle helmets will include provisions to prevent helmets from coming off riders' heads and address the risk of injury to children. Additional provisions may also be added. Sections 7 and 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act will not apply to this proceeding, and the final standard will take effect one year after issuance. Until then, non-conforming helmets will not meet the interim standard required under subsection (a)(1). The final standard for bicycle helmets, developed under subsection (c), will take effect one year after issuance. Non-conforming helmets will be considered in violation of a consumer product safety standard until the final standard is in place. Authorization of appropriations for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration grant program: $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, and $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1996. Definition of \"approved bicycle helmet\" includes meeting interim and final standards."
