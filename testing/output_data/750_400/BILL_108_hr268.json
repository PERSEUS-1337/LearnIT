The United States Weather Research Program, established under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Authorization Act of 1992, focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation (snow and rain), accelerating weather forecast improvements, and prioritizing areas for quick progress with significant impact. The United States Weather Research Program, established in 1992, focuses on improving weather forecasts by leveraging existing investments, prioritizing areas for quick progress, setting collaborative goals, and providing research grants to universities and research institutions. The United States Weather Research Program, established in 1992, focuses on improving weather forecasts by setting collaborative goals and providing research grants to universities and research institutions. SEC. 3. PROGRAM RESEARCH PRIORITIES. The United States Weather Research Program's research priorities include improving hurricane forecasts for landfall location and strength, enhancing forecasts for heavy precipitation events like winter storms and rain storms, and improving flood forecasting and warning systems for inland flooding related to tropical cyclones. The United States Weather Research Program aims to enhance forecasts for winter storms, rain storms, floods, and high-impact weather events through better prediction methods. This includes improving flood forecasting by coupling precipitation forecasts with hydrologic prediction and enhancing forecasting and warning systems for inland flooding related to tropical cyclones. Additionally, efforts are being made to improve short and medium-range numerical weather predictions and warnings of high-impact weather events through the Hemispheric Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment (THORpex). The United States Weather Research Program aims to enhance forecasts for high-impact weather events through improved prediction methods, including conducting the Hemispheric Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment (THORpex) to fill observational gaps in the Northern Hemisphere and testing advanced data assimilation techniques in global models. Additionally, efforts are focused on identifying effective methods of delivering weather information and recommending ways to improve societal and economic impacts. The United States Weather Research Program aims to enhance forecasts for high-impact weather events through improved prediction methods, including conducting THORpex to fill observational gaps in the Northern Hemisphere and testing advanced data assimilation techniques in global models. Societal and economic impacts are also evaluated to identify effective ways of delivering weather information and assess the impacts of adverse weather on society and the economy. The United States Weather Research Program aims to assess social and economic impacts of adverse weather, evaluate useful weather information for decision makers, and conduct research to improve human conditions. Research concepts are tested at test bed centers to enhance forecasts for high-impact weather events. The United States Weather Research Program tests research concepts at test bed centers to improve forecasts for high-impact weather events and enable technology transfer to operational meteorologists. SEC. 4. INTERAGENCY PLANNING AND PROCESS. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration leads the US Weather Research Program, coordinating with other federal agencies and entities to develop a five-year plan addressing collaboration with universities, research needs, and weather information dissemination. The US Weather Research Program, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, focuses on collaborating with universities and research institutions, identifying social, economic, and military weather information needs, outlining dissemination methods, and transferring research results to forecasting operations. SEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must provide an annual report to the House Committee on Science and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The report includes the most recent five-year plan, federal agency roles and funding, and justifications for any plan changes. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must provide an annual report to Congress, including the most recent five-year plan, federal agency roles and funding, justifications for plan changes, and an assessment of plan objectives achievement. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the Office of Atmospheric Research of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration includes $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 and $15,500,000 for fiscal year 2005, with at least 50% allocated for grants to institutions of higher education. For fiscal years 2005 and 2006, $15,500,000 and $16,000,000 respectively are allocated for grants to institutions of higher education, with at least 50% designated for competitive, merit-reviewed grants. For fiscal year 2006, $16,000,000 is allocated for grants to institutions of higher education, with at least 50% designated for competitive, merit-reviewed grants."
