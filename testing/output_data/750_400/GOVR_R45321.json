    "content": "The Trump Administration requested $76.2 billion for the Department of Transportation (DOT) for FY2019, which is 8.6% less than the previous year. The proposed budget includes significant cuts in funding for various programs, such as zeroing out the BUILD grant program and reducing funding for public transportation and Amtrak. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for DOT in the FY2019 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for the Department of Transportation in the FY2019 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill, which is a 1.8% increase over the previous year. The Senate passed a bill providing $86.6 billion in new budget authority for DOT for FY2019, slightly above the previous year. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for the Department of Transportation in the FY2019 THUD appropriations bill, a 1.8% increase over the previous year. The Senate passed a bill providing $86.6 billion in new budget authority for DOT for FY2019, slightly above the previous year. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for the Department of Transportation in the FY2019 THUD appropriations bill, a 1.8% increase over the previous year. The Senate bill would likely result in a slight reduction in inflation-adjusted funding for DOT compared to its FY2018 level. DOT's funding arrangements are unusual compared to most federal agencies, with most of its funding coming from trust funds and taking the form of grants to states and local government authorities. The Department of Transportation's funding is unique compared to other federal agencies, with most of its budget coming from trust funds. Around two-thirds to three-fourths of its funding is mandatory, while one-third to one-fourth is discretionary. This funding structure is reflected in the breakdown of DOT's budgets in recent years. The Department of Transportation receives most of its funding from trust funds, with around two-thirds to three-fourths being mandatory and one-third to one-fourth discretionary. The Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund typically provide around 90% of DOT's annual funding. In FY2018, there was a significant increase in discretionary funding. In recent years, the Department of Transportation has relied heavily on two large trust funds, the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, for around 90% of its annual funding. However, in FY2018, there was a notable increase in discretionary funding, changing the funding proportion. Approximately 80% of DOT's funding is distributed to states, local authorities, and Amtrak. The funding from trust funds like the Airport and Airway Trust Fund is not clearly shown in DOT budget tables as it is categorized as discretionary budget authority. Around 80% of DOT's funding is given to states, local authorities, and Amtrak as grants. The Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for air traffic control, has a budget that is not primarily grant-based. The Department of Transportation (DOT) primarily provides funding to states, local authorities, and Amtrak in the form of grants. The Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for air traffic control, has a budget that is not grant-based. Most of DOT's funding comes from trust funds supported by taxes, with periodic reauthorizations of these taxes being crucial for funding DOT programs. Highway, transit, and rail programs are currently authorized through FY2020. The Department of Transportation (DOT) funding primarily comes from trust funds supported by taxes, with periodic reauthorizations of these taxes being crucial. The highway, transit, and rail programs are authorized through FY2020, but the federal aviation programs' authorization is set to expire in September 2018. DOT's nonemergency annual funding has increased from $70 billion in FY2012 to $86 billion in FY2018 in current-year dollars. The Department of Transportation's funding primarily comes from trust funds supported by taxes, with periodic reauthorizations being crucial. The authorization for federal aviation programs is set to expire on September 30, 2018, potentially affecting structure and funding levels. Inflation-adjusted funding for DOT peaked in FY2010 at $87.5 billion and declined until FY2015, then began rising again in FY2016. Funding in FY2016 and FY2017 was similar to FY2006 levels. In FY2010, DOT's inflation-adjusted funding peaked at $87.5 billion, declining until FY2015 before rising again in FY2016. Funding in FY2016 and FY2017 was similar to FY2006 levels, with lower inflation-adjusted funding from FY2012-FY2017 compared to FY2007-FY2011. Highway Trust Fund provides most federal highway and transit funding, mainly from federal motor fuels excise tax. Table 4 compares FY2019 appropriations for DOT to FY2018. In FY2010, DOT's inflation-adjusted funding peaked at $87.5 billion, declining until FY2015 before rising again in FY2016. Funding in FY2016 and FY2017 was similar to FY2006 levels, with lower inflation-adjusted funding from FY2012-FY2017 compared to FY2007-FY2011. Table 4 presents a selected account-by-account summary of FY2019 appropriations for DOT, compared to FY2018. Most federal highway and transit funding comes from the Highway Trust Fund, funded mainly by the federal motor fuels excise tax. Congress has transferred about $143 billion from the fund due to annual expenditures exceeding revenues. The federal motor fuels excise tax (\"gas tax\") funds the Highway Trust Fund, with annual expenditures exceeding revenues. Congress has transferred $143 billion from the general fund to keep the trust fund solvent due to the tax not being raised since 1993. The federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993, leading to a shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund. To keep the fund solvent, about $143 billion was transferred from the Treasury's general fund during FY2008-FY2016. The tax is a fixed amount per gallon of fuel sold, regardless of the fuel cost, resulting in 18.3 cents per gallon of gasoline and 24.3 cents per gallon of diesel. Inflation and increasing fuel efficiency have diminished the value of the gas tax. The Highway Trust Fund receives 18.3 cents for each gallon of gasoline and 24.3 cents for each gallon of diesel sold. The value of the gas tax has been reduced by inflation and increasing fuel efficiency. The Congressional Budget Office predicts flat gasoline consumption through 2024 due to improved fuel efficiency offsetting increased miles driven. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts flat gasoline consumption through 2024 due to increased fuel efficiency in the U.S. passenger fleet. This is expected to offset the rise in miles driven, resulting in Highway Trust Fund revenues of $39 billion to $41 billion annually from FY2018 to FY2027. Congress allocated $1.5 billion for national infrastructure investment grants (BUILD Transportation grants) for FY2018. Congress allocated $1.5 billion for national infrastructure investment grants (BUILD Transportation grants) for FY2018. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $750 million, while the Senate-passed bill would provide $1 billion. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $1 billion for Transportation grants in FY2018, noting concerns about DOT's selection criteria for grant recipients. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $1 billion for Transportation grants in FY2018. The committee report prohibits DOT from using an applicant's willingness to create new sources of nonfederal revenue as a selection criterion for projects receiving grants. The TIGER grant program, originating from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, is a discretionary grant program aimed at addressing infrastructure investment. The TIGER grant program, originating from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, is a discretionary grant program intended to address criticisms of federal transportation funding structure. The committee report prohibits DOT from using certain selection criteria for projects receiving grants. The TIGER grant program aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding by distributing funds to projects with national or regional impacts and allowing projects in different modes to compete based on comparative benefit. An example of these challenges is Amtrak's Gateway Program on the Northeast Corridor rail line. The Gateway Program, a project on the Northeast Corridor rail line, faces challenges due to federal transportation funding being divided by mode, making it difficult for projects in different modes to compete for funds based on comparative benefit. The program includes replacing a deteriorating tunnel under the Hudson River, benefiting Amtrak passengers from Washington, DC, to Boston, MA. The Gateway Program involves replacing a deteriorating tunnel under the Hudson River on the Northeast Corridor rail line. The $13 billion-plus project is primarily funded by New York and New Jersey, benefiting Amtrak passengers from Washington, DC, to Boston, MA. The $13 billion-plus Gateway Program involves replacing a deteriorating tunnel under the Hudson River on the Northeast Corridor rail line. Funding for the project falls on New York and New Jersey, with the BUILD program providing grants for projects of national, regional, or metropolitan-area significance. The BUILD/TIGER program funds projects of national, regional, and metropolitan-area significance through competitive selection by DOT. Funding has mainly gone towards regional and metropolitan projects due to congressional direction for equitable distribution across geographic areas and transportation modes. Congress continues to support the program through annual DOT appropriations. Congress has directed that funds from the BUILD/TIGER program be distributed equitably across geographic areas, between rural and urban areas, and among transportation modes. The program has low minimum grant thresholds and is heavily oversubscribed, with critics arguing that grants have disproportionately gone to urban areas. Congress has mandated that at least 20% of funding should go to rural projects. The TIGER grant program is oversubscribed, with critics arguing that urban areas receive a disproportionate amount of funding. Congress has mandated that a percentage of funding should go to rural projects, with the allocation increasing from 20% to 33% in recent years. In FY2018, Congress increased funding for rural projects to 30%. The House Appropriations Committee recommended 33% for rural areas in FY2019, while the Senate bill maintained the 30% from the previous year. Additionally, 33% of funding should go to projects near major seaports, and the remaining 33% for urban areas over 200,000 in population. The House report directs that 33% of recommended funding should go to projects near major seaports, with the remaining 33% for urban areas over 200,000 in population. The BUILD/TIGER grant appropriation process has followed a pattern of requests from the Obama Administration, proposed cuts by the House, similar amounts proposed by the Senate, and final enacted amounts agreed upon by Congress. The BUILD/TIGER grant appropriation process has followed a pattern of requests from the Obama Administration, proposed cuts by the House, similar amounts proposed by the Senate, and final enacted amounts agreed upon by Congress. In FY2018, the Trump Administration requested no funding, but Congress funded the program. This pattern seems to be repeating in the FY2019 appropriations bills. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority. In FY2018, the Trump Administration requested no funding for the Essential Air Service (EAS) program, but Congress funded it. The program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority, with a mandatory annual authorization estimated at $140 million for FY2019, financed by overflight fees collected from commercial airlines by the FAA. These fees apply to international flights passing through U.S. airspace without landing or taking off in the United States. The EAS program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority, with a mandatory annual authorization estimated at $140 million for FY2019, financed by overflight fees collected from commercial airlines by the FAA. The Trump Administration requested $93 million in discretionary funding for the EAS program in FY2019, $62 million less than the program received in FY2018. The House committee bill recommended a $175 million discretionary appropriation. The Trump Administration requested $93 million in discretionary funding for the EAS program in FY2019, $62 million less than the program received in FY2018. The House committee bill recommended a $175 million discretionary appropriation, while the Senate-passed bill also recommends the same amount. This would result in a 10% increase over the FY2018 total funding level of $285.8 million. The EAS program funding for FY2019 is recommended at $175 million, a 10% increase from the FY2018 level of $285.8 million. The program aims to support air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes, with costs doubling since FY2008 due to airline route reductions and new community additions. The EAS program, with a total funding level of $285.8 million, aims to preserve commercial air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. Changes made in 2012 include capping the per-passenger subsidy and allowing smaller planes for communities with few daily passengers. Congress made changes to the Essential Air Service (EAS) program in 2012, including capping subsidies per passenger, limiting subsidies for communities close to hub airports, and allowing smaller planes for communities with few daily passengers. Supporters argue that the EAS program is essential to preserving airline service to small communities as promised during airline deregulation in 1978. Supporters of the Essential Air Service (EAS) program argue that it is necessary to maintain airline service to small communities as promised during airline deregulation in 1978. They believe that subsidizing air service in rural areas promotes economic development. Critics point out that the subsidy cost per passenger is high, many airports in the program have few passengers, and some are close to major airports. Critics of the Essential Air Service (EAS) program argue that the subsidy cost per passenger is high, many airports in the program have few passengers, and some are close to major airports. In 2008, Congress mandated railroads to implement positive train control (PTC) by the end of 2015 to prevent incidents caused by operator or dispatcher error. Freight railroads have spent billions to meet this requirement. Railroads were directed by Congress in 2008 to install positive train control (PTC) to prevent incidents caused by errors. Despite billions spent by freight railroads, most required tracks did not have PTC by the end of 2015. Congress extended the deadline to 2018, with an option for further extension to 2020 with approval from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). Funding has been provided to assist railroads with expenses. Despite billions spent by freight railroads, most required tracks did not have PTC by the end of 2015. Congress extended the deadline to 2018, with an option for further extension to 2020 with approval from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). Funding has been provided to assist railroads with expenses, including $50 million in FY2016, $199 million in FY2017 (for commuter railroads), and at least $250 million in FY2018. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request did not include any funding for the cost of PTC implementation. The Trump Administration did not include funding for PTC implementation in the FY2019 budget. The House-reported bill allocated $150 million for PTC projects, while the Senate-passed bill directed DOT to prioritize PTC projects for grants. The Senate-passed bill does not allocate a specific amount for PTC projects but directs DOT to prioritize them for grants from the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements grant program. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 restructured Amtrak's federal grants, providing separate funding for the Northeast Corridor and the national network, and authorized new grant programs for states, public agencies, and rail projects. The Reform and Investment Act of 2015 reauthorized Amtrak under P.L. 114-94, changing its federal grant structure. It now receives separate grants for the Northeast Corridor and the national network. Three new programs were authorized for intercity passenger rail development. The FY2019 budget requested $738 million for intercity passenger rail funding, all for grants to Amtrak. The Administration's FY2019 budget requested $738 million for intercity passenger rail funding, all for grants to Amtrak. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.9 billion for Amtrak, $800 million for two new grant programs, and $150 million for the Magnetic Levitation Technology Deployment Program. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.9 billion for Amtrak, $800 million for two new grant programs, and $150 million for the Magnetic Levitation Technology Deployment Program. The Senate bill would provide $1.9 billion for Amtrak and $565 million for three new grant programs, prioritizing PTC projects. The Senate bill would provide $1.9 billion for Amtrak and $565 million for three new grant programs, with a focus on prioritizing PTC projects. Congress historically provided little funding for intercity passenger rail development, except for brief appropriations in FY2009 and FY2010 for high-speed and intercity passenger rail grants. Congress historically provided minimal funding for intercity passenger rail development, except for brief appropriations in FY2009 and FY2010. Funding for intercity passenger rail development was limited from FY2011 to FY2016, with a brief increase in FY2017. From FY2011 to FY2016, Congress provided no funding for intercity passenger rail development, except for PTC implementation. In FY2017, Congress allocated $98 million for new intercity passenger rail grant programs, increasing to $863 million in FY2018. The Federal Transit Administration distributes the majority of its $13 billion funding to state and local transit agencies through formula-based programs. The Federal Transit Administration's funding of $13 billion is mainly allocated to state and local transit agencies through formula-based programs. The Capital Investment Grants program (CIG) is the largest discretionary grant program, funding new fixed-guideway transit lines and extensions. The Capital Investment Grants program (CIG) is the largest discretionary grant program, funding new fixed-guideway transit lines and extensions. It has three components: New Starts grants for projects over $300 million seeking over $100 million in federal funding, Small Starts grants for projects under $300 million seeking less than $100 million in federal funding, and Core Capacity grants for projects increasing the capacity of existing systems. New Starts grants are for capital projects over $300 million seeking more than $100 million in federal funding; Small Starts grants are for projects under $300 million seeking less than $100 million in federal funding; Core Capacity grants increase existing system capacity by at least 10%. An Expedited Project Delivery Pilot provides funding for eligible projects with a 25% federal share and public-private partnership support. The Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for Capital Investment Grants in FY2019, which is $1.6 billion less than the previous year. Grant funds for large projects are typically disbursed over several years, with a focus on projects with multiyear grant agreements signed in previous years that are now under construction. The Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for Capital Investment Grants in FY2019, $1.6 billion less than the previous year. Funding is mainly allocated to projects with existing full funding grant agreements signed in previous years. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $2.614 billion, slightly less than FY2018. The Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for Capital Investment Grants in FY2019, less than the previous year. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $2.614 billion, slightly less than FY2018. The Senate-passed bill would provide $2.553 billion. Congress has expressed concern regarding the Administration's stance toward the CIG program. The Trump Administration has not requested funding for any new transit projects in its FY2018 or FY2019 DOT budget requests, breaking with previous federal policy. Congress has expressed concern about the Administration's stance on the Capital Investment Grants program, which has led to a decrease in funding from $2.614 billion to $2.553 billion in the Senate-passed bill. The Trump Administration has taken the position that state and local governments should fund transit projects without federal assistance. Congress has not supported this policy and provided more funding than requested for the CIG program in FY2018. Congress has not supported the Administration's proposal to end federal assistance for new transit projects, providing more funding than requested for the CIG program in FY2018. Both the House-reported bill and the Senate-passed bill for FY2019 would also allocate more funding than requested for the CIG program, directing FTA to advance eligible projects through the program. The Senate Appropriations Committee report highlights FTA's non-compliance with GAO findings. The House-reported and Senate-passed bills for FY2019 allocate more than double the amount requested by FTA for the CIG program. The Senate Appropriations Committee report criticizes FTA for not complying with congressional directives and causing unnecessary delays for projects. The GAO found that FTA failed to comply with congressional directives for the CIG program due to lack of funding requests. Transportation for America criticized FTA for deliberately delaying transit projects despite the Administration's goal of reducing delays. Transportation for America criticizes FTA for unnecessary delays in transit project development, citing only $533 million of $2.3 billion provided by Congress for new projects has been issued. Project sponsors are facing increased costs due to prolonged review processes. FTA has only issued $533 million out of the $2.3 billion provided by Congress for new transit projects, causing delays and increased costs for project sponsors. The review process for funding applications is drawn out, leading to expired construction bids and the need for agencies to rebid projects. Despite allegations of delays, FTA denies intentionally prolonging the project review process. The FTA review process for funding applications has caused delays and increased costs for project sponsors. Bids for construction have expired before FTA completes its review, leading agencies to rebid projects. New Starts grants can cover up to 80% of project costs, but recent appropriations acts have limited the federal share to 51-60%. The House FY2019 bill includes a provision capping federal share at 50%. The FY2018 DOT appropriations act lowered the federal share limit for New Starts projects to 51%, and the House-reported FY2019 bill includes a provision capping it at 50%. Critics argue that the higher federal share for highway projects, typically 80%, makes them more attractive than public transportation projects. The House-reported FY2019 bill includes a provision capping the federal share for New Starts projects at 50%. Critics argue that the higher federal share for highway projects, typically 80%, makes them more attractive than public transportation projects. Advocates believe a higher local match requirement allows for more projects to be supported with limited funding. Advocates support a provision capping the federal share for New Starts projects at 50%, arguing it allows for more projects to be funded with limited resources. They believe a higher local match requirement encourages careful cost estimation and reduces the risk of cost overruns and low ridership. To estimate costs and benefits of transit projects more carefully, reducing risk of cost overruns and low ridership. Challenges to funding transportation infrastructure include federal funding distribution by mode and formula to states. Difficulty in amassing significant federal funding for projects involving multiple modes. Congress provides $55 billion annually for surface transportation programs, with the majority automatically allocated. The federal funding distribution for transportation infrastructure poses challenges for projects involving multiple modes, making it difficult for states to accumulate the necessary funds. This is exemplified by Amtrak's Gateway Program, specifically the Hudson Tunnel replacement project. The Amtrak's Gateway Program aims to enhance rail service between northern New Jersey and Manhattan by replacing bridges, expanding track capacity, and adding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The Gateway Program aims to increase rail capacity and reliability between northern New Jersey and Manhattan by replacing bridges, expanding track capacity, and adding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The estimated cost of the program is at least $24 billion. The Gateway Program aims to improve rail capacity between New Jersey and Manhattan by replacing bridges, expanding track capacity, and adding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The estimated cost of the program is at least $24 billion, with the new Hudson River Tunnel alone costing $11.1 billion. Funding for the project is expected to come from DOT programs for intercity and commuter rail traffic. The estimated cost of the new Hudson River Tunnel is $11.1 billion. Funding for the project is expected to come from DOT programs for intercity and commuter rail traffic, with limited funding available for intercity rail projects in recent years. The Capital Investment Grants program has more funding to award compared to other rail grant programs. In recent years, little funding has been available for intercity rail projects. The largest rail grant program in FY2017 had $68 million, increased to $593 million in FY2018. The Capital Investment Grants program has $2.6 billion in FY2018, with intense competition for funding. An agreement was reached in 2016 between DOT, Amtrak, and the States of New Jersey and New York to share costs for building the new Hudson Tunnel. The Trump Administration does not feel bound by the previous agreement to share costs for building the new Hudson Tunnel. Congress would need to provide the funding, as neither the House nor Senate Appropriations Committees mentioned the Gateway Program or Hudson. The costs of building the new Hudson Tunnel are to be shared by DOT/Amtrak, New Jersey/New Jersey Transit, and New York State. The Trump Administration does not feel obligated to the previous agreement, and Congress would need to provide the funding. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not mention the Gateway Program or Hudson Tunnel project in their FY2019 reports, but recommended significant funding for rail and transit grant programs that Gateway projects could be eligible for. Additionally, they suggested $240 million more for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor account than Amtrak requested for FY2019. The FY2019 THUD committee reports did not mention the Gateway Program or Hudson Tunnel project, but recommended significant funding for rail and transit grant programs that Gateway projects could be eligible for. Additionally, they proposed $240 million more for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor account than requested for FY2019. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized $1.5 billion over 10 years in grants to WMATA for maintenance and capital grants, to be matched by funding from DC, Maryland, and Virginia. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized $1.5 billion over 10 years in grants to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) for maintenance and capital grants, to be matched by funding from DC, Maryland, and Virginia. This funding is in addition to around $310 million WMATA receives under FTA formula programs. The FY2018 grant was noted as the final installment of the $1.5 billion commitment made by Congress in 2008, with the Administration requesting $120 million for this. The Senate Appropriation Committee's report noted that the FY2018 grant was the final installment of the $1.5 billion funding commitment made in 2008 for WMATA. The Administration requested $120 million for FY2019, while the House Appropriations Committee recommended $150 million and the Senate-passed bill would provide $150 million. The Senate Appropriation Committee's FY2019 report directed WMATA, local jurisdictions, and FTA to continue working on extending the authorization for this grant. The Administration requested $120 million for the grant to WMATA for FY2019, while the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate-passed bill recommended $150 million each. Both committees directed WMATA to work on extending the authorization for the grant and implementing wireless service throughout the rail system. WMATA is facing a maintenance backlog and has had several fatal incidents. WMATA is urged to continue implementing wireless service throughout the rail system. The agency is dealing with a maintenance backlog and has experienced fatal incidents, leading to questions about its safety culture. Mismanagement of federal funding has led to restrictions on WMATA's use of funds, with an audit in 2015 recommending changes to safety practices. Several fatal incidents, including one in January 2015, have raised concerns about WMATA's safety culture. Mismanagement of federal funding led to restrictions on WMATA's use of funds, with FTA assuming oversight of safety compliance practices in 2015. FTA continues to conduct inspections and lead safety oversight of WMATA. In 2015, FTA took over safety oversight of WMATA from the Tri-State Oversight Committee, conducting inspections and leading accident investigations. FTA also directed that federal funds received by WMATA be used to improve safety. In February 2017, FTA notified leaders of the three jurisdictions that it would withhold 5% of their FY2017 transit Urbanized Area formula funds until they create a new State Safety Oversight Program to replace the Tri-State Oversight. FTA took over safety oversight of WMATA from the Tri-State Oversight Committee in 2015, conducting inspections and leading accident investigations. In February 2017, FTA notified leaders of the three jurisdictions that it would withhold 5% of their FY2017 transit Urbanized Area formula funds until they create a new State Safety Oversight Program. The jurisdictions established a new safety oversight agency (the Metrorail Safety Commission) soon after, but it must be operational before FTA releases the funding. On September 6, 2018, FTA outlined the steps the new Metrorail Safety Commission must take to complete the transition of oversight. The Tri-State Oversight Committee was replaced by the Metrorail Safety Commission, which needs to be operational for FTA to release funding. FTA outlined steps for the Commission to transition oversight responsibilities. The National Transportation Safety Board recommended FRA oversee WMATA's rail operations instead of FTA, but Congress would need to act for this change. The National Transportation Safety Board recommended that FRA oversee WMATA's rail operations instead of FTA, but Congress would need to act for this change to happen."
