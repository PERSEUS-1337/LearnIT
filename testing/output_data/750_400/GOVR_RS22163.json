Many Members of Congress support a close transatlantic relationship with the European Union and NATO, viewing them as advancing U.S. interests, especially during the Cold War to counter the Soviet Union. Congressional interest in Europe now focuses on the need for like-minded partners. During the Cold War, a united Europe was seen as a way to counter the Soviet Union. Congressional interest in Europe now focuses on the need for like-minded partners in facing global challenges. Members of Congress have at times questioned the level of cooperation offered by Europe and whether it might constrain U.S. policy choices. During the Cold War, a united Europe was seen as a way to counter the Soviet Union. Congressional interest now focuses on the need for like-minded partners in facing global challenges. The U.S. Congress and Administrations strongly support NATO and the EU as pillars of the Euro-Atlantic community for promoting prosperity and security in Europe. The institutional pillars of the Euro-Atlantic community, NATO and the EU, have been successful in promoting prosperity and security in Europe. The U.S. Congress and Administrations strongly support these institutions to foster democratic states, military allies, and trading partners. The relationship between the United States and the EU is gaining significance as the EU's 28 member countries make common decisions. The relationship between the United States and the EU is growing in significance as the EU's 28 member countries make common decisions and formulate policies in various areas. The EU is also working on strengthening its Common Foreign and Security Policy and Common Security and Defense Policy. The EU's 28 member countries make common decisions and policies in various areas, including economic, social, law enforcement, and judicial matters at the EU institutions. Efforts are ongoing to strengthen the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP). NATO remains the primary security institution in the Euro-Atlantic community, with the United States playing a leading role. Members of Congress maintain a significant interest in NATO, which has undergone significant changes since the end of the Cold War. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO has added 12 new member states from Central and Eastern Europe. Discussions about the future role and capabilities of NATO have continued, especially in light of the conflict in Ukraine and tense relations with Russia. In 2014, leadership transitions occurred in Euro-Atlantic institutions, with EU-wide elections selecting 751 Members of the European Parliament for a new term. German MEP Martin Schulz was reelected as President of the Parliament. The conflict in Ukraine and tense relations with Russia have been central topics of discussion among NATO member states.

Bush Administration, with mostly constructive transatlantic relations over the past six years. Polls show that European perceptions of U.S. foreign policy under the Obama Administration remain relatively favorable, with mostly constructive transatlantic relations over the past six years. Both sides have encountered frustrations and reality checks in dealing with global challenges, pushing them towards common approaches. Challenges faced by the United States and Europe have led to cooperative approaches, but also frustrations. The crisis in Ukraine has caused a reevaluation of assumptions about European security, with the United States maintaining a leading role in NATO. After the Obama Administration's 2012 announcement of a \"re-balancing\" towards Asia, Europeans worried about U.S. focus shifting from Europe. The crisis in Ukraine prompted a reassessment of European security, with the U.S. still active in NATO and managing relations with Russia. The U.S. expects Europe to take on more responsibility for its security and play a leading role in regional and international issues. The U.S. continues to play a leading role in NATO and managing relations with Russia. Europe is expected to share the burden of its security, take a leading role in regional and international issues, and act as an effective partner in addressing common threats. Concerns remain about Europe's economic difficulties and declining defense spending. Europe is expected to share the burden of security, act as an effective partner in addressing common threats, and play a leading role in regional and international issues. However, concerns persist about Europe's economic difficulties, declining defense spending, and questions about its ability to deliver a coherent foreign policy. Continuing declines in defense spending and military capabilities, along with questions about Europe's ability to deliver a robust common foreign policy, are being assessed by U.S. officials and Members of Congress. The European financial crisis post-2008 global downturn has highlighted the unfinished nature of the EU, leading to tensions between member states. The debt crisis following the 2008-2009 global downturn exposed the EU's unfinished nature, causing tensions among member states. Despite reforms, unresolved issues persist, raising questions about further EU integration. Anti-establishment sentiment has grown due to mainstream parties' perceived inability to address economic and social challenges. The EU debt crisis exposed unresolved issues and tensions among member states, leading to anti-establishment sentiment and the rise of populist parties advocating nationalist and anti-EU policies. The rise of populist parties advocating nationalist and anti-EU policies has caused a backlash among European voters. These parties, including far-right and far-left groups, oppose the euro currency, European integration, and their country's EU membership. In the May 2014 European Parliament election, \"Euro-skeptic\" parties won a significant portion of the votes. The trend was further tested after the victory of the radical-left Syriza party in the January 2015 Greek elections. \"Opposing the euro currency and European integration, \"Euro-skeptic\" parties of the far-right and far-left gained a quarter of the votes in the May 2014 European Parliament election. The trend will be tested further with national elections in several European countries, including the UK, which could lead to a referendum on EU membership.\" The trend of Euro-skeptic parties gaining support in European elections will be tested further in national elections in Estonia, Finland, Denmark, Portugal, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The UK elections, in particular, could lead to a referendum on EU membership, impacting its relationship with the United States. Domestic challenges in Europe, such as political instability and economic struggles, may affect Europe's ability to partner with the US. Relations with Russia have also been a significant issue in recent years. The deterioration of U.S. and European relations with Russia in 2014 transformed Russia from a strategic partner to a strategic problem. Some advocate pragmatic cooperation with Russia, while others see it as a challenge of uncertain dimensions. The crisis and conflict in Ukraine in 2014 transformed Russia from a strategic partner to a strategic problem for U.S. and European policy makers. Relations between Russia and the West have been tense for over a decade due to issues like NATO enlargement and conflicts with Georgia. Some advocate for pragmatic cooperation with Russia, while others believe a return to previous levels of cooperation is unlikely. Relations between Russia and the West have been tense for over a decade, with points of tension including NATO enlargement and conflicts with Georgia. The Obama Administration attempted to improve relations through a \"reset\" initiative, leading to cooperation on Afghanistan and Iran, the signing of the New START treaty, and a temporary easing of tensions over U.S. missile defense plans. However, some believe that a return to previous levels of cooperation is unlikely given recent Russian actions. The 2008 conflict between Russia and Georgia strained relations. The Obama Administration tried to improve relations through a \"reset\" initiative, leading to cooperation on Afghanistan and Iran, signing the New START treaty, and easing tensions over U.S. missile defense plans. However, U.S. and European objections remained regarding Russia's policies on various issues. Despite efforts to improve relations through a \"reset\" initiative, tensions between the U.S. and Europe with Russia persisted due to disagreements over various issues, including Russia's recognition of Georgia's Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions as independent countries and its suspension of obligations under the CFE Treaty. Strains escalated further after criticism of Russia's 2011-2012 elections triggered a backlash from Moscow, especially with the adoption of the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 by the U.S. Congress. With Vladimir Putin back in the presidency, Russia strongly opposed the U.S. Congress passing the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 in response to alleged human rights violations. Russia also clashed with U.S. and European foreign policy, criticizing the NATO operation in Libya and supporting Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian conflict. The political crisis in Ukraine starting in late 2013 led to strained relations between the U.S. and Europe with Russia, reaching their lowest point in decades. Russia pressured Ukraine to halt an Association Agreement, further escalating tensions. The political crisis in Ukraine in late 2013 led to strained relations between the U.S., Europe, and Russia. Russia pressured Ukraine to halt an Association Agreement, resulting in violent clashes and the ousting of President Yanukovych in February 2014. U.S. and European leaders supported the formation of a new, more pro-Western government. In February 2014, Yanukovych was ousted after protests against turning away from the EU. Pro-Western parties won the 2014 elections. Russian forces seized Crimea, which was subsequently annexed by Russia. In February-March 2014, Russian forces seized Crimea, which was subsequently annexed by Russia, citing historical, military significance, and the will of the population in Crimea. The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 was justified as rectifying a historical transfer from Russia to Ukraine, protecting inhabitants, and responding to the will of the population in Crimea. The annexation and referendum are not recognized internationally, leading to sanctions against Crimean and Russian individuals. This was the first forcible border change in Europe. The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, not recognized internationally, led to sanctions. The conflict in eastern Ukraine, with over 4,300 reported deaths, continues despite a ceasefire agreement. The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 led to the first forcible border change in Europe since 1945. The conflict in eastern Ukraine has resulted in over 4,300 reported deaths, with ongoing combat despite a ceasefire agreement. The United States and Western governments accuse Russia of direct involvement in the conflict, providing military support to separatists. Russia denies these allegations. The United States and Western governments believe Russian military units are directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine, providing personnel and material support to separatists. Despite some tensions, there is strong coordination between the U.S. and Europe in responding to Russian actions. The U.S. and Europe believe Russia is directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine, providing support to separatists. Despite tensions, there is strong coordination in responding to Russian actions, including extensive sanctions. The EU expanded sanctions after the shooting down of MH17 in 2014. The EU expanded sanctions on Russia after the shooting down of MH17 in 2014, targeting wider sectors of the Russian economy due to the large economic ties many European countries have with Russia. The EU expanded sanctions on Russia after the shooting down of MH17 in 2014, targeting wider sectors of the Russian economy due to the large economic ties many European countries have with Russia. EU debates over sanctions consider the economic value and political influence of relationships with Russia, as well as varying attitudes based on history, geography, and culture. US policy makers express frustration at the EU's deliberations on sanctions. Debates over sanctions on Russia involve economic value, political influence, varying attitudes based on history, geography, and culture, and doubts about effectiveness. Despite some European skepticism, all 28 EU member states have unanimously adopted sanctions to deter Russia's actions in Ukraine. This consensus was based on sending a strong message to Russia's leadership through meaningful sanctions. The EU member states unanimously adopted sanctions to deter Russia's actions in Ukraine, based on the consensus that sending a strong message to Russia's leadership through meaningful sanctions was a political imperative. The sanctions package is reviewed monthly, requiring unanimous agreement to overturn it, with the sectoral sanctions up for renewal in July 2015. Russia's economy has entered a recession in recent months. The EU adopted sanctions to deter Russia's actions in Ukraine, with unanimous agreement needed to overturn them. Russia's economy has entered a recession, with analysts attributing it to a drop in oil prices and Western sanctions. The impact of sanctions on Russia's foreign policy remains unclear. Russia's economy is in recession due to a weakened ruble, high inflation, and a drop in oil prices. Western sanctions are also believed to be a contributing factor. The impact of sanctions on Russia's foreign policy remains uncertain, with speculation about their next steps in eastern Ukraine ranging from maintaining a \"frozen conflict\" to seeking de-escalation. The foreign policy of Russia's leadership in eastern Ukraine is uncertain, with speculation ranging from maintaining a \"frozen conflict\" to seeking de-escalation. A proposal to ease sanctions was tabled in January 2015 if Russia complies with the ceasefire agreement. The EU proposed easing sanctions on Russia in January 2015 if they comply with the ceasefire agreement, but a resurgence of combat in eastern Ukraine led to doubts. The proposal depends on Russia's full implementation of the ceasefire agreement, with uncertainty surrounding Russia's foreign policy in eastern Ukraine. The EU proposed easing sanctions on Russia in January 2015 if they comply with the ceasefire agreement. However, a resurgence of combat in eastern Ukraine led to doubts, emphasizing the need for Russia's full implementation of the ceasefire agreement. With Vladimir Putin expected to remain Russia's leader, U.S. and European relations with Russia will continue to be a key focus for policymakers. Members of the 114th Congress may consider additional sanctions or other actions related to Russia and Ukraine. For the foreseeable future, U.S. and European relations with Russia will remain a central topic for policymakers as they try to understand Russia's foreign policy intentions and shape responses. Members of the 114th Congress may consider adopting more sanctions or deterrents in response to developments in Russia and Ukraine. Cooperation with European counterparts and support for Ukraine are also key areas of interest for Congress. Members of Congress may consider adopting additional sanctions or deterrents in response to developments in Russia and Ukraine. They may cooperate with European counterparts and provide support to Ukraine, including financial aid and loan guarantees. The US provided financial aid and loan guarantees to Ukraine in 2014, with additional support including military assistance authorized by the Ukraine Freedom Support Act in 2014. The Administration has not yet provided lethal aid to Ukraine. The US and EU have provided financial assistance to Ukraine, with the US authorizing $350 million in military aid, including lethal weapons, from 2015 to 2017. The EU has pledged over \u20ac11 billion in development assistance and loans from 2014 to 2020. The EU has provided over \u20ac11 billion in development assistance and loans to Ukraine between 2014 and 2020. International financial assistance is contingent on Ukraine's economic reforms and anti-corruption efforts, impacting debates on NATO's future and U.S. defense outlook. International financial assistance from states and the EU to Ukraine is tied to economic reforms and anti-corruption measures. Recent developments in Ukraine have sparked discussions on NATO's future and shifted the U.S. stance on European defense issues. Russia's actions in Ukraine have led to calls for NATO to focus on collective territorial defense, prompting European countries to increase defense spending. European defense issues have been heightened by Russia's actions in Ukraine and increased naval and air activities near European countries, leading to calls for NATO to focus on collective territorial defense. European countries are pledging to increase defense spending and develop military capabilities in response to Russian aggression. The Obama Administration has reassured European allies through the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) proposed in June 2014. The Obama Administration's European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) aims to reassure European allies of the U.S. commitment to European security in response to Russian aggression. Congress appropriated $810 million for the initiative, which includes troop rotations and pre-positioning military equipment in Eastern Europe. The Obama Administration's European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) received $810 million from Congress in December 2014. The initiative includes troop rotations to Poland and the Baltic states, pre-positioning military equipment in Eastern Europe, and an augmented U.S. military presence in Europe. The U.S. military presence in Europe related to ERI is rotational, with no plans for a permanent increase in personnel. In January 2015, the U.S. announced plans to close 15 bases in Europe as part of cost-cutting measures. The United States announced plans in January 2015 to close 15 bases in Europe as part of cost-cutting and restructuring measures, but the overall U.S. force level in Europe is expected to remain at approximately 67,000 personnel. Debates about the future of NATO were expected to revolve around long-term questions highlighted by the end of the alliance's mission in Afghanistan, especially given budgetary constraints facing many European governments. Prior to the crisis in Ukraine, debates about the future of NATO were expected to revolve around long-term questions highlighted by the end of the alliance's mission in Afghanistan. Concerns have been raised about declining European defense budgets and a growing transatlantic military \"capabilities gap\" that could increase NATO's reliance on U.S. military capacity. European militaries lack important capabilities such as strategic air- and. Facing concerns about declining European defense budgets and a growing transatlantic military \"capabilities gap,\" there is worry that NATO's reliance on U.S. military capacity could increase. European militaries lack key capabilities like strategic air- and sealift, aerial refueling, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Efforts like NATO's \"Smart Defense\" initiative have had limited success in addressing these challenges. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO members, including the United States, have emphasized the importance of the alliance's ability to conduct \"out-of-area\" operations and address unconventional security threats. Some European defense integration initiatives, like NATO's \"Smart Defense\" initiative, aim to pool resources for shared capabilities, but results have been limited. Central and eastern European countries prefer focusing on collective territorial defense. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO members, including the United States, have emphasized the alliance's ability to conduct \"out-of-area\" operations and address unconventional security threats. The 2010 NATO summit adopted a Strategic Concept with three core tasks: collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security, reaffirming NATO's role in ensuring the collective defense and security of its members. The 2010 NATO summit adopted a Strategic Concept focusing on collective territorial defense, reaffirming NATO's role in ensuring the security of its members. The Concept outlines three core tasks: collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security, emphasizing the development of capabilities for expeditionary operations and addressing unconventional security challenges. The 2010 NATO summit adopted a Strategic Concept focusing on collective defense and security of its members, emphasizing the development of capabilities for expeditionary operations and addressing unconventional security challenges. However, some analysts believe that public opposition, lack of political will, and resource shortages could make Europe less willing to engage in large-scale overseas missions. In the aftermath of Afghanistan, analysts believe Europe may be less willing to engage in large-scale overseas missions due to public opposition, political will, and resource shortages. The security outlook in Europe has shifted with increased concerns about the threat from Russia, leading some countries like Poland and the Baltic states to call for permanent basing of U.S. and NATO forces. This is reflected in initiatives like the European Reassurance Initiative. The security outlook in Europe has shifted due to increased concerns about the threat from Russia. Some countries, like Poland and the Baltic states, are calling for permanent basing of U.S. and NATO forces. NATO's response includes rotating forces, increased exercises, and pre-positioning of assets to bolster security in the region. For example, NATO countries have tripled the number of fighter aircraft in the Baltic Air Policing mission. The U.S. and NATO are responding to security concerns in Europe by increasing exercises, rotating forces, and pre-positioning assets. NATO countries have tripled fighter aircraft in the Baltic Air Policing mission. The \"Readiness Action Plan\" from NATO's 2014 Summit outlines measures for enhanced infrastructure and troop bases in Central and Eastern Europe. At the 2014 Summit in Wales, NATO member countries agreed to a \"Readiness Action Plan\" for enhanced defense in Central and Eastern Europe, including infrastructure improvements, pre-positioning of equipment, and the establishment of a Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) with 4,000 soldiers capable of rapid deployment. At the 2014 Wales Summit, NATO allies agreed to establish a new Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) with 4,000 soldiers for rapid deployment in response to threats. Leaders also pledged to increase defense spending to 2% of national GDP within a decade. At the Wales Summit, NATO allies agreed to establish a 4,000-soldier land force with air, maritime, and special operations support. Leaders also pledged to increase defense spending to 2% of national GDP within a decade. Tensions between the EU and Russia have raised concerns about European energy security due to the region's heavy reliance on Russian gas imports. Russia's focus on European energy security has increased due to Europe's heavy reliance on Russian gas imports. The EU depends on Russia for a significant portion of its gas imports and oil supplies, with this dependence expected to grow in the next 20 years. Moscow has been using energy supplies as a tool for foreign policy leverage by seeking bilateral energy deals with European countries. Russia's energy leverage over Europe has grown as the EU relies heavily on Russian gas and oil. Moscow has pursued bilateral energy deals with European countries and acquired significant ownership of European energy infrastructure. Concerns exist over Russia's lack of transparency and market reciprocity in business practices and investment policies, with past disputes leading to gas cutoffs like the 2006 conflict with Ukraine. Russia has acquired large-scale ownership of European energy infrastructure and lacks transparency in business practices. Concerns arise over potential gas cutoffs, as seen in past disputes with Ukraine. European energy security is a U.S. interest due to Russia's influence. The disputes between Russia and Ukraine in 2006 and 2009 have raised concerns for countries reliant on Russian natural gas supplies, especially amid tensions between the two nations. U.S. officials view European energy security as a priority and are worried about Russian energy dominance affecting transatlantic unity on Russia-related issues. Successive U.S. Administrations have urged EU states to diversify energy sources and develop alternatives to reduce dependence on Russia. Europe faces challenges in diversifying its energy supply, with North Africa and Central Asia seen as potential alternative sources. Political and economic instability in North Africa has hindered its role as a natural gas supplier, while efforts to increase supply from Central Asia have been met with obstacles. Europe is working on developing alternative energy sources and increasing energy efficiency. North Africa and Central Asia are potential suppliers, but face challenges such as political and economic instability. Russia has hindered the development of alternative pipelines linking Europe to Central Asian suppliers. European countries are also focusing on renewable energy development. European leaders are working on a common energy strategy to coordinate member states' policies and integrate the internal energy market. Russia has obstructed the development of alternative pipelines linking Europe to Central Asian suppliers. There are questions about the contribution of renewable energy sources in meeting energy needs. European leaders are striving to develop a common energy strategy to coordinate member states' policies and integrate the internal energy market. Recent events in Ukraine and Crimea have heightened the urgency for these efforts. Several European countries have enhanced their energy infrastructure by building LNG terminals, expanding pipeline interconnectivity, and enabling gas flow reversal in pipelines. European countries are enhancing their energy infrastructure to mitigate the consequences of a crisis, such as a cut-off of Russian gas. There is a proposal for an EU \"energy union\" to purchase natural gas for all 28 members, replacing the current system of bilateral negotiations and contracts. In April 2014, then-Prime Minister Tusk of Poland proposed an EU \"energy union\" where a single agency would purchase natural gas for all 28 members. This union would include \"solidarity mechanisms\" for member states to help each other during supply disruptions. EU had already adopted legislation to increase competition and transparency in the energy sector by separating gas production ownership from distribution. Before recent events in Ukraine, the EU had already adopted legislation to introduce competition and transparency in the energy sector by separating gas production ownership from distribution. This legislation, along with an investigation against Gazprom, has drawn criticism from Russia, leading to the cancellation of the South Stream project in December 2014. In December 2014, Russia canceled the South Stream project, a pipeline intended to bypass Ukraine and deliver gas to Europe. This decision was seen as a response to EU bureaucratic obstacles and criticism of Russia's actions in Ukraine. Russia canceled the South Stream project, a pipeline to deliver gas to Europe bypassing Ukraine, due to EU bureaucratic obstacles and criticism of Russia's actions in Ukraine. This decision was seen as a cover to abandon a politically and financially burdensome project. Russia aims to diversify its markets by concluding pipeline construction deals with China and Turkey.

This decision provided a cover to abandon a politically and financially burdensome project. Russia is seeking to diversify its markets by concluding pipeline construction deals with China and Turkey. The United States is leading a coalition to combat the Islamic State organization in Iraq and Syria through military action and targeting their financial sources. The United States and Europe are working together to combat the terrorist organization Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. A multilateral coalition led by the US is seeking to degrade and destroy ISIS through military action, support for partner ground forces, and targeting their financial sources. NATO member countries and European nations have participated in coalition airstrikes, provided trainers and advisers to Iraqi forces, and offered humanitarian aid to Kurdish forces in Iraq. European countries, including NATO members Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, have joined coalition airstrikes against IS in Iraq. They have also pledged trainers, advisers, weapons, and humanitarian aid to assist Iraqi and Kurdish forces. European military action against IS has been limited to Iraq due to political and legal challenges, while concerns remain about the civil war in Syria. European countries, including NATO members, have provided aid to Kurdish forces in Iraq. European military action against IS has been limited to Iraq, with concerns about the civil war in Syria. The EU has condemned the Assad government and imposed sanctions due to the ongoing violence. The EU has been a leading voice in condemning the Assad government in Syria, imposing sanctions and recognizing the Syrian National Coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. They lifted an embargo on arming Syrian rebel forces in 2013. The EU imposed extensive sanctions on the Assad government's economic base and recognized the Syrian National Coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. Support for opposition forces mainly included non-lethal equipment, humanitarian aid, and training. Concerns about Europe's vulnerability to terrorism were heightened after the 2015 Paris attacks. The EU imposed sanctions on the Assad government and recognized the Syrian National Coalition. Support for opposition forces included non-lethal equipment, humanitarian aid, and training. Concerns about Europe's vulnerability to terrorism increased after the 2015 Paris attacks, leading to raids on an Islamic State-linked cell in Belgium. Analysts and European governments are worried about \"foreign fighters\" joining the Islamic State from Europe and the West. Since the inception of the Islamic State, analysts and European governments have expressed concerns about \"foreign fighters\" from Europe and the West joining the group. Recent estimates suggest there may be 3,000 to 5,000 individuals involved in conflicts in Syria and Iraq, with significant EU countries of origin including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Raids have been conducted to break up Islamic State-linked terrorist cells in Belgium. Recent estimates suggest 3,000 to 5,000 Muslims from Europe and other Western countries are involved in conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Concerns arise about fighters returning home with extremist views and skills to carry out terrorist attacks in Europe. Authorities in Europe are concerned about the potential threat posed by foreign fighters returning from conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Measures such as increased surveillance and combating terrorist recruitment are being implemented to address security concerns. Some experts question the widespread threat posed by foreign fighters returning from conflicts in Syria and Iraq to Europe. European governments are taking security measures such as increasing surveillance, combating terrorist recruitment, and prohibiting travel to address these concerns. Authorities have arrested individuals suspected of planning to travel to Syria, confiscated passports to prevent travel to conflict zones, detained returning fighters, and set up websites to address the issue. European countries have implemented security measures to prevent citizens from traveling to Syria and Iraq to join terrorist groups like IS. Despite efforts to arrest suspects, confiscate passports, and detain returning fighters, challenges remain in tracking and preventing the flow of European fighters. An EU-wide approach is hindered by differing national views. Efforts to prevent European citizens from joining terrorist groups like IS have included training in terrorist camps, setting up websites and hotlines for concerned family members. However, challenges persist in tracking and preventing the flow of fighters to Syria and Iraq. An EU-wide approach is hindered by differing national views on intelligence-sharing, data privacy, and civil liberties. The EU's efforts to enhance counterterrorism capabilities have been hindered by differing national views on intelligence-sharing, data privacy, and civil liberties. The Paris attacks have reignited debates on increasing security and surveillance powers, particularly due to the EU's open internal borders. The proposal for an EU airline security measure, stalled since 2013, may now gain momentum. The Paris attacks have sparked debates on enhancing security and surveillance powers in the EU, including the proposal for an EU airline passenger name record system. Transatlantic cooperation on counterterrorism has been strong since 9/11, with regular dialogues between U.S. and European officials on homeland security and counterterrorism. Since the 9/11 attacks, transatlantic cooperation on counterterrorism has been robust, with regular dialogues between U.S. and European officials. In 2010, new U.S.-EU treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance came into force, along with agreements on container security and sharing airline passenger data to enhance aviation and border security. The proposal for an EU airline passenger name record system aims to collect data on air travelers. In 2010, new U.S.-EU treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance were implemented, along with agreements on container security and sharing airline passenger data to strengthen aviation, transport, and border security. The United States and the EU collaborate on tracking and countering terrorism financing through forums like the Financial Action Task Force and the U.S.-EU \"SWIFT agreement.\" The EU and States collaborate to counter terrorism financing through forums like the Financial Action Task Force and the U.S.-EU \"SWIFT agreement,\" allowing access to financial data. Bilateral intelligence sharing and law enforcement cooperation are also crucial in disrupting terrorist plots. The EU and States collaborate on counterterrorism financing through forums like the Financial Action Task Force and the U.S.-EU \"SWIFT agreement,\" allowing access to financial data. Bilateral intelligence sharing and law enforcement cooperation are crucial in disrupting terrorist plots. However, European policy makers have concerns about data privacy safeguards in U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements. The EU values data privacy as a basic right and has strict regulations protecting personal data. While overall counterterrorism cooperation is strong, European policy makers have concerns about data privacy safeguards in U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements. The EU values data privacy as a basic right and has strict regulations protecting personal data, leading to complications and delays in adopting agreements on sharing airline passenger data. Negotiations for a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement have been ongoing since 2011. Objections in the European Parliament delayed the adoption of the SWIFT deal and sharing airline passenger data. The US and EU have been negotiating a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement since 2011. Both have aligned their lists of terrorist organizations, with the EU adding Hezbollah's military wing in 2013. US officials welcomed this move, urging the EU to include Hezbollah on its common terrorist list. In July 2013, the EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, aligning with the United States. However, critics argue that listing only the military wing is insufficient as Hezbollah can still fundraise in Europe. In December 2014, the General Court of the European Union ruled that Hamas should be removed from the EU's list of designated terrorist organizations. Critics argue that listing only Hezbollah's military wing on the EU's terrorist list is insufficient as the group can still fundraise in Europe. In December 2014, the EU General Court ruled that Hamas should be removed from the list of designated terrorist organizations due to procedural grounds. The EU General Court ruled that Hamas should be removed from the EU's list of designated terrorist organizations on procedural grounds. The EU External Action Service clarified that this decision was not political and that sanctions against Hamas will remain in place during the appeal process.
