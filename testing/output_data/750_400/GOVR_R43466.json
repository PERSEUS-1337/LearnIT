These medications are used to treat various mental health conditions, but there is limited evidence on their safety and efficacy in children. Congress is closely monitoring how states regulate the use of psychotropic medications for foster children. Children in foster care have higher rates of mental health care needs and are more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medications. Congress is closely monitoring how states regulate the use of these medications for foster children, as evidence on their safety and efficacy in children is limited. Federal child welfare law requires states to oversee prescription drug use among children in foster care, including psychotropic medications. The report discusses the oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care by Congress and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. States are required to monitor and regulate the use of these medications for children in care. The report discusses congressional oversight and efforts by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to ensure appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care. State monitoring of medication use for foster children is also briefly mentioned. Child welfare agencies intervene in cases of abuse or neglect, sometimes leading to children being placed in foster care. State monitoring of medication use for foster children is discussed, with child welfare agencies becoming involved in cases of abuse or neglect. Children in foster care are placed in settings designed for round-the-clock care, following a judge's determination that removal from their home was necessary for their welfare. Children in foster care are placed in settings for round-the-clock care by the state child welfare agency, following a judge's determination that removal from their home was necessary for their welfare. Most children enter foster care due to neglect or abuse by their parents, with behavior problems also playing a role, especially for older children. Foster care is intended to provide a safe and supportive environment for these children. The judge has given responsibility for the child's \"care and placement\" to the state child welfare agency due to neglect or abuse by parents. Foster care is a temporary placement until reunification with parents or a permanent placement with relatives, an adopted family, or a legal guardian. States must ensure the safety and well-being of children in foster care. During FY2015, 671,000 children spent time in foster care, with 243,000 leaving the system. Nearly 428,000 children remained in care by the end of the fiscal year, focusing on their safety and well-being. The national foster care caseload has generally been decreasing. During FY2015, 671,000 children spent time in foster care, with 243,000 leaving the system. Nearly 428,000 children remained in care by the end of the fiscal year, focusing on their safety and well-being. The national foster care caseload has generally been decreasing, with about 77,000 fewer children in foster care on the last day of FY2015 compared to FY2006. Children in foster care have higher mental health service needs due to abuse or neglect experienced before entering foster care. The decline in foster care caseload over the past decade has been significant, with 77,000 fewer children in care by the end of FY2015 compared to FY2006. Children in foster care often have higher mental health service needs due to abuse or neglect experienced before entering the system, which can have serious long-term effects on their mental health and socialization. Children who experience maltreatment before entering foster care may struggle with regulating emotions and interpreting social cues, leading to behavioral issues such as violence or aggression. A national survey found that a significant percentage of children placed in foster care due to abuse or neglect were at risk of behavioral or emotional problems. In a national survey conducted in 2008 and 2009, a significant percentage of children placed in foster care due to abuse or neglect were found at risk of behavioral or emotional problems, with rates much higher than those in the general population. In a national survey, children in foster care were found at risk of behavioral or emotional problems, with rates much higher than the general population. Children in foster care group homes or institutions had even higher rates of needing mental health services. Medicaid-eligible children in foster care are increasingly diagnosed with mental health issues like attention disorders and anxiety. In recent years, children in foster care, including those on Medicaid, have been increasingly diagnosed with various mental health issues such as attention disorders, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. Children in foster care, eligible for Medicaid, have seen an increase in mental health diagnoses such as attention disorders, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. Older children are more likely to receive these diagnoses. In 2002-2007, children in foster care with Medicaid saw a rise in mental health diagnoses. Older children were more likely to be diagnosed with conditions like conduct disorders, attention disorders, and depression. In 2007, children in foster care with Medicaid saw an increase in mental health diagnoses. The most common diagnoses varied by age group, with conduct disorders and attention disorders being prevalent among younger children, while older children were more likely to be diagnosed with conduct disorders and depression. Rates of major mental health diagnoses rose for both age groups from 2002 to 2007, except for depression among children ages 6. Rates of major mental health diagnoses increased among children in foster care with Medicaid from 2002 to 2007. Conduct disorders and depression were the most common diagnoses, with rates rising for both age groups except for depression among children ages 6 to 11. National standards recommend mental health screenings and assessments for all children placed in foster care. National standards recommend mental health screenings and assessments for all children placed in foster care, with diagnostic and treatment services available through Medicaid. Children in foster care should receive mental health services through Medicaid, which provides medical assistance for primary, acute, and long-term care. Medicaid eligibility is available for most, if not all, children in foster care. The Medicaid program provides medical assistance for primary, acute, and long-term care services to eligible individuals in each state, including children in foster care. Medicaid eligibility entitles states to federal reimbursement for a portion of the cost of providing medical assistance. Children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid and entitled to the same services as other children. The EPSDT program covers health screenings, assessments, laboratory tests, immunizations, health education, and vision, dental, and hearing services. The EPSDT program under federal statute covers health screenings, assessments, laboratory tests, immunizations, health education, and vision, dental, and hearing services for children, including those in foster care. States must provide treatment to meet children's identified health needs, including mental health needs, using Medicaid financing. Under EPSDT, states must provide screenings and services at regular intervals to meet children's health needs, including mental health. This includes services from mental health professionals like psychiatrists, psychologists, and clinical social workers, as well as prescription drugs. Children with mental health challenges may benefit from psychosocial treatment such as counseling and case management. Children with mental health challenges may benefit from psychosocial treatment like counseling and case management provided by mental health professionals. Evidence supports the use of psychosocial treatments such as behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy, family-focused treatment, and group-based interventions for children with mental disorders. Certain psychosocial treatment interventions, including CBT, family-focused treatment, and group-based interventions, have shown moderate effectiveness for children with antisocial-related and disruptive behaviors. CBT activities like anger management and social skills training are effective for children who have experienced trauma. Psychosocial interventions, including CBT, have been found effective for children with antisocial-related behaviors. CBT activities like anger management and social skills training are also effective for children who have experienced trauma. Psychotropic medications may be prescribed to children in foster care when psychosocial treatment alone is not effective. Psychotropic medications may be prescribed to children in foster care for trauma when psychosocial treatment alone is not effective. Medical professionals and stakeholders may lack resources for accompanying psychosocial therapies. Psychotropic medications may be prescribed to children in foster care when psychosocial treatment alone is not effective due to a lack of resources for accompanying therapies. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have noted an over-reliance on medication for children in care, reflecting a lack of timely access to effective behavioral health care and evidence-based psychosocial therapies. The Medicaid program has noted an over-reliance on medication for children in foster care, indicating a lack of timely access to effective behavioral health care and evidence-based psychosocial therapies. HHS's SAMHSA rates treatments based on their effectiveness, but there is no standard for evidence-based therapies. Analysis of data from a national survey found that children entering foster care were more likely to receive mental health supports. HHS's SAMHSA rates treatments based on effectiveness, with no standard for evidence-based therapies. Children in foster care more likely to receive mental health supports than those at home following abuse/neglect investigations. Medicaid data shows over-reliance on medication for foster care children. Children in foster care with mental health needs are more likely to receive supports such as screening, assessment, and referrals compared to those who remain at home after abuse/neglect investigations. Medicaid data shows a higher use of psychosocial interventions for foster care children on antipsychotic medication. Children in foster care eligible for Medicaid have shown increased use of psychosocial mental health interventions while on antipsychotic medication, compared to non-foster children. Studies indicate that foster children needing mental health services may not always receive them, with 3 out of 10 not receiving specialty mental health services despite meeting clinical criteria. A national survey from 2008-2010 found that 3 out of 10 children in foster care with mental health needs did not receive specialty services, and 9% received psychotropics without services. Between 16% and 33% of children in out-of-home care may use psychotropic medication daily, with rates varying based on age, placement, and length of involvement. Between 16% and 33% of children in out-of-home care may be using psychotropic medication on any given day, with rates varying based on factors such as age, placement setting, and length of involvement with the child welfare agency. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care far exceed the rates among children generally, which is about 6%. Children whose Medicaid eligibility is based on their foster care status have been found to receive psychotropic medication at three to nine times the rate of all other children served by Medicaid. Children in foster care have higher rates of psychotropic medication use compared to children generally. Those whose Medicaid eligibility is based on foster care status receive medication at three to nine times the rate of other children on Medicaid. This rate is comparable to older children with diagnosed mental or neurodevelopmental disorders. Children in foster care have higher rates of psychotropic medication use compared to children generally. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children involved with the child welfare system are three to nine times higher than the rate of all other children served by Medicaid, and somewhat comparable to older children with diagnosed mental or neurodevelopmental disorders. Research shows that children in non-relative foster family homes are not more likely than child-welfare involved children living in their own homes to be prescribed psychotropic medication. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children involved with the child welfare system, including those in foster care, vary by state and over time. Research from the early 2000s found great variation in prescription of psychotropic medication for children in foster care. Differences across states led researchers to conclude that foster family homes were not more likely than children in their own homes to be prescribed psychotropic medication. Research from the early 2000s found variation in psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, with state practices playing a significant role in prescription patterns. Medicaid claims data from 2002 to 2007 also showed differences in medication use among children eligible for Medicaid based on their foster care status. The researchers found that state practices in prescribing psychotropic medication played a significant role in the variation of mental health services among children in foster care. A study of Medicaid claims data from 2002 to 2007 showed an increase in the use of antipsychotic medications during this time frame. The study on Medicaid and foster care status found an increase in antipsychotic medication use among children. 45 states saw a rise in usage from 2002 to 2007, while two states saw a decrease and one state saw no change. The study found an increase in antipsychotic medication use among children in foster care. 45 states saw a rise in usage from 2002 to 2007, with rates ranging from 2.8% to 21.7%. A review of Medicaid claims data in 20 states showed a slight increase in usage from 2005 to 2008, followed by a slight decrease by 2010. The rate of antipsychotic medication use among children in foster care varied from 2.8% to 21.7% in each state. A recent analysis of Medicaid claims data in 20 states showed an increase in antipsychotic use from 2005 (8.7%) to 2008 (9.3%), followed by a slight decrease by 2010 (8.9%). Non-foster care children with Medicaid and privately insured children had lower levels of antipsychotic use, with a slight increase in usage among privately insured children from 2005 (0.62%) to 2009 (0.77%), remaining steady through 2013 (0.75%). The study found that antipsychotic use among children in foster care varied from 2.8% to 21.7% in each state. Medicaid claims data in 20 states showed an increase in antipsychotic use from 2005 (8.7%) to 2008 (9.3%), followed by a slight decrease by 2010 (8.9%). Non-foster care children with Medicaid and privately insured children had lower levels of antipsychotic use, with a slight increase in usage among privately insured children from 2005 (0.62%) to 2009 (0.77%), remaining steady through 2013 (0.75%). The data primarily comes from the second National Survey on Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II) funded and administered by HHS, examining outcomes of 5,872 children. The second National Survey on Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II) funded by HHS examined psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, capturing the experiences of children who remained in their homes following investigations of abuse or neglect. The survey included a national sample of 5,872 children in the child welfare system. The survey examined psychotropic medication use among 5,872 children in the child welfare system who were investigated for abuse or neglect. It captured the experiences of children who remained in their homes or were placed in foster care. The NSCAW II Survey looked at children in the child welfare system, including those who stayed with their biological or adoptive parents, lived informally with relatives, or were placed in foster care. The children's ages ranged from 2 months to 20 years at different follow-up points. The NSCAW II Survey followed children in the child welfare system, ranging from 2 months to 20 years old. The children may have entered and re-entered care or returned after subsequent investigations. Children living with their own parents post-abuse investigation were less likely to be using foster care. Children in the NSCAW II study who were in foster care, particularly those in congregate care and school-age, had a higher likelihood of using psychotropic medication compared to those living with their own parents post-abuse investigation. There was no significant difference in medication use among children in foster care. Among children in the NSCAW II study, those in foster care, especially in congregate care and school-age, were more likely to be on psychotropic medication compared to those living with their own parents post-abuse investigation. At 18 months following the investigation, children in foster care had a significantly higher rate of psychotropic medication use. At 18 months post-investigation, children in foster care had a higher rate of psychotropic medication use compared to those who remained in their homes. This difference continued to increase at the 36-month follow-up, with one-third of children in care taking psychotropics, in contrast to 12.9% of children in their homes. At 36 months follow-up, children in foster care had higher psychotropic medication use (32.8%) compared to those in their homes (12.9%). Among foster care placements, medication use was significantly higher in group homes and residential programs (48.2%) than in foster family homes. The prevalence of psychotropic medication use was significantly higher among children in foster group homes or residential treatment programs compared to those in foster family homes and formal kin care. Children in group foster care settings had a usage rate of 48.2% within six months of initial investigation, compared to 11.8% to 19.5% in other foster care settings. Children in group settings had the highest rate of psychotropic medication use (67.4%), followed by other foster care settings (15.9% to 23.8%), children in their own homes (10.9%), and informal kin care (11.9%) approximately 18 months after the initial investigation of child abuse or neglect. Children in group settings had the highest rate of psychotropic medication use (67.4%) within six months after the investigation, compared to other foster care settings (15.9% to 23.8%), children in their own homes (10.9%), and informal kin care (11.9%). This trend continued 36 months after the investigation, with over half of children in group settings still taking psychotropics (52%). Children in group settings had the highest rate of psychotropic medication use (67.4%) within six months after the investigation. Approximately 18 months later, just over half of children in group settings were still taking psychotropics (52%). Children in foster care group homes or residential settings were most likely to be taking more than one psychotropic medication compared to other placement settings. Approximately 18 months after the initial investigation, children in foster care group homes or residential settings were most likely to be taking more than one psychotropic medication. About half of foster children in group settings who were prescribed psychotropics were taking two or more drugs, whereas the rate of children in other child welfare settings taking two or more drugs was much lower. At 36 months following the initial investigation, children in group settings were significantly more likely to be taking two or more psychotropic medications compared to children in other child welfare settings. The rates of children in foster care, formal kin care, informal kin care, and those who remained in their own homes taking multiple medications were lower in comparison. Children in group settings were also more likely to be using three or more psychotropic medications at 36 months following the investigation. At 36 months following the investigation, children in group settings had the highest percentage of those taking multiple psychotropic medications compared to other child welfare settings. Foster care children, especially those of elementary and secondary school age, were more likely to be using psychotropic medication. Youth ages 11 to 17 were most commonly using psychotropics at each follow-up wave. Children in foster care, particularly those of elementary and secondary school age, were more likely to use psychotropic medication compared to children in other settings. Youth ages 11 to 17 had the highest usage of psychotropics at each follow-up wave, followed by youth ages 6 to 10, youth ages 18 and older, and youth ages 1.5 to 5 years. Older youth, ages 18 and above, were less likely to be prescribed psychotropic medications compared to children ages 6 to 17. The research literature has characterized patterns of prescribing psychotropic drugs to foster children as \"too many, too much, and too young.\" Polypharmacy, defined as concurrent use of three or more psychotropic medication classes for at least 30 days during a one-year period, was fairly common among foster children. An analysis of national Medicaid claims data from 2002 through 2007 found that polypharmacy\u2014defined as concurrent use of three or more psychotropic medication classes for at least 30 days during a one-year period\u2014was consistent at about 5.2% to 5.9% annually among all children in foster care. In 2011, polypharmacy with three or more antipsychotic drugs for at least 90 days was comparable for children in foster care based on Medicaid claims data from 20 states. The analysis of Medicaid claims data for 20 states in 2011 showed that polypharmacy with three or more antipsychotic drugs was comparable for children with foster care status (2.8%) and non-foster care status (3.1%). Children in foster care prescribed psychotropics had an average of 1.9 psychotropics per child on a given day. Data from the NSCAW II study shows that children in foster care were prescribed an average of 1.9 psychotropic medications per child per day. Concerns have been raised about the use of certain classes of psychotropics, such as antipsychotics, concurrently. The percentage of children in group or residential settings prescribed three or more psychotropics is significantly higher compared to other groups of children. Concerns have been raised about the use of multiple psychotropic medications in children, particularly in group or residential settings where a higher percentage of children are prescribed three or more psychotropics. Antipsychotic polypharmacy has shown greater adverse effects with only marginal benefits, especially when dosages exceed recommendations for foster children. Antipsychotic polypharmacy in children, especially in group or residential settings, has shown greater adverse effects with only marginal benefits. Concerns include prescriptions exceeding recommendations for foster children and very young children being prescribed psychotropics. Limited studies on safety and efficacy of these medications for children add to the concerns. Studies have shown limited safety and efficacy of psychotropic medications for children, with concerns about very young children being prescribed these drugs. Research found that a small percentage of children under the age of 6 in out-of-home care were prescribed psychotropics, with rates varying among different states. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined Medicaid data from 2008 to analyze the use of psychotropic drugs among foster children in five states. They found that 0.3% to 2.1% of children under age 1 in foster care were prescribed psychotropics, compared to a lower rate (0.1% to 1.2%) of infants not in foster care. Prescribing rates for ADHD and antipsychotic medication increased with each year of age among children ages 3 to 6 in foster care, raising concerns among health experts about the lack of established mental health indications for the use of psychotropic drugs in infants. Health experts have raised concerns about the increased prescribing rates of ADHD and antipsychotic medication among infants and young children in foster care, as there are no established mental health indications for the use of psychotropic drugs in this age group. Children in foster care may have greater mental health service needs, but the effectiveness of psychotropic medications in treating them is uncertain. Children in foster care may have greater mental health service needs, leading to a higher likelihood of receiving psychotropic medications due to a lack of available psychosocial services. Children in foster care may more readily receive psychotropics due to the lack of available psychosocial services, attributed to a shortage of mental health providers with clinical understanding of complex trauma. The prescribing rate of psychotropics has decreased, but certain classes like antipsychotics are still used off-label for children with bipolar disorders and schizophrenia. The use of antipsychotic medication in children in foster care has been steadily increasing, with a slight decrease in recent years. This trend may be attributed to various factors, including the lack of available psychosocial services and the off-label use of antipsychotics for behavioral conditions. The use of antipsychotic medication in children in foster care has been steadily increasing, possibly due to factors such as limited research on efficacy, pharmaceutical marketing, and a general rise in psychotropic medication prescriptions for children. The use of psychotropic medications in children, including those in foster care, has raised concerns due to limited research on efficacy and pharmaceutical marketing. Studies on antipsychotics in this population have shown mixed results on safety and effectiveness. The use of psychotropic medications in children, including those in foster care, has raised concerns due to limited research on efficacy and safety. Studies on antipsychotics in this population have shown mixed results on their effectiveness. Research on the safety of these drugs for child mental health disorders, including those in foster care, is lacking, especially for certain conditions like disruptive behavior disorders and eating disorders. Most studies on antipsychotics in children, including those in foster care, lacked sufficient evidence to determine their safety for addressing various mental health disorders. Research also showed a high risk of bias in these studies due to issues like missing data handling and improper participant assignment. The analysis of studies on antipsychotics in children found a high risk of bias due to issues like missing data handling and improper participant assignment. Some children may benefit from psychotropic medication despite concerns about harmful health outcomes. Some children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medication for managing symptoms and issues associated with mental health and behavior concerns stemming from exposure to complex trauma, especially when coupled with psychosocial services. Antipsychotics have been linked to harmful health outcomes in children, including high cholesterol levels, weight gain, and type-2 diabetes. Children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medication for managing symptoms and issues associated with mental health and behavior concerns stemming from exposure to complex trauma. Stimulants for ADHD have been well researched and found to be effective in reducing core symptoms such as hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention, and aggression. Multiple studies have found that stimulants are effective in reducing core symptoms of ADHD in children, including hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention, and aggression. Children in foster care have a higher prevalence of mental health diagnoses, leading to increased use of psychotropic medications to manage their symptoms. Children in foster care have a higher prevalence of mental health diagnoses, leading to increased use of psychotropic medications. State officials and child psychiatrists suggest that higher levels of psychotropic drug use may be appropriate due to the severity of mental health conditions in this population. Inconsistent state oversight practices may also contribute to the use of psychotropics in responding to the mental health needs of these children. Congress is interested in overseeing prescription medications used by children in foster care. In 2005, Congress showed interest in overseeing prescription medications used by children in foster care, particularly in response to concerns about the enrollment of foster children in clinical drug trials. This followed reports of inconsistent state oversight practices and multiple foster care placements contributing to the use of psychotropic medications to address the mental health needs of these children. In 2005, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources examined the enrollment of foster children in clinical drug trials and the oversight of prescription drug use by children in foster care. The Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006 required state child welfare agencies to consult with medical professionals in assessing the health of foster children to receive certain funding. The Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006 mandated state child welfare agencies to consult with medical professionals for assessing and treating foster children's health. Congressional hearings in 2007 and 2008 focused on oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in foster care. The 2007 and 2008 congressional hearings discussed oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in foster care. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 expanded the requirement for states to consult with medical professionals on the health and well-being of foster children. In 2008, Congress expanded the requirement for states to consult with medical professionals on the health and well-being of children in foster care. States must develop a coordinated strategy with child welfare and Medicaid agencies to ensure access to health care, including mental health services, for each child in foster care. In 2008, Congress expanded the requirement for states to develop a coordinated strategy with child welfare and Medicaid agencies to ensure access to health care, including mental health services, for children in foster care. The 2008 law directed states to oversee drugs prescribed to children in foster care. In 2011, the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act further stipulated that the coordinated strategy must include protocols for the use of psychotropic medication for children in foster care. In October 2011, the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act (P.L. 112-34) amended the requirement for states to have a coordinated strategy for overseeing drugs prescribed to children in foster care, including protocols for psychotropic medication. In December 2011, the Senate held an oversight hearing on state policies regarding this issue based on a study by the Government Accountability Office. In December 2011, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee held an oversight hearing on state policies for prescribing psychotropic medications to foster children, based on a study by the Government Accountability Office comparing state policies to best practice guidelines. GAO reviewed state policies for oversight of prescribing psychotropic medications in six states, comparing them to best practice guidelines. The study found that all six states fell short of providing comprehensive oversight as defined by AACAP, with only Texas fully implementing consent procedures. The GAO found that six state programs lacked comprehensive oversight in prescribing psychotropic medications, with only Texas fully implementing consent procedures according to AACAP guidelines. States not following these guidelines may lead to caregivers not fully understanding the risks and benefits. GAO recommended that HHS endorse guidance for state Medicaid and child welfare. According to a report, states should implement consent procedures similar to AACAP's guidelines to ensure caregivers understand the risks and benefits of using psychotropic medications. GAO recommended that HHS endorse guidance for monitoring these medications in foster care. Witnesses discussed the need for cooperation between HHS and state Medicaid programs. The GAO recommended guidance for monitoring psychotropic medications in foster care, which was implemented. Witnesses discussed increasing cooperation between HHS and state Medicaid programs to improve oversight. A former foster youth shared his experience with multiple medications and diagnoses. In a roundtable discussion, HHS explored ways to enhance guidance for states on psychotropic medication oversight. A 12-year-old former foster youth shared his experience with multiple medications and diagnoses received while in foster care. He found a therapist helpful during this time. In April 2013, the Senate Finance Committee held a roundtable discussion on psychotropic medications for children in foster care. Current and former foster youth shared their experiences, with some mentioning that therapy helped them transition from medications. At a roundtable discussion on psychotropic medications for children in foster care, current and former foster youth shared their experiences. Some mentioned that therapy helped them transition from medications, emphasizing the importance of an invested caregiver or knowledgeable professional in mental health treatment. Child welfare stakeholders discussed the prevalence of psychotropic medication use among youth and the role of the federal government in promoting alternatives. In a roundtable discussion on psychotropic medications for children in foster care, youths emphasized the importance of an invested caregiver or knowledgeable professional in mental health treatment. Child welfare stakeholders discussed the prevalence of psychotropic medication use among youth and the role of the federal government in promoting alternatives. The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing on the use of psychotropic medications in May 2014. The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing in May 2014 on the use of psychotropic medications among children in foster care. Witnesses discussed the efforts of states and the federal government to ensure appropriate use of these medications. The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing in May 2014 regarding the use of psychotropic medications among children in foster care. Witnesses included officials from HHS, GAO, a researcher specializing in this area, and Dr. Phil McGraw. GAO focused on their work from 2011 to 2014 related to psychotropic medication prescription among children in foster care. At a May 2014 hearing, GAO discussed their work from 2011 to 2014 on psychotropic medication prescription among children in foster care. They examined prescribing rates and the documentation supporting the use of psychotropics among a sample of children in care. The GAO contracted child psychiatrists to examine documentation supporting the use of psychotropics among children in foster care. They found varying quality in the documentation, with issues related to dosage amounts and concurrent use of multiple medications. Experts found varying quality in the documentation supporting the use of psychotropics among children in foster care, with issues related to dosage amounts and concurrent use of multiple medications. GAO recommended that HHS issue guidance to states regarding oversight of medication to third-party managed care organizations administering Medicaid benefits for children in foster care. The GAO recommended that HHS issue guidance to states on oversight of medication for children in foster care, including psychotropic medication use. However, the guidance did not address the role of third-party managed care organizations in monitoring psychotropic use among foster children. The GAO recommended guidance to state child welfare and Medicaid agencies on oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in care, but did not address the role of third-party MCOs. State officials reported developing practices to support mental health diagnoses and treatment for foster children. State officials in seven states have implemented practices to support appropriate mental health diagnoses and treatment for children in foster care, including guidelines on prescribing psychotropic medications and promoting the use of psychosocial services. Collaboration among stakeholders was identified as a key factor in these efforts. State officials in seven states have developed guidelines for prescribing psychotropic medications and promoting psychosocial services for children in foster care. Strong collaboration among child welfare, Medicaid, and other agencies, along with state outreach to stakeholders, was crucial for successful implementation of oversight practices. The effectiveness of these state practices was not evaluated by the GAO. The GAO found that strong collaboration among child welfare, Medicaid, and other agencies, along with state outreach to stakeholders, was critical in implementing oversight practices for prescribing psychotropic medications to children in foster care. State officials reported using various measures to assess the results of their efforts, including monitoring physician prescribing practices and child outcomes. State officials reported using measures like physician prescribing practices and monitoring child outcomes to assess their efforts in overseeing psychotropic medication use for children in care. However, HHS has not convened meetings with stakeholders engaged in state oversight since 2014. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that HHS has not convened meetings with stakeholders engaged in state oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in care since 2014. GAO recommended that HHS consider cost-effective ways to convene state stakeholders to collaborate on psychotropic medication oversight. HHS has implemented federal requirements for states to have protocols in place for monitoring psychotropic medication use. HHS has implemented federal requirements for states to have protocols in place for monitoring psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. Several federal agencies have collaborated to better understand psychotropic medication use and promote interagency cooperation by publicizing best practices and successful state strategies. Several federal agencies have worked together to gain a better understanding of psychotropic medication use among children, especially those in foster care. The Obama Administration proposed expanding funding for oversight of psychotropic medications in its annual budgets, including for FY2017. The Obama Administration proposed expanding funding for oversight of psychotropic medications for children with mental health needs, including those in foster care under the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program. Under the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program, states must develop a coordinated strategy to ensure access to health care, including mental health and dental services, for children in foster care. This plan involves collaboration between the state child welfare agency, Medicaid agency, and health care experts.
