    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 21107.8 of the Vehicle Code allows cities or counties to designate privately owned offstreet parking facilities for public use, subject to certain regulations. If a city or county enacts an ordinance or resolution authorized by Section 21107.8 of the Vehicle Code, they may allow the operator of a privately owned offstreet parking facility to regulate unauthorized parking. The owner or operator of the facility must include instructions on contesting parking fee invoices for unauthorized parking. If a city or county authorizes regulation of unauthorized parking in a privately owned offstreet parking facility, the owner or operator cannot submit parking fee invoices to the Department of Motor Vehicles to collect unpaid fees by withholding licenses or vehicle registration renewals. An ordinance or resolution does not apply to offstreet parking facilities unless a notice is posted at each entrance warning of public moving vehicle laws and potential parking invoice fees for violators. Parking receipts must also include language about potential parking invoice fees for violators. Section 22507.8 may be enforced without the need for an ordinance or resolution, as long as a parking receipt includes language about potential parking invoice fees for violators. A public hearing and written notice to the owner and operator of the offstreet parking facility are required before enacting any ordinance or resolution. Section 22507.8 can be enforced without the need for an ordinance or resolution, and without posting notices at each entrance to the offstreet parking facility. The department is not obligated to patrol or enforce provisions of this code on privately owned offstreet parking facilities, except for those applicable to private property. Cities or counties authorizing private parking regulation must include specific provisions in their ordinance or resolution. A city or county authorizing private parking regulation must include dispute resolution procedures in their ordinance or resolution, such as a written policy with specified time periods and an administrative hearing process allowing for in-person or mail hearings and administrative review. The dispute resolution policy for private parking regulation must include specified time periods and an administrative hearing process with options for in-person or mail hearings, administrative review, a hearing by a trained third-party examiner, and the ability to pay parking charges in installments for those unable to pay in full. The private parking regulation policy includes a hearing by a third-party examiner, delivery of decisions by mail, installment payment options for those unable to pay in full, a prohibition on incentives based on issued invoices, and a cap on parking invoice fees. The private parking regulation policy includes measures such as prohibiting incentives based on the number of invoices issued or disputed, capping parking invoice fees, and preventing private parking regulators from posing as government agencies."
