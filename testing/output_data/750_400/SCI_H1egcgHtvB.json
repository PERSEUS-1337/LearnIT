    "content": "Contemporary semantic parsing models struggle to generalize to unseen database schemas when translating natural language questions into SQL queries. A unified framework based on relation-aware self-attention mechanism addresses schema encoding, schema linking, and feature representation within a text-to-SQL encoder, boosting exact match accuracy to 53.7% on the challenging Spider dataset. The unified framework, utilizing relation-aware self-attention mechanism, improves exact match accuracy to 53.7% on the Spider dataset compared to 47.4% for the previous state-of-the-art model. This advancement enhances schema linking and alignment in querying databases with natural language, making large datasets more accessible to users unfamiliar with query languages. The release of large annotated datasets containing questions and corresponding database SQL queries has driven progress in translating natural language questions into executable queries. This has led to improvements in schema linking and alignment, enhancing the model's understanding. The potential to query databases with natural language can empower users who are not proficient in query languages. Large annotated datasets with questions and corresponding SQL queries have advanced research in translating natural language questions into executable queries. New tasks like WikiSQL and Spider challenge generalization to unseen database schemas, each query conditioned on a multi-table schema without overlap between train and test sets. Supervised learning models face challenges in generalizing to unseen database schemas in tasks like WikiSQL and Spider. Encoding schemas into suitable representations for decoding SQL queries is complex due to the lack of overlap between train and test sets. Schema generalization is challenging for text-to-SQL semantic parsing models due to the need to encode schema information, including column types and relationships, and recognize natural language references to database columns and tables, known as schema linking. The model must encode schema information, including column types and relationships, and recognize natural language references to database columns and tables, known as schema linking. This challenge of ambiguity in linking is illustrated in an example. Schema linking involves aligning column/table references in a question to the corresponding schema columns/tables. The challenge of ambiguity in linking is illustrated in an example where the semantic parser must consider schema relations and question context to resolve references properly. Prior work has addressed schema encoding, but schema linking remains relatively less explored. The semantic parser must consider both schema relations and question context to align column/table references in a question. Previous work encoded schema relations with a graph neural network, but did not contextualize schema encoding with the question, making it challenging for the model to reason about schema linking. The previous work addressed schema representation using a graph neural network but did not contextualize it with the question, hindering schema linking. This limits information propagation to predefined relations like foreign keys. Global reasoning is crucial for building effective models. The previous work focused on schema representation using a graph neural network but lacked contextualization with the question, hindering schema linking. The new framework, RAT-SQL, integrates global reasoning with predefined schema relations for effective relational structure encoding in the database schema and question. In this work, a unified framework called RAT-SQL is introduced for encoding relational structure in the database schema and questions. It utilizes relation-aware self-attention for global reasoning over schema entities and question words, along with structured reasoning over predefined schema relations. RAT-SQL achieves 53.7% exact match accuracy on the Spider test set, setting a new state-of-the-art result. RAT-SQL utilizes relation-aware self-attention for global reasoning over schema entities and question words, achieving 53.7% exact match accuracy on the Spider test set. This result is currently the state of the art among models unaugmented with pretrained BERT embeddings. Additionally, RAT-SQL enables the model to build more accurate internal representations of the question's alignment with schema columns and tables. Semantic parsing of natural language to SQL queries has gained popularity with the creation of multi-table datasets like WikiSQL and Spider. RAT-SQL, utilizing relation-aware self-attention, achieves state-of-the-art results in building accurate internal representations of question alignment with schema columns and tables. Schema encoding is less challenging in WikiSQL compared to Spider due to the absence of multi-table relations, making schema linking more difficult in Spider. The state-of-the-art semantic parser on WikiSQL achieves a test set accuracy of 91.8%, significantly higher than the state of the art on Spider, which has richer natural language expressiveness and less restricted SQL grammar. The state-of-the-art models evaluated on Spider use attentional architectures for question/schema encoding and AST-based structural architectures for query decoding. IRNet encodes the question and schema separately with LSTM and self-attention, using custom type vectors for schema linking. They decode a query in an intermediate representation (IR) with the AST-based decoder of Yin and Neubig. IRNet (Guo et al., 2019) and Bogin et al. (2019b) both focus on schema encoding and linking in query processing. IRNet uses LSTM and self-attention for question and schema encoding, while Bogin et al. employ a graph neural network. Both models emphasize the importance of schema encoding and linking in query generation. The Bogin et al. (2019b) study focuses on schema encoding and linking using a graph neural network in an intermediate representation (IR) with higher-level abstraction than SQL. They emphasize the importance of schema encoding and linking in query processing, highlighting the need for feature engineering techniques to augment word vectors. In contrast, RAT-SQL offers a unified framework for encoding relational information among inputs. Additionally, Bogin et al. (2019a) introduced Global-GNN, a different approach to schema linking for Spider that incorporates global reasoning between question words and schema. The relational framework of RAT-SQL provides a unified way to encode arbitrary relational information among inputs. Global-GNN, on the other hand, applies global reasoning between question words and schema columns/tables, with question word representations influencing schema representations. Global-GNN implements global reasoning between question words and schema columns/tables by gating the graph neural network. Unlike RAT-SQL, question word representations influence schema representations, and message propagation is limited to schema-induced edges. In contrast, the relation-aware transformer mechanism allows encoding arbitrary relations between question words and schema elements explicitly. The relation-aware transformer mechanism allows encoding arbitrary relations between question words and schema elements explicitly using self-attention, extending previous work on relation-aware self-attention applied to sequences of words in machine translation. Relation-aware self-attention can encode complex relationships within unordered sets of elements, such as columns and tables in a database schema. This is the first application of relation-aware self-attention to joint representation learning with predefined relations. The RAT-SQL framework utilizes relation-aware self-attention to encode complex relationships within database schemas and between schema elements and questions. This is the first application of such attention mechanism to joint representation learning with predefined and softly induced relations. The RAT-SQL framework applies relation-aware self-attention to encode complex relationships in database schemas and between schema elements and questions. It defines the text-to-SQL semantic parsing problem and introduces schema linking implementation. The goal is to generate SQL queries from natural language questions. Our framework encodes relational structure between questions and schemas to generate SQL queries. The schema consists of columns and tables, with the desired SQL program represented as an abstract syntax tree. The schema in the context of SQL queries consists of columns and tables, with some columns serving as primary or foreign keys. Each column has a type such as number or text, and the desired SQL program is represented as an abstract syntax tree. The encoding mechanism aims to bias towards predefined relations within the schema. The schema in SQL consists of columns and tables, with primary and foreign keys. Each column has a type like number or text. Schema linking aligns question words with columns or tables, crucial for generating SQL queries. An alignment matrix is used to model the latent alignment, biased towards string-match relations. In schema linking, the alignment between question words and columns/tables is crucial for generating SQL queries. An alignment matrix is used to model this alignment, inspired by string-match relations. The database schema is represented as a directed graph, with nodes representing tables and columns labeled with their names and types. The database schema is represented as a directed graph, with nodes for tables and columns labeled with their names and types. Each node and edge in the graph has a label, and an edge exists between nodes x and y based on Table 1. The decoder in the schema linking process involves choosing a column. Figure 3 provides an overview of the process. The database schema is represented as a directed graph with nodes for tables and columns labeled with their names and types. For each pair of nodes x and y in the graph, Table 1 describes when there exists an edge from x to y and the label it should have. An initial representation is obtained for each node in the graph using a bidirectional LSTM over the words in the label. The approach involves obtaining initial representations for nodes in a graph and words in a question using bidirectional LSTMs. The LSTM for graph nodes concatenates output from initial and final time steps, while the LSTM for the question looks up word embeddings for input tokens. Parameters are not shared between LSTMs. The approach involves obtaining initial representations for nodes in a graph and words in a question using bidirectional LSTMs. Parameters are not shared between LSTMs. The representations are then imbued with information from the schema graph using relation-aware self-attention. The approach involves obtaining initial representations for nodes in a graph and words in a question using bidirectional LSTMs. Parameters are not shared between LSTMs. These initial representations are independent of each other. To imbue these representations with schema graph information, relation-aware self-attention is used. This self-attention is relation-aware and transforms input elements using a fully-connected layer. The relationship between elements in the input is encoded in the terms r ij. The text discusses relation-aware self-attention in transforming input elements using fully-connected layers. It explains the process of obtaining initial representations for nodes in a graph and words in a question, followed by applying a stack of N relation-aware self-attention layers with separate weights for each layer. The input consists of elements from c, t, and q. A stack of N relation-aware self-attention layers is applied with separate weights for each layer. The directed graph representing the schema includes edge types based on specific descriptions. After processing through a stack of N encoder layers, a directed graph is created to represent the schema with edge types based on specific descriptions. The edge types include SAME-TABLE, FOREIGN-KEY-COL-F, FOREIGN-KEY-COL-R, PRIMARY-KEY-F, PRIMARY-KEY-R, and BELONGS-TO-R. Each edge represents a relationship between nodes in the graph. In the schema representation, various edge types define relationships between nodes in the graph, such as SAME-TABLE, FOREIGN-KEY-COL-F, PRIMARY-KEY-F, and BELONGS-TO-R. Additionally, different types of foreign key relationships are established between tables, columns, and primary keys. In the schema representation, different types of foreign key relationships are established between tables, columns, and primary keys. We define a set of relation types and map each type to an embedding to obtain values for every pair of elements in x. In the schema representation, various foreign key relationships are established between tables, columns, and primary keys. To obtain values for every pair of elements in x, a set of relation types is defined and mapped to an embedding. Additional types are added beyond those listed in Table 1 to account for cases where nodes do not correspond to question words, there are no edges between certain schema nodes, and there are no self-edges. In the schema representation, foreign key relationships are established between tables, columns, and primary keys. Additional relation types are defined to align column/table references in the question with schema columns/tables. These types include COLUMN-IDENTITY, TABLE-IDENTITY, COLUMN-COLUMN, COLUMN-TABLE, TABLE-COLUMN, and TABLE-TABLE. In schema representation, foreign key relationships are established between tables, columns, and primary keys. Relation types like COLUMN-IDENTITY, TABLE-IDENTITY, COLUMN-COLUMN, COLUMN-TABLE, TABLE-COLUMN, and TABLE-TABLE are defined. To aid in aligning column/table references in questions with schema columns/tables, relation types are further defined based on exact or partial matches of n-grams in the question text. The text discusses matching n-grams in questions with column and table names in a schema representation, assigning types such as QUESTION-COLUMN-M and QUESTION-TABLE-M based on exact or partial matches. This adds 33 types beyond the initial 10 defined in Table 1. The text discusses assigning types like QUESTION-COLUMN-M and QUESTION-TABLE-M based on exact or partial matches between n-grams in questions and schema representation. This adds 33 types beyond the initial 10 defined in Table 1. Memory-Schema Alignment Matrix uses relation-aware attention as a pointer mechanism. The text discusses aligning memory elements with columns/tables in SQL queries using relation-aware attention. The alignment matrix should respect constraints like sparsity to capture real alignments. The memory-schema alignment matrix in SQL queries should respect constraints like sparsity to capture real alignments. To bias the soft alignment towards real discrete structures, an auxiliary loss is added to encourage sparsity of the alignment matrix. The alignment matrix in SQL queries should align with specific columns and tables, with an added auxiliary loss to promote sparsity. The model's belief of the best alignment is used as ground truth, with a cross-entropy loss to strengthen this alignment. The input is encoded, and a decoder is used to generate the SQL query. The model's belief of the best alignment is used as ground truth in SQL queries. A cross-entropy loss is applied to strengthen this alignment, with relevant columns and tables from the input encoded. The decoder generates the SQL query using an LSTM to output decoder actions in depth-first traversal order. The decoder generates SQL queries as an abstract syntax tree using an LSTM to output decoder actions in depth-first traversal order, updating the LSTM's state accordingly. The LSTM decoder generates SQL queries as an abstract syntax tree by updating its state with previous actions and node embeddings. Multi-head attention is used to obtain z_t from the LSTM output.

Default initialization method and batch size of 20 are used for training up to 40,000 steps. The Spider dataset (Yu et al., 2018b) is used with 8,659 examples for training, including data from Restaurants, GeoQuery, Scholar, Academic, Yelp, and IMDB datasets. Evaluations are mostly done on the development set with 1,034 examples.

Evaluations are mainly conducted on the development set with 1,034 examples, using metrics similar to previous work. The development set contains 1,034 examples with unique databases and schemas. Results are reported using the same metrics as previous work, focusing on exact match accuracy. RAT-SQL outperforms all other methods on the hidden test set, coming close to the best BERT-augmented model. In Table 2a, RAT-SQL outperforms all other approaches on the hidden test set, even coming within 1.3% of the best BERT-augmented model. Adding BERT embeddings to RAT-SQL may lead to state-of-the-art performance among BERT models. Performance drops with increasing difficulty, as shown in Table 2b. Adding BERT augmentation to RAT-SQL could potentially lead to state-of-the-art performance among BERT models, with a 7% typical improvement. Performance drops with increasing difficulty, as seen in Table 2b. Schema linking relations significantly improve accuracy, as shown in an ablation study in Table 2c. The generalization gap between development and test was affected by a drop in accuracy on hard questions. Schema linking relations improved accuracy significantly, as demonstrated in an ablation study. The alignment between a question and the database schema also impacted model accuracy. The alignment between a question and the database schema impacts model accuracy by providing a mechanism for aligning words to columns. The alignment matrix helps the model align words to columns, with additional terms in the loss encouraging it to act like an alignment. In the final model, the alignment loss terms did not impact overall accuracy, despite earlier improvements seen during development. Hyper-parameter tuning that increased encoding depth may have eliminated the need for explicit supervision. The alignment loss terms did not affect overall accuracy in the final model, despite earlier improvements observed during development. Hyper-parameter tuning that increased encoding depth may have eliminated the need for explicit supervision. An accurate alignment representation has additional benefits, such as identifying question words for copying when a constant is required. Depth eliminated the need for explicit supervision of alignment. An accurate alignment representation has benefits like identifying question words for copying when a constant is needed. The alignment matrix correctly identifies key words referencing columns, but there are some mistakes in alignment. The alignment matrix correctly identifies key words referencing columns in the table (cylinders, model, horsepower), but mistakenly aligns \"model\" to the wrong table (cars_data) instead of car_names. Despite challenges in semantic parsing of text to SQL, models struggle to learn good representations for a given database schema and properly link column/table references in questions. This requires reasoning about the role of columns/tables in the context of a question. In this work, a unified framework is presented to address challenges in schema encoding and linking. Through relation-aware self-attention, the model learns schema and question word representations based on their alignment with predefined schema relations, leading to significant state-of-the-art improvement in semantic parsing of text to SQL. The unified framework presented in this work addresses schema encoding and linking challenges by utilizing relation-aware self-attention to learn schema and question word representations based on alignment with predefined schema relations. This approach leads to significant improvements in text-to-SQL parsing and allows for the combination of hard schema relations and soft self-attended relations in the same encoder architecture. This joint representation learning is expected to be beneficial for various learning tasks with predefined structure.

In an oracle experiment, the decoder's ability to select the correct column was evaluated, even with schema encoding and linking improvements. The oracle experiment evaluated the decoder's ability to select the correct column in text-to-SQL parsing, showing an accuracy of 99.4% with predefined structure. The oracle experiment tested the decoder's ability to select the correct column or table in text-to-SQL parsing. Using \"oracle sketch\" and \"oracle cols\" resulted in 99.4% accuracy, verifying the grammar's effectiveness. However, using only one oracle led to lower accuracies of 70.9% and 67.6%, indicating incorrect column or table selections in the output. The oracle experiment showed that the grammar is effective in answering most questions in the data set. However, using only \"oracle sketch\" or \"oracle cols\" resulted in lower accuracies of 70.9% and 67.6% respectively, indicating incorrect column or table selections in the output. This suggests that both column and structure errors are important areas for improvement in the future."
