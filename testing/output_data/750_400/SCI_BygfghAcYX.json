This capacity bound correlates with test error behavior as network sizes increase, potentially explaining the generalization improvement with over-parametrization. Additionally, a matching lower bound for Rademacher complexity is presented, showing improvement over existing measures. The capacity bound for two layer ReLU networks correlates with test error behavior as network sizes increase, potentially explaining generalization improvement with over-parametrization. A matching lower bound for Rademacher complexity is also presented, showing improvement over existing measures. Deep neural networks have been successful in various tasks, starting an arms race of training larger networks for better test performance. Rademacher complexity improves capacity lower bounds for neural networks, which have been successful in various tasks. Over-parametrized networks can fit random labels but achieve smaller generalization error with real labels. Training larger networks has led to better test performance. Increasing the capacity of neural networks by using over-parametrized models has led to better test performance, despite the ability to fit random labels. This contradicts traditional wisdom in learning, as larger models typically result in overfitting. However, in the case of neural networks, increasing model size only helps in achieving smaller generalization error with real labels. Increasing model capacity in neural networks can lead to better generalization error, even without explicit regularization. This contradicts traditional wisdom that larger models typically overfit the training data. Increasing model size improves generalization error even without explicit regularization. Empirical observations show that training on models with more hidden units decreases test error for image classification. This improvement in generalization with over-parametrization raises questions about the right measure of complexity. The increase in model size leads to a decrease in test error for image classification on MNIST and CIFAR-10. Various studies have shown this trend across different architectural and hyper-parameter choices. The improvement in generalization with over-parametrization raises questions about the appropriate measure of complexity for neural networks. Existing complexity measures based on the total number of parameters do not fully capture this behavior. Different norm, margin, and sharpness based measures have been suggested to better assess the capacity of neural networks. The complexity of neural networks and their generalization behavior have been studied extensively. Existing measures based on total parameters do not fully capture this phenomenon. Different norm, margin, and sharpness based measures have been proposed to better understand neural network capacity. Even when a network can perfectly fit training data, test error continues to decrease. Even with a large enough network to fit training data perfectly, test error continues to decrease, indicating the complexity of hidden units and their impact on network output. The test error decreases for larger networks, showing the complexity and impact of hidden units on network output. The average unit capacity and impact decrease faster than 1/ \u221a h, where h is the number of hidden units. The average unit capacity and impact decrease faster than 1/ \u221a h as the number of hidden units increases. Previous studies have shown that complexity measures fail to explain why over-parametrization helps in neural networks. Existing complexity measures fail to explain the benefits of over-parametrization in neural networks, as they increase with network size. Bartlett et al. (2017) and Neyshabur et al. (2017) showed that these measures, such as spectral norm and 1,2 norm, increase with network size. Dziugaite & Roy (2017) also found that numerical generalization bounds increase with network size, even for two-layer networks. Numerical generalization bounds based on PAC-Bayes increase with network size, even for two-layer networks. To further study this phenomenon, simplifying the architecture while preserving the property of interest is necessary. Therefore, two-layer ReLU networks were chosen for analysis. In this study, the focus is on the impact of the number of hidden units on the measures of neural networks. Two-layer ReLU networks were chosen for analysis as they exhibit similar behavior to more complex architectures. A tighter generalization bound is proven for these networks, showing a correlation with test error that decreases with an increasing number of hidden units. The study focuses on the impact of hidden units on neural networks, proving a tighter generalization bound for two-layer ReLU networks. The capacity bound correlates with test error and decreases with more hidden units. Complexity is characterized at a unit level, with measures shrinking faster than 1/ \u221a h for each hidden unit as network size increases.

Complexity is characterized at a unit level, with measures shrinking faster than 1/ \u221a h for each hidden unit as network size increases. The generalization bound depends on the Frobenius norm of the top layer and the difference of the hidden layer weights with the initialization, decreasing with increasing network size. The generalization bound for two-layer ReLU networks depends on the Frobenius norm of the top layer and the difference of hidden layer weights with initialization, decreasing as network size increases. In the over-parametrized setting, the closeness of learned weights to initialization can be understood by considering the limiting case of infinite hidden units. Training just the top layer in this extreme setting minimizes training error due to randomly initialized hidden layer having all possible features. In the over-parametrized setting, training just the top layer of the network with infinite hidden units minimizes training error by selecting the right features to minimize loss. This suggests that as networks become over-parametrized, optimization algorithms require less tuning of hidden unit weights to find the optimal solution.

This suggests that as networks become over-parametrized, optimization algorithms require less tuning of hidden unit weights to find the optimal solution. Dziugaite & Roy (2017) and Nagarajan & Kolter (2017) emphasize the importance of initialization in the optimization process.

Dziugaite & Roy (2017) and Nagarajan & Kolter (2017) emphasize the importance of initialization in the optimization process. Dziugaite & Roy (2017) numerically evaluated a PAC-Bayes measure from the initialization used by algorithms, while Nagarajan & Kolter (2017) observed the significant role of initialization and proved an initialization dependent generalization bound for linear networks. Liang et al. (2017) suggested a Fisher-Rao metric based complexity measure that correlates with generalization behavior in larger networks. Our contributions in this paper include an empirical investigation of over-parametrization in neural networks on three datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN). We show that existing complexity measures increase with the number of hidden units, which does not fully explain generalization behavior. In this paper, the authors empirically investigate the impact of over-parametrization on generalization in neural networks using three datasets. They show that existing complexity measures do not fully explain the generalization behavior with over-parametrization. Additionally, they propose tighter generalization bounds for two-layer ReLU networks and introduce a complexity measure that decreases with the increasing number of hidden units. The authors propose tighter generalization bounds for two-layer ReLU networks and introduce a complexity measure that decreases with the increasing number of hidden units. They also provide a matching lower bound for the Rademacher complexity of two-layer ReLU networks with a scalar output, which considerably improves over previous bounds. The authors present a lower bound for the Rademacher complexity of two-layer ReLU networks with a scalar output, improving upon previous bounds. The network consists of fully connected layers with input dimension d, output dimension c, and hidden units h. The lower bound presented is larger than the Lipschitz constant of the network class. It focuses on two-layer fully connected ReLU networks for c-class classification tasks. The margin operator \u00b5 is defined as a function to select the prediction based on output scores. The margin operator \u00b5 is defined for c-class classification tasks, selecting predictions based on output scores. The ramp loss is defined for any distribution D and margin \u03b3 > 0, representing the expected margin loss of a predictor f(.). The ramp loss is defined as the difference between the score of the correct label and the maximum score among other labels. It is bounded between 0 and 1, with the expected margin loss of a predictor f(.) defined for any distribution D and margin \u03b3 > 0. The loss function L \u03b3 (.) is bounded between 0 and 1, with the empirical estimate denoted as L \u03b3 (f). Setting \u03b3 = 0 reduces it to classification loss, denoted as L 0 (f). The generalization bound holds for any function f \u2208 F with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b4 over the choice of the training set of size m. The Rademacher complexity is a capacity measure that captures the ability of functions in a function class to fit random labels, increasing with the complexity of the class. We will bound the Rademacher complexity of neural networks to get a bound on the generalization error. The Rademacher complexity is a capacity measure that captures the ability of functions in a function class to fit random labels, increasing with the complexity of the class. To bound the Rademacher complexity of neural networks and generalize the error, the right function class must be chosen to explain the decrease in generalization error with increasing width. The Rademacher complexity depends on the function class chosen to capture trained networks, which should be smaller to explain the decrease in generalization error with increasing width. Choosing a larger function class may result in weaker capacity bounds. Experiments on network layers with increasing hidden units were conducted on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with similar observations on SVHN and MNIST datasets in Section A. The behavior of network layers with increasing hidden units was investigated on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The spectral and Frobenius norms initially decrease but eventually increase with h, with the Frobenius norm increasing at a faster rate. The distance Frobenius norm w.r.t. initialization decreases, indicating an increase in the Frobenius norm. The spectral and Frobenius norms of the learned layer on SVHN and MNIST datasets initially decrease but eventually increase with h, with the Frobenius norm increasing at a faster rate. The distance to initialization per unit and the distribution of angles between learned weights and initial weights are also analyzed. The increase in the Frobenius norm of weights in larger networks is attributed to the increase in random initialization. The per unit distance to initialization decreases with increasing network size, leading to a shift in the distribution of angles between learned and initial weights. This quantity, referred to as unit capacity, plays a key role in capacity bounds. The per unit distance to initialization decreases with increasing network size, leading to a shift in the distribution of angles between learned and initial weights. This quantity, referred to as unit capacity, plays a key role in capacity bounds. In the second layer, the behavior of different measures changes with increasing network size. In the second layer of the network, the Frobenius norm and distance to initialization decrease with network size, indicating a limited role of initialization. The norm of outgoing weights from hidden units decreases faster than 1/\u221ah as the size grows. The Frobenius norm and distance to initialization decrease with network size in the second layer, suggesting a limited role of initialization. The norm of outgoing weights from hidden units decreases faster than 1/\u221ah as the size grows, impacting the final decision. Unit impact is defined as \u03b1 i = v i 2. The impact of each classifier on the final decision shrinks faster than 1/\u221ah. Unit impact is defined as \u03b1 i = v i 2, the magnitude of outgoing weights from unit i. The hypothesis class of two-layer neural networks depends on the capacity and impact of hidden units. The unit impact, defined as \u03b1 i = v i 2, is the magnitude of outgoing weights from unit i. Empirical observations suggest that neural networks from real data have bounded unit capacity and impact, leading to a better understanding of generalization behavior in this function class. The hypothesis class of neural networks using parameters in set W has bounded unit capacity and impact. Studying the generalization behavior of this function class can enhance our understanding of these networks. A generalization bound for two layer ReLU networks is proven by bounding the Rademacher complexity of the class F W in terms of the sum over hidden units of unit capacity and impact. In this section, a generalization bound for two layer ReLU networks is proven by bounding the Rademacher complexity of the class F W in terms of the sum over hidden units of unit capacity and impact. The theorem provides a bound for the Rademacher complexity of the composition of loss function \u03b3 over the class F W. The proof is detailed in the supplementary Section C, utilizing a new technique. The generalization bound for two layer ReLU networks is proven by bounding the Rademacher complexity of the class F W. The proof utilizes a new technique to decompose the complexity of the network into complexity of the hidden units, different from previous works that decompose it to layers. The proof introduces a new technique to decompose network complexity into hidden units, providing a tighter bound on Rademacher complexity for two-layer neural networks. This generalization bound applies to any function in the defined class, with specific \u03b1 and \u03b2 values fixed before training. The proof introduces a technique to decompose network complexity into hidden units, providing a tighter bound on Rademacher complexity for two-layer neural networks. The generalization bound applies to any function in the defined class, with specific \u03b1 and \u03b2 values fixed before training. The following theorem states the generalization bound for any two-layer ReLU network. The generalization bound for any two-layer ReLU network is stated in Theorem 2, which provides a bound on the generalization error with probability 1 - \u03b4 over the choice of the training set. This bound improves over existing bounds and decreases with increasing network width in practice. Additionally, an explicit lower bound for the Rademacher complexity is shown in Theorem 3. The generalization error for two-layer ReLU networks is bounded by DISPLAYFORM2, which improves over existing bounds and decreases with increasing network width. An explicit lower bound for Rademacher complexity is also provided, matching the first term in the generalization bound. The additive factor\u00d5( h/m) in the bound is small in the regimes of interest, resulting in an overall decrease in capacity. The generalization error for two-layer ReLU networks is bounded by DISPLAYFORM2, improving existing bounds and decreasing with wider networks. The additive factor\u00d5( h/m) in the bound is small in relevant regimes, leading to a decrease in overall capacity. Theorem 3 shows the tightness of the bound, with a finer tradeoff between terms for p norms in Appendix Section B. In Appendix Section B, the generalization bound is extended to p norms, showing a tradeoff between terms. The key complexity terms differ between bounds, with U \u2212 U0 1,2 in one and U \u2212 U0 F in the other. The size of the network trained on CIFAR-10 is discussed in TAB1. The complexity term in the bound is U - U0 F VF for the range of h considered, where V2 and VF differ by number of classes. The bound increases with h mainly due to the term U - U0 1,2. Experimental comparison involves training two layer ReLU networks of size h on CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets. When hidden units have similar capacity, networks of size 128 can reach zero training error on CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets. However, larger networks can achieve better generalization even without regularization. The training and test error for CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets are shown in FIG0 and FIG4. Networks of size 128 can reach zero training error, but larger networks show better generalization without regularization. Unit capacity and unit impact decrease with increasing network size. The number of epochs needed to reach 0.01 cross-entropy loss decreases for larger networks. The unit-wise properties of unit capacity and unit impact decrease with increasing network size. The number of epochs required to reach 0.01 cross-entropy loss decreases for larger networks. Generalization bounds typically scale as C/m where C is the effective capacity of the function class. The effective capacity of the function class decreases with network size. Our bound is the only one that decreases with h and is consistently lower than other norm-based data-independent bounds, even outperforming VC-dimension for networks larger than 1024. The numerical values may be loose but are valuable for understanding relative generalization. Our bound decreases with network size and outperforms other norm-based bounds, even surpassing VC-dimension for networks larger than 1024. The numerical values, though loose, provide insight into generalization behavior. Applying data-dependent techniques can significantly improve these bounds. Our capacity bound decreases with network size and surpasses VC-dimension for networks larger than 1024. Applying data-dependent techniques can significantly improve these bounds, providing insight into generalization behavior. Our capacity bound decreases with network size, surpassing VC-dimension for networks larger than 1024. It is the only bound that decreases with size, potentially pointing to properties allowing over-parametrized networks to generalize. The complexity measure is compared between networks trained on real and random labels to analyze generalization behavior. In this section, a lower bound for the Rademacher complexity of neural networks is proven, matching the dominant term in the upper bound. The distribution of margin normalized by the complexity measure is plotted for networks trained with true and random labels, showing correlation with generalization behavior. The lower bound for the Rademacher complexity of neural networks is proven in this section, matching the dominant term in the upper bound. The parameter set DISPLAYFORM0 is defined, and F W is the function class defined on W. For any DISPLAYFORM1, W \u2286 W. The lower bound for the Rademacher complexity of neural networks is proven in this section, matching the dominant term in the upper bound. The parameter set DISPLAYFORM0 is defined, and F W is the function class defined on W. The spectral norm of the hidden layer is constrained for comparison with existing results and extends the lower bound to a larger function class F W. The proof is provided in supplementary Section C.3. The lower bound for the Rademacher complexity of neural networks matches the dominant term in the upper bound, showing tightness. This is proven in supplementary Section C.3, extending the lower bound to a larger function class F W. The lower bound for the Rademacher complexity of neural networks matches the dominant term in the upper bound, showing tightness. This is proven in supplementary Section C.3, extending the lower bound to a larger function class F W. To match the second term in the upper bound for Theorem 1, consider the setting with c = 1 and \u03b2 = 0, resulting in DISPLAYFORM3 where DISPLAYFORM4. When \u03b2 = 0, the function class DISPLAYFORM5, indicating the upper bound in Theorem 1 is tight. This suggests that even with more information, such as bounded spectral norm with respect to the reference matrix being small, the upper bound cannot be improved. Previous capacity lower bounds for spectral norm bounded classes of neural networks with a scalar output and element-wise activation functions correspond to the Lipschitz. The lower bound for the Rademacher complexity of neural networks shows a gap between the Lipschitz constant of the network and the capacity of neural networks. This non-trivial lower bound excludes neural networks with all rank-1 matrices. The lower bound for the Rademacher complexity of neural networks reveals a gap between the Lipschitz constant and network capacity. It excludes neural networks with all rank-1 matrices as weights, showing a capacity gap between ReLU activations and linear networks. This bound does not apply to linear networks and can be extended to more layers by setting weight matrices in intermediate layers to the Identity matrix. The lower bound for the Rademacher complexity of neural networks highlights a capacity gap between ReLU activations and linear networks, excluding those with all rank-1 weight matrices. This bound does not hold for linear networks and can be extended to more layers by setting intermediate layer weight matrices to the Identity matrix. The function class defined by the parameter set shows a stronger lower bound for this function. The function class defined by the parameter set has a stronger lower bound for this function, improving on previous results. Theorem 7 in Golowich et al. (2018) also provides a lower bound for the composition of 1-Lipschitz loss function and neural networks with bounded spectral norm. Our result improves the lower bound in Bartlett et al. (2017) by a factor of \u221a h for the function class. Golowich et al. (2018) also gives a \u2126(s 1 s 2 \u221a c) lower bound for neural networks with bounded spectral norm. Our new capacity bound for neural networks decreases with the increasing number of hidden units, potentially explaining better generalization performance of larger networks. In this paper, a new capacity bound for neural networks is presented, which decreases with the increasing number of hidden units. The focus is on understanding the role of width in the generalization behavior of two layer networks. Future studies will explore the interplay between depth and width in controlling network capacity. A matching lower bound is provided, improving on current lower bounds for neural networks.

A new capacity bound for neural networks is presented, with a matching lower bound provided for comparison. Future research aims to explore optimization algorithms converging to low complexity networks. In this paper, the focus is on capacity bounds for neural networks, with interest in obtaining bounds with smaller values. The study does not address optimization algorithms converging to low complexity networks or the effects of different hyperparameter choices on solution complexity. Implicit regularization effects of optimization algorithms for neural networks are left for future exploration.

Generalization bounds were calculated with a margin set to the 5th percentile of data points. Bounds were adjusted for binary classification and the number of classes. Reference matrices were utilized in the bounds given in Bartlett et al. (2017) and BID0. In binary classification, BID2 and Neyshabur et al. (2015c) were adjusted by factors to ensure linear increase with the number of classes. Random initialization was used as the reference matrix for bounds. Distributions were estimated using Gaussian kernel density estimation. Figures 6 and 7 display measures on networks of different sizes trained on SVHN and MNIST datasets. The over-parametrization phenomenon is shown in the left panel of FIG10. In Bartlett et al. (2017) and BID0, random initialization was used as the reference matrix for bounds. Distributions were estimated using Gaussian kernel density estimation. Figures 6 and 7 show measures on networks of different sizes trained on SVHN and MNIST datasets. The over-parametrization phenomenon is depicted in the left panel of FIG10. Theorem 2 was generalized to p norm, with Lemma 11 introducing a cover for the p ball with entry-wise dominance. The over-parametrization phenomenon in the MNIST dataset is illustrated in FIG10. The generalization bound is compared to others in the middle and right panels. Theorem 2 is extended to the p norm, with Lemma 11 introducing a cover for the p ball with entry-wise dominance. The generalization error is bounded for any h, p \u2265 2, \u03b3 > 0, \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1), and U 0 \u2208 R h\u00d7d. The generalization error bound for any h, p \u2265 2, \u03b3 > 0, \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1), and U 0 \u2208 R h\u00d7d is given by a tight upper bound that decreases with h for larger values. This bound improves on previous results and is of the same order if all rows of V have the same norm. The generalization error bound decreases with h for larger values and is tighter if all rows of V have the same norm. With probability 1 \u2212 \u03b4, for any function f(x) = V[Ux] +, the error is bounded. A vector-contraction inequality for Rademacher complexities is used in the proof. The generalization error bound for function f(x) = V[Ux] + is bounded using a vector-contraction inequality for Rademacher complexities. Lemma 7 from Maurer (2016) is utilized in the proof, showing the relationship between the norm of a vector and the expected magnitude of its inner product with Rademacher random variables. Lemma 7 from Maurer (2016) is used to bound the generalization error of a function using Rademacher complexities. The Rademacher complexity of a class of networks can be decomposed to that of hidden units, as shown in the proof. The Rademacher complexity of the class F W can be bounded using Lemma 9, which decomposes it to that of hidden units. The proof involves induction on t and the Lipschitzness of the ramp loss. The Rademacher complexity of the class F W can be bounded using Lemma 9, decomposing it to hidden units. The induction proof involves the Lipschitzness of the ramp loss, showing the bound for t = t + 1. The ramp loss is Lipschitz with respect to each dimension and \u221a2\u03b3-Lipschitz overall. Lemma 10, the Ledoux-Talagrand contraction, is used in the proof of Theorem 1, showing the convexity and Lipschitzness of functions. Lemma 10 (Ledoux-Talagrand contraction, Ledoux & Talagrand (1991)). Let f: R+ \u2192 R+ be convex and increasing. Let \u03c6i: R \u2192 R satisfy \u03c6i(0) = 0 and be L-Lipschitz. Let \u03bei be independent Rademacher random variables. The lemma is used in the proof of Theorem 1. The proof is completed by taking the sum of the inequality over j from 1 to h. The covering lemma allows us to prove the generalization bound in Theorem 5 without assuming the knowledge of the norms of the network parameters. Lemma 10 (Ledoux-Talagrand contraction, Ledoux & Talagrand (1991)) states that for a convex and increasing function f, with Lipschitz continuous functions \u03c6i and independent Rademacher random variables \u03bei, the proof is completed by summing the inequality over j from 1 to h. Lemma 11 introduces a covering lemma to prove the generalization bound in Theorem 5 without requiring knowledge of network parameter norms. Lemma 11 introduces a covering lemma to prove the generalization bound in Theorem 5 without requiring knowledge of network parameter norms. The lemma shows how to cover a p ball with a dominating set and bounds the size of such a cover. By construction, a set of vectors can be found using the lemma, with the generalization error bounded under certain conditions. Lemma 13 states that a set of vectors can be found to bound the generalization error under certain conditions. The proof involves applying a union bound on Lemma 12, with specific constraints on the norms of the vectors. Lemma 13 provides bounds on generalization error by applying a union bound on Lemma 12 with specific vector norm constraints. Lemma 14 provides specific results for the case p = 2, giving bounds on generalization error for a function f(x) = V[Ux] +. Lemma 14 gives bounds on generalization error for a function f(x) = V[Ux] + with specific results for p = 2. The proof of Theorem 2 directly follows from Lemma 14. The generalization bound for p = 2 and \u00b5 = 3 \u221a 2 4 \u2212 1 is directly upper bounded. The proof of Theorem 2 follows from Lemma 14, with Lemma 15 providing a looser generalization bound for any p \u2265 2. Lemma 15 provides a generalization bound for any p \u2265 2, which is looser than Lemma 14 for p = 2 due to extra constants and logarithmic factors. The generalization error is bounded for any function f(x) = V[Ux] + with certain conditions. The generalization error for any function f(x) = V[Ux] + is bounded by Lemma 15 for p \u2265 2. The proof involves upper bounding the generalization bound and using specific values for \u00b5 and p. The proof of Theorem 5 follows from Lemma 15 by using notation to hide constants and logarithmic factors. The proof of Theorem 3 starts with the case where h = d = 2k, m = n2k for some k, n \u2208 N. The dataset is divided into 2k groups, each containing n copies of a different element. The proof of Theorem 3 follows from Lemma 15 by using notation to hide constants and logarithmic factors. The dataset is divided into 2k groups, each containing n copies of a different element in the standard orthonormal basis. The function F(\u03be) is defined based on the value of i(\u03be), and U(\u03be) is chosen as the product of a diagonal matrix and F(\u03be). Each group has n copies of a different element in the standard orthonormal basis. The function F(\u03be) is defined based on the value of i(\u03be), and U(\u03be) is chosen as the product of a diagonal matrix and F(\u03be), where F(\u03be) 2 \u2264 1 and the 2-norm of each row of F is upper bounded by 1."
