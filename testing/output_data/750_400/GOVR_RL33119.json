    "content": "Prior to the passage of SAFETEA, the most recent authorization for federal highway, highway safety, and transit programs was the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21, P.L. 105-278), which provided funds for FY1998-FY2003. After October 1, 2003, federal surface transportation programs operated on short-term extension acts. Long-term reauthorizations, like TEA-21, are preferred for better long-term planning and construction needs in the surface transportation community. After the expiration of TEA-21, federal surface transportation programs operated on short-term extensions, causing uncertainty in funding. The passage of SAFETEA was welcomed by highway and transit interests for providing long-term planning and construction stability. The passage of SAFETEA was welcomed by highway and transit interests for providing long-term planning and construction stability, despite delays in its passage converting it from a six-year bill to just over a four-year bill expiring in FY2009. Federal funding for surface transportation is closely linked to the revenue stream provided by the highway trust fund, which consists of separate accounts for highways and mass transit. The primary revenue sources for these accounts are the 18.4 cent fuel tax. The passage of SAFETEA was welcomed by highway and transit interests, despite delays converting it from a six-year bill to just over a four-year bill expiring in FY2009. Federal funding for surface transportation is closely linked to the revenue stream provided by the highway trust fund, which consists of separate accounts for highways and mass transit. The primary revenue sources for these accounts are the 18.4 cent fuel tax, with 90% of the income coming from gasoline and diesel fuel taxes. The highway trust fund relies heavily on fuel taxes, specifically the 18.4 cent per gallon tax on gasoline and 24.4 cent per gallon tax on diesel fuel, which provide about 90% of the fund's income. Additional taxes go towards the transit account and a leaking underground storage tank fund. There have been multiple tax increases over the fund's almost 50-year history, with the last one occurring in 1993. Initially, these funds were deposited into the Treasury general funds for deficit reduction until FY1998. The trust fund, established almost 50 years ago, has seen several tax increases over the years. In FY2004, the highway account received $31 billion in tax revenues, while the mass transit account received $5 billion. The trust fund has been a reliable source of funding for surface transportation, collecting more than it has expended for most of its history. The trust fund has been a reliable source of funding for surface transportation, collecting more than it has expended for most of its history. In FY2004, the highway account received $31 billion in tax revenues, while the mass transit account received $5 billion. However, in recent years, the trust fund's unexpended balance has been decreasing as expenditures exceed revenues. The FY2004 limitation on obligations for the trust fund was set at $33.6 billion, with a total appropriation of $34.5 billion. Despite a substantial unexpended balance, it is declining, leading to uncertainty about its long-term financial health. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provided some support, but challenges remain. The trust fund's unexpended balance is substantial but declining, leading to uncertainty about its long-term financial health. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provided additional future income, but challenges remain. The 108th Congress increased future income for the trust fund through changes in gasohol taxation, potentially adding $4 billion annually from FY2005. Disagreements between Congress, Congressional Leadership, and the Administration arose over funding levels for the next reauthorization period. The Conference Committee, Congressional Leadership, and the Administration could not agree on total program funding for the next reauthorization period. Some Members of Congress supported higher project funding than the Bush Administration, which objected to raising fuel taxes. Various mechanisms, including gasohol changes, were proposed by Congress. The Administration objected to raising fuel taxes for trust fund health. Congress proposed gasohol changes and other mechanisms to increase revenues for the trust fund and support a larger program in SAFETEA reauthorization. The gasohol changes and other tax adjustments were proposed to increase revenues for the trust fund and support a larger program in the SAFETEA reauthorization. The revenue increases were considered modest and mainly involved cutting back on tax fraud and transferring Treasury general fund revenues to the trust fund. The finance title of the act includes provisions to fund additional highway and transit spending through modest revenue increases, mainly from cutting back on tax fraud and transferring Treasury general fund revenues to the trust fund. It was believed that these changes, combined with gasohol legislation enacted in 2004 and expected economic growth, would be sufficient to finance the $286.4 billion program created by the act. The SAFETEA act included provisions to fund highway and transit spending through revenue increases and transferring funds to the trust fund. Changes in gasohol legislation and expected economic growth were expected to cover the $286.4 billion program. TEA-21 altered the highway trust fund's relationship with the Federal Unified Budget by creating new budget categories and setting limitations on obligations. TEA-21 amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 by creating new budget categories for highway and mass transit. It also set limitations on obligations for fiscal years FY1999 to FY2003, using Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to adjust amounts in the highway account based on receipts. TEA-21 amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 by creating new budget categories for highway and mass transit. It set limitations on obligations for fiscal years FY1999 to FY2003, using Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to adjust amounts in the highway account based on receipts. Annual revenues and expenditures affecting trust fund balances are part of the federal deficit calculation. The provision in TEA-21 adjusted highway program authorization levels based on increased or decreased revenues. Annual revenues and expenditures impacting trust fund balances are included in the federal deficit calculation. Changes set a predetermined funding level for core highway and transit programs, creating \"firewalls\" to prevent funds from being used for other purposes. The changes in TEA-21 established a set level of funding for core highway and transit programs, known as a discretionary spending guarantee. These \"firewalls\" ensured that funds allocated to these programs could not be used for other purposes. The budget format introduced in TEA-21 was largely retained in SAFETEA, with additional funds above the firewall level available through the annual appropriations process. SAFETEA maintained the budget format of TEA-21, with \"firewalls\" ensuring guaranteed funding levels for highway and transit programs. The main focus of SAFETEA was on money allocation, providing $286.4 billion in spending authority for FY2004-FY2009, a significant increase from TEA-21's $218 billion over the same period. SAFETEA retained the budget format of TEA-21, with a focus on money allocation. It provided $286.4 billion in spending authority for FY2004-FY2009, a significant increase from TEA-21. SAFETEA provided $218 billion over FY1998-2003, representing a funding increase for federal transportation programs. It guaranteed over $244 billion in spending authority for FY2005-FY2009. SAFETEA is a five-year bill providing over $244 billion in guaranteed spending authority between FY2005-FY2009. Major programs receive significant new funding, with total annual spending increases each year. Total spending in FY2009 is almost 23% higher than in FY2005. The legislation provides significant new funding for all major programs, with total annual spending increasing each year. Total spending in FY2009 is nearly 23% higher than in FY2005. More detailed programmatic information can be found in the report's Appendix and at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/safetealu/fundtables.htm. The House version of SAFETEA included a provision for Congress to reconsider the total funding amount. The House version of SAFETEA included a provision for Congress to reconsider the total funding amount, but the Bush Administration objected to this \"re-opener\" provision. TEA-21 created a spending mechanism to adjust highway program obligations based on changes in revenue from the highway trust fund. Detailed programmatic information can be found in the report's Appendix and at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/safetealu/fundtables.htm. Congress did not include a provision to reconsider the total funding amount in the final act, despite objections from the Bush Administration. TEA-21 created a mechanism to adjust highway program obligations based on changes in revenue from the highway trust fund. The Reauthorization Adjustment of Budget Authority (RABA) provided additional spending authority in its first three years, but in FY2003, a program reduction was called for. Congress decided not to reduce funding through the appropriations process. The Reauthorization Adjustment of Budget Authority (RABA) was created to adjust highway program obligations based on changes in revenue from the highway trust fund. In its first three years, RABA provided additional spending authority, but in FY2003, a program reduction was called for. Congress chose to increase spending instead of reducing it, leading to a push for changes in how RABA was calculated to make revenue swings less dramatic. SAFETEA changed the calculation of RABA by using a two-year calculation instead of a single year as in TEA-21. SAFETEA changed how RABA is calculated by using a two-year calculation instead of a single year. It delays RABA calculations until FY2007 and prevents spending reductions as long as the highway trust fund balance exceeds $6 billion. Transportation policy battles often align regionally rather than along party lines. The SAFETEA legislation changed RABA calculations to a two-year basis, delaying them until FY2007. It also prevents spending reductions as long as the highway trust fund balance is over $6 billion. Transportation policy debates often focus on regional distribution of federal highway aid. Congress has addressed funding distribution concerns through minimum guarantee provisions in surface transportation reauthorization acts since 1982. The regional character of transportation policy is evident in the debate over the distribution of federal highway aid among states. Congress has included provisions in surface transportation acts since 1982 to address funding concerns. Some states have complained about receiving less aid than they contribute in highway taxes, pushing for legislative remedies. Some states, known as donor states, have long complained about receiving less federal highway aid than their highway taxes contribute to the highway trust fund. They seek a higher share rate-of-return, most recently 95%, on their tax payments to the Treasury. Donee states, which receive more aid than they pay in taxes, do not oppose equity provisions but resist any reduction in their current shares. Donor states advocate for legislative remedies to increase their share rate-of-return on tax payments to the Treasury, aiming for 95%. They argue for equity, stating they have been subsidizing the repair of donee state infrastructure for years, especially in the Northeast. They emphasize their higher dependence on roads and lack of benefit from federal transit spending. Donor states argue for equity in federal funding, claiming they have been subsidizing the repair of infrastructure in donee states for years. They emphasize their higher road dependence and lack of benefit from federal transit spending. Southern and western donor states also highlight their fast growth and equal or greater needs compared to donee states. They believe the completion of the Interstate Highway System eliminates the rationale for the donor-donee disparity. Southern and western donor states argue that their fast growth and equal or greater needs justify their status as donor states. They believe the completion of the Interstate Highway System eliminates the rationale for the donor-donee disparity. Donee state advocates argue that fairness should not be separated from needs, citing the age of their infrastructure and limited financial resources as reasons for their donee status. Donee states argue that fairness should not be separated from needs, citing the age of their highway infrastructure, high costs of urban road maintenance, and limited financial resources as reasons for their donee status. They also believe that a national highway network should not be solely based on state or regional boundaries. Additionally, they point out that Midwestern and southern states spend less on highways and criticize them for seeking federal funds without contributing their own resources. Donee states argue that a national highway network should consider needs over state boundaries and criticize Midwestern and southern states for seeking federal funds without investing their own resources. The debate over equity remedies has broader implications for addressing federal transportation needs. The debate over equity remedies in federal transportation funding has implications for various overarching issues. Questions arise about the federal government's role compared to states as the minimum guarantee approaches 100%. Controversy surrounds whether the MG should be expanded to include more states. The debate over federal transportation funding equity raises questions about the role of the federal government versus states as the minimum guarantee nears 100%. There is controversy over whether the Federal aid highway program should be converted to a revenue sharing or block grant program. Additionally, there are discussions about broadening the minimum guarantee to include Federal Transit Administration programs. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor state demands for a higher rate-of-return and donee state demands to be held harmless, especially with expected insufficient funding from the Highway Trust Fund. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor state demands for a higher rate-of-return and donee state demands to be held harmless, especially with expected insufficient funding from the Highway Trust Fund. To overcome obstacles in constructing a minimum guarantee mechanism, previous reauthorization bills had included provisions to broaden the MG to include Federal Transit Administration programs. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor and donee state demands due to insufficient funding. To overcome obstacles, previous bills included \"hold harmless\" provisions to maintain base shares for all states, requiring an increase in the federal highway program size to achieve equity remedies. The previous reauthorization bills included \"hold harmless\" provisions to maintain base shares for all states, requiring an increase in the federal highway program size to achieve equity remedies. This approach was costly, with donor states receiving more funding to reach a designated percentage share. Providing equity remedies in surface transportation legislation has been achieved by giving more money to all states, with donor states receiving even more to reach a designated percentage share. This approach, costly in dollar terms, led to the largest highway program under TEA21. SAFETEA replaced the TEA-21 MG program with an \"Equity\" program due to limited funding availability and practical politics. The SAFETEA Act replaced the TEA-21 MG program with an \"Equity Bonus\" program to address limited funding availability and practical politics. The Equity Bonus funding is added to initial apportionments to bring donor states up to their guaranteed rate-of-return levels. The Equity Bonus program replaces the TEA-21 MG program, ensuring each state receives a minimum return of 90.5% for FY2005-2006, 91.5% for FY2007, and 92% for FY2008-2009 on their estimated payments to the highway account of the HTF. The Equity Bonus program ensures states receive a minimum return of 90.5% for FY2005-2006, 91.5% for FY2007, and 92% for FY2008-2009 on their estimated payments to the highway account of the HTF. Various programs are subject to the equity provision, including new formula programs and existing rail-highway grade crossing program. The Equity Bonus program ensures states receive a minimum return on their estimated payments to the highway account of the HTF. Various programs are subject to the equity provision, including new formula programs and existing rail-highway grade crossing program. The EB program also includes hold harmless provisions for certain states. The Equity Bonus program guarantees states a minimum return on their payments to the highway account of the HTF, including new formula programs and the existing rail-highway grade crossing program. Hold harmless provisions in the EB program protect certain states based on specific criteria such as population density, income levels, fatality rates, and fuel indexes. Twenty-seven states qualify for the Equity Bonus program based on specific criteria including population density, income levels, fatality rates, and fuel indexes. The Equity Bonus program guarantees a set percentage of annual TEA-21 apportionments for twenty-seven qualifying states with specific criteria. The Equity Bonus program ensures that twenty-seven qualifying states receive a set percentage of their annual TEA-21 apportionments. Each state has an annual percentage floor ranging from 117% to 121% for different fiscal years. The program distributes funds to states, with the first $2.639 billion allocated to the STP annually. The Equity Bonus Program guarantees that qualifying states receive a set percentage of their annual TEA-21 apportionments, with annual percentage floors ranging from 117% to 121%. Funds are distributed to states, with the first $2.639 billion allocated to the STP annually, and any additional funds distributed among six core programs based on their apportionment ratios. The Equity Bonus Program ensures that states receive a set percentage of their annual apportionments, with funds distributed to six core programs based on their apportionment ratios. FHWA analysis estimates that over five years, the EB program distributions will cost $40.9 billion. Funds for these programs are apportioned to states annually using SAFETEA formulas. The Equity Bonus Program distributes funds to six core programs based on apportionment ratios, costing $40.9 billion over five years. Funding for these programs is allocated annually to states using SAFETEA formulas. SAFETEA formulas allocate funds to apportioned programs, also known as formula programs. Under TEA-21, most highway funding was reserved for five core programs, which accounted for 86% of highway spending. SAFETEA increases the core programs to six, including interstate maintenance, national highway system, surface transportation program, highway bridge and bridge maintenance, congestion mitigation, and air quality, and highway safety. SAFETEA increases core highway programs from five to six, including interstate maintenance, national highway system, surface transportation program, highway bridge and bridge maintenance, congestion mitigation, air quality, and highway safety improvement program. The majority of funding in the surface transportation bill goes to these core programs. The Surface Transportation Bill SAFETEA includes core highway programs like interstate maintenance, national highway system, surface transportation program, highway bridge maintenance, congestion mitigation, air quality, and highway safety improvement program. Additional smaller apportioned programs from TEA-21, such as metropolitan planning and recreational trails, are also continued. Only a few new programs were included in SAFETEA despite considering many during reauthorization. The SAFETEA Surface Transportation Bill includes core highway programs like interstate maintenance, national highway system, and highway safety improvement program. Additional smaller apportioned programs from TEA-21, such as metropolitan planning and recreational trails, are also continued. Only a few new programs were included in SAFETEA, like the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program and Safe Routes to School Program. The SAFETEA Surface Transportation Bill includes core highway programs like interstate maintenance, national highway system, and highway safety improvement program. It also introduces new formula programs such as the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program (CBI) and the Safe Routes to School Program (SRSP). Funding distribution under the Federal-Aid Highway program is based on various factors outlined in Title 23 of the U.S. Code. The SAFETEA Surface Transportation Bill includes core highway programs like interstate maintenance, national highway system, and highway safety improvement program. It introduces new formula programs such as the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program (CBI) and the Safe Routes to School Program (SRSP). Funding distribution is based on apportionment formula factors outlined in Title 23 of the U.S. Code, with programs using weighted factors like lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, and estimated tax payments to the highway account. Some programs are based on single factors like state share of total cost to repair deficient bridges or non-attainment area population under the Clean Air Act. SAFETEA made adjustments, including eliminating the 10% safety STP set-aside from TEA-21. The SAFETEA Surface Transportation Bill made adjustments to existing program formulas, such as eliminating the 10% safety STP set-aside from TEA-21 and adjusting the STP Transportation Enhancements set-aside. It also made changes to the calculation of weighted non-attainment and maintenance areas for ozone under the Clean Air Act. The SAFETEA Surface Transportation Bill made adjustments to existing program formulas, including the STP Transportation Enhancements set-aside, the creation of a $20 million NHS set-aside for ferry boats, and the establishment of set-asides for the Territorial Highway Program and off-system bridge program. SAFETEA created a $20 million NHS set-aside for ferry boats and ferry terminal facilities in Alaska, New Jersey, and Washington. The Territorial Highway Program set-aside is $40 million for FY2005-FY2006 and $50 million annually for FY2007-FY2009. The off-system bridge program set-aside minimum is 15%, with the 35% ceiling removed. Formula distribution is weighted based on federal lane miles, FAHP vehicle miles traveled, and total lane miles of FAHP highways in each state. The bridge program set-aside minimum is maintained at 15% but the 35% ceiling is removed. The distribution formula is weighted based on federal lane miles, FAHP vehicle miles traveled, and annual number of fatalities on the federal-aid system in each state. Minimum payment to each state is set at 0.5%. Railway-Highway Crossings program is funded through a takedown from HSIP but distributed differently to states. The Railway-Highway Crossings program is funded through a takedown from HSIP but is distributed differently to the states based on specific formulas. The distribution includes a 50% allocation based on the number of public railway-highway grade crossings in each state compared to the total number in all states. The minimum payment to each state is set at 0.5%. The Railway-Highway Crossings program funding is distributed based on specific formulas, with 50% allocated according to the number of public railway-highway grade crossings in each state compared to the total number in all states. Additionally, $90 million annually from HSIP is set aside by states for construction and operational improvements on high-risk rural roads. Under SAFETEA, $90 million annually from HSIP is set aside by states for construction and operational improvements on high-risk rural roads, with funds apportioned to states along the Canada-U.S. and Mexico-U.S. borders based on specific formulas. Under SAFETEA, funds are apportioned to states along the Canada-U.S. and Mexico-U.S. borders based on specific formulas related to commercial truck crossings, personal vehicle and bus crossings, total weight of incoming cargo, and the number of ports-of-entry. Funds under SAFETEA are apportioned among states based on specific formulas related to commercial truck crossings, incoming cargo weight, ports-of-entry, and student enrollment in primary and middle schools. No state will receive less than $1 million. The apportionment of funds among states under SAFETEA is based on specific formulas related to commercial truck crossings, incoming cargo weight, ports-of-entry, and student enrollment in primary and middle schools. No state will receive less than $1 million. Non-apportioned highway programs are subject to allocations based on criteria in highway laws and may be earmarked by Congress. Programs in this category are smaller than core programs, with some having significant funding levels. Highway programs are allocated based on criteria in highway laws and may be earmarked by Congress. In SAFETEA, the largest allocated program is for congressionally mandated high priority projects (earmarks) specifically designated in the act. Other large programs include the federal lands program, interstate maintenance discretionary program, and bridge discretionary program. SAFETEA includes new large allocated programs such as a transportation improvement program and a redefined national corridor infrastructure program. SAFETEA includes new large allocated programs like a transportation improvement program, a national corridor infrastructure program, and a program for projects of national or regional significance, all subject to 100% earmarking. The act also outlines project selection criteria for the latter and establishes a unique operating framework for these projects. The SAFETEA act includes new programs for transportation improvement, national corridor infrastructure, and projects of national/regional significance with 100% earmarking. Innovative financing mechanisms like GARVEEs and credit assistance leverage future highway funds to expedite project completion and attract additional funding. The SAFETEA act introduced innovative financing mechanisms like GARVEEs, TIFIA, and SIBs to leverage future highway funds for project completion and attract additional funding. GAO, CBO, and FHWA have studied the strengths and weaknesses of these mechanisms. SAFETEA made changes to TIFIA and SIB programs. SAFETEA introduced innovative financing mechanisms like GARVEEs, TIFIA, and SIBs to leverage future highway funds for project completion. GAO, CBO, and FHWA have studied the strengths and weaknesses of these mechanisms. SAFETEA made changes to TIFIA and SIB programs, providing federal financial assistance through secured loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit. SAFETEA introduced innovative finance programs like TIFIA and the SIB program, providing federal financial assistance for transportation projects. Changes include lowering project size thresholds and allocating $122 million annually for TIFIA's leveraging activities. The SIB program uses federal funds to capitalize state infrastructure revolving funds. The SAFETEA Act lowers project size thresholds for transportation projects and allocates $122 million annually for TIFIA's leveraging activities. It expands the SIB program to allow any state to establish SIBs capitalized with federal funds. The act also consolidates tolling provisions. The SAFETEA Act expands the State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) program to allow any state to establish SIBs capitalized with federal funds for tolling projects. It authorizes four tolling programs and includes provisions for tolling HOV lanes. Section 1143 of the act, concerning private facility bonds, is also expected to impact tolling. The program is continued under current law with 15 tolling projects authorized. The SAFETEA Act authorizes four tolling programs and includes provisions for tolling HOV lanes. Section 1143 of the act, concerning private facility bonds, is expected to impact tolling. The program is continued under current law with 15 tolling projects authorized, with funding allocated for non-tolling congestion pricing pilot projects. The SAFETEA Act authorizes $11 million for FY2005 and $12 million annually for FY2006-FY2009 for 15 tolling projects. $3 million is allocated for non-tolling congestion pricing pilot projects each year. The Secretary of Transportation is directed to carry out 15 demonstration projects allowing toll collection on existing toll facilities or highways. Both House and Senate bill provisions to change the program were dropped during Conference. The new program authorizes $11 million for FY2005 and $12 million annually for FY2006-FY2009 for 15 tolling projects. It directs the Secretary of Transportation to carry out 15 demonstration projects allowing toll collection on existing toll facilities or highways to manage congestion, reduce emissions, or finance highway expansion. Funding is expected to go towards HOT lanes. The new program authorizes $11 million for FY2005 and $12 million annually for FY2006-FY2009 for 15 tolling projects. It directs the Secretary of Transportation to carry out 15 demonstration projects allowing toll collection on existing toll facilities or highways to manage congestion, reduce emissions, or finance highway expansion, with most funding going towards HOT lanes. Revenues from toll facilities can be used for debt service, private financing returns, and operating costs, with excess funds available for federal-aid highway or transit projects. The use of toll facility revenues is restricted to debt service, private financing returns, and operating costs. Excess funds can be used for federal-aid highway or transit projects. Toll facilities can vary toll prices based on time of day or congestion levels to improve air quality and manage traffic. High occupancy vehicle (HOV) facilities must also vary toll prices accordingly. Fees collected on express lanes are to be collected only. The program allows toll facilities to set varying toll prices based on time of day or congestion levels to improve air quality and manage traffic. High occupancy vehicle (HOV) facilities must also adjust toll prices accordingly. Fees collected on express lanes are to be collected only through noncash electronic technology. The act establishes a pilot toll program for the Secretary of Transportation to permit toll collection on Interstate System highways for construction purposes. The pilot toll program allows states to collect tolls on Interstate System highways for construction purposes using noncash electronic technology. States must demonstrate that toll financing is the most efficient way to advance the project. The pilot program allows states to collect tolls on three Interstate System highways for construction purposes. States must show that toll financing is the most efficient way to advance the project and cannot enter agreements preventing improvements to public roads adjacent to toll facilities. The pilot program allows states to collect tolls on Interstate System highways for construction purposes. States cannot enter agreements preventing improvements to public roads adjacent to toll facilities. Revenues from tolls can only be used for debt service, investor returns, and operating costs of the toll facility. Interstate Maintenance program funds cannot be used on toll facilities. The pilot program allows states to collect tolls on Interstate System highways for construction purposes, with revenues designated for debt service, investor returns, and operating costs of the toll facility. State agencies can allow vehicles to pay a toll to use HOV lanes, with requirements for enrollment and program management. Section 1121 of the act allows state departments of transportation to permit vehicles to pay a toll to use HOV lanes, with requirements for enrollment, toll collection, demand management, and enforcement. The provision also allows for tolling of low emission and energy-efficient vehicles. Section 1121 of the act allows state departments of transportation to implement a toll program for HOV lanes, manage toll collection automatically, adjust toll amounts to manage traffic levels, and enforce violations. It also permits tolling of low emission and energy-efficient vehicles at a preferential rate. Additionally, the act amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow tax-exempt private activity bonds for financing highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities by state and local governments. The act allows tolling of low emission and energy-efficient vehicles at a preferential rate for HOV use and amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow tax-exempt private activity bonds for financing highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities by state and local governments. The act allows tax-exempt private activity bonds for financing highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities by state and local governments, with a $15 billion limit on the bonds that can be issued. The act allows tax-exempt private activity bonds for financing highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities by state and local governments, with a $15 billion limit on the bonds that can be issued. The bonding provision could have a substantial impact on infrastructure development, potentially exceeding the amount allocated for California's formula highway assistance from SAFETEA. The bonding provision in SAFETEA allows tax-exempt private activity bonds for financing infrastructure projects, potentially exceeding California's $15 billion formula highway assistance. This provision is crucial for tolling projects, aiming to create revenue mechanisms for facility use. The ADHP program aims to boost economic development in Appalachia by improving regional connectivity. The ADHP program, funded by the highway trust fund, aims to improve regional connectivity in Appalachia and boost economic development. Projects using private activity bonds may require tolls for revenue unless alternative funding mechanisms are established. Administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission, funds are allocated to member states based on cost estimates. The Appalachian Development Highway Program (ADHP) aims to improve regional connectivity and boost economic development in Appalachia. Administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission, funding is allocated to member states based on cost estimates. As of 2004, 85% of ADHP roads are either completed or under construction, with an estimated additional $4.47 billion needed to complete the system. Under TEA-21, the ADHP received $450 million in funding. The ADHS 2002 Cost to Complete Report estimated an additional $4.47 billion in federal funds needed to complete the system. Funding for the ADHP under TEA-21 included $450 million in contract authority annually, with additional funding through the appropriations process. SAFETEA provides $470 million annually for the ADHP, with a prohibition on using toll revenues as credits for non-federal purposes. Under TEA-21, the ADHP received $450 million annually in contract authority, with additional funding through appropriations. SAFETEA now provides $470 million annually for the program, with a prohibition on using toll revenues as credits for non-federal purposes. SAFETEA includes over 5,092 earmarks for congressional high priority projects worth over $14.8 billion. SAFETEA significantly increases earmarks for high priority projects, with over 5,092 earmarks worth $14.8 billion, compared to TEA-21's 1,849 earmarks worth $9.4 billion. New earmarked categories have been introduced in SAFETEA. The SAFETEA Act introduces new earmarked categories, including projects of national and regional significance and national corridor infrastructure improvements, with a total value of over $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion respectively. The SAFETEA Act introduces new earmarked categories for transportation improvements, national corridor infrastructure improvements, and projects of national and regional significance, totaling over $6.2 billion in funding. The SAFETEA Act introduces new earmarked categories for transportation improvements, national corridor infrastructure improvements, and projects of national and regional significance, totaling over $6.2 billion in funding. The category lists 33 earmarks valued at over $1.9 billion, with 465 projects listed for transportation improvements totaling over $2.5 billion in funding. Individual projects may appear in multiple earmarking lists and receive different amounts of funding. The conference report explains the earmarked projects in the SAFETEA Act, with over $1.9 billion in funding for 33 earmarks and 465 projects. Additionally, there are 32 earmarks in the highway title and 25 earmarks in the research title, totaling almost $1 billion in funding. The transit title also includes earmarked programs for bus and bus facilities. The SAFETEA Act contains numerous earmarks totaling over $24 billion, with specific projects in the highway, research, and transit titles receiving funding. The bus and bus facilities program alone has 662 projects with $1.6 billion in funding. The transit title of the SAFETEA Act includes 662 specific projects with nearly $1.6 billion in funding, along with 39 additional earmarks valued at over $191 million. The total amount of earmarking in the bill is estimated to exceed $24 billion, with discussions focusing on how it affects the Equity Bonus calculation. Earmarks in the bill are categorized as \"below the line\" or \"above the line\" for EB purposes. The discussion about earmarks in the bill focuses on how it affects the Equity Bonus calculation. Earmarks are categorized as \"below the line\" or \"above the line\" for EB purposes, significantly impacting state shares.

The NEPA process requires an environmental impact statement (EIS) for federally funded projects that significantly impact the environment. Projects with unclear impacts undergo an environmental assessment (EA), and if impacts are significant, an EIS is prepared. Projects with no significant impact are processed as categorical exclusions. Compliance with Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act is also typically carried out within the NEPA process. Compliance with Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 is a requirement typically carried out within the NEPA process. Section 4(f) applies to the use of publicly owned parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites for transportation projects. The law prohibits using these resources unless there is no feasible alternative. Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 applies to publicly owned parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites for transportation projects. It prohibits their use unless there is no feasible alternative, aiming to minimize harm to these resources. Some Members of Congress are concerned about delays in completing large projects due to inefficient environmental review processes. Environmental Streamlining provisions were included in TEA-21 to address concerns about delays in completing large transportation projects. FHWA defines environmental streamlining as timely project delivery while protecting and enhancing the environment. Major transportation projects may be impacted by various federal, state, and local regulations. The Environmental Streamlining provisions in TEA-21 aim to expedite federally funded transportation projects while ensuring environmental protection. Improved interagency cooperation is crucial for successful implementation. The Department of Transportation is required to establish a coordinated environmental review process. Improved interagency cooperation is crucial for successful implementation of environmental streamlining provisions in TEA-21. The Department of Transportation must develop a coordinated environmental review process for highway projects with significant environmental impact. SAFETEA includes provisions to further streamline the environmental review process for highway construction and transit projects, aiming to expedite the process required by federal and state agencies. SAFETEA includes provisions to streamline the environmental review process for highway construction and transit projects, addressing NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements to expedite compliance with environmental regulations. SAFETEA provisions aim to streamline the environmental review process, focusing on NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements to expedite compliance with environmental regulations. The term \"streamlining\" is not explicitly used in SAFETEA, but the goal remains the same - to accelerate compliance with NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements. SAFETEA provisions in H.R. 3 aim to expedite compliance with environmental regulations by streamlining the NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements. Key provisions include designating DOT as the lead agency, specifying roles of lead and cooperating agencies, and setting deadlines for decision-making. SAFETEA provisions in H.R. 3 aim to expedite compliance with environmental regulations by streamlining the NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements. Key provisions include establishing a new entity called a \"participating agency\" for NEPA process and setting procedures for lead and participating agencies. The SAFETEA provisions in H.R. 3 aim to streamline existing statutory and regulatory requirements related to the NEPA process. This includes the establishment of a new entity called a \"participating agency,\" setting procedures for collaborative development of project statements, and implementing a 180-day statute of limitation on judicial claims for final agency actions. The SAFETEA provisions in H.R. 3 aim to streamline NEPA process by establishing procedures for collaborative development of project statements, implementing a 180-day statute of limitation on judicial claims, allowing use of transportation funds to expedite environmental review, establishing dispute resolution process, and giving states authority to determine categorical exclusions for projects. The SAFETEA provisions in H.R. 3 aim to streamline the NEPA process by allowing transportation funds to expedite environmental reviews, establishing a dispute resolution process, and giving states authority to determine categorical exclusions for projects. Additionally, it allows for the use of publicly owned parks and recreation areas for transportation projects under Section 4(f). SAFETEA allows state pilot programs for assuming federal responsibilities on environmental compliance. Section 4(f) permits use of parks, wildlife refuges with \"de minimis impacts\" approval from relevant authorities. Historic sites can also be used with minimal impact. SAFETEA allows for the use of parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites with \"de minimis impacts\" approval from relevant authorities. DOT is required to issue regulations clarifying factors for determining if alternatives are \"prudent and feasible\" under Section 4(f) requirements. SAFETEA allows for the use of parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites with \"de minimis impacts\" approval. DOT must issue regulations clarifying factors for determining if alternatives are \"prudent and feasible\" under Section 4(f) requirements. Additionally, the Interstate System cannot be considered a \"historic site\" under Section 4(f) provisions. The Interstate System cannot be considered a \"historic site\" under Section 4(f) provisions, but individual elements may have historic significance protected under Section 4(f) requirements. ISTEA directed the Secretary of DOT to establish Congestion Mitigation measures following the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) established the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program to reduce emissions from highway travel and help states comply with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by funding projects to reduce carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone. The CMAQ Program, established by ISTEA, aims to reduce emissions from highway travel to help states comply with NAAQS. It funds projects to reduce carbon monoxide and ozone through various eligible programs and projects. The CMAQ Program, established by ISTEA, aims to reduce emissions from highway travel by funding projects to reduce carbon monoxide and ozone. Eligible projects include transportation control measures, auto emission control programs, alternative fuel vehicle purchases, traffic flow improvements, and pedestrian/bicycle facilities. CMAQ funds are apportioned based on a state's population and pollution reduction needs, with a weighting factor applied to areas not meeting NAAQS for ozone and/or CO. TEA-21 expanded the CMAQ program to include projects targeting particulate matter (PM) reduction, but did not change the apportionment formula based on ozone and CO levels. States with no nonattainment areas are guaranteed a minimum apportionment of 0.5 percent of CMAQ funds. SAFETEA amended the CMAQ apportionment formula under 23 U.S.C. \u00a7104(b)(2) and the program received $8.6 billion in funding for FY2005-FY2009, compared to $8.1 billion under TEA-21. States with maintenance or nonattainment areas for only PM still receive guaranteed minimum CMAQ funding. SAFETEA amended the CMAQ apportionment formula and program funding for FY2005-FY2009 totaled $8.6 billion, compared to $8.1 billion under TEA-21. States with maintenance or nonattainment areas for only PM receive guaranteed minimum CMAQ funding. SAFETEA expands program funding eligibility to include projects like advanced truck stop electrification systems and transportation system management improvements. SAFETEA expands CMAQ program funding eligibility to include projects such as advanced truck stop electrification systems, transportation systems management improvements, emergency communications equipment, and diesel retrofits with funding priority. It also allows states receiving minimum apportionment to use CMAQ funds for eligible projects. SAFETEA expands CMAQ program funding eligibility to include advanced truck stop electrification systems, transportation systems management improvements, and diesel retrofits with funding priority. It allows states receiving minimum apportionment to use CMAQ funds for eligible projects. DOT is directed to evaluate CMAQ projects' impacts on air quality and congestion levels. SAFETEA directs DOT to evaluate a sample of CMAQ projects to assess their impact on air quality and congestion levels, maintaining a database of project impacts without providing direct funding for the evaluation or database. Under the Clean Air Act, areas not meeting National Ambient Air Quality Standards must develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to achieve attainment. As of May 2005, 124 areas with a total population of 159 million were subject to SIP requirements. As of May 2005, 124 areas with a total population of 159 million were required to develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) under the Clean Air Act to achieve attainment of National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Section 176 of the Act prohibits federal funding for projects in these areas unless they conform to the SIPs, ensuring they do not cause new violations, worsen existing ones, or delay standard attainment. Section 176 of the Clean Air Act prohibits federal funding for projects in areas required to develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) unless they conform to the SIP requirements. Projects must not cause new violations, worsen existing ones, or delay standard attainment. Transportation Improvement Programs (TIP) must demonstrate conformity every two years, as new highways typically increase vehicle emissions. Highway and transit projects must adhere to these regulations. The Clean Air Act requires Transportation Improvement Programs (TIP) to demonstrate conformity every two years to receive federal funding for highway and transit projects. The impact of conformity requirements is expected to increase due to the growth of emissions from SUVs and light trucks, as well as higher than expected vehicle miles traveled. Highway and transit projects must be part of a conforming TIP to receive federal funds. Conformity requirements are expected to become more challenging due to increased emissions from SUVs and light trucks, higher vehicle miles traveled, stricter air quality standards, and recent court decisions tightening conformity rules. The implementation of more stringent air quality standards will lead to additional areas being subject to conformity, potentially resulting in temporary suspension of highway and transit funds for numerous metropolitan areas unless emissions are sharply reduced. Only 5 metropolitan areas had to change transportation plans in the previous six years to comply with conformity rules, as per a 2003 Government Accountability Office survey. Numerous metropolitan areas may face a temporary suspension of highway and transit funds unless they reduce emissions. A 2003 Government Accountability Office survey found that only 5 areas had to change transportation plans to meet conformity rules in the previous six years, but one-third of local transportation planners anticipate future challenges in demonstrating conformity. The Clean Air Act does not allow waivers of conformity, and only a limited set of exempt projects can be funded in areas facing a conformity lapse. The Clean Air Act does not allow waivers of conformity, and only a limited set of exempt projects can be funded in areas facing a conformity lapse. Concerns have been raised about limitations on funding new projects that could reduce emissions and the mismatch between SIP, TIP, and long-range transportation planning cycles. Calls have been made for less frequent but better-coordinated demonstrations of conformity. The Clean Air Act prohibits waivers of conformity and only allows funding for a limited set of exempt projects in areas with conformity issues. Concerns include restrictions on funding projects that could reduce emissions and the mismatch between SIP, TIP, and long-range transportation planning cycles. Recommendations have been made for less frequent but better-coordinated conformity demonstrations. The GAO recommended extending the time frame between required transportation plan updates and amending the Clean Air Act to align conformity rules. This recommendation was supported by transportation planners and highway builders. The GAO recommended extending the time frame between required transportation plan updates and amending the Clean Air Act to align conformity rules. This was generally supported by transportation planners and highway builders but opposed by environmental groups and air quality planning officials. P.L. 109 - 59 now requires less frequent conformity demonstrations (at least every four years instead of every two years) and shortens the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases. P.L. 109 - 59, supported by transportation planners and highway builders but opposed by environmental groups and air quality planning officials, requires less frequent conformity demonstrations (every four years instead of every two years) and shortens the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases. The law also establishes a 12-month grace period following a failure to demonstrate conformity before a lapse would be declared. The law requires less frequent conformity demonstrations (every four years instead of every two years) and shortens the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases. The local air pollution control agency must be consulted and public comments solicited if the planning horizon is to be shortened. A 12-month grace period is established following a failure to demonstrate conformity before a lapse would be declared."
