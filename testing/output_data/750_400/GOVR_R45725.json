It protects U.S. shipyards, carriers, and sailors but is debated for increasing costs and limiting ship availability. The Jones Act, part of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, mandates that vessels transporting cargo between U.S. points must be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. Some experts argue that it increases costs, limits ship availability, and makes building merchant vessels in U.S. shipyards more expensive than abroad. The law has been a topic of debate in recent Congresses, especially in relation to Puerto Rico's economic challenges, the sinking of the ship El Faro in 2015, and discussions about domestic transportation of oil and natural gas. Its effectiveness in achieving national security goals has also been questioned. The Jones Act, part of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, mandates that vessels transporting cargo between U.S. points must be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. It has been a topic of debate in recent Congresses, especially in relation to Puerto Rico's economic challenges, the sinking of the ship El Faro in 2015, and discussions about domestic transportation of oil and natural gas. The law's effectiveness in achieving national security goals has also been questioned. The Jones Act of 1920 mandates that vessels transporting cargo domestically must be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. The law's effectiveness in achieving national security goals has been questioned, leading to discussions on increasing efficiency and reducing regulatory burdens in the maritime sector. The Jones Act of 1920 mandates U.S.-built, owned, and crewed vessels for domestic cargo transport, stemming from laws favoring a U.S.-flag fleet since 1789. The Jones Act of 1920 mandates U.S.-built, owned, and crewed vessels for domestic cargo transport, stemming from laws favoring a U.S.-flag fleet since 1789, including restrictions on foreign-owned vessels transporting domestic cargo between U.S. ports. In 1817, Congress enacted a precursor to the Jones Act by disallowing foreign-owned vessels from transporting domestic cargo between U.S. ports. This prohibition was later extended to vessels transporting passengers domestically in 1886. The United States had a shipbuilding advantage in the 1800s due to ample timber supplies, but lost it as wooden sailing ships were replaced by iron steamships. In response to the decline in U.S. vessel trade share, Congress debated allowing foreign-built vessels to sail under the U.S. flag. The decline in U.S. vessel trade share led Congress to consider allowing foreign-built vessels to sail under the U.S. flag, known as the \"free ship\" movement. Opponents argued that the higher cost of U.S. crews would hinder the resurgence of trade carried by U.S. vessels. Bills were proposed to allow foreign-built vessels for U.S.-flag international service. Since 1912, the domestic build requirement has mainly applied to vessels on domestic voyages, while in the late 1800s, Congress considered but did not pass bills allowing foreign-built ships for U.S.-flag international service. In 1912, Congress enacted a measure (P.L. 62-33, 37 Stat. 562) requiring U.S.-flag vessels on domestic voyages to be domestically built. In the late 1800s, Congress tightened coastwise transport regulations in response to shippers' attempts to use foreign-built ships to avoid high-cost U.S. vessels. In response to shippers' attempts to avoid high-cost U.S. vessels, Congress tightened coastwise transport regulations in the late 1800s. For example, a shipper loaded goods on a foreign-flag ship bound for Antwerp, Belgium, before transferring them to another foreign-flag ship bound for Los Angeles to save on freight charges. In response to shippers' efforts to cut costs, Congress amended coastwise laws in the late 1800s to prevent routing cargo through foreign ports to avoid high U.S. vessel charges. This allowed shippers to use foreign-flag ships for transportation, resulting in lower freight costs. In response to shippers' cost-cutting efforts, Congress amended coastwise laws in the late 1800s to prevent routing cargo through foreign ports. Despite amendments in 1893 and 1898 to prohibit this practice, U.S. shippers continued to use foreign-flag vessels in the Alaska trade by moving cargo between the United States and Vancouver, Canada, by rail. Senator Wesley Jones of Washington sought to stop this by requiring Alaska-bound cargo to move directly. In response to shippers' cost-cutting efforts, Congress amended coastwise laws in the late 1800s to prevent routing cargo through foreign ports. U.S. shippers continued to use foreign-flag vessels in the Alaska trade by moving cargo between the United States and Vancouver, Canada, by rail. Senator Wesley Jones of Washington amended the coastwise language in the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 to require Alaska-bound cargo to move through the Port of Seattle, replacing shipments between \"U.S. ports\" with shipments between \"U.S. points.\" The Jones Act, passed in 1920, required Alaska-bound cargo to move through the Port of Seattle by amending coastwise laws. The debate over the act included the relative cost of building ships in the United States versus foreign countries. Congress had previously requested annual reports on this subject in the Shipping Act of 1916. The minority report expressed concerns that banning foreign-built ships would lead to higher costs. The Jones Act, passed in 1920, required Alaska-bound cargo to move through the Port of Seattle by amending coastwise laws. The debate over the act included the relative cost of building ships in the United States versus foreign countries. The minority report to a 1919 House committee expressed concerns that banning foreign-built ships would lead to higher costs for domestically built ships. The Jones Act of 1920 required Alaska-bound cargo to go through the Port of Seattle, amending coastwise laws. Banning foreign-built ships could increase costs for domestically built ships, hindering the competitiveness of American merchants in global commerce. The Jones Act of 1920 amended coastwise laws to require Alaska-bound cargo to go through the Port of Seattle. Banning foreign-built ships could increase costs for domestically built ships, affecting the competitiveness of American merchants in global commerce. American merchants need the ability to buy ships from the open world market to compete effectively. The Jones Act of 1920 amended coastwise laws to require Alaska-bound cargo to go through the Port of Seattle. Banning foreign-built ships could increase costs for domestically built ships, affecting the competitiveness of American merchants in global commerce. American merchants need the ability to buy ships from the open world market to compete effectively. U.S.-built ships cost more than foreign-built ships, with the price differential increasing over the years. The cost differential between U.S.-built ships and foreign-built ships has been increasing over the years. A 1922 government report showed a 20% cost difference, which grew to 50% in the 1930s, doubled in the 1950s, and tripled by the 1990s. Currently, U.S.-built tankers are estimated to cost four times more than global prices, while container ships may cost five times more. This cost disparity poses a challenge for the Department of Defense. The cost of U.S.-built ships has been increasing over the years compared to foreign-built ships. Currently, a U.S.-built tanker is estimated to be four times the global price, while a container ship may cost five times more. This cost disparity is a challenge for the Department of Defense, leading them to opt for more used foreign-built cargo ships instead of building domestically. U.S. shipyards do not compete with foreign shipyards on exports. The Department of Defense officials are facing issues with military sealift ships due to the unaffordable cost of building them domestically. Instead, they plan to purchase more used foreign-built cargo ships. U.S. shipyards do not compete on price or vessel characteristics with foreign shipyards, and U.S. crewing costs are higher, resulting in an estimated operating cost differential of over $6 million per ship per year compared to foreign-flag ships. The high operating costs of U.S.-flag ships, including crewing, insurance, and maintenance, make them less competitive with foreign-flag vessels. A 2011 study by MARAD found that U.S.-flag ships had operating costs 2.7 times greater than foreign-flag ships, with the cost gap increasing since then. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 focused on selling surplus government cargo ships from World War I and outlined key maritime policy goals that still exist today. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 emphasized the sale of surplus government cargo ships from World War I and established enduring maritime policy goals, including the necessity for a well-equipped merchant marine to support national defense and commerce. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 emphasized the importance of a well-equipped merchant marine to support national defense and commerce, reflecting the United States' emerging power status at the time. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 emphasized the need for a strong merchant marine owned by U.S. citizens to support national defense and commerce. This reflected the United States' emerging power status at the time, especially during World War I when European nations faced ship shortages due to the war effort. The Jones Act, part of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, applies to domestic waterborne shipments in the United States. It requires that a majority of the crew, including the master and officers, must be U.S. citizens. This act was established to ensure the U.S. had its own merchant marine for national defense and commerce, especially during World War I when European nations faced ship shortages. The Jones Act applies to domestic waterborne shipments in the United States, requiring a majority of the crew to be U.S. citizens. U.S. territories like the U.S. Virgin Islands, America Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands are exempt from the Jones Act, allowing foreign-flag ships to transport cargo between these islands and other U.S. points. The Jones Act requires U.S. ownership and crew for domestic waterborne shipments, with 75% of a corporation's stock owned by U.S. citizens. U.S. territories like the U.S. Virgin Islands, America Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands are exempt from the Jones Act, allowing foreign-flag ships to transport cargo between these islands and other U.S. points. Puerto Rico is exempt for passengers but not for cargo, and vessels traveling between Guam and another U.S. point must be U.S.-owned and -crewed but need not be U.S.-built. The Coast Guard enforces U.S.-build requirements, ownership of carriers, and crewing regulations. The Coast Guard enforces the U.S.-build requirement for vessels, ownership of carriers, and crewing regulations for Jones Act operators seeking a \"coastwise endorsement.\" Customs and Border Protection is responsible for determining maritime activity. The Jones Act enforces licensing requirements for operators seeking a \"coastwise endorsement\" and is overseen by Customs and Border Protection. The Act defines what constitutes \"transportation\" and determines if a voyage has U.S. points of origin and destination. The Jones Act enforces licensing requirements for operators seeking a \"coastwise endorsement\" and is overseen by Customs and Border Protection. It defines transportation and determines if a voyage has U.S. points of origin and destination. The Act requires the use of only \"U.S.-built\" vessels, with the Coast Guard determining what qualifies as U.S.-built. The Jones Act mandates the use of \"U.S.-built\" vessels, with the Coast Guard defining the criteria for what qualifies as U.S.-built. This includes having all \"major components\" of the hull and superstructure fabricated in the U.S. and the vessel being assembled in the U.S. The Jones Act requires vessels to be U.S.-built if all major components of the hull and superstructure are made in the U.S. The Coast Guard excludes propulsion machinery and other equipment from this determination. U.S. shipyards often import engines for oceangoing ships as they are considered attached components. For oceangoing ships, U.S. shipyards can import engines from foreign manufacturers as they are considered components attached to the hull, not integral parts of the hull's structure. Parts or components that are self-supporting and do not compromise the vessel's integrity can be manufactured abroad, as long as they are attached to the vessel. The Coast Guard allows certain ship parts to be manufactured abroad as long as they are attached to the vessel in a U.S. shipyard, not overseas. The weight-based test permits up to 1.5% of the steel weight of hull and superstructure components to be made abroad, including propellers, stern bulbs, bulbous bows, some rudders, and watertight components. The Coast Guard allows certain ship parts to be manufactured abroad as long as they are attached to the vessel in a U.S. shipyard. Up to 1.5% of the steel weight of hull and superstructure components can be made abroad, including propellers, stern bulbs, bulbous bows, some rudders, and watertight components. Steel products in standard forms can be imported with no weight limit, but custom shaping, molding, and cutting must be done in the U.S. shipyard. The Coast Guard permits certain foreign-built components in vessel construction as long as they do not exceed the steel weight limit. Shipyards seek confirmation from the Coast Guard through determination letters detailing permissible foreign components. In vessel construction, U.S. shipyards require confirmation from the Coast Guard on using foreign-built components to comply with the Jones Act. The Coast Guard issues determination letters specifying permissible foreign components. Shipyard unions have sued the Coast Guard over its interpretation of the statute in 2007. In 2007, shipyard unions sued the Coast Guard over its interpretation of the statute regarding the use of foreign components in vessel construction. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania ruled in favor of the Coast Guard, citing historical interpretations dating back to the late 1800s. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania ruled in favor of the Coast Guard in a lawsuit brought by shipyard unions over the use of foreign components in vessel construction. The court noted that the Coast Guard's interpretation aligns with historical interpretations dating back to the late 1800s. The lawsuit stemmed from a partnership between a Philadelphia shipyard and a South Korean shipbuilder to build Jones Act tankers and container ships. The shipyard unions' lawsuit was prompted by a Philadelphia shipyard's partnership with a South Korean shipbuilder, begun in 2004, to use the Korean builder's ship designs and other procurement services to build a series of Jones Act tankers and container ships. General Dynamics NASSCO of San Diego has also partnered with Daewoo Shipbuilding of South Korea since 2006 to procure vessel designs and materials for commercial ships built for Jones Act carriers. Since 2006, General Dynamics NASSCO of San Diego has partnered with Daewoo Shipbuilding of South Korea to procure vessel designs, engineering, and materials for commercial ships built for Jones Act carriers. The use of foreign components in shipbuilding has raised concerns about undermining the Jones Act policy objective of a domestic shipbuilding capability independent of foreign yards. In a court case, shipyards argued that not allowing foreign components would increase ship costs, reduce orders for new ships, and harm the domestic fleet.

Shipyards argued that not allowing foreign components would increase ship costs, reduce orders for new ships, and harm the domestic fleet. The United States is the largest cruise ship market, but most Americans board foreign-flag cruise ships due to CBP regulations. The United States is the largest cruise ship market, but most Americans board foreign-flag cruise ships due to CBP regulations exempting ships from being Jones Act-compliant if they visit a distant foreign port. This exemption is based on the reasoning that the main objective of such cruises is to visit foreign ports, not transport passengers between U.S. ports. Foreign cruise ships visiting distant foreign ports are exempt from being Jones Act-compliant when making round trips from a U.S. port and visiting other U.S. ports, as per a 1985 rulemaking by the U.S. Customs Service. This exemption is based on the main objective of such cruises being to visit foreign ports, not transport passengers between U.S. ports. The 1985 rulemaking by the U.S. Customs Service allows foreign cruise ships to visit U.S. ports as long as they also include a visit to a nearby foreign port. Passengers must stay on the cruise until it returns to the same U.S. port. This exemption is based on the primary intent of the cruise voyage, which is not domestic transportation of passengers. Passengers on foreign cruise ships can visit U.S. ports if they also stop at a nearby foreign port. They must stay on the cruise until it returns to the same U.S. port. Voyages that do not include visits to other ports are known as \"voyages to nowhere\" and can involve activities like whale watching or deep-sea fishing. If passenger vessels stay within 3 miles of U.S. territorial waters on voyages to nowhere, they must comply with the Jones Act. This interpretation is based on Treasury Decision 22275 from 1900. CBP has determined that vessels within 3 miles of U.S. territorial waters must be Jones Act-compliant. If they venture beyond 3 miles into international waters, compliance is not required. Charter fishing boats have different regulations when venturing into international waters. CBP has determined that vessels within 3 miles of U.S. territorial waters must be Jones Act-compliant. However, if charter fishing boats venture into international waters, they still must be Jones Act-compliant, based on a 1936 ruling. According to CBP, passenger vessels must be Jones Act-compliant even in international waters. A passenger is defined as anyone aboard who is not a crew member or owner, regardless of payment. According to CBP, a passenger on a vessel is defined as anyone who is not a crew member or owner, regardless of payment. This definition applies to various scenarios, such as yacht owners entertaining clients or construction companies transporting workers to a site, requiring compliance with the Jones Act. CBP's interpretations also impact activities like \"lightering\" and the use of offshore supply vessels in the oil market. In the offshore oil market, CBP's interpretations have affected \"lightering\" and offshore supply vessels used for oil platforms. If a tanker to be lightered is within 3 nautical miles of shore, it is considered a \"U.S. point,\" allowing foreign-flagged vessels for lightering operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Offshore supply vessels (OSVs) used to supply oil platforms must be Jones Act-compliant if servicing offshore oil rigs. Lightering vessels within 3 miles of shore are considered \"U.S. points,\" allowing foreign-flagged vessels for operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Lightering vessels in the Delaware Bay and other areas within the 3-mile zone must be Jones Act-compliant. OSVs servicing offshore oil rigs must also adhere to Jones Act regulations within the 200-mile offshore zone designated for offshore natural resource activities. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 designates U.S. waters extending 200 miles offshore for offshore natural resource activities. Only oil rigs attached to the seabed are considered \"U.S. points,\" while mobile offshore drilling units not attached to the seabed are not. Foreign-flagged vessels were allowed to service these units until Congress mandated compliance in 2008. In 2008, Congress required that OSVs servicing MODUs be U.S.-owned and -crewed, but not necessarily U.S.-built. This requirement is the same as for U.S.-flag vessels engaged in international voyages. Another factor determining Jones Act compliance for OSVs is whether they are transporting supplies or workers to the oil rig. In 2008, Congress mandated that OSVs servicing MODUs must be U.S.-owned and -crewed, but not necessarily U.S.-built. Another factor for Jones Act compliance is if the OSV is transporting supplies or workers to the oil rig. CBP defines \"vessel equipment\" as necessary for navigation, operation, maintenance, or safety of persons on board. The Jones Act requires OSVs servicing MODUs to be U.S.-owned and -crewed, but not necessarily U.S.-built. Vessels involved in installing rig equipment or conducting geophysical surveying can be foreign-flagged. Flotels providing living quarters are exempt from Jones Act compliance. The Jones Act requires OSVs servicing MODUs to be U.S.-owned and -crewed, but not necessarily U.S.-built. Flotels providing living quarters are exempt from Jones Act compliance. In 2017, CBP proposed that most activities performed by OSVs fall under the Jones Act, but withdrew the proposal after reviewing comments. Some question whether the Jones Act applies to offshore wind farms beyond 3 miles. The distinction between vessels providing living quarters for construction workers and those servicing MODUs under the Jones Act can be unclear. CBP proposed that most activities by OSVs fall under the Jones Act in 2017 but withdrew the proposal after feedback. There is uncertainty about whether the Jones Act applies to offshore wind farms beyond 3 miles from shore, impacting wind farm development due to the nonavailability of Jones Act-compliant Tower Installation Vessels (TIVs). The Department of Energy has highlighted the challenge of nonavailability of Jones Act-compliant Tower Installation Vessels (TIVs) for offshore wind farm development beyond 3 miles from shore. This lack of TIVs hinders installations in deeper waters, leading U.S. wind developers to either import equipment or use Jones Act-compliant vessels from U.S. ports. The lack of Jones Act-compliant Tower Installation Vessels (TIVs) for offshore wind farm development beyond 3 miles from shore has led U.S. wind developers to import equipment or use Jones Act-compliant vessels from U.S. ports. CBP's interpretation of the Jones Act regarding merchandise transformation at intermediate foreign ports has also influenced coastal maritime activity. The Jones Act has influenced coastal maritime activity by allowing non-Jones Act-compliant vessels to transport equipment if it is transformed at an intermediate foreign port. For example, a Texas oil producer ships gasoline to a Bahamian facility where it is blended with imported petroleum to create a final product. The Jones Act allows non-compliant vessels to transport products if they are transformed at an intermediate foreign port. For example, a Texas oil producer ships gasoline to a Bahamian facility where it is blended with imported petroleum to create a final product that is then shipped to New York. Foreign-flag tankers are permitted for these shipments, even if a portion of the cargo is between two U.S. points. The Jones Act allows non-compliant vessels to transport products if they are transformed at an intermediate foreign port. For example, a Texas oil producer ships gasoline to a Bahamian facility where it is blended with imported petroleum to create a final product that is then shipped to New York. Foreign-flag tankers are permitted for these shipments, even if a portion of the cargo is between two U.S. points. This interpretation has precedent in a 1964 Customs Service ruling involving California rice being processed in the U.S. Virgin Islands before being shipped to Puerto Rico, with both shipment legs involving foreign-flag ships. The Jones Act allows non-compliant vessels to transport products if they are transformed at an intermediate foreign port. Congress has enacted provisions tightening Jones Act requirements since 1920, with exemptions for certain maritime activities. In 1935, vessels sold to foreign owners or registered under a foreign-flag were forbidden from requalifying as Jones Act-eligible. In 1935, Congress prohibited Jones Act-qualified vessels sold to foreign owners from requalifying as Jones Act-eligible, providing protection for Jones Act carriers from competition. In 1940, Congress expanded the Jones Act to cover towing vessels and salvage vessels operating in U.S. waters. In 1988, Congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material requires a Jones Act-qualified vessel. Congress has enacted exemptions to the Jones Act. In 1988, Congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material requires a Jones Act-qualified vessel. Congress has enacted exemptions or exceptions to the Jones Act, including waivers when no Jones Act-qualified operator is available in a particular market. In 1988, Congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material requires a Jones Act-qualified vessel. Congress has enacted exemptions or exceptions to the Jones Act, including waivers when no Jones Act-qualified operator is available in a particular market. The Jones Act exemptions have allowed foreign-flag cruise ships to carry passengers between the U.S. mainland and Puerto Rico. In 1984, Congress exempted passenger travel between Puerto Rico and any other U.S. port from the Jones Act if no Jones Act-qualified operator was available. This exemption allows foreign-flag cruise ships to transport passengers between the U.S. mainland and the island. Congress has also permitted foreign-flagged LNG tankers to provide domestic service in 1996 and 2011 due to a lack of Jones Act-qualified vessels, but no ship owners have utilized these exemptions. Additionally, Congress has enacted exemptions for sudden spikes in demand for Jones Act-qualified vessels. In 1996 and 2011, Congress allowed foreign-flagged LNG tankers to operate domestically under certain exemptions, but no ship owners have taken advantage of these opportunities. Congress has also granted exemptions for vessel shortages in the past, such as during a surge in steelmaking for the war effort in the 1940s and a bumper grain harvest in 1951. Additionally, exemptions were enacted in 1996 for vessels involved in oil spill cleanup operations. In the 1940s and 1951, Congress granted exemptions for vessel shortages during a surge in steelmaking for the war effort and a bumper grain harvest. In 1996, exemptions were also given for vessels involved in oil spill cleanup operations. Additionally, exemptions were enacted for innovative vessel designs used in foreign trade with domestic legs that technically fall under the Jones Act. In 1971, Congress granted a Jones Act waiver for a ship designed for international voyages carrying river barges (LASH technology). This exemption is no longer relevant as this shipping method is no longer in use. In 1965, Congress exempted the movement of empty containers between U.S. ports to accommodate upcoming container ship usage internationally. In 1971, Congress exempted river barges on international voyages using LASH technology from the Jones Act. This exemption is no longer relevant as this shipping method is no longer in use. In 1965, Congress also exempted the movement of empty containers between U.S. ports to accommodate upcoming container ship usage internationally. The Jones Act exempts the movement of empty containers between U.S. ports for international shipments, allowing foreign-flagged carriers to reposition their equipment. This exemption requires Jones Act-compliant ships for transshipment of loaded containers, impacting the development of marine highways. Feeder ships for transshipment are common abroad but not in the U.S. due to Jones Act requirements for U.S.-built, -crewed, and -owned ships. The Jones Act requires U.S.-built, -crewed, and -owned ships for transshipment of loaded containers, impacting the development of marine highways. Lack of transshipment services in the U.S. increases demand for rail and road connections to ports. Congress has authorized exemptions to the Jones Act under certain circumstances. The Jones Act requires U.S.-built, -crewed, and -owned ships for transshipment of loaded containers. Lack of transshipment services increases demand for rail and road connections to ports. Congress has authorized exemptions to the Jones Act under certain circumstances, including exemptions for specific vessels identified by name and registration number. Since 1989, Congress has granted Jones Act waivers for at least 133 specific vessels in 16 legislative acts, typically appearing in maritime-related legislation. Waivers are given for vessels identified by name and registration number, without specifying the reason for the waiver or vessel details. Since 1989, Congress has granted Jones Act waivers for at least 133 specific vessels in 16 legislative acts, typically appearing in maritime-related legislation. These waivers are for vessels that are not commercially significant, with some owned by nonprofit entities. One exception was the 2011 granting of waivers to three LNG tankers built in the United States in the late 1970s. Since 1989, Congress has granted Jones Act waivers for at least 133 vessels, with some owned by nonprofit entities. One exception was the 2011 granting of waivers to three LNG tankers built in the United States in the late 1970s. Many vessels require waivers due to technicalities in meeting Jones Act requirements, with specific conditions placed on their use. In the late 1970s, states that later became foreign-registered vessels needed waivers due to technicalities in meeting Jones Act requirements, such as missing U.S.-citizen ownership records. Waivers were granted during World War I, World War II, and the Korean War under specific conditions. Congress has the authority to issue waivers \"in the interest of national defense\" since 1950. During World War I, World War II, and the Korean War, domestic shipping restrictions were waived. Congress has had the authority to issue waivers \"in the interest of national defense\" since 1950, which has been used in various conflicts such as the Persian Gulf War and a conflict in Libya. The authority to waive domestic shipping restrictions for national defense purposes has been in effect since 1950. Waivers have been granted during conflicts like the Persian Gulf War and Libya, as well as for fuel resupply after natural disasters. This authority has been used for waivers following major hurricanes like Katrina, Harvey, Irma, and Maria. The executive branch has waived the Jones Act for fuel resupply after natural disasters using the \"national defense waiver\" authority. MARAD checks vessel availability before granting waivers, and the lack of heavy-lift vessels in the Jones Act fleet has led to foreign-flag vessels being allowed for transport. In 2008, Congress gave MARAD the role of checking for Jones Act-qualified vessels before granting waivers. National defense waivers have been granted due to the lack of heavy-lift vessels in the Jones Act fleet, allowing foreign-flag vessels for specific transports. The Jones Act waivers have been granted for specific transports, such as allowing an oil company to use a Chinese-flagged heavy-lift vessel to transport an oil rig from the Gulf Coast to Alaska in 2006. However, Customs denied a waiver request in 1992 to use a foreign-flag heavy-lift vessel to transport replicas of Christopher Columbus's ships from Boston to San Francisco. The use of specific heavy-lift vessels in the construction of offshore oil rigs has been a point of contention, with CBP denying waivers despite the need for these vessels. CBP has denied Jones Act waivers for using foreign-flag heavy-lift vessels to transport replicas of Christopher Columbus's ships from Boston to San Francisco, citing the high standard of \"national defense\" justification. This decision has been made despite safety concerns raised by the Coast Guard and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. CBP has denied Jones Act waivers for using foreign-flag vessels to transport replicas of Christopher Columbus's ships, citing \"national defense\" justification. Safety concerns were raised by the Coast Guard and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. The Department of the Interior advised that not granting a waiver created a safety hazard for operators. National defense waivers are not issued for economic reasons, such as commercial practicality or expediency. While waivers have been issued for fuel shortages, they have not been granted to favor domestic supply lines over offshore ones, despite arguments for the latter being a national security issue. In 1976, some Members of Congress sought to extend the Jones Act to the U.S. Virgin Islands due to vulnerability of offshore supply lines. Northeast refineries considered seeking a Jones Act waiver in 2014 to ship crude. In 2018, the largest refinery in North America in the U.S. Virgin Islands supplied petroleum products to the U.S. Northeast on foreign-flagged tankers. Northeast refineries considered seeking a Jones Act waiver to ship crude oil from Texas. The United States exported between 40 million and 80 million barrels of crude oil per month on foreign-flag tankers, imported about 150 million barrels per month from overseas sources on foreign-flag tankers, and shipped about 15 million barrels per month domestically on Jones Act vessels. The United States is facing a situation where refineries are importing crude oil and LNG on foreign-flag tankers, while also exporting crude oil and LNG by ship. However, there are no LNG tankers in the Jones Act fleet, and shippers have not utilized waivers for LNG. The United States is facing challenges with importing and exporting crude oil and LNG by ship, while lacking LNG tankers in the Jones Act fleet. Shippers have not utilized waivers for LNG tankers, leading to controversies and discussions about the Jones Act in various shipping sectors. Puerto Rico is seeking a waiver to receive bulk LNG shipments from the U.S. mainland. Puerto Rico is seeking a 10-year waiver of the Jones Act to receive bulk shipments of LNG from the U.S. mainland. Recent controversies over the Jones Act have concerned the oceangoing ship and offshore supply vessel sectors. The Jones Act also covers ships on the Great Lakes, river barges, harbor tugs, dredging vessels, and various kinds of passenger vessels. The Jones Act ship fleet has shortcomings compared to the merchant fleet desired by the drafters of the 1920 act. The Jones Act covers various types of vessels, including ships on the Great Lakes, river barges, harbor tugs, and passenger vessels. As of March 2018, there were 99 oceangoing ships in the Jones Act-compliant fleet, with the largest category being tankers. Of the 57 tankers, 11 carry Alaskan crude oil to the West Coast, 44 carry refined products along the Atlantic Coast, and 2 are chemical or asphalt tankers. In March 2018, the Jones Act-compliant fleet had 99 oceangoing ships with 3,380 mariners. The fleet includes tankers, container ships, roll on/roll off vessels, dry bulk vessels, and general-cargo vessels serving Alaska's subsistence harbors. The Jones Act-compliant fleet includes tankers, container ships, roll on/roll off vessels, dry bulk vessels, and general-cargo vessels. The fleet has shrunk to less than a quarter of its 1950 size, with larger ships but less aggregate carrying capacity. The Jones Act fleet supplying subsistence harbors along Alaska's coast has significantly decreased in size since 1950, with larger ships but less carrying capacity. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was a notable drop in fleet size. In a 1967 congressional hearing, the U.S. merchant marine was criticized as being \"too small, too old, and too unproductive.\" In the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was a significant drop in the size of the U.S. merchant marine fleet. In a 1967 congressional hearing, Secretary of Transportation Alan Boyd criticized the fleet as \"too small, too old, and too unproductive.\" The Lyndon B. Johnson Administration was the only one to call for the repeal of the Jones Act, as domestic ships are carrying fewer tons of freight compared to railroads and pipelines. The Lyndon B. Johnson Administration is the only one in the modern era to advocate for repealing the Jones Act. Domestic ships have lost market share to railroads and pipelines despite their economic advantages. Ocean carriers can move more cargo per trip and per gallon of fuel compared to trucks and railroads. Although ships are slower, many shippers are willing to sacrifice transit time for cost savings. The Jones Act fleet operates in domestic trade routes where overland modes are not an option, serving Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Shippers are willing to sacrifice transit time for lower costs as long as delivery schedules are reliable. The Jones Act fleet serves Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico in domestic trade routes where shippers have few alternatives. While shippers prioritize reliable delivery schedules over transit time, the Jones Act has not effectively increased the nation's maritime commerce as intended by Congress in the Merchant Marine Act of 1936. The Jones Act has not succeeded in meeting the policy goals of sustaining a growing merchant marine that carries an increasing proportion of the nation's commerce. The fleet does not appear to provide shipping service on all essential routes or have the safest and most suitable vessels. The Jones Act fleet does not meet the policy goals of providing shipping service on essential routes and having the safest and most suitable vessels. Some ship designs, like \"project cargo\" or \"heavy-lift\" vessels, are not represented in the fleet. The Jones Act fleet does not meet policy goals of providing shipping service on essential routes and having the safest and most suitable vessels. Some ship designs, like \"project cargo\" or \"heavy-lift\" vessels, are not represented in the fleet, such as those used for moving dredging fleets to project sites. The Department of Defense has used waivers of the Jones Act to move radar systems and newly built vessels on foreign-flag heavy-lift vessels. The Jones Act fleet lacks certain vessel types like project cargo or heavy-lift vessels for moving dredging fleets. The Department of Defense has used waivers to move radar systems and vessels on foreign-flag heavy-lift ships. Jones Act operators face challenges in competing internationally due to higher costs. The Jones Act fleet lacks project cargo or heavy-lift vessels. The Department of Defense uses waivers to move radar systems and vessels on foreign-flag heavy-lift ships due to higher costs for Jones Act operators. Two dry bulk ships in the Jones Act fleet are nearly 40 years old, twice the economic life of global fleet ships. The sole Jones Act-qualified chemical tanker was built in 1968, with no LNG tankers in the fleet. The Jones Act fleet lacks project cargo or heavy-lift vessels. Department of Defense uses waivers to move radar systems and vessels on foreign-flag heavy-lift ships due to higher costs for Jones Act operators. Despite new domestic markets from the shale gas boom, no LNG tankers are in the Jones Act fleet. The high cost of U.S.-built and U.S.-crewed ships has led to a unique vessel design in the U.S. market. Despite new domestic markets from the shale gas boom, the Jones Act fleet lacks LNG tankers. To address the high cost of U.S.-built and U.S.-crewed ships, the U.S. market has developed articulated tug barges (ATBs). Over 150 ATBs are estimated to be operating in the Jones Act trades, offering more capability than flatwater barges but still less reliable and capable than traditional ships in handling heavy sea states. The U.S. market has developed articulated tug barges (ATBs) as a unique vessel design for the Jones Act trades. Over 150 ATBs are currently operating, offering more capability than flatwater barges but still less reliable and efficient than traditional ships in handling heavy sea states. ATBs sail closer to the coasts, posing a higher risk of grounding and providing less time to prevent spilled oil from reaching shorelines. ATBs are less reliable and efficient than tanker ships for longer voyages due to their slower speed and smaller size. The notch between the barge and tug creates more water resistance. They pose a higher risk of grounding and provide less time to prevent oil spills from reaching shorelines. ATB crews are not qualified to sail sealift ships. The El Faro, a Jones Act general cargo ship, sank in a hurricane in 2015. The El Faro, a Jones Act general cargo ship built in 1975, sank in a hurricane in 2015. The Coast Guard expressed concern about the U.S.-flag fleet's condition after the incident. The Coast Guard expressed concern about the condition of the U.S.-flag fleet after the sinking of the El Faro in 2015. They found that other vessels in the fleet were also in substandard condition, noting that the fleet is much older than the average fleet worldwide. The Coast Guard's concern about the U.S.-flag fleet's condition post-El Faro sinking extends to other vessels, with findings showing substandard conditions not unique to El Faro. The fleet's age, three times older than average, raises maintenance issues, as seen with the 46-year-old Matsonia's hull crack discovery in 2019. The Coast Guard is concerned about the condition of the U.S.-flag fleet post-El Faro sinking, with findings showing substandard conditions not unique to El Faro. The fleet's age, three times older than average, raises maintenance issues, as seen with the 46-year-old Matsonia's hull crack discovery in 2019. The Jones Act fleet today is relatively young due to shipbuilding after the increase in shale oil production and before the lifting of the oil export ban. New ships were needed to comply with tighter emissions requirements in the North American emission control area. The Jones Act fleet today is relatively young compared to its prior composition, with just over one-third of oceangoing vessels being 21 years old or older. The Great Lakes fleet, consisting of dry bulk ships and large barges, is considerably older. The Jones Act oceangoing fleet has 35 ships that are 21 years old or older, down from 64 ships in 2007. The Great Lakes fleet includes 33 dry bulk ships and large barges, with the largest ships built between 1972 and 1981. The second-largest class of ships, around 700 feet in length, is even older, with some originally built in the 1940s or 1950s. The U.S. fleet of 1,000-foot freighters on the Great Lakes carries iron ore, limestone, coal, and cement. These ships were built between 1972 and 1981, while the second-largest class, around 700 feet long, is older, with some vessels dating back to the 1940s or 1950s. Freshwater ships like those on the Great Lakes have longer lifespans than oceangoing vessels. Great Lakes ships are narrower due to the dimensions of the Soo Locks in Michigan. The U.S. fleet of Great Lakes freighters includes 1,000-foot ships carrying various materials. These ships have longer lifespans than oceangoing vessels. The Canadian Great Lakes fleet demonstrates the impact of vessel import policies on a domestic fleet, with the youngest ship built in 1985 before Canada imposed a 25% tariff. The Canadian Great Lakes fleet saw a decline in new ship additions due to a 25% import tariff on newly constructed ships, which was later repealed in 2010. Since then, over 35 new dry bulk ships have been built in other countries for service on the Great Lakes, unable to carry cargo between U.S. points. In 1985, Canada imposed a 25% tariff on imported ships, halting new additions to the Canadian fleet. The tariff was repealed in 2010, leading to the construction of over 35 new dry bulk ships for the Great Lakes. Thousands of tugs and barges transport dry and liquid bulk commodities on inland rivers, dominated by corn and soybean exports. Since 1990, overall tonnage on the nation's inland rivers has been flat or slightly declining. The fleet includes thousands of tugs and barges carrying dry and liquid bulk commodities, with a significant portion dedicated to the export of corn and soybeans and domestic coal movement. One of the leading manufacturers of river barges ceased operation in April 2018 due to decreased demand for coal deliveries by barge. The Dredging Act of 1906 requires vessels engaged in dredging. Since 1990, overall tonnage on the nation's inland rivers has been flat or slightly declining, with a focus on the export of corn and soybeans and domestic coal movement. A leading manufacturer of river barges ceased operation in April 2018 due to decreased demand for coal deliveries by barge. The Dredging Act of 1906 requires U.S.-built, -operated, and -crewed vessels for dredging in U.S. waters. The 1906 Dredging Act requires U.S.-built, -operated, and -crewed vessels for dredging in U.S. waters. In 1988, the Jones Act was amended to include valueless material as \"merchandise,\" necessitating dredge spoil to be transported in Jones Act-qualified vessels. This requirement increases the cost of dredging U.S. harbors significantly. The ban on foreign-built dredgers and operators under the Jones Act significantly raises the cost of dredging U.S. harbors. Despite increased federal spending on navigation dredging, there has not been a larger volume of material dredged due to limited supply of dredging vessels and rising costs of fuel, steel, and labor. Corps of Engineers data shows that despite increased federal spending on navigation dredging, there has not been a larger volume of material dredged from U.S. harbors. Factors such as limited supply of dredging vessels, rising costs of fuel, steel, and labor, as well as more stringent environmental requirements, contribute to the cost increases. The U.S. privately owned fleet is older and smaller compared to leading European dredging firms. The U.S. privately owned fleet is much older and smaller compared to leading European dredging firms. European firms have a fleet of hopper dredges with three to four times the capacity of the entire U.S. hopper fleet. The majority of U.S. hopper dredges are over 20 years old, while European fleet is mostly under 20 years old. The U.S. privately owned hopper dredge fleet is significantly older and smaller compared to leading European firms. When the Army Corps bids harbor work requiring a hopper dredge, one of the four U.S. firms is the sole bidder over a third of the time. Insufficient dredges can perform the work during certain periods scheduled for dredging projects. The U.S. hopper dredge fleet is aging and smaller compared to European firms. One U.S. firm often bids alone for Army Corps harbor work. Insufficient dredges are available for scheduled projects. Mobilization costs can be over one-third of total project costs. Foreign firms use heavy-lift vessels for transport, which are not available in the U.S. Jones Act fleet. OSV fleet size is variable. The U.S. hopper dredge fleet is aging and smaller compared to European firms. Mobilization costs can be over one-third of total project costs. Foreign firms use heavy-lift vessels for transport, which are not available in the U.S. Jones Act fleet. The offshore supply vessel fleet consisted of about 1,800 vessels in 2017, mainly working in the Gulf of Mexico. Foreign-built vessels are relied upon for construction of rigs in deeper waters. The offshore supply vessel fleet in 2017 consisted of about 1,800 vessels, mainly operating in the Gulf of Mexico. Foreign-built vessels with dynamic positioning propulsion systems are used for construction in deeper waters, lacking in the Jones Act fleet for wind tower installation. The Jones Act fleet lacks vessels with dynamic positioning propulsion systems for construction in deeper waters, hindering wind tower installation. Congress has designated other fleets for sealift support since 1920, but merchant mariners on Jones Act ships are still seen as contributing to national defense efforts. The Jones Act fleet faces challenges in serving as a naval auxiliary during times of war or national emergency. Congress has designated other fleets for sealift support since 1920, but the shrinking U.S. mariner pool raises concerns about crewing a reserve sealift fleet. In 2014, Congress directed the development of a national sealift strategy. The Jones Act oceangoing ships' crews are crucial for military sealift support. Congress directed the development of a national sealift strategy in 2014, but it has not been issued yet. The shrinking U.S. mariner pool raises concerns about crewing a reserve sealift fleet. The Jones Act oceangoing ships' crews, crucial for military sealift support, consist of about 3,380 merchant mariners. These mariners, with six months of shore leave per year, would crew a reserve fleet of government-owned cargo ships for military sealift purposes. This plan is part of the national sealift strategy that has yet to be issued. The Jones Act crew of oceangoing ships consists of about 3,380 merchant mariners, which is about 29% of the total mariner pool needed for the government-owned reserve fleet. The remaining mariners would come from the U.S.-flag privately owned international fleet and the Military Sealift Command fleet. MARAD estimates a sufficient commercial mariner pool to crew the reserve sealift fleet for up to 180 days, but a prolonged effort would require crew rotations, leading to a shortfall of about 1,800 mariners. The mariner pool is barely enough to sustain an extended sealift operation. The reserve sealift fleet consists of 120 ships and 5,576 mariners. MARAD estimates a sufficient mariner pool for a surge lasting up to 180 days, but a longer effort would face a shortfall of about 1,800 mariners. This shortage has been a consistent issue for decades, even when the mariner pool was larger. The mariner pool is insufficient for a longer sealift effort, a consistent issue for decades even when the pool was larger in the past. In 2004, the RRF had 59 ships and a mariner pool of 16,900. In 1991, the RRF had 96 ships and a mariner pool of 25,000. The mariner pool was deemed barely sufficient to crew the reserve sealift fleet. The Jones Act aimed for a commercial fleet capable of providing sealift in times of war. Three other fleets for military sealift have been established since then: RRF, MSC, and MSP, with predominantly foreign-built ships. The RRF, originating in a 1954 act of Congress, now has 46 ships. The maritime policy aimed for a commercial fleet that could provide sealift in times of war. Three fleets for military sealift have been established: RRF, MSC, and MSP, with predominantly foreign-built ships. The RRF, originating in a 1954 act of Congress, currently consists of 46 ships on standby with a skeleton crew of about 600 commercial mariners. The MSC fleet, controlled by TRANSCOM, consists of 46 ships on standby with a skeleton crew of 600 commercial mariners. An additional 1,200 mariners would be needed to sustain its operation once activated. MSC ships are mostly crewed by civilian mariners who are federal employees. The MSP ships, established by Congress in 1996, receive an operating subsidy of $5 million per vessel per year and rely heavily on government cargoes. The MSP ships, established by Congress in 1996, receive an operating subsidy of about $5 million per vessel per year to cover the additional cost of American crews and rely heavily on government cargoes reserved for them. Military is to utilize MSP ships before MSC ships according to agreements between MARAD and the Department of Defense. The military sealift fleet heavily relies on government cargoes reserved for them under the \"cargo preference\" law. While Jones Act operators must use more costly U.S.-built ships, the sealift fleet mainly uses cheaper foreign-built ships. Jones Act operators compete in the commercial marketplace, while the sealift fleet does not. The Jones Act requires operators to use expensive U.S.-built ships, while the military sealift fleet uses more affordable foreign-built ships. To increase competitiveness, the sealift fleet could be built domestically, sharing the higher cost nationally. This would expand the mariner pool for sealift support and enhance repair capabilities. The sealift fleet could be built domestically to increase competitiveness and share the higher cost nationally. This would expand the mariner pool for sealift support and enhance repair capabilities. The military seeks cargo ships with flexible capabilities, including ramps or onboard cranes for unloading cargo at underdeveloped ports. The majority of the military sealift fleet consists of product tankers and roll-on/roll-off ships for carrying fuel and moving tanks, trucks, and helicopters. The military sealift fleet consists of versatile ships with ramps or cranes for unloading cargo at underdeveloped ports. It includes product tankers, roll-on/roll-off ships for tanks and trucks, and container ships for ammunition. The military's preference for versatility conflicts with the commercial fleet's trend towards specialized and larger ships for cost efficiency. The military's preference for versatile ships with ramps or cranes conflicts with the commercial fleet's trend towards specialized and larger ships for cost efficiency. General cargo and break-bulk ships have been replaced by container ships without onboard cranes, leading to potential challenges for commercial mariners in foreign ports. The largest container ships require 45 to 50 feet. Commercial mariners may lack experience operating cargo cranes in foreign ports due to the shift from general cargo and break-bulk ships to container ships without onboard cranes. The largest container ships require deeper water than many ports can provide, and cost pressures have led to the installation of fuel-efficient engines on commercial carriers. Ro/Ro ships have been replaced by \"pure car carriers\" that prioritize passenger car capacity over military utility. The largest container ships need deeper water than many ports can offer. Cost pressures have led to fuel-efficient engines on commercial carriers, but these engines may not meet the speed requirements for military sealift ships. Stringent sulfur emission regulations have pushed operators to switch to LNG-fueled engines or install scrubbers, which take up cargo space and have no military use. The military sealift ships face challenges in meeting speed requirements due to fuel-efficient engines used by commercial carriers. Stringent sulfur emission regulations have led to the adoption of LNG-fueled engines or scrubbers, impacting cargo space and crew skill sets. The disparity between ideal vessel designs and crew skills poses a challenge for military sealift operations. The Jones Act contributes to military sealift by preserving shipyard skills for building and repairing vessels, despite a growing disparity between military and commercial vessel designs and crew skill sets. U.S. shipyards build few oceangoing ships annually, limiting their export capabilities. The Merchant Marine Act of 1970 aimed to have a shipyard industrial base capable of building and repairing ships. However, U.S. shipyards only build a few oceangoing ships annually, hindering their export potential and leading to gaps in orders. Despite sufficient demand to sustain one shipyard focused on commercial ships, employment has declined, with no vessels currently under construction or on order. The demand for oceangoing ships in U.S. shipyards is limited, leading to gaps in orders and hindering export potential. One shipyard builds commercial ships but has seen a decline in employment with no vessels currently under construction or on order. Other shipyards focus on smaller vessels like tour boats, ferries, and barges, with around 1,000 barges built annually to meet the Jones Act domestic build requirement. The shipyard mentioned in the curr_chunk had no vessels under construction or on order as of March 31, 2019. Shipyards building smaller vessels lack dry docks for repairing large ships, while the government-owned sealift fleet is aging and in need of repair due to a lack of large dry docks. The government-owned sealift fleet, under the Jones Act domestic build requirement, lacks large dry docks for repairs, leading to delays in readiness to sail. Many vessels are in need of repair, with some failing safety inspections and being deemed unseaworthy due to rusted hulls. The Navy's plan to address the issues with the sealift fleet includes building new vessels, repairing current ships to extend their service life, and purchasing used foreign-built ships. However, repairs have been more costly and time-consuming than initially projected. According to TRANSCOM, the Navy is considering accelerating the purchase of used, foreign-built ships due to the high cost and time required for repairing current vessels. Building new ships in U.S. yards is deemed unaffordable. The Tariff Act of 1930, along with the Jones Act, aims to support U.S. shipyards by imposing a 50% duty on nonemergency ships. The Navy is considering accelerating the purchase of used, foreign-built ships due to high costs and time delays in repairing current vessels. Building new ships in U.S. yards is 26 times more expensive. The Tariff Act of 1930 imposes a 50% duty on nonemergency repairs on U.S. flag ships done in foreign shipyards. Many U.S.-flag international trading ships have repairs done in foreign yards due to lower costs, even with the 50% duty."
