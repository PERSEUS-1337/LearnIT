The Tar Creek Superfund Site in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, was a lead and zinc mining area from the early 1900s to the 1970s. It is part of the Tri-State Mining District and is prone to flooding due to its location. Mining companies had to pump water from the Boone Aquifer. The Tar Creek Superfund Site in Oklahoma, part of the Tri-State Mining District, was a lead and zinc mining area from the early 1900s to the 1970s. Mining companies had to pump water from the Boone Aquifer, and much of the mining was on Indian land controlled by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. During World War I, mining at the Site accounted for over 45% of the Nation's wartime consumption. During World War II, the Department of the Interior recommended stockpiling waste tailings aboveground at the Tar Creek Superfund Site for later reprocessing. During World War II, the Department of the Interior recommended stockpiling waste tailings aboveground at the Tar Creek Superfund Site for later reprocessing. In 1960, Congress enacted the Small Producers Lead and Zinc Mining Stabilization Act to encourage lead and zinc production at the Site. In 1979, acid mine water began discharging at the surface from several locations at the Site as the underground mine workings refilled with water from the Boone Aquifer. In 1983, the Site was placed on the National Priorities List due to acid mine water discharging at the surface from underground mine workings refilled with water from the Boone Aquifer. In 1984, the Environmental Protection Agency started remediation efforts for the acid mine water. In 1994, the Environmental Protection Agency concluded that it was impossible to remediate the acid mine water at the Site due to numerous mine shafts and boreholes. The Environmental Protection Agency found it impossible to remediate acid mine water at the Site due to numerous mine shafts and boreholes. The open mine shafts are a source of recharge to underground mine workings, with millions of tons of chat laced with toxic heavy metals like lead contributing to flood problems. The stockpiled chat at the Site is contaminated with heavy metals, including lead, contributing to flood problems and recharging underground mine workings. It has been used for construction purposes in various high-access areas. The stockpiled chat at the Site has been used in construction, contaminating residential areas with heavy metals like lead. The Environmental Protection Agency started remediation work in 1994 to address unsafe lead levels in residential yards. The use of chat in construction has contaminated residential areas with heavy metals, including lead. The Environmental Protection Agency remediated yards with unsafe lead levels in 1994. Studies show children at the Site have elevated blood lead levels, which can cause learning disabilities and other health issues. Scientific studies confirm that many children at the Site have high blood lead levels, leading to learning disabilities and other health issues. Dust from the stockpiled chat poses a health risk, and repeated cave-ins have occurred due to mining activities, some exceeding 100 feet in diameter and affecting populated areas and schools. Scientific studies indicate that dust from the stockpiled chat at the Site poses a health risk. Repeated cave-ins, some larger than 100 feet in diameter, have occurred in populated areas and near schools. No government agency has taken action to address the chat or subsidence dangers at the Site, and there have been no comprehensive epidemiological studies conducted. The Site faces unique environmental challenges. Repeated cave-ins, some larger than 100 feet in diameter, have occurred in populated areas and near schools. No government agency has taken action to address the chat or subsidence dangers at the Site, and there have been no comprehensive epidemiological studies conducted. The Site can never be made safe for human habitation due to its unique environmental problems.

The Site can never be made safe for human habitation due to its unique environmental problems. SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will provide assistance under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to residents in the 17 square mile area identified in Governor Keating's Tar Creek Superfund Task Force Final Report. This includes the communities of Picher and Cardin on the Tar Creek Superfund site in Oklahoma. The EPA will be considered the displacing agency for the application of the Act. The Environmental Protection Agency will provide assistance to residents in the Tar Creek Superfund site in Oklahoma under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970. The EPA will work with other officials to seek a comprehensive resolution for the cleanup of the site. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will collaborate with other officials to address environmental and health issues at the Tar Creek Superfund site, without relieving any agency of cleanup responsibilities under the law."
