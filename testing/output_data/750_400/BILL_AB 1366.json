    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to increase enrollment and graduation rates for students eligible under Assembly Bill 540 by mandating the establishment of Dream Resource Centers at public higher education institutions. Approximately 65,000 undocumented students graduate from high schools each year, but only 20 percent attend college. Many are unaware of laws like Assembly Bill 540, the California Dream Act, and DACA that make college more accessible. Most college campuses lack centralized support services for these students. Recent policy changes, including Assembly Bill 540, the California Dream Act, and DACA, have made college graduation more attainable for undocumented students. However, most college campuses lack centralized support services for students eligible under these laws. The creation of Dream Resource Centers would streamline financial aid and academic opportunities for students eligible under Assembly Bill 540, empowering them in a safe environment to increase enrollment, transfer, and graduation rates. Several college campuses have established Dream Resource Centers to support undocumented students, including the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of California, Davis; and various California State University campuses. These centers offer workshops, legal assistance, information on available programs, and peer mentoring to enhance awareness of resources and increase employment opportunities for these students. Chapter 3.67 is added to the Education Code, encouraging California Community Colleges to designate Dream Resource Liaisons on campuses to assist students in accessing financial aid and academic opportunities. Each campus of the California Community Colleges is encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison to assist students, including undocumented students, in accessing financial aid and academic opportunities. Each campus of the California State University is encouraged to designate a staff person as a Dream Resource Liaison knowledgeable in financial aid and academic opportunities for students meeting specific requirements, including undocumented students. This staff person should be placed in the campus' extended opportunities programs and services office or financial aid office. Each campus of the California State University is encouraged to have a designated staff person as a Dream Resource Liaison knowledgeable in financial aid and academic opportunities for students meeting specific requirements, including undocumented students. The University of California is encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison on each of its campuses.
