The Management Conference for the Coeur d'Alene Basin must publish a water pollution prevention, control, and restoration plan within one year of enactment, clarifying responsibilities and suggesting a timetable for actions. The Plan developed under this section will clarify duties for water pollution prevention, suggest timetables for adoption, describe funding methods, and sources for programs and projects. The Plan will include strategies for water pollution prevention and control in the Coeur d'Alene Basin, funding methods, and incorporate environmental management concepts from State and Federal plans. The Plan will incorporate environmental management concepts from State and Federal plans and include a strategy for water pollution prevention and control in the Coeur d'Alene Basin. The Plan will include strategies for pollution prevention and management in the Coeur d'Alene Basin, with provisions for public review and approval by the Administrator. The Management Conference will hold a public meeting in Idaho to hear comments on the draft plan. The Administrator will approve the Plan within 30 days if it meets the requirements. Once approved, the Plan will be considered an approved management program and comprehensive conservation plan. Upon approval of the Plan, it will be deemed an approved management program and comprehensive conservation plan. Grant assistance may be provided to water pollution control agencies. Upon approval of the Plan, it will be implemented. Grant assistance may be provided to water pollution control agencies for the development of the Plan. Grants are available for assisting in the development of a Plan, including research, surveys, studies, and technical work. The federal share of grants cannot exceed 70% of the development costs, with the condition that non-Federal sources provide the remaining share, which can include in-kind services.
