The Mexico City policy, issued by President Reagan in 1984, required foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify that they would not perform or actively promote abortion. It has been rescinded and reissued by past and current Administrations. President Obama rescinded it in January 2009. The FY2013 House legislation proposed to codify the policy, but the Senate bill did not include such language. Previous Administrations have also suspended grants to UNFPA over coercive family planning practices in China. The George W. Bush Administration disagreed on whether UNFPA engages in such activities. The US has suspended grants to UNFPA due to evidence of coercive family planning practices in China, citing violations of the \"Kemp-Kasten\" amendment. Past administrations have disagreed on whether UNFPA engages in such activities. The George W. Bush Administration suspended contributions from FY2002 to FY2008, while President Obama resumed contributions in 2009. The proposed FY2013 House legislation included funding for family planning. The George W. Bush Administration suspended U.S. contributions to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008 following a State Department investigation of family planning programs in China. President Obama resumed U.S. contributions to the organization in 2009. The proposed FY2013 House legislation included $461 million for family planning and reproductive health activities and prohibited funding for UNFPA, while the Senate legislation included $700 million for family planning and reproductive health, including $44.5 million for UNFPA. Both the House and Senate bills included the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The House proposed $461 million for family planning and reproductive health activities, while the Senate proposed $700 million, including $44.5 million for UNFPA. Both bills included the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The Administration suggested dissolving the AEECA account in FY2013, with a proposed 18% cut in funding for programs currently funded through AEECA. The AEECA account, established in 1989 and 1992, was proposed to be dissolved in FY2013 due to the end of special focus on former Soviet and Eastern bloc states transitioning to democracy and free market economies. The House legislation merged AEECA funds with other accounts, signaling continued support for the region. The AEECA account, currently funded through AEECA, faces an 18% cut from FY2012 funding. The House legislation merges AEECA funds with ESF, GHP, and INCLE accounts, while the Senate proposal allows funds from ESF and other accounts to assist AEECA-eligible countries without specifying a minimum funding level. The Senate proposal allows funds from ESF and other accounts to assist AEECA-eligible countries without specifying a minimum funding level. U.S. national security, trade promotion, and humanitarian interests are key rationales for international affairs activities. During the Cold War, foreign aid and diplomatic programs focused on anti-communism and other U.S. policy interests like economic development, trade promotion, education, healthcare, human rights, and environmental protection. Post-Cold War, objectives shifted to nuclear weapons proliferation prevention, drug trafficking control, peace efforts in the Middle East, regional stability, and security. After the Cold War, U.S. foreign policy objectives shifted to focus on stopping nuclear weapons proliferation, curbing illegal drug production and trafficking, promoting peace in the Middle East, achieving regional stability, protecting religious freedom, and countering trafficking in persons. The 9/11 terrorist attacks led to a significant change in emphasis towards national security objectives in foreign aid and diplomatic programs. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, U.S. foreign policy shifted towards emphasizing national security objectives, with a focus on counterterrorism efforts. This change was reflected in President Bush's 2002 National Security Strategy, which established global development as a key component of U.S. national security alongside defense and diplomacy. Development continued to be highlighted in subsequent National Security Strategies in 2006 and 2010. In 2002, President Bush established global development as a key component of U.S. national security, alongside defense and diplomacy. Foreign assistance budget justifications began to prioritize the war on terrorism, focusing on aid to \"front-line\" states. Large reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq became prominent. In 2010, the National Security Strategy continued to prioritize foreign aid to \"front-line\" states in the war on terrorism. Reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq were significant in the foreign aid budget, emphasizing aid as a tool for national security. The State Department focused on diplomatic security and public diplomacy in Muslim communities. The Bush Administration increased aid for combatting HIV/AIDS globally through the creation of PEPFAR and established the MCC to support development strategies in countries with good governance. The Bush Administration increased aid for combatting HIV/AIDS globally through the creation of PEPFAR and established the MCC to support development strategies in countries with good governance. The Obama Administration continued these initiatives, including the MCC, global health funding, and assistance to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The Obama Administration continued Bush's foreign aid initiatives, including the MCC, global health funding, and assistance to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Funding for these initiatives was requested within Overseas Contingency Operations in regular appropriations bills. The administration also completed the first Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review in 2010, naming USAID as the leading agency. The Obama Administration completed the first Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review in 2010, naming USAID as the leading agency for development assistance. Reforms for the Department of State were also identified and implemented, including the establishment of the Bureau of Energy and elevating the Office of the Coordinator for Stabilization and Reconstruction to the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations in its FY2012 budget. In its FY2012 budget proposals, the Department of State requested a significant change in funding for Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, extending the use of OCO funds for \"extraordinary, but temporary, costs.\" In its FY2012 budget proposals, the Department of State requested a change in funding for Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, extending the use of OCO funds for \"extraordinary, but temporary, costs.\" Congress adopted the OCO designation and expanded it to include additional accounts and countries. The OCO designation was adopted by Congress in the FY2012 State-Foreign Operations appropriations legislation to cover extraordinary costs in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. This designation became more important with the Budget Control Act of 2011, allowing war-related funding to be separate from core international affairs activities in the budget. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) increased the significance of the OCO designation, allowing war-related funding to be separate from core international affairs activities in the budget. However, OCO funds are not exempt from automatic across-the-board reductions scheduled for January 2, 2013. This approach is similar to the use of supplemental international affairs appropriations in the past decade. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) determined that OCO funds are not exempt from BCA automatic across-the-board reductions scheduled for January 2, 2013. This OCO approach is reminiscent of past use of supplemental international affairs appropriations. Supplemental funds for foreign operations were appropriated in FY2002-FY2010 for activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, not counted toward subcommittee budget allocations. The Obama Administration criticized this practice, stating such activities should no longer be emergencies, and pledged to request funds through the regular budget process starting in FY2010. This led to a sharp increase in base funding in FY2010, with supplemental international affairs funds still requested and enacted for that year, mainly for the earthquake in Haiti, as well as activities in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. In FY2010, there was a sharp increase in base funding for international affairs, with supplemental funds requested for activities in Haiti, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. FY2011 was the only year in the last decade where all international affairs funding was part of the base budget before the OCO approach was adopted in FY2012. Unlike supplementals, OCO allows all funding to be considered simultaneously in the regular budget process. In FY2011, all international affairs funding was part of the base budget before the OCO approach was adopted in FY2012. OCO allows all funding to be considered simultaneously in the regular appropriations process. For FY2013, $8.24 billion, or 15% of the international affairs request, was designated as OCO, 5% less than FY2012. In FY2013, $8.24 billion, or 15% of the international affairs request, was designated as OCO. The House legislation designated $8.3 billion as OCO, while the Senate bill designated $2.3 billion as OCO. In FY2013, $8.3 billion was designated as OCO in the House legislation, with more funds allocated to foreign operations accounts and less to State operations accounts. The Senate bill allocated $2.3 billion as OCO, significantly less than requested, omitting funding for the Iraq Police Development program and funding disaster assistance and migration accounts through the base budget. State Department-Foreign Operations funding had been increasing until 2011, with a spike in FY2004 due to reconstruction funds for Iraq and Afghanistan. The funding for the Iraq Police Development program was mentioned, and disaster assistance and migration accounts would be funded through the base budget. State Department-Foreign Operations funding increased until 2011, with a spike in FY2004 for Iraq and Afghanistan reconstruction. However, in FY2011, Congress reduced foreign affairs spending to meet deficit reduction goals. Funding levels in FY2012 and FY2013 remained stable due to efforts to reduce deficit spending. Adjusted for inflation, funding in constant dollars was below FY2009 levels. In FY2011, Congress reduced foreign affairs spending to meet deficit reduction goals, leading to stable funding levels in FY2012 and FY2013. Adjusted for inflation, funding in constant dollars was below FY2009 levels. State-Foreign Operations appropriations for the past decade are shown in Table 2 and Figure 3, while appropriations for the State Department and related agencies are shown in Table 3 and Figure 4. State-Foreign Operations appropriations were below FY2009 levels, with a spike in foreign aid in 2004 but only a slight increase in State Department funding. Recent years show an upward trend in State Department and related agencies funding, reflecting efforts by the George W. Bush and Obama Administrations to increase human resource capacity. In 2004, there was a spike in foreign aid, but State Department funding only slightly increased. Recent years have seen a steeper upward trend in State Department and related agencies funding, reflecting efforts by the George W. Bush and Obama Administrations to increase human resource capacity. Appropriations for Foreign Operations in the foreign affairs budget have also shown a similar trend over the past decade. Appropriations for Foreign Operations in the foreign affairs budget have shown a similar trend over the past decade, with foreign aid funding levels off in FY2012 and FY2013. Israel and Egypt typically received the largest amounts of U.S. foreign aid every year since the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978. Foreign aid funding levels off in FY2012 and FY2013, with Israel and Egypt historically receiving the largest amounts of U.S. foreign aid. Reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan have also been significant, with Iraq seeing a decline in assistance in recent years. Pakistan has seen an increase in aid, aimed at limiting the appeal of extremist organizations. In 1978, the Camp David Peace Accords were signed. Iraq and Afghanistan have received significant reconstruction efforts, moving them into the top five aid recipients. Pakistan has also moved up the list due to security and economic aid to combat extremist organizations. The top five aid recipients in FY2013 were the same as in FY2012, with Israel receiving the most aid at $3,100 million in Foreign Military Financing. Pakistan's ranking has increased due to aid for combating extremist organizations. The top five aid recipients in FY2013 remained the same as FY2012, with Israel receiving the most aid. Afghanistan and Pakistan received temporary OCO appropriations, with Afghanistan receiving the majority of aid within ESF. Iraq moved up to fourth place in FY2013. In FY2013, Afghanistan ranked second with $2,505 million requested, including $1,237.9 million in OCO funds. Pakistan ranked third at $2,228 million, with $800 million for PCCF. Iraq moved up to fourth place with $2,045 million, of which $1,750 million was OCO money. Aid to Africa would have declined by 10% to $6.4 billion, while aid to the Near East would have increased by 12% to $9.0 billion in the FY2013 budget request. In FY2013, aid to Africa would have declined by 10% to $6.4 billion, while aid to the Near East would have increased by 12% to $9.0 billion. South Central Asia would have seen a 6% increase to $5.3 billion, with 88% of the aid requested for war-related costs in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Israel and Iraq received significant assistance, with Israel receiving $3.1 billion and Iraq receiving $2.0 billion. In FY2013, aid to Africa declined by 10% to $6.4 billion, while aid to the Near East increased by 12% to $9.0 billion. South Central Asia saw a 6% increase to $5.3 billion, with 88% of the aid requested for war-related costs in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Israel, Iraq, Egypt, and Jordan received significant assistance in the Near East region. In FY2013, aid to Israel, Iraq, Egypt, and Jordan increased, while aid to Colombia decreased. Europe and Eurasia saw a decline due to progress in the region. Aid to East Asia and Pacific remained consistent. Congress has shown interest in various aid sectors like education and health. In FY2013, aid to East Asia and Pacific remained consistent with past levels. Congress has expressed interest in discrete aid sectors like education, trade capacity, maternal and child health, and biodiversity. Administrations now include a section in budget requests addressing these key interest areas, but allocation data was not provided for comparison to previous enacted levels. Comparing past and present requested funds can provide insights. The Administration's budget requests for FY2012 and FY2013 show a decrease in funding for key interest areas, with FY2013 request being lower for all sectors except five compared to FY2012. Allocation data was not provided for comparison to previous enacted levels. The Administration's FY2013 budget request for key interest areas showed declines compared to FY2012, with reduced funding requests for sectors such as Food Security, Global Climate Change, Sustainable Landscapes, Neglected Tropical Diseases, Nutrition, Maternal and Child Health, and Higher Education. The Administration's FY2013 budget request saw declines in funding for key interest areas, including Food Security, Global Climate Change, Sustainable Landscapes, Neglected Tropical Diseases, Nutrition, Maternal and Child Health, and Higher Education. Increased funding was emphasized for Gender Funding and Science, Technology, and Innovation. In FY2013, the Administration increased funding for Gender Funding and Science, Technology, and Innovation, while funding for key interest areas like Food Security and Global Climate Change declined. The budget also focused on Maternal and Child Health, Higher Education, Clean Energy, and Basic Education."
