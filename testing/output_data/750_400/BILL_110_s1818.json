    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Missing Mercury in Manufacturing Monitoring and Mitigation Act\". Congress finds that mercury and mercury compounds are highly toxic to humans, ecosystems, and wildlife. Approximately 10 percent of women of childbearing age in the United States have mercury in their bloodstreams at levels that could harm their unborn babies. Additionally, around 630,000 children born annually in the United States are at risk of neurological issues due to mercury exposure in utero. The main source of mercury exposure in the United States is through consuming mercury-contaminated fish. The long-term solution to mercury pollution is essential. 630,000 children born annually in the United States are at risk of neurological problems from mercury exposure in utero, with ingestion of mercury-contaminated fish being the main source. The long-term solution to mercury pollution is to minimize global mercury use and releases to reduce contamination levels in the environment. Uncontaminated fish is a critical and healthy source of nutrition worldwide. To reduce mercury pollution, it is essential to minimize global mercury use and releases, aiming for lower contamination levels in the environment. Uncontaminated fish is a vital and healthy source of nutrition worldwide. Additionally, an estimated 24,000 to 30,000 tons of mercury are used at mercury cell chlor-alkali plants globally, contributing to transboundary pollution that affects bodies of water near industrial areas. An estimated additional 24,000 to 30,000 tons of mercury are used at mercury cell chlor-alkali plants worldwide, leading to transboundary pollution affecting bodies of water near industrial areas like the Great Lakes and remote areas such as the Arctic Circle. In the United States, only 8 out of approximately 30 chlorine-producing plants still use the outdated \"mercury cell\" process, with 5 plants yet to commit to phasing out mercury use. Only 8 out of 30 chlorine-producing plants in the US use the outdated \"mercury cell\" process, with 5 plants not committed to phasing out mercury. Only 10% of chlorine and caustic soda in the US comes from these plants, despite cost-effective alternatives being available. The outdated \"mercury cell\" process is used in only 8 out of 30 chlorine-producing plants in the US. Cost-effective alternatives are available for the remaining 90% of chlorine and caustic soda production. Other countries like Japan have already banned the mercury cell process due to contamination risks. The chlor-alkali industry acknowledges the risk of mercury contamination in products from mercury cell facilities. The chlor-alkali industry acknowledges the risk of mercury contamination in products from mercury cell facilities, despite the quantities of mercury known to have been used or in use. The chlor-alkali industry recognizes the risk of mercury contamination in products from mercury cell facilities, leading to direct and indirect mercury release. However, there is a lack of accountability for mercury disposition and accurate estimation of current emissions. It is crucial for the US to aggressively work towards reducing supply, demand, and emissions of mercury. The United States must address the lack of accountability for mercury disposition and accurate estimation of emissions to minimize mercury supply, demand, and releases domestically and internationally. Congress declares that the United States should develop policies to reduce mercury use and emissions, including reducing exposures to mercury for women of childbearing age and young children. Additionally, amendments are proposed to the Toxic Substances Control Act to address the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. SEC. 4. USE OF MERCURY IN CHLORINE AND CAUSTIC SODA MANUFACTURING. Amendment to the Toxic Substances Control Act to regulate mercury use in these industries. The manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells is prohibited in the United States starting January 1, 2012. Definitions for terms like chlor-alkali facility, hazardous waste, and solid waste are provided in this section. Reporting requirements are also outlined, with a deadline of April 1, 2008. The manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells is prohibited in the United States from January 1, 2012. Reporting requirements for chlor-alkali facilities include submitting a report on mercury-containing substances annually until April 1, 2012. The owner or operator of each chlor-alkali facility must submit a report annually to the Administrator and the State identifying the type and quantity of mercury-containing waste generated, the mercury content of the waste, and how each waste was managed. The chlor-alkali facility must report annually on the type and quantity of mercury-containing waste generated, its mercury content, how each waste was managed, and the volume of mercury released into the air or water.
