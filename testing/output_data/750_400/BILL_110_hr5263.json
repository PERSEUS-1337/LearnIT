    "content": "The Forest Landscape Restoration Act may be cited as the official title of this legislation. The purpose of the Act is outlined in section 2. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act aims to promote collaborative ecosystem restoration in priority forest landscapes by encouraging sustainability, leveraging local and national resources, reducing wildfire management costs, and demonstrating the effectiveness of ecological restoration techniques. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act promotes collaborative ecosystem restoration in priority forest landscapes by reducing wildfire risk, demonstrating ecological restoration techniques' effectiveness, and utilizing forest restoration byproducts to offset costs and benefit rural economies. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act defines key terms such as \"covered Federal lands,\" \"Fund,\" \"program,\" and \"Secretaries\" for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act defines key terms for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program is established by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to fund ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes. Activities must comply with the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. Eligibility criteria are required for nomination and selection under the program. The program requires compliance with the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. Eligibility criteria for nomination and funding include a complete landscape restoration strategy with identified ecological treatments for a 10-year period. To be selected and funded under the program, a collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must have a complete landscape restoration strategy that prioritizes ecological treatments for a 10-year period across a landscape of at least 50,000 acres, primarily forested Federal lands but may include other types of land in need of ecosystem restoration. The collaborative forest landscape restoration program requires a landscape of at least 50,000 acres primarily forested Federal lands, in need of ecosystem restoration, and accessible by wood-processing infrastructure for using woody biomass. The collaborative forest landscape restoration program focuses on restoring ecosystems on at least 50,000 acres of primarily forested Federal lands.

Annual performance reporting is also required. The plan includes maintaining or decommissioning roads, using woody biomass from landscape restoration projects, and reporting annually on performance. Additionally, it involves developing small business incubators and providing employment and training opportunities in rural communities. The plan involves developing small business incubators and providing employment and training opportunities in rural communities through various entities and partnerships. The plan aims to create employment and training opportunities in rural communities through local entities, Youth Conservation Corps crews, small businesses, and other hiring or training entities. It considers community wildfire protection plans. The plan focuses on creating job opportunities in rural areas through local entities, small businesses, and other hiring/training entities. It also considers community wildfire protection plans and analyzes cost savings from reduced wildfire management costs and lower unit costs for ecological restoration treatments. The proposal under Public Law 108-148 aims to analyze cost savings from reduced wildfire management and lower unit costs for ecological restoration treatments. It estimates annual Federal funding needed and the amount of new non-Federal investment leveraged by Federal funding for ecological restoration. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal aims to implement the proposal with new non-Federal investment leveraged by Federal funding for ecological restoration treatments. The proposal must also meet any other requirements determined necessary by the Secretaries for efficient administration. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must be submitted to the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service Region for each State where the Federal lands are located. State Directors or Regional Foresters can nominate the proposal. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must be submitted to the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service Region for each State where the Federal lands are located. State Directors or Regional Foresters can nominate the proposal for selection by the Secretaries. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals are submitted to the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service Region for each State. State Directors or Regional Foresters nominate the proposals for selection by the Secretaries, including a proposal to use Federal funds for planning and implementation. The State Directors or Regional Foresters nominate collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals for selection by the Secretaries, including a proposal to use Federal funds for ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands. The State Directors or Regional Foresters nominate collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals for selection by the Secretaries, including a proposal to use Federal funds for ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands. The costs of planning and carrying out ecological restoration treatments on covered Federal lands consistent with the landscape restoration strategy would be covered by amounts transferred to the Secretaries from the Fund. Amounts proposed to be transferred to the Secretaries from the Fund during the first 2 years following selection would be used for ecological restoration treatments. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must provide evidence that funds transferred to the Secretaries from the Fund will be used for ecological restoration treatments consistent with the landscape restoration strategy within the same fiscal year. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must include evidence that funds transferred to the Secretaries will be used for restoration treatments consistent with the landscape strategy within the same fiscal year. If activities are proposed on non-Secretaries' land, the State Director or Regional Forester must provide evidence of the landowner's approval. The restoration proposal requires evidence of funding and landowner approval for activities on non-covered Federal land. The selection process involves consultation with scientific and technical advisory panels. The Secretaries will select collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals that have been nominated and meet eligibility criteria after consulting with advisory panels. The Secretaries will select collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals nominated and meeting eligibility criteria, giving special consideration to ecological case strength and proposed restoration strategies.
