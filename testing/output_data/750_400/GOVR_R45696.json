    "content": "The report analyzes forest management provisions in the 115th Congress, comparing them with prior laws. Enacted through two legislative vehicles, the Stephen Sepp Wildfire Suppression Funding and Forest Management Activities Act and the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, both laws address forest management from three general perspectives. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill included provisions for forest management on federal lands. The focus is on managing forested federal land, federal programs for forest management on nonfederal lands, and forestry research programs. This report primarily focuses on provisions related to the management of forested federal land by the Forest Service (FS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). FS manages 193 million acres of the National Forest System (NFS), while BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands. The report discusses the management of forested federal land by the Forest Service (FS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), covering laws like the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA). FS manages 193 million acres of the National Forest System (NFS), while BLM oversees 246 million acres of public lands. The report provides an overview of laws governing forest management activities by the Forest Service (FS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) on federal lands. It discusses provisions enacted by the 115th Congress affecting project planning, wildland fire management, and forest management activities. The report summarizes provisions enacted by the 115th Congress affecting project planning, wildland fire management, and forest management activities for the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management on federal lands. It covers categories such as project planning, wildland fire management, forest management and restoration programs, and miscellaneous issues, discussing changes made and potential concerns for Congress. The report covers provisions enacted by the 115th Congress related to project planning, wildland fire management, forest management, and restoration programs. It discusses changes made in each category and potential issues for Congress to consider. The report also includes side-by-side tables comparing forest-related provisions in each law to prior law. The report covers provisions enacted by the 115th Congress related to project planning, wildland fire management, forest management, and restoration programs. Approximately 145 million acres of the 193-million-acre National Forest System consists of forests and woodlands, with Congress directing management to protect watersheds and provide a continuous timber supply for US citizens. The Appendix contains side-by-side tables comparing forest-related provisions in each law to prior law. Approximately 145 million acres of the 193-million-acre National Forest System consists of forests and woodlands. Congress directed management to protect watersheds, provide a continuous timber supply for US citizens, and authorized the sale of trees. Multiple uses of national forests were added in the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960. The Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 expanded the authorized uses of national forests to include recreation, livestock grazing, energy and mineral development, and protection of wildlife and fish habitat, in addition to watershed protection and timber production. Management is to be coordinated for multiple use and sustained yield, without necessarily maximizing dollar returns or managing any one area for all uses. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA) requires the Forest Service to prepare and update comprehensive land and resource management plans for each National Forest System unit, developed and revised with public involvement. Plans must consider multiple use and sustained yield, maintaining resource outputs without impairing land productivity. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA) mandates the Forest Service to create and update land and resource management plans for each National Forest System unit with public involvement. Plans must ensure resource outputs without harming land productivity and comply with laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. The Forest Service must comply with laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA when creating and updating land management plans for National Forest System units with public involvement. Forest plans describe desired resource conditions but do not authorize specific on-the-ground actions. Projects, such as timber harvests and trail maintenance, implement the forest plan for a specific site. The Forest Service must comply with laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA when creating and updating land management plans for National Forest System units with public involvement. Forest plans broadly describe desired resource conditions but do not authorize specific on-the-ground actions. Projects, such as timber harvests and trail maintenance, implement the forest plan for a specific site, ensuring compliance with applicable requirements. Projects on public lands managed by the Forest Service must align with forest plans' resource objectives and follow FS procedures to ensure compliance with laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands, with approximately 38 million acres being woodlands and forests. BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands, primarily in the western United States, with approximately 38 million acres being woodlands and forests. These lands are governed by the principles of multiple use and sustained yield under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), similar to the NFS. The 2.6 million acres of Oregon and California Railroad (O&C) Lands and Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR) Lands in western Oregon are forested. The 2.6 million acres of Oregon and California Railroad (O&C) Lands and Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR) Lands in western Oregon are forested lands managed for permanent forest production under sustained yield principles, providing timber, protecting watersheds, offering recreational opportunities, and supporting local economies. BLM in western Oregon manages forested lands for permanent forest production, sustained yield, timber provision, watershed protection, recreation, and economic stability. Activities must align with resource management plans and comply with applicable laws. BLM in western Oregon manages forested lands for various purposes, including permanent forest production, sustained yield, timber provision, watershed protection, recreation, and economic stability. To ensure compliance with applicable laws, BLM must prepare and maintain resource management plans, revise them as needed, and ensure that on-the-ground activities align with these plans and comply with laws such as NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. NEPA requires federal agencies to assess the environmental impacts of proposed actions before making final decisions. Compliance with NEPA depends on the level of impacts of the proposed action. NEPA requires federal agencies to assess environmental impacts of proposed actions before final decisions. Compliance depends on the level of impacts, leading to preparation of EIS or EA to determine significance. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to assess environmental impacts of proposed actions before final decisions. Actions that would significantly affect the \"quality of the human environment\" require the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) leading to a Record of Decision. If impacts are uncertain, an agency may prepare an environmental assessment (EA) to determine the need for an EIS or a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) through a Decision Notice. Agencies must evaluate impacts of proposed actions and alternatives, including taking no action. The analysis in the EIS or EA/FONSI informs the agency's decision-making process. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to assess environmental impacts of proposed actions before final decisions. Actions that significantly affect the environment may require an environmental impact statement (EIS) leading to a Record of Decision. Agencies evaluate impacts and alternatives, including a no-action alternative, through an environmental assessment (EA) or a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) in a Decision Notice. Categorical exclusions (CEs) are actions with no significant environmental effects, identified based on past experience. Under NEPA regulations, categorical exclusions (CEs) are actions with no significant environmental effects and do not require an EIS or an EA. CEs are identified based on past experience and some are established in statute by Congress. Agencies may determine additional documentation needed for a CE. FS distinguishes between CEs that do not require further documentation. In its list of CEs, FS distinguishes between actions that generally do not require further documentation and those that generally require a decision memorandum as part of an administrative record supporting the decision to approve the proposal as a CE. Each federal agency has identified actions that normally require an EIS or an EA in their agency-specific procedures implementing NEPA. In their agency-specific procedures implementing NEPA, federal agencies identify actions that require an EIS, EA resulting in a FONSI, or can be approved using a CE. FS and BLM regulations also address resource conditions where an excluded action may have significant environmental effects, necessitating further analysis in an EA or EIS. The presence of extraordinary circumstances, such as flood plains, municipal watersheds, endangered species habitats, wilderness areas, roadless areas, and archaeological sites, may require further analysis in an EA or EIS instead of using a CE for certain projects. The presence of extraordinary circumstances like flood plains, municipal watersheds, endangered species habitats, wilderness areas, roadless areas, and archaeological sites may prevent the use of a CE for eligible projects. NEPA's process helps identify environmental impacts and requirements for projects, serving as an umbrella compliance process. The NEPA process helps identify environmental impacts and requirements for projects, serving as an umbrella compliance process for additional environmental review and consultation requirements under ESA and NHPA. Compliance with NEPA may trigger additional environmental review and consultation requirements under other laws if waived for a given category of action. The NEPA process identifies project impacts that may trigger additional environmental review and consultation requirements under ESA and NHPA. Compliance with NEPA may be waived for certain actions, but requirements under other federal laws would still apply. HFRA aims to expedite planning for hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration projects on NFS and BLM lands to reduce wildfire risk. HFRA was intended to expedite planning for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS and BLM lands to reduce wildfire risk by defining specific projects and authorizing an expedited planning process. The Hazardous Fuels Reduction Act (HFRA) aims to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires by modifying biomass availability that fuels wildland fires. It authorizes expedited planning for projects covering up to 20 million acres of federal land, defining terms like At-Risk Community. The Hazardous Fuels Reduction Act (HFRA) authorizes projects covering up to 20 million acres of federal land, defining terms like At-Risk Community as areas prone to large-scale wildfires. Authorized Hazardous Fuels Reduction Projects (HFRA Projects) involve methods such as prescribed fire, wildland fire use, and mechanical methods to reduce hazardous fuels. Fire Regimes and Condition Classes are terms used to describe changes in fire risk levels. Authorized Hazardous Fuels Reduction Projects (HFRA Projects) involve methods like prescribed fire, wildland fire use, and mechanical methods for reducing hazardous fuels. Fire Regimes and Condition Classes are terms used to prioritize and assess these projects based on historical fire patterns. The Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) is an area near at-risk communities. The Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) is an area near at-risk communities where Hazardous Fuels Reduction Projects (HFRA Projects) may be conducted. Fire Regimes and Condition Classes are used to prioritize and assess these projects based on historical fire patterns. HFRA projects can be conducted in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) near at-risk communities with a Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP) or in areas with specified characteristics like steep slopes. Projects are also allowed in municipal watersheds with moderate or significant departure from historical fire regimes, on damaged land, or lands with threatened species habitat at risk of wildfire. Designated wilderness areas are explicitly excluded from HFRA projects. HFRA projects must adhere to specific criteria and cannot take place in designated wilderness areas. They focus on thinning, prescribed fire, or other activities to address issues like wind, ice, insect, or disease damage. HFRA projects must adhere to specific criteria and cannot take place in designated wilderness areas. They focus on thinning, prescribed fire, or removing small-diameter trees to modify fire behavior, while maximizing large or old-growth tree retention. An objection process is established for proposed HFRA projects. The HFRA projects must focus on thinning, prescribed fire, or removing small-diameter trees to modify fire behavior, while maximizing large or old-growth tree retention. An objection process is established for proposed HFRA projects, allowing objections to be filed within 30 days of the agency's publication of draft decision documents. The HFRA projects focus on thinning, prescribed fire, or removing small-diameter trees to modify fire behavior. An objection process allows objections to be filed within 30 days of the agency's publication of draft decision documents. Objections are limited to parties that submitted specific comments during the comment periods and may only be on issues raised within those comments. If no comments were received on a project, no objections will be accepted. Judicial review is available if the objector is not satisfied after the administrative review process. HFRA requires objections to be based on issues raised in comments during the public comment periods. If no comments were received, objections will not be accepted. Judicial review in federal court is available if the objector remains unsatisfied after the administrative review process. Only issues raised during the public comment period and administrative review can be considered during judicial proceedings. The next step after the administrative review process is judicial review in federal court, where only issues raised during public comments and the review process can be considered. Congress directed FS to use the pre-decisional objection process for all projects, with some differences between HFRA and non-HFRA projects. The Chief of the Forest Service can declare a non-HFRA project an emergency situation. The post-decisional administrative appeals process for non-HFRA projects is now aligned with the pre-decisional objection process for HFRA projects. All FS projects follow the same objection process, with differences between HFRA and non-HFRA projects. The Chief of the Forest Service can declare a non-HFRA project an emergency and proceed directly to implementation. The 2014 farm bill authorized landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS. The 2014 farm bill authorized landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS based on declining forest health, risk of tree mortality, or hazard trees posing a safety risk. Non-HFRA projects can be declared emergencies and implemented without delay. The 2014 farm bill authorized landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS based on declining forest health, risk of tree mortality, or hazard trees posing a safety risk. Approximately 74.5 million acres nationwide have been designated as insect and disease treatment areas by the Forest Service. These areas may prioritize projects to reduce the risk of insect or disease infestations and increase resilience. The Forest Service has designated approximately 74.5 million acres nationwide as insect and disease treatment areas. Projects within these areas aim to reduce the risk of infestations and increase resilience. Projects initiated before the end of FY2018 are considered hazardous fuel reduction projects and are subject to HFRA regulations. Collaboration with state, local, and tribal governments is required for project development. The Forest Service has designated 74.5 million acres as insect and disease treatment areas to reduce infestation risks and increase resilience. Projects initiated before FY2018 are hazardous fuel reduction projects subject to HFRA regulations, requiring collaboration with governments. Projects in the WUI must analyze proposed actions and one alternative. The Forest Service designates acres for insect and disease treatment to reduce risks and increase resilience. Projects in the WUI require analysis of proposed actions and one alternative, while projects outside the WUI must consider the no-action alternative as well. Congress authorized FS to identify eligible areas for projects. The Forest Service is authorized to designate NFS areas for insect and disease treatment projects, prioritizing and implementing them through an expedited process. In at-risk communities within 1.5 miles, only the proposed action needs analysis, while projects outside the WUI must consider the no-action alternative. The Forest Service is authorized to designate NFS areas for insect and disease treatment projects through an expedited process. As of March 2019, 206 projects across 59 national forests and 18 states have been proposed under these authorities, with some undergoing EA or EIS analysis procedures. The remaining projects are processed using a CE. The Forest Service has proposed 206 projects across 59 national forests and 18 states for insect and disease treatment. Some projects are undergoing EA or EIS analysis, while the rest are processed using a CE. The 2014 farm bill added a new Section 603 to HFRA, specifying certain projects as categorically excluded from NEPA requirements. The 2014 farm bill added Section 603 to HFRA, categorically excluding certain projects from NEPA requirements. Projects eligible for the Farm Bill CE must comply with specific criteria and are exempt from the administrative review objections process. The 2018 farm bill added hazardous fuels projects as a priority category for implementation through the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) or by considering the best available science. These projects are exempt from the pre-decisional administrative review objections process. In order to receive funding under the 2014 Farm Bill CE, projects must meet eligibility requirements of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) or consider the best available science. They should prioritize retaining old-growth and large trees for insect and disease resiliency, involve a transparent collaborative process, and avoid establishing new permanent roads. Temporary roads must be removed within three years of project completion, with maintenance allowed on existing roads as needed. Projects seeking funding under the 2014 Farm Bill CE must prioritize old-growth and large trees for resiliency, involve a transparent collaborative process, and avoid establishing new permanent roads. Temporary roads must be removed within three years of project completion, with maintenance allowed on existing roads as needed. Projects cannot exceed 3,000 acres and must be located within designated I&D areas or in areas classified as Condition Classes 2 or 3 in Fire Regime Group I, II, or III. Projects seeking funding under the 2014 Farm Bill CE must prioritize old-growth and large trees for resiliency, involve a transparent collaborative process, and avoid establishing new permanent roads. Temporary roads must be removed within three years of project completion, with maintenance allowed on existing roads as needed. Projects cannot exceed 3,000 acres and must be located within designated I&D areas or in areas classified as Condition Classes 2 or 3 in Fire Regime Group I, II, or III. FS policy requires documenting decisions using the Farm Bill CE through a decision memorandum, considering resource conditions for extraordinary circumstances. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill expanded HFRA authorities for FS and BLM planning and project implementation. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill expanded HFRA authorities for FS and BLM planning and project implementation, amending HFRA to include fuel reduction and fire breaks. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill expanded HFRA authorities by amending the definition of authorized fuel reduction projects to include fuel breaks and fire breaks. Projects can now be planned and implemented using HFRA procedures, including analyzing alternatives based on the project's location. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the use of procedures to expedite priority projects in I&D areas, including hazardous fuels reduction projects planned and implemented using the Farm Bill CE. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized procedures to expedite priority projects in I&D areas, including hazardous fuels reduction projects. It also established new statutory CEs to streamline planning processes and made changes to interagency consultation requirements under the Endangered Species Act. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill established new statutory CEs to expedite specific projects, such as wildfire resilience for FS and projects related to sage grouse or mule deer habitat for both FS and BLM. The 2018 farm bill also made changes to interagency consultation requirements under the Endangered Species Act. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill introduced statutory CEs for wildfire resilience projects for FS and projects related to sage grouse or mule deer habitat for FS and BLM. These new CEs aim to expedite project planning and implementation, but their potential impact on forest management goals remains uncertain. The new statutory CEs introduced in the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill aim to expedite project planning and implementation for wildfire resilience projects for FS and projects related to sage grouse or mule deer habitat for FS and BLM. The potential impact of these new CEs on forest management goals remains uncertain. The provisions of each CE share similarities with the Farm Bill CE, allowing for larger projects to be planned (up to 3,000 to 4,500 acres) through a CE. Some believe that larger project sizes will help FS achieve landscape-level goals more efficiently, while using a CE for environmental review may speed up project planning and implementation. Bill CE\u2014allow FS (and BLM, as applicable) to plan for larger projects (up to 3,000 to 4,500 acres) through a CE. Larger project sizes could help FS achieve landscape-level goals more efficiently. Using a CE for environmental review may speed up project planning and implementation, improving agency efficiency. The 2014 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that FS took 177 days to complete CEs, compared to 565 days for EAs in FY2012. FS used CEs less frequently from FY2008 to FY2012, but trends may have changed since then. Concerns exist about conducting large projects without detailed environmental reviews, which could lead to potential issues. The 2014 GAO report found that FS took 177 days to complete CEs, compared to 565 days for EAs in FY2012. Concerns exist about conducting large projects without detailed environmental reviews, which could lead to potential issues. Section 202 of the FY2018 omnibus added a Wildfire Resilience CE for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS lands. The Wildfire Resilience CE, established in Section 202 of the FY2018 omnibus, is similar to the Farm Bill CE and is for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS lands. Projects must be located within designated I&D areas and must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements. The decision to use the Farm Bill CE must be documented through a decision memo after assessing for any significant environmental effects. Eligible projects aim to maximize fuel retention. The Farm Bill CE is used for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS lands, following specific eligibility requirements. Projects must aim to retain old-growth and large trees for resiliency, based on collaborative and transparent processes. No new permanent roads can be established, and temporary roads must be decommissioned within three years. Projects under the Farm Bill CE must retain old-growth and large trees for resiliency, follow collaborative processes, and limit project size to 3,000 acres. No new permanent roads are allowed, and temporary roads must be removed within three years. Maintenance of existing roads is permitted. The Farm Bill CE mandates projects to preserve old-growth trees, limit size to 3,000 acres, and remove temporary roads within three years. Projects in WUI areas are prioritized, but those in high wildfire hazard areas are also eligible. The Secretary must report annually on CE usage to congressional committees and GAO. Seven projects were proposed under this provision. The Wildfire Resilience CE allows projects in high wildfire hazard areas classified as Condition Class 2 or 3 in Fire Regime groups I, II, or III. The Secretary must report annually on CE usage to congressional committees and GAO. Seven projects were proposed under this provision in FY2018. The Wildfire Resilience CE allows projects in high wildfire hazard areas classified as Condition Class 2 or 3 in Fire Regime groups I, II, or III. Seven projects were proposed under this provision in FY2018, meeting location and purpose requirements similar to those under the 2014 Farm Bill CE. The Wildfire Resilience CE prioritizes projects in high wildfire hazard areas and within the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI), while the Farm Bill CE does not prioritize WUI projects. The Wildfire Resilience CE is for hazardous fuels reduction projects, while the Farm Bill CE also covers projects for insect and disease infestation. Congress directed the Forest Service to apply specific evaluation procedures for the Wildfire Resilience CE. The Wildfire Resilience CE prioritizes projects in high wildfire hazard areas and within the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI), while the Farm Bill CE does not prioritize WUI projects. The Wildfire Resilience CE is for hazardous fuels reduction projects, while the Farm Bill CE also covers projects for insect and disease infestation. Congress directed the Forest Service to apply specific evaluation procedures for the Wildfire Resilience CE, but similar legislative language was not included for the Farm Bill CE. The Forest Service must evaluate if extraordinary circumstances are present on the project site, which may require further analysis through an EA or EIS. The Farm Bill CE also requires assessment for extraordinary circumstances that may preclude its use. Section 8611 of the 2018 farm bill establishes a CE for projects to protect sage-grouse and mule-deer on NFS and BLM lands. The Farm Bill CE requires assessment for extraordinary circumstances that may preclude its use for projects to protect sage-grouse and mule-deer on NFS and BLM lands, as directed by Section 8611 of the 2018 farm bill. The Farm Bill CE specifies requirements for projects to protect, restore, or improve sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat in a sagebrush steppe ecosystem. Projects must align with resource management plans and DOI Secretarial Order 3336 for BLM lands. Specific activities include removing nonnative vegetation, managing vegetation with livestock grazing, and targeted herbicide use. The law requires projects to align with existing resource management plans and DOI Secretarial Order 3336 for BLM lands. Specific activities include removing nonnative vegetation, managing vegetation with livestock grazing, and targeted herbicide use. Projects are restricted from designated wilderness areas, inventoried roadless areas, or areas where vegetation removal is prohibited. No new permanent roads are allowed, but existing roads can be repaired, and temporary roads must be decommissioned. Projects must align with resource management plans and Secretarial Order 3336 for BLM lands. Activities include removing nonnative vegetation, managing vegetation with livestock grazing, and targeted herbicide use. Projects are restricted from wilderness areas, inventoried roadless areas, or where vegetation removal is prohibited. No new permanent roads allowed, only repair existing roads, and decommission temporary roads within three years. Projects limited to 4,500 acres on NFS lands within designated I&D areas. Agencies must apply extraordinary circumstances procedures when using the CE. Temporary roads on NFS lands must be decommissioned within three years of project completion or when no longer needed. Projects are limited to 4,500 acres and can only occur within designated I&D areas. Agencies must consider various factors before using the CE, including landscape-scale habitat projects, population declines, and habitat restoration. A 20-year monitoring plan must be developed prior to using the CE. The law directs agencies to consider landscape-scale habitat projects, population declines, and habitat restoration before using the CE. A 20-year monitoring plan is required. The CE differs from other CEs in project purposes and requirements. The Endangered Species Act aims to conserve endangered species and their ecosystems. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to conserve endangered species and their ecosystems, administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Individual species can be listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to protect endangered species and their ecosystems. Species can be listed as endangered or threatened based on the risk of extinction, with a set of prohibitions applying once listed. Federal agencies can seek exemptions from these prohibitions under certain circumstances. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows for species to be listed as endangered or threatened based on extinction risk. Federal agencies must ensure their actions do not harm listed species or their habitats. Federal agencies must ensure that their actions do not harm endangered or threatened species or their critical habitat. They must consult with FWS or NMFS if an action may adversely affect a listed species. This consultation, known as a Section 7 consultation, is not required for actions dictated by statute. If an action is found to not jeopardize a species, a consultation is not needed. The Section 7 consultation is required when a federal action may affect a listed species. If the action is found to not jeopardize the species or its critical habitat, a biological opinion is issued with terms for the action to proceed safely. The Secretary issues a biological opinion specifying terms for federal actions to proceed safely if they do not harm a species or its critical habitat. Consultations mostly result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or suggest reasonable alternatives to avoid harm to species. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to this process. The Secretary must suggest alternatives to avoid harm to species when listing species or modifying critical habitat. Most consultations result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or propose reasonable alternatives for projects to proceed. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to how Section 7 consultation requirements interact with land and resource management plans for NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands in Oregon. The FY2018 omnibus enacted changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land and resource management plans in Oregon. It specifies that listing a species as threatened or endangered does not require consultation to update a forest plan, unless it is over 15 years old and 5 years have passed since listing. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for forest plans in Oregon, stating that consultation is not needed to update a plan for listed species unless it's over 15 years old and 5 years have passed since listing. This has sparked controversy as it may set a new precedent for ESA implementation. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for forest plans in Oregon, stating that consultation is not needed to update a plan for listed species unless it's over 15 years old and 5 years have passed since listing. This has sparked controversy as it may set a new precedent for ESA implementation. The law further specifies that this does not affect the requirements for Section 7 consultation for projects implementing forest plans or for plan updates or amendments. The changes in the FY2018 omnibus are controversial, as some argue that they override a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals regarding re-consultation on land management plans after critical habitat designation for the Canada lynx. Those in favor of the changes argue that not requiring Section 7 consultations for existing land management plans due to a species listing or critical habitat designation is necessary. Provisions were enacted to override a Ninth Circuit Court decision requiring re-consultation on land management plans after critical habitat designation for the Canada lynx. Supporters argue that exempting existing plans from Section 7 consultations due to species listing or critical habitat designation allows for flexibility, consistency, and fewer delays in plan implementation. Exceptions in the law permit plan changes reflecting listed species and habitat alterations over time. The species listing or critical habitat designation exemptions in the law aim to provide flexibility, consistency, and fewer delays in plan implementation. Opponents argue that not allowing for consultation or re-consultation could harm species if plans permit harmful activities to continue. Additionally, concerns are raised about the potential long time lag before consultation is required. Critics argue that not allowing consultation or re-consultation for changes in species listing and critical habitat could harm species if plans allow harmful activities to continue. They also raise concerns about the potential delay before consultation is required. Proponents claim that projects under a plan still undergo consultation, making plan consultation redundant. The lag before consultation could harm species and their habitat. Critics argue that plans address projects at a higher level and could impact cumulative effects. The federal government's wildland fire management responsibilities include various activities. The federal government's wildland fire management responsibilities include fuel reduction, preparedness, prevention, detection, response, suppression, and recovery activities. Recent legislation has changed how Congress appropriates funding for wildfire suppression and added requirements for wildfire risk mapping and reporting. The 2018 farm bill made changes to how Congress appropriates funding for wildfire suppression, added requirements for wildfire risk mapping and reporting, and modified aspects of hazardous fuel reduction programs. This included reauthorizing procedures to expedite priority projects in designated areas and expanding the definition of authorized fuel reduction projects. The 2018 farm bill made changes to funding for wildfire suppression, added wildfire risk mapping requirements, and modified hazardous fuel reduction programs by reauthorizing procedures for priority projects and expanding authorized fuel reduction projects. Funding is provided to the Department of the Interior, which allocates it to the Office of Wildland Fire and four agencies. Funding for wildland fire management is provided through discretionary appropriations to the Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Forest Service (FS). DOI allocates the funding to the Office of Wildland Fire and four agencies, while FS allocates it to the Suppression Operations program for controlling wildfires on federal land. This funding covers firefighter salaries, equipment, aviation operations, and incident support. Funding for wildland fire management is provided to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service through the Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Forest Service (FS). The Suppression Operations program within DOI and FS's Wildland Fire Management account funds wildfire control on federal land, covering firefighter salaries, equipment, aviation operations, and incident support. If suppression funding is depleted, DOI and FS can transfer funds from other accounts for firefighting activities, known as fire borrowing. Overall, funding for wildland fire management has increased significantly since the 1990s, with a large portion going towards rising suppression costs. The Forest Service (FS) and Department of the Interior (DOI) can transfer funds from other accounts for firefighting activities if suppression funding is exhausted, a practice known as fire borrowing. Overall, appropriations for wildland fire management have increased considerably since the 1990s, with a significant portion going towards rising suppression costs. The Forest Service (FS) and Department of the Interior (DOI) often require more suppression funds than allocated, leading to fire borrowing. Congress typically enacts supplemental appropriations to repay transferred funds and replenish wildfire accounts. Wildfire suppression funds frequently exceed appropriations, leading to fire borrowing and concerns about impacts on other agency programs. Congress has historically provided supplemental appropriations to repay transferred funds and replenish wildfire accounts. There have been discussions in the 115th Congress about exploring options for wildfire spending outside of current procedural and budgetary controls. The 115th Congress explored providing wildfire spending outside of procedural and budgetary controls. In the FY2018 omnibus, a new mechanism for suppression funding was established, known as the wildfire funding fix. Discretionary spending is currently subject to statutory limits under the Budget Control Act of 2011. In the FY2018 omnibus, the 115th Congress established the wildfire funding fix for suppression funding outside of budgetary constraints. Discretionary spending is subject to statutory limits set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. If spending exceeds a limit, sequestration enforces automatic budget authority cancellations through across-the-board reductions. Certain spending is exempt from these limits. Between FY2012 and FY2021, enacted discretionary spending cannot exceed set limits. If limits are surpassed, sequestration enforces automatic budget cuts through across-the-board reductions. Some spending is exempt from these limits, such as emergency and disaster relief funding. The FY2018 omnibus amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act to include a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations in nondefense discretionary spending limits. This adjustment applies from FY2020 to FY2027 and covers emergency and unpredictable aspects of wildland fires. The FY2018 omnibus amended BBEDCA to include a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations in nondefense discretionary spending limits starting in FY2020 through FY2027. This adjustment covers emergency aspects of wildland firefighting and includes support, response, stabilization activities, and necessary funds for repayment of any transfers. The FY2018 omnibus amended BBEDCA to include a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations in nondefense discretionary spending limits starting in FY2020 through FY2027. This adjustment covers emergency aspects of wildland firefighting, including support, response, stabilization activities, and necessary funds for repayment of any transfers. The new adjustment would apply to appropriations provided above the 10-year average spending level for wildfire suppression operations as calculated for FY2015. The amount of the adjustment is capped each fiscal year, starting at $2.25. The FY2018 omnibus amended BBEDCA to include a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations in nondefense discretionary spending limits starting in FY2020 through FY2027. This adjustment covers emergency aspects of wildland firefighting, including support, response, stabilization activities, and necessary funds for repayment of any transfers. The adjustment is capped each fiscal year, starting at $2.25 billion in FY2020 and increasing to $2.95 billion in FY2027. Any funding above the FY2015 baseline for wildfire suppression would not be subject to discretionary spending limits. The FY2018 omnibus amended BBEDCA to include a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations in nondefense discretionary spending limits starting in FY2020 through FY2027. The adjustment is capped each fiscal year, starting at $2.25 billion in FY2020 and increasing by $0.1 billion to $2.95 billion in FY2027. Congress could appropriate up to an additional $2.25 billion in FY2020 for wildfire suppression, effectively outside of the discretionary spending limits. In FY2020, Congress could appropriate up to $3.64 billion for suppression operations, exceeding the discretionary limits. This amount includes the minimum baseline of $1.39 billion and an additional $2.25 billion. In FY2019, FS and DOI received a total of $2.05 billion for suppression purposes. In FY2020, agencies could be appropriated up to $3.64 billion for wildfire suppression, exceeding discretionary limits. The wildfire funding fix removes budget process barriers for additional funds in FY2020 and FY2021. The wildfire funding fix potentially removes budget process barriers for providing additional wildfire suppression funds for FY2020 and FY2021, as the BCA statutory limits for discretionary spending are in effect only until FY2021. If new limits are established for FY2022 through FY2027, the wildfire adjustment would still apply. If no new limits are enacted, the wildfire adjustment would no longer apply, and it is uncertain if Congress will continue to provide fire borrowing authority to the agencies. The wildfire funding fix removes budget process barriers for providing additional wildfire suppression funds until FY2021. If new limits are set for FY2022-2027, the wildfire adjustment still applies. If no new limits are enacted, the adjustment no longer applies. It is unclear if Congress will continue to provide fire borrowing authority to agencies once the adjustment is in effect in FY2020. The wildfire funding fix removes budget process barriers for providing additional wildfire suppression funds until FY2021. Section 103 of the FY2018 omnibus requires the Secretary to promptly request supplemental appropriations if wildfire funds are estimated to be exhausted within 30 days, giving Congress notice of the need for additional funding. This provision requires additional action from Congress to ensure agencies have access to funds for federal services in response to wildfires. The wildfire funding fix raises concerns for Congress as the funds provided for wildfire suppression operations may be exhausted within 30 days, requiring additional action from Congress to ensure continued federal services in response to wildfires. One concern is the lack of reporting on the 10-year suppression obligation for FY2020, raising accountability and oversight issues regarding suppression spending. The wildfire funding fix raises concerns for Congress as the funds provided for suppression operations may be depleted quickly, requiring additional action. One concern is the lack of reporting on the 10-year suppression obligation for FY2020, raising accountability and oversight issues regarding spending. Another concern is that the funding fix is a temporary procedural change that does not address inflationary factors or other suppression cost forecasting issues. The FY2015 baseline and annual adjustment limits for suppression spending are not tied to inflationary factors. The wildfire funding fix is a temporary procedural change that does not address various concerns related to suppression costs, such as improving cost forecasting and evaluating suppression methods. The Fire Modeling Institute developed a Wildfire Hazard Potential index to aid in strategic planning. The Fire Modeling Institute developed a Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) index to help inform strategic planning and fuel management decisions at a national scale. The WHP index reflects the relative potential for a wildfire to occur that would be difficult to suppress or contain. The Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) index is used for strategic planning and fuel management decisions at a national scale. Approximately 226 million acres in the continental United States are classified at high or very high WHP, with 53% being federal land. Approximately 226 million acres of land in the continental United States are classified at high or very high Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP). Of these lands, 53% are federal lands, while the remaining 47% are state, tribal, other public, or private lands. High or very high WHP indicates fuels with a higher probability of extreme fire behavior under certain weather conditions. This data, when combined with spatial data, can help estimate relative wildfire risk to resources and assets. Approximately 226 million acres in the US have high or very high Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP), with 53% on federal lands and 47% on state, tribal, other public, or private lands. The WHP data, when paired with spatial data, can estimate wildfire risk to resources and assets. The FY2018 omnibus directs the Forest Service to develop web-based wildfire hazard severity maps for community use within two years. The FY2018 omnibus directs the Forest Service to develop web-based wildfire hazard severity maps for community use within two years, in consultation with federal and state partners, colleges, and universities. The omnibus also requires reports to Congress on specified topics related to wildland fire management. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill require FS and BLM to submit reports to Congress on specified topics related to wildland fire management, including annual reports within 90 days after the end of a fiscal year in which the wildfire funding fix is used. The first report may be required by December 30, 2021, if the wildfire adjustment is used in FY2020. The omnibus bill mandates annual reports on wildland fire management to be submitted to Congress within 90 days after using the wildfire funding fix. The report must detail the use of the funding fix and be prepared in consultation with the OMB Director. It will be available to the public and submitted to specific House and Senate Committees. The Secretaries must prepare annual reports on wildland fire management in consultation with the OMB Director. Reports will detail the use of the wildfire funding fix, overall spending, and factors influencing suppression decisions. Reports will be submitted to specific House and Senate Committees. The 2018 farm bill requires annual reports on wildland fire management, detailing funding use, spending, suppression decision factors, and lessons learned from large fires. The 2018 farm bill mandates annual reports on wildland fire management, analyzing significant large fires' various measures like cost drivers, fuel treatment effectiveness, and preparedness investments. Additionally, the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior must submit a joint report to Congress on wildfire prevention, insect infestation, and disease control on federal land. The 2018 farm bill requires annual reports on wildland fire management, including cost drivers and fuel treatment effectiveness. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior must submit a joint report to Congress on wildfire prevention, insect infestation, and disease control on federal land, due within 180 days of enactment and annually thereafter.

Reports include data on federal land treatment for wildfire, insect infestation, disease prevention, fire risk assessment, wildfire impact, federal response time, timber production, and road/trail maintenance needs. The annual reports mandated by the 2018 farm bill to Congress include data on federal land treatment for wildfire, insect infestation, disease prevention, fire risk assessment, wildfire impact, federal response time for large fires, timber production, and road/trail maintenance needs. Forest restoration activities aim to establish or reestablish ecosystem composition and structure. Forest restoration activities on federal land aim to establish or reestablish ecosystem composition, structure, and functioning to enhance resilience and resistance to disturbances like wildfires and insect infestations. This includes activities such as thinning trees to reduce density. Forest restoration aims to establish or reestablish ecosystem composition, structure, and functioning to enhance resilience and resistance to disturbances like wildfires and insect infestations. Activities may include thinning trees and prescribed fires to mitigate potential wildfire intensity and facilitate post-fire recovery. Forest restoration projects, authorized by BLM and FS, aim to reduce tree density and understory vegetation through activities like prescribed fires to mitigate wildfire intensity and promote post-fire recovery. The authority for conducting restoration projects is primarily derived from FLPMA for BLM and from various acts for FS, including the Organic Administration Act of 1897, MUSY, and NFMA. Congress has also authorized specific forest restoration programs for both agencies. The Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended by NFMA, authorizes specific forest restoration programs for FS and BLM. The 115th Congress established new programs for FS and amended existing programs, including the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, stewardship contracting authority, and the good neighbor authority. The 115th Congress established new programs for FS and amended existing programs, including the watershed condition framework, water source protection, Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP), stewardship contracting authority, and the good neighbor authority. These programs allow FS and BLM to partner with stakeholders for forest restoration and management activities under the \"Shared Stewardship\" approach. The FS and BLM have established programs to partner with stakeholders for forest restoration and management activities under the \"Shared Stewardship\" approach. These programs aim to address land management concerns at a landscape-scale and offer opportunities to accelerate forest restoration to mitigate insect infestations and reduce wildfire risks. Additionally, they provide potential benefits to surrounding communities by offering forest products. Title IV of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 supports programs that aim to accelerate forest restoration, mitigate insect infestations, reduce wildfire risks, and provide benefits to surrounding communities through collaboration and the promotion of forest products. Stakeholders generally support these programs, although some have raised concerns about specific aspects. The Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 established the CFLRP to fund restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes through collaboration with diverse stakeholders. Some concerns have been raised about specific aspects of the program. The Lands Management Act of 2009 established the CFLRP to fund restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes through collaboration with diverse stakeholders. Priority forest landscapes must be at least 50,000 acres and primarily consist of NFS lands in need of restoration. The collaboration process must be transparent and include multiple interested persons representing diverse interests. Proposals for Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act must focus on priority forest landscapes of at least 50,000 acres, primarily NFS lands in need of restoration. The proposals should incorporate the best available science, including projects for old-growth stand maintenance, hazardous fuel reduction, and must be accessible by wood-processing infrastructure. No new permanent roads can be established in the proposal area. Proposals for Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act must focus on priority forest landscapes of at least 50,000 acres, primarily NFS lands in need of restoration. The proposals should incorporate the best available science, including projects for old-growth stand maintenance, hazardous fuel reduction, and must be accessible by wood-processing infrastructure. No new permanent roads can be established in the proposal area. The law requires annual accomplishments and 5-year status reports to specified congressional committees. Up to 10 proposals can be selected and funded by the Secretary of Agriculture each fiscal year. The law does not allow new permanent roads and requires annual reports to Congress. The Secretary of Agriculture can select and fund up to 10 proposals each year, with 23 proposals funded since FY2010. Each proposal includes projects to achieve forest restoration goals. The law allows the Secretary of Agriculture to select and fund up to 10 proposals each year for forest restoration goals. FS has funded 23 proposals since FY2010, with each proposal including individual projects to implement restoration goals over a specified time period. The law established a fund to cover up to 50% of project costs, with annual appropriations of up to $40 million through FY2019. Selected proposals can receive up to $4 million per year for up to 10 years for project implementation. The law established a fund to cover up to 50% of project costs, with annual appropriations of up to $40 million through FY2019. Each selected proposal can receive up to $4 million per year for up to 10 years for project implementation. The program received $40 million annually in appropriations from FY2014 through FY2019 and is perceived as successful in achieving land management objectives and contributing to local economies. The CFLRP program received $40 million annually in appropriations from FY2014 through FY2019. It is perceived as successful in achieving land management objectives and contributing to local economies. The dedicated funding commitment provides long-term stability for project implementation and coordination, although it may direct resources away from NFS lands in some areas. Some find the CFLRP program valuable for its dedicated funding commitment, providing stability for project implementation. However, concerns exist about resources being directed away from certain areas. The program offers economic benefits but falls short in creating new markets for wood products and reducing treatment costs. Collaboration with community stakeholders is improving, but some feel it is not evenly distributed. Some feel the CFLRP program falls short in fostering new markets for wood products or reducing treatment costs. Collaboration with community stakeholders has improved, but progress on complex issues is lacking. Section 8629 of the 2018 farm bill reauthorized the program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the CFLRP program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023. The law allows the Secretary of Agriculture to extend funding for existing projects for up to 10 years and added the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture as recipients of program status reports. Funding for selected proposals is set to expire soon. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the CFLRP program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023. Agriculture can extend funding for existing projects for up to 10 years, with the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture receiving program status reports. Funding for selected proposals is set to expire soon, but reauthorization and extension of eligibility could allow projects to continue beyond FY2019. Congress appropriating to the new authorization level could result in more projects being funded. The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into good neighbor agreements (GNAs) with state governments for restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands. Reauthorization and extension of eligibility for selected proposals could allow projects to continue beyond FY2019, with potential for more projects to be funded if Congress appropriates to the new authorization level. The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into good neighbor agreements (GNAs) with state governments for restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands, allowing states to conduct various restoration services. The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into agreements with states for restoration work on public lands, including treating trees, reducing fuels, and improving forest health. Prohibited treatments in designated wilderness areas and did not include road construction or specify revenue treatment. The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into agreements with states for restoration work on public lands, including tree treatments and fuel reduction. Prohibited treatments in designated wilderness areas and excluded road construction or specified revenue treatment. States may perform the work, but FS and BLM must comply with federal laws and approve silvicultural prescriptions. The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter agreements with states for restoration work on public lands, including tree treatments and fuel reduction. States may perform the work, but FS and BLM retain responsibility for compliance with federal laws and approval of silvicultural prescriptions. Master Agreements (MAs) between states and FS or BLM outline the scope of the agreements, with Supplemental Project Agreements (SPAs) detailing specific terms for project implementation. FS has executed 48 MAs in 33 states and 105 SPAs in 28 states, covering 82 national forests. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) allows for agreements between states, FS, and BLM for project implementation. FS has executed 48 MAs in 33 states and 105 SPAs in 28 states, covering 82 national forests. The GNAs focus on specific project types like timber production, wildlife, hazardous fuels management, and other activities. The authority is generally seen as successful. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) allows agreements between states, FS, and BLM for project implementation, with a focus on specific project types like timber production, wildlife, hazardous fuels management, and other activities. The authority is generally perceived as successful in enhancing state-federal relationships and performing cross boundary restoration work, although funding and resource capacity varied across states. Some concerns were reported regarding the uncertainty of sustained future GNA work. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) is generally successful in enhancing state-federal relationships and performing cross boundary restoration work. Some states have concerns about sustained future GNA work. Changes to the GNA were enacted in the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill, allowing forest restoration activities to include road construction, repair, and restoration on defined NFS roads. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill made changes to the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA), allowing forest restoration activities to include road construction, repair, and restoration on defined NFS roads. The farm bill also expanded GNA availability to include federally recognized Indian tribes and county governments, with funds received from timber sales under GNA to be retained and used for additional projects through FY2023. The 2018 farm bill expanded the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) to include federally recognized Indian tribes and county governments, allowing funds from timber sales to be retained for additional projects through FY2023. This expansion has the potential to significantly increase the use of GNA and create more opportunities for cross-boundary collaboration. The farm bill expanded the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) to tribes and county governments, allowing funds from timber sales to be used for projects. This could increase cross-boundary restoration work but may also lead to increased administrative demands and concerns about revenue distribution. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) was expanded to tribes and county governments by the farm bill, allowing the use of funds from timber sales for projects. This could lead to increased cross-boundary restoration work but also raise concerns about administrative demands and revenue distribution. Stewardship end-result contracting was established as a temporary pilot program in 1999 and extended multiple times until 2013. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) was expanded to tribes and county governments by the farm bill, allowing the use of funds from timber sales for projects. Stewardship end-result contracting (stewardship contracting) was established as a temporary pilot program in 1999 and made permanent in the 2014 farm bill, enabling FS and BLM to enter into multi-year contracts to achieve land management goals. The 2014 farm bill made the Good Neighbor Authority permanent, allowing FS and BLM to enter into multi-year contracts for land management goals by combining timber sale and service contracts. The Good Neighbor Authority allows federal agencies to combine timber sale contracts with service contracts to achieve land management goals such as improving water quality, forest health, soil productivity, and wildlife habitats. The Good Neighbor Authority allows federal agencies to offset the cost of service activities by trading goods for services to achieve land management goals such as restoring water quality, improving forest health, reducing fire hazards, increasing soil productivity, restoring watersheds, maintaining wildlife habitats, and reestablishing native plant species. Any timber sale revenue exceeding the cost of contracted services can be deposited in a Stewardship Contracting Fund for future projects without further appropriation. The Good Neighbor Authority allows federal agencies to offset service costs by trading goods for services to achieve land management goals like restoring water quality, improving forest health, reducing fire hazards, increasing soil productivity, maintaining wildlife habitats, and reestablishing native plant species. Excess timber sale revenue can be deposited in a Stewardship Contracting Fund for future projects without additional appropriation. FS and BLM can award contracts based on best value, considering past performance, proposal quality, and other factors, and give procurement preference to contractors using wood products innovatively. Annual reports on project development, execution, administration, and accomplishments are required. The law allows contracts to be awarded on a best-value basis, considering past performance, proposal quality, and other factors in addition to cost. It also permits procurement preference for contractors using wood products innovatively. Annual reports on stewardship contract development, execution, administration, and accomplishments are required. Stakeholders generally view stewardship contracting favorably, reporting increased restoration opportunities and economic benefits. Stewardship contracting is generally perceived favorably among stakeholders, with increased restoration opportunities and economic benefits reported. Some concerns include the potential incentive to remove ecologically important trees for more service work. Some stakeholders express concerns about the distribution of receipts from stewardship contracts, upfront financial obligations, and the slow pace of implementation in the development of new markets for woody biomass and restoration by-products. Some stakeholders have concerns about the distribution of receipts from stewardship contracts, revenue-sharing requirements with county governments, up-front financial obligations, and the slow pace of implementation. Initial difficulties in assessing stewardship contracting were due to contract integration complexity and poor record-keeping, but agencies have since improved systems and offered more contracts. The implementation of stewardship contracting initially faced challenges due to contract integration complexity and poor record-keeping. However, agencies have since improved systems, offered more contracts annually, and covered larger areas. Despite these improvements, a 2015 USDA Office of Inspector General report identified issues with the Forest Service's contract administration and record-keeping related to stewardship contracts. Specifically, the report found non-compliance with procurement requirements in defining evaluation factors. The 2015 USDA OIG report found issues with the Forest Service's contract administration and record-keeping related to stewardship contracts. FS did not consistently comply with procurement requirements in defining evaluation factors for awarding contracts. New guidance was published in 2016 in response to the report's findings. The FY2018 omnibus authorized FS and BLM to enter into 20-year stewardship contracts or agreements. The FY2018 omnibus authorized FS and BLM to enter into 20-year stewardship contracts in areas classified in Fire Regime Groups I, II, and III. The law also allowed a procurement preference for contractors promoting innovative use of forest products. Additionally, a cancellation ceiling could be included in stewardship contracts. The law authorized FS and BLM to enter 20-year stewardship contracts in Fire Regime Groups I, II, and III areas. It also allowed a procurement preference for contractors promoting innovative forest product use and included a cancellation ceiling in contracts. Excess revenues can be used to pay outstanding liabilities from cancelled contracts. Congressional notification is required for entering stewardship contracts. The law allows FS and BLM to enter stewardship contracts with cancellation ceilings. Funds can be obligated in stages for cancellation ceilings, with excess revenues used to cover liabilities from cancelled contracts. Congressional notification is needed for contracts exceeding a $25 million cancellation ceiling without proposed funding. The FS and BLM can enter stewardship contracts with cancellation ceilings higher than $25 million without proposed funding for cancellation costs. This provision allows funds to be obligated in stages, resolving concerns about upfront financial obligations. The use of 20-year stewardship contracts and procurement preference can increase market certainty for forest products industries and promote innovation. The potential benefits of using 20-year stewardship contracts and procurement preference include resolving upfront financial obligations and increasing market certainty for forest products industries. The protection of watersheds is an authorized activity of many FS programs, but OMB cited inadequacies in FS's watershed programs in a 2006 review. The protection of watersheds is an authorized activity of many FS programs, but OMB cited inadequacies in FS's watershed programs in a 2006 assessment report, highlighting lack of water quality data and inconsistent national approach to prioritize watershed management on NFS lands. FS committed to developing long-term performance measures as part of an improvement plan. The 2006 assessment report identified deficiencies in FS's watershed programs, including lack of water quality data and inconsistent national prioritization. FS committed to developing long-term performance measures, improving data quality, and making watersheds a management priority through the Watershed Condition Framework (WCF). The Forest Service (FS) committed to improving watershed programs by developing performance measures, enhancing data quality, and prioritizing watersheds through the Watershed Condition Framework (WCF). FS classified and prioritized watersheds by 2011, initiated restoration action plans in 2013, and began implementing projects to achieve those goals. However, a 2017 USDA OIG report highlighted deficiencies in FS' management and implementation of the WCF program. The Forest Service (FS) prioritized watersheds through the Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) program, developing restoration action plans and implementing projects to achieve goals. However, a 2017 USDA OIG report identified deficiencies in FS' management and implementation of the program, including inadequate coordination and oversight at the national level, and shortcomings in record-keeping methodologies for monitoring project costs and performance towards watershed restoration. Section 8405 of the 2018 farm bill codified the WCF program in statute, assigning specific responsibilities and providing guidance. The 2018 farm bill codified the WCF program, assigning specific responsibilities to the Secretary of Agriculture for NFS land. The program aims to evaluate watershed conditions and establish assessment criteria for water quality, aquatic habitat, vegetation, and soil condition. The 2018 farm bill codified the Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) program, authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a WCF for National Forest System (NFS) land. The program allows the Forest Service to evaluate and classify watershed conditions, identify priority watersheds for protection and restoration, and develop restoration action plans in coordination with nonfederal landowners and other governments. The 2018 farm bill established the Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) program for National Forest System (NFS) land. The program allows the Forest Service to evaluate and classify watershed conditions, identify priority watersheds for protection and restoration, and develop restoration action plans in coordination with nonfederal landowners and other governments. The law also authorizes an emergency designation process to prioritize watershed rehabilitation after significant wildfire impact. The 2018 farm bill established the Watershed Condition Framework program for NFS land to prioritize protection and restoration activities on priority watersheds. It also authorizes an emergency designation process for rehabilitating watersheds impacted by wildfires. Watershed protection, including water source protection, is an authorized use of the NFS. The NFS allows for watershed protection, including water source protection, through authorized activities such as cooperative agreements for restoration and enhancement purposes with various entities. If deemed in the public interest, federal funds may be used to share costs with nonfederal partners for implementing these agreements. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing FS to enter into multi-year partnership agreements with nonfederal entities for watershed restoration and enhancement purposes. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing FS to enter into multi-year partnership agreements with nonfederal entities for watershed restoration and enhancement purposes, including activities to protect municipal water sources.

FS may develop a water source management plan with nonfederal partners to carry out forest management activities for watershed protection and restoration projects. The law authorizes FS to conduct environmental analysis for the development of the water source management plan or each project proposed. FS can accept cash, donations, and services for these projects. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing FS to enter into partnership agreements with nonfederal partners to protect and restore NFS watersheds that serve as sources of municipal water. FS may develop a water source management plan with nonfederal partners to carry out forest management activities for watershed protection and restoration projects. The law authorizes FS to conduct a single environmental analysis pursuant to NEPA for the development or finalization of the water source management plan or for each project proposed pursuant to a plan. FS can accept cash, donations, and services for these projects, and establish a Water Source Protection Fund to match partner donations. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing FS to partner with nonfederal partners to protect and restore NFS watersheds that serve as sources of municipal water. Congress authorized $10 million in annual appropriations to the Water Source Protection Fund through FY2023 to match partner donations for forest management activities. Other provisions in the bill include designating NFS lands as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System and miscellaneous provisions related to land acquisition, exchange, and disposal. The 2018 farm bill authorized $10 million annually for the Water Source Protection Fund to match partner donations for forest management activities on NFS lands. Various provisions in the bill include designating NFS lands as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System and other miscellaneous provisions related to land acquisition, exchange, and disposal. Additionally, Section 8626 of the bill designated new wilderness areas and expanded existing ones in NFS lands in Tennessee. The 2018 farm bill authorized funding for forest management activities on NFS lands, including the establishment of new wilderness areas and expansion of existing ones in Tennessee. One new wilderness area, Upper Bald River Wilderness, was designated on Cherokee National Forest, covering 9,038 acres, with additions to existing wilderness areas totaling over 10,500 acres. The 2018 farm bill authorized funding for forest management activities on NFS lands in Tennessee, establishing the Upper Bald River Wilderness on Cherokee National Forest. Over 10,500 acres were designated as additions to existing wilderness areas on the forest, managed in accordance with the Wilderness Act, prohibiting most commercial activities and motorized access. The 2018 farm bill authorized funding for forest management activities on NFS lands in Tennessee, establishing the Upper Bald River Wilderness on Cherokee National Forest. Wilderness areas like Little Frog Mountain and Sampson Mountain are managed in accordance with the Wilderness Act, prohibiting most commercial activities and motorized access. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill enacted provisions that changed how federal land is acquired, exchanged, or disposed of, with specific authorities established, reauthorized, or modified. For example, Section 8623 of the 2018 farm bill established a new program authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to lease up to 10 isolated areas. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill enacted provisions to change how federal land is acquired, exchanged, or disposed of. Specific authorities were established, reauthorized, or modified, such as a new program authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to lease isolated parcels for administrative sites and reauthorizing a program to sell or exchange BLM lands for administrative purposes. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill enacted provisions to change federal land acquisition, exchange, or disposal. The Secretary of Agriculture can lease up to 10 isolated parcels for administrative sites at market value. The bills reauthorized programs for selling or exchanging BLM lands for administrative purposes and conveying administrative sites or undeveloped parcels of NFS land. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the Forest Service Facility Realignment and Enhancement program, modified the Small Tracts Act, and contained provisions for exchanges or sales of specific parcels and entities. The 2018 farm bill expanded eligibility requirements for the Small Tracts Act and authorized exchanges or sales of specific parcels and entities. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for BLM and NFS lands. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture are authorized to issue rights-of-way for BLM and NFS lands, allowing specific use for various purposes including water infrastructure and transportation systems. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for BLM and NFS lands for various purposes, including water infrastructure and transportation systems. This allows access for facilities such as water infrastructure, transportation systems, electricity generation, communication systems, and other necessary public interest facilities on federal lands. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for BLM and NFS lands for various purposes, including water infrastructure, transportation systems, electricity generation, communication systems, and other necessary public interest facilities on federal lands. FS and BLM charge cost-recovery fees for processing and monitoring applications as well as an annual land use rental fee based on estimated hours for processing and monitoring. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for BLM and NFS lands for various purposes in the public interest. FS and BLM charge cost-recovery fees for processing and monitoring applications, along with an annual land use rental fee based on estimated hours. The fees are determined by the agency's processing time and compliance monitoring. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for BLM and NFS lands for various purposes in the public interest. BLM and FS have rental fee schedules for linear ROWs and communication sites based on land value and type of communication use. The 115th Congress directed FS to update their process and fee schedule for communication sites and established new regulations for certain activities within electricity ROWs. The 115th Congress enacted provisions directing FS to update their process and fee schedule for issuing special use authorizations for communication sites and established new regulations for certain activities within electricity ROWs to address concerns about wildfire ignitions. Some provisions address concerns about wildfire ignitions within electricity transmission and distribution ROWs, where power line ignitions can lead to fires spreading across larger areas due to weather conditions. Confusing administrative processes may hinder ROW permit-holders from conducting necessary maintenance activities to mitigate ignition risks on federal lands within their ROWs. Some believe weather conditions contribute to vegetation coming into contact with power lines, leading to fire risks. Improved processes for ROW permit holders to conduct vegetation management on federal lands are seen as beneficial by the 115th Congress. The 115th Congress provisions aim to improve processes for right-of-way permit holders to conduct vegetation management on federal lands, with some concerns about balancing project implementation speed with accountability and adherence to federal land laws. Some provisions also address responsibilities for wildfire suppression costs within right-of-ways. Some provisions specify responsibilities for wildfire suppression costs within right-of-ways on federal lands, with concerns about the potential implications for disproportionate cost-sharing. Some provisions specify responsibilities for wildfire suppression costs within right-of-ways on federal lands, with concerns about the potential implications for disproportionate cost-sharing. The provisions limit damages and liability for ROW permit holders, sparking debate on the federal government's share of wildfire costs and the need for prompt agency action on maintenance requests. Utilities are argued not to be fully responsible for wildfire costs due to past agency actions contributing to increased fuel levels around ROWs. Some argue that limiting damages and liability for ROW permit holders will prompt agency action on maintenance requests and prevent utilities from bearing full wildfire costs.

The law also encouraged training programs for employees on vegetation management and the electrical transmission system. Section 211 of the FY2018 omnibus bill encourages FS and BLM to develop training programs for employees on vegetation management and the electrical transmission system. It also specifies ROW permit holder liabilities related to vegetation management activities, limiting strict liability for damages or injury to $500,000 under certain conditions for activities conducted pursuant to an approved plan. The 2018 farm bill established a pilot program for utility ROW permit holders on NFS land, limiting liability for damages or injury to $500,000 under certain conditions. The law prohibits strict liability for damages resulting from activities conducted by a ROW holder if the Secretary unreasonably withholds plan approval or fails to adhere to an approved plan schedule. FS and BLM must report on the impacts of the liability clauses to Congress within four years of enactment. The 2018 farm bill established a pilot program for utility ROW permit holders on NFS land, limiting liability for damages or injury to $500,000 under certain conditions. The law defines utility ROWs to include electric transmission lines, natural gas infrastructure, or related infrastructure. Participating permit holders may develop and implement vegetation management plans. The 2018 farm bill established a pilot program for utility ROW permit holders on NFS land, allowing them to develop vegetation management plans and perform projects within their ROWs. Participants must adhere to FS and state regulations for fire prevention and vegetation removal activities. The 2018 farm bill established a pilot program for utility ROW permit holders on NFS land to develop and implement vegetation management plans, subject to FS approval. Participants may also pay for and perform projects on specified NFS lands within and up to 75 feet from the ROW, adhering to FS and state regulations. Participants are responsible for project costs, with the possibility of FS contributing funds at the discretion of the Secretary of Agriculture. The pilot program for utility ROW permit holders on NFS land involves vegetation management plans and projects within specified areas. Participants are responsible for project costs, with the potential for FS to contribute funds. The Secretary of Agriculture may retain funds provided by participants for implementing the pilot. Participants must reimburse FS for wildfire suppression costs and damage caused by their operations. The law requires FS to submit a program status report to Congress every two years starting in 2020. Participants in the pilot program must reimburse FS for wildfire suppression and damage caused by their operations, with the option to receive reimbursement for providing resources to suppress wildfires in the ROW. The pilot participant must reimburse FS for wildfire suppression and damage caused by their operations. If the participant provides resources to suppress a wildfire in the ROW, the cost of those resources will be credited towards reimbursement costs. The FS must reimburse the pilot participant for any excess costs, up to a limit of $500,000 in certain circumstances. The electricity ROW provisions in the FY2018 omnibus differ from those in the ROW pilot program on NFS lands. The FY2018 omnibus program is specific to electricity ROWs, while the FS pilot program applies to electricity ROWs as well. The FY2018 omnibus program and the FS pilot program have different provisions for electricity ROWs. The FS pilot program under the 2018 farm bill includes natural gas and infrastructure, while the FY2018 omnibus program is specific to electricity ROWs. Participant responsibilities in the farm bill pilot are limited to wildfire and vegetation management, with no mention of liability. The FY2018 omnibus caps liability costs for program participants. Counties with NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands receive payments from the federal government. The 2018 farm bill pilot program includes electricity ROWs, natural gas, and infrastructure. Participant responsibilities are limited to wildfire and vegetation management. The FY2018 omnibus program caps liability costs for participants. Counties with NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands receive payments based on revenue generated from the prior year. SRS authorized optional payment system for counties as an alternative to revenue-sharing payments, based on historic revenue, acreage, and per capita income. The SRS authorized an optional payment system for counties to receive payments based on historic revenue, acreage, and per capita income from lands. Payments were allocated among three categories for funding education, roads, and projects within the county. The SRS statute specified payments to be allocated among three categories based on payment level: Title I FS payments for education and roads, Title II payments for projects on lands and within the county, and Title III payments for specified county programs like fire prevention and emergency services. Title II also established Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) to improve collaborative relationships and provide advice to agencies. Title III payments were designated for county programs such as fire prevention and emergency services. Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) were established under Title II to provide advice and recommendations to agencies, with specific membership requirements including representation from various interests. The law established Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) with specific membership requirements and set the authorized payment level at 95% of the previous year's level. SRS payments were extended multiple times until FY2016. The authorized payment level for Secure Rural Schools (SRS) payments was set at 95% of the previous year's level. SRS payments were extended until FY2016, with counties receiving revenue-sharing payments in FY2017. The FY2018 omnibus reauthorized SRS payments for FY2017 and FY2018. The FY2018 omnibus reauthorized SRS payments for FY2017 and FY2018 at 95% of the previous year's level. Counties received revenue-sharing payments in FY2017 after the last authorized SRS payments in FY2016. The reauthorization set the FY2017 payment level at 95% of the last authorized payment. The FY2018 omnibus reauthorized SRS payments for FY2017 and FY2018 at 95% of the previous year's level. Counties received a full SRS payment for FY2017, with payments essentially made in two installments. Payment allocation requirements were changed, and Title III funds were expanded for law enforcement purposes. The reauthorization of SRS payments for FY2017 and FY2018 included changes to payment allocation requirements and expanded uses for Title III funds. The 2018 farm bill also made changes to the SRS statute despite its expiration, establishing a process for modifications by the applicable Secretary. The 2018 farm bill made changes to the SRS statute, including modifications to RAC membership requirements and the establishment of a pilot program for appointing RAC members in Montana and Arizona. These changes were in response to concerns about the prohibitive requirements for RACs. The 2018 farm bill modified RAC membership requirements and established a pilot program for appointing RAC members in Montana and Arizona. This was in response to concerns about the prohibitive requirements for RACs. The Tribal Forest Protection Act authorized agreements with Indian tribes for forest projects on tribal lands or adjacent NFS and BLM lands. The Tribal Forest Protection Act (TFPA) allows agreements with Indian tribes for forest projects on tribal lands or adjacent NFS and BLM lands. The projects aim to address forest restoration needs or threats to tribal lands, evaluated based on tribal factors for best value. The Tribal Forest Protection Act (TFPA) allows agreements with Indian tribes for forest projects on tribal lands or adjacent NFS and BLM lands. The projects aim to address forest restoration needs or threats to tribal lands, evaluated based on tribal factors for best value. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) authorizes tribes to enter into self-determination contracts with the federal government for operating federal Indian programs. The 2018 farm bill authorized federally recognized tribes to enter into self-determination contracts with the federal government to operate specified federal Indian programs, such as Bureau of Indian Affairs schools or Indian Health Service hospitals. Additionally, the bill allowed tribes to enter into contracts to perform administrative, management, and other functions of the Tribal Forest Protection Act on a demonstration basis. The 2018 farm bill authorized self-determination contracts with tribes for TFPA functions on NFS land, with the Secretary of Agriculture carrying out delegated responsibilities. Decision-making authority over NEPA and TFPA remains with the Secretary concerned. Congress may address various issues. The 2018 farm bill authorized self-determination contracts with tribes for TFPA functions on NFS land, with the Secretary of Agriculture carrying out delegated responsibilities. Congress may consider oversight of the agencies' implementation of the new laws and implications of changes in federal forest management. Congress may consider oversight of the forestry provisions enacted by the 115th Congress, including implications of changes in federal forest management. The Forest Service has identified millions of acres of NFS lands at high risk, with a backlog of restoration treatments that could take up to 29 years to eliminate. The Forest Service has identified millions of acres of NFS lands at high risk, with a backlog of restoration treatments that could take up to 29 years to eliminate. Around 2-6 million acres of treatments are accomplished annually, but hazardous fuels are accumulating three times faster than the rate of treatment. To address these concerns, FS has proposed to increase the scale, scope, and implementation of forest management projects generally, and forest restoration. The Forest Service aims to increase the scale and scope of forest management projects to address the backlog of treatment needs and hazardous fuel accumulation. Administrative process barriers, including decision-making processes related to the National Environmental Policy Act, are identified as impeding progress towards restoration goals. Some identify administrative process barriers, like decision-making related to the National Environmental Policy Act, as hindering forest restoration projects. These barriers prevent agencies from implementing projects at the necessary pace and scale to address forest health concerns. Some stakeholders believe administrative barriers, such as inadequate funding and training, hinder the Forest Service from efficiently implementing project planning requirements. The 115th Congress enacted provisions to improve agency efficiencies by expanding procedures. The 115th Congress enacted provisions to improve agency efficiencies by expanding procedures for project planning, including hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration projects. Stakeholders believe administrative barriers, such as inadequate funding and training, hinder the Forest Service's implementation of these requirements. The 115th Congress enacted provisions to improve agency efficiencies by expanding procedures for project planning, including hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration projects. Stakeholders believe administrative barriers hinder the Forest Service's implementation of these requirements, such as inadequate funding and training. Some argue that changes to decision-making processes, like establishing Categorical Exclusions, are altering the legal framework for federal forest management. Expanding the use of Categorical Exclusions under NEPA for project implementation is seen as beneficial for achieving restoration goals by the Forest Service and BLM. However, concerns exist that these changes may impact citizen participation in decision-making and could worsen environmental issues related to forest health. These issues have been ongoing for decades. Some stakeholders argue that expanding the use of Categorical Exclusions could worsen environmental impacts and hinder citizen participation in government decisions. Concerns about forest health and high fuel levels have been ongoing for decades, dating back to the wildfires in Yellowstone National Park in 1988. The National Commission on Wildfire Disasters recommended increased investment in reducing hazardous fuels in high-risk ecosystems in 1994. In response to deteriorating forest health conditions and high fuel levels following the 1988 wildfires in Yellowstone National Park, the National Commission on Wildfire Disasters recommended increased investment in reducing hazardous fuels in high-risk ecosystems in 1994. Subsequent studies and recommendations urged federal land management agencies to increase hazardous fuel treatments and develop long-term strategies to address forest health issues and mitigate wildfire risks. Policy-makers are expected to face disastrous wildfires and their costs in the future. Recommendations have been made to increase hazardous fuel treatments, develop strategies for reducing fuels, and address forest health issues. Concerns have been raised about the hazardous fuels reduction program and the need for guidance to prioritize, implement, and monitor projects. Issues with the implementation of recommendations have been identified in a 2016 report. The 2006 OIG report raised concerns about FS' hazardous fuels reduction program and recommended developing guidance and controls for project identification, prioritization, implementation, monitoring, and reporting. A 2016 OIG report found ongoing issues with FS prioritizing, tracking, and reporting on hazardous fuels reduction projects. Congress also asked GAO in 2001 to evaluate challenges impeding FS' fuel management project implementation, with the report revealing obstacles in approximately 24% of cases. The 2006 report identified issues with FS prioritizing, tracking, and reporting hazardous fuels reduction projects. Concerns about project implementation have persisted, with a significant percentage of decisions being appealed or challenged in various years. Academic studies have also examined FS NEPA implementation. The report found that 24% of fuel reduction decisions in FY2001 and FY2002 were appealed, while 20% of fuel management projects in FY2006 through FY2008 were challenged. Academic studies suggest that complex projects are more likely to be challenged, along with factors like timber harvests and public involvement requirements. HFRA, passed in 2003, is also mentioned. The HFRA, passed in 2003, aimed to expedite hazardous fuels reduction projects on NFS areas. Despite these efforts, the need for treatment in NFS areas has continued to grow, prompting FS to seek ways to accelerate project implementation. Complex projects are more likely to face challenges, along with factors like timber harvests and public involvement requirements. The HFRA, passed in 2003, aimed to expedite hazardous fuels reduction projects on NFS areas. Despite these efforts, the need for treatment in NFS areas has continued to grow. FS is looking for ways to increase the pace of project implementation. Some believe the HFRA approach needs to be more broadly applied. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm legislation enacted forest-related provisions for comparison. The HFRA approach to streamline agency decisionmaking has not been successful and some believe it needs to be more broadly applied. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill enacted forest-related provisions for comparison in legislation during the 115th Congress. The tables provide side-by-side comparisons of the provisions in each law to prior law, excluding provisions that do not directly affect forest management."
