    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Prevention of Frivolous Ethanol Lawsuits Act of 2010\" and includes findings. The Congress finds that ethanol is widely used in gasoline for vehicles and engines, and any decision to increase ethanol blending must ensure it does not harm emission control systems. Significant concerns exist regarding the effects of increasing the blending limit of ethanol in gasoline on engine performance, including potential issues such as engine failures, decreased performance, and increased consumer complaints. The Federal Trade Commission has proposed labeling requirements for fuels with ethanol blending limits exceeding current standards to address concerns about potential negative effects on engine performance and interstate commerce. The Federal Trade Commission is proposing labeling requirements for fuels with ethanol blending limits exceeding current standards to address concerns about potential negative effects on engine performance and interstate commerce.
