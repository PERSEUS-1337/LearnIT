The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 has allowed Federal agencies to use incentive prizes and challenges, resulting in benefits such as paying only for success, setting ambitious goals, involving a broader group of people, and bringing diverse perspectives to problem-solving. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 has enabled Federal agencies to use incentive prizes and challenges, allowing them to set ambitious goals, involve a broader group of people, bring diverse perspectives to problem-solving, and increase cost-effectiveness. Granting agencies direct authority to use crowdsourcing and citizen science will remove ambiguity about their ability to do so. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 has enabled Federal agencies to use incentive prizes and challenges to set ambitious goals, involve a broader group of people, bring diverse perspectives to problem-solving, and increase cost-effectiveness. Granting agencies direct authority to use crowdsourcing and citizen science will remove ambiguity and stimulate broader public participation in the innovation process. Crowdsourcing projects offer unique benefits such as improving government service delivery with lower resource investments and connecting citizens to Federal missions. The benefits of crowdsourcing projects include improving government service delivery with lower resource investments, connecting citizens to Federal missions, and acquiring data at a greater geographic extent and density. Citizen science promotes open government, volunteerism, and enables citizens to gather, analyze, and share data to address community concerns. It also accelerates scientific research. Citizen science accelerates scientific research, promotes open government, volunteerism, and enables citizens to address community concerns by gathering, analyzing, and sharing data. It also improves science literacy and enhances skills in STEM fields, increasing American competitiveness. Citizen science accelerates scientific research, promotes open government, volunteerism, and enables citizens to address community concerns by gathering, analyzing, and sharing data. It also improves science literacy, enhances skills in STEM fields, increases American competitiveness, furthers science diplomacy, and builds trust and understanding between citizens and scientists. Participants in crowdsourcing and citizen science contribute to these efforts. Federal agencies should consider providing meaningful incentives to engage and retain participants in crowdsourcing and citizen science projects, including receiving attribution for their contributions. Federal agencies should consider providing incentives for participants in crowdsourcing and citizen science projects, such as receiving attribution, learning new skills, connecting with others, and contributing to solving meaningful problems. Participants in crowdsourcing and citizen science projects are motivated by learning new skills, connecting with others, and contributing to solving meaningful problems for the benefit of society. Participants in crowdsourcing and citizen science projects are motivated by learning new skills, connecting with others, and contributing to solving meaningful problems for the benefit of society. SEC. 3. CROWDSOURCING AND CITIZEN SCIENCE. Citizen science involves open collaboration where individuals or organizations participate in various scientific processes, including formulating research questions, designing projects, conducting experiments, collecting and analyzing data, interpreting results, developing technologies, making discoveries, and solving problems. Citizen science involves open collaboration in scientific processes such as project design, conducting experiments, data collection and analysis, result interpretation, technology development, discoveries, and problem-solving. Crowdsourcing is a method to obtain services, ideas, or content from a group, especially online. The Director refers to the Director of the organization. The term \"crowdsourcing\" is defined as a method to obtain services, ideas, or content from a group, especially online. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The term \"Federal agency\" includes any Executive agency as defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code.

A \"participant\" is an individual or entity that volunteers consent. The term \"related entity\" refers to Federal Government contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, users, customers, and cooperating parties. The head of each Federal agency or multiple agencies working together may authorize individuals or entities to participate as volunteers in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects. A \"related entity\" includes Federal Government contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, users, customers, cooperating parties, grantees, investigators, fellows, or detailees of a Federal agency. The head of each Federal agency or multiple agencies working together may utilize crowdsourcing and citizen science approaches with volunteers, including individuals or entities like contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, users, customers, cooperating parties, grantees, investigators, fellows, or detailees of a Federal agency. The head of a Federal agency can accept voluntary services from participants involved in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects authorized by the agency. Federal agencies can accept voluntary services from participants in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects authorized by the Office of Personnel Management, as long as the services are unpaid and do not displace any federal employees. Federal agencies engaged in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must promote and encourage broad participation of consenting participants. Each agency must ensure that participants are not financially compensated, and their involvement will not displace any federal employees. Additionally, agencies must obtain consent, registration, and define terms of use for the projects. Each Federal agency conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must promote and encourage broad participation of consenting participants. Agencies have the authority to determine the level of consent, registration, or acknowledgment of terms of use required from participants on a project-by-project basis.
