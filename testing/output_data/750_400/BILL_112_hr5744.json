The Act aims to prevent catastrophic wildfires. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" aims to expedite wildfire prevention projects on Federal lands, reduce threats to endangered species, and provide efficiency tools to streamline projects for reducing wildfires. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines terms like \"at-risk community\" and \"at-risk forest\" to address high wildfire risk on Federal lands. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines terms like \"at-risk community\" and \"at-risk forest\" to address high wildfire risk on Federal lands, including the loss of key ecosystems, wildlife, or habitats to wildfire. It also includes Federal land in condition class II or III as defined by the Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station. The Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station developed classes for wildfire prevention projects in at-risk forests or endangered species habitats. These projects aim to manage hazardous fuels. An authorized wildfire prevention project involves measures developed by the Secretary concerned for hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, restoration, watershed restoration, and habitat protection for threatened and endangered species in at-risk forests. It may include livestock grazing and timber harvest projects for these purposes. An authorized wildfire prevention project on Federal land may involve measures for hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, restoration, watershed restoration, and habitat protection for threatened and endangered species. It can include livestock grazing and timber harvest projects for these purposes. Federal land includes National Forest System land. Federal land includes land of the National Forest System and public lands, excluding land where vegetation removal is specified. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land or the Secretary of the Interior for public lands. \"Threatened and endangered species habitat\" refers to Federal land where natural fire regimes are important or wildfire is a threat. The term \"threatened and endangered species habitat\" refers to Federal land where natural fire regimes are important for endangered species or where wildfire poses a threat to them, as identified in species recovery plans or Federal Register notices. The curr_chunk discusses the protection of endangered species, threatened species, or their habitats as outlined in species recovery plans or Federal Register notices. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZED WILDFIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS. The Secretary shall implement wildfire prevention projects in at-risk forests and endangered species habitat, focusing on reducing surface, ladder, and canopy fuels. Protection from catastrophic wildfires is a priority for endangered species habitat projects. Authorized wildfire prevention projects on threatened and endangered species habitat must enhance protection from wildfires for the species or habitat and comply with guidelines in the species recovery plan under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. In at-risk forests, authorized wildfire prevention projects aim to improve Federal land conditions from class II or III to class I. Grazing of domestic livestock may be permitted in certain cases. Authorized wildfire prevention projects in at-risk forests aim to improve Federal land conditions from class II or III to class I. Domestic livestock grazing may be used to reduce surface fuel loads and recover burned areas, with no utilization standards applying. Timber harvesting and thinning are also permitted to reduce wildfire risks. Authorized wildfire prevention projects can use domestic livestock grazing to reduce fuel loads and recover burned areas. Timber harvesting and thinning are allowed to prevent wildfires, without requiring revisions to land management plans. The section discusses the prevention of wildfires by managing ladder and canopy fuel loads, without mandating changes to land management plans. It also addresses the consideration of public petitions for designating federal land as at-risk forest or endangered species habitat. The Secretary must review and make a determination on public petitions for designating Federal land as at-risk forest or endangered species habitat within 60 days of receiving them. SEC. 5. PUBLIC REVIEW AND ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS. The Secretary must publish a notice of proposed wildfire prevention projects in the Federal Register for public comment. Specific written comments related to the project can be submitted within 30 days. Within 60 days of the notice, the final project will be designated after considering any received comments. The Secretary must publish a notice of proposed wildfire prevention projects in the Federal Register for public comment. Within 60 days, the final project will be designated after considering any received comments. Only those who submitted comments on the proposed project can provide feedback on the final designated project. The Secretary must publish a notice of final designated wildfire prevention projects in the Federal Register. Only those who submitted comments on the proposed project can provide specific written feedback on the final project within 30 days of publication. Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 is required for planning and conducting authorized wildfire projects. The Secretary must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and other laws for authorized wildfire prevention projects. Informal consultation requirements of the Endangered Species Act apply to these projects. Special rules may apply to certain projects. The Endangered Species Act's consultation requirements apply to authorized wildfire prevention projects, with special rules for projects involving timber harvesting or grazing. The Secretary must prepare an environmental assessment within 30 days for these projects. Special rules apply to authorized wildfire prevention projects involving timber harvesting or grazing. The Secretary must prepare an environmental assessment within 30 days for these projects to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The authorized wildfire prevention project will be considered compliant with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 if the deadline for the environmental assessment is not met. For livestock grazing projects, the assessment will be valid for a minimum of 10 years. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires compliance with deadlines for environmental assessments. Livestock grazing projects are valid for 10 years, while timber harvest projects are valid for 20 years. The Secretary is not obligated to consider alternatives in the environmental assessment. Compliance with this section deems the environmental assessment sufficient for a minimum of 20 years, without requiring consideration of alternatives by the Secretary concerned. This satisfies the requirements of various environmental acts. Compliance with this section satisfies requirements of environmental acts such as the National Environmental Policy Act, National Forest Management Act, Endangered Species Act, and Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW. Administrative review follows special process under Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. Judicial review follows separate process under the same Act. Before listing any species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Secretary must research the impact on forest fuel loads. Endangered species recovery plans must include wildfire risk assessment analysis."
