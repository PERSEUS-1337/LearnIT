    "content": "Congress's contempt power is used to respond to acts that obstruct the legislative process, such as a witness refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena. This power can be used to coerce compliance, punish the contemnor, or remove the obstruction. In recent decades, Congress has primarily used its contempt power in response to witnesses refusing to comply with congressional subpoenas. Congress has three formal methods to combat noncompliance, including the dormant inherent contempt power to detain and imprison a contemnor until they comply with demands. Congress has three formal methods to combat noncompliance with subpoenas: inherent contempt power allows detention until compliance, criminal contempt permits prosecution by the executive branch. Inherent contempt encourages compliance with congressional directives, while criminal contempt allows for prosecution by the executive branch for noncompliance with a subpoena. Criminal contempt serves as punishment but may not lead to subsequent acquiescence. Congress can also seek enforcement of a subpoena through the judicial branch. Congress may rely on the judicial branch to enforce a congressional subpoena by seeking a civil judgment declaring the individual legally obligated to comply. Failure to comply may result in contempt of court, especially for executive branch officials. The federal court can declare an individual legally obligated to comply with a congressional subpoena, with noncompliance potentially leading to contempt of court. Civil enforcement may be necessary for Congress to ensure compliance, especially with executive branch officials. The report examines Congress's contempt power, procedures for inherent contempt, criminal contempt, and civil enforcement of subpoenas, as well as the challenges in enforcing contempt actions against executives. Enforcement is crucial for Congress to ensure compliance with its subpoenas, with various methods such as inherent contempt, criminal contempt, and civil enforcement being analyzed. Challenges in enforcing contempt actions against executive branch officials are also discussed. For a more detailed version, refer to CRS Report RL34097, Congress's Contempt Power and the Enforcement of Congressional Subpoenas. Congress's contempt power is closely tied to its investigative authority, allowing for broad access to information, including confidential details. The enforcement of contempt actions against executive branch officials is a key aspect, with various methods like inherent contempt, criminal contempt, and civil enforcement being considered. For more detailed information, refer to CRS Report RL34097. The power of Congress to punish for contempt is closely linked to its investigative authority, which allows for broad access to information, including confidential details. Congress's authority to investigate and obtain information is established by the Supreme Court as essential to its legislative function, even though there is no specific provision in the Constitution authorizing such oversight. The Supreme Court has firmly established that congressional oversight and investigations are essential to the legislative function, with broad authority to seek and enforce informational demands. This power was established in two Supreme Court rulings related to the Teapot Dome scandal in the 1920s. In McGrain v. Daugherty, the Court described the power of inquiry as an essential auxiliary to the legislative function. The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of congressional oversight and investigations in two rulings related to the 1920s Teapot Dome scandal. In McGrain v. Daugherty, the Court described the power of inquiry as essential for legislative function, stating that lawmakers need information to legislate effectively. The Court emphasized the necessity of obtaining accurate information through means of compulsion for effective legislative function, as lawmakers often lack the requisite information themselves. This power of inquiry with enforcing process was deemed essential even before the Constitution was framed and adopted. The power of inquiry with enforcing process is essential for effective legislative function, as lawmakers often lack accurate information. This attribute is intended to be included in the constitutional provisions to ensure the function is carried out effectively. The power of inquiry with enforcing process is essential for effective legislative function, as lawmakers often lack accurate information. This attribute is intended to be included in the constitutional provisions to ensure the function is carried out effectively. In Sinclair v. United States, a witness at congressional hearings refused to provide answers and was prosecuted for contempt of Congress. The witness had noted a lawsuit between the government and the Mammoth Oil Company and reserved any evidence for the courts. In Sinclair v. United States, a witness at congressional hearings was prosecuted for contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions, citing a pending lawsuit between the government and Mammoth Oil Company as a reason for withholding information. The Supreme Court upheld the witness's conviction, rejecting the argument that the lawsuit justified not providing answers. The Supreme Court upheld a witness's conviction for contempt of Congress in Sinclair v. United States. The Court rejected the argument that pending lawsuits justified withholding information, stating that Congress had the power to investigate regardless. The Supreme Court ruled in Sinclair v. United States that Congress has the power to investigate regardless of pending lawsuits. Congress can require disclosures to aid its constitutional power, even if the information may also be useful in lawsuits. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld Congress's broad investigative authority, stating that it is as far-reaching as its power to enact laws. This includes the ability to require disclosures for its constitutional power, even if the information may also be relevant to pending lawsuits. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld Congress's broad investigative authority, stating that it is as far-reaching as its power to enact laws. This includes inquiries into the administration of existing laws and potential new statutes, as reiterated in Eastland v. United States Servicemen's Fund and Watkins v. United States. In Watkins v. United States, the Supreme Court emphasized Congress's broad power of inquiry, stating it includes investigations into existing laws, proposed statutes, waste, fraud, abuse, and maladministration within government departments. The Court highlighted that congressional investigative power is at its peak when addressing corruption, inefficiency, or waste in federal departments. The Supreme Court emphasized Congress's broad power of inquiry, stating it includes investigations into alleged waste, fraud, abuse, or maladministration within government departments to expose corruption and inefficiency. The Supreme Court recognizes Congress's power to inquire into corruption, maladministration, and inefficiencies in government agencies, even though inherent contempt power is not explicitly granted by the Constitution. The Court recognizes Congress's power to investigate corruption and inefficiencies in government agencies, upholding the inherent contempt power to detain individuals for trial. The inherent contempt power allows individuals to be detained by Congress, tried at the bar of the body, and imprisoned as punishment or coercion, as upheld in Supreme Court decisions. The inherent contempt power allows individuals to be detained by Congress, tried at the bar of the body, and imprisoned as punishment or coercion. The witness can be imprisoned until compliance, following traditional methods like in Anderson v. Dunn where a non-Member was accused of bribery by a House Member in 1818. The House's procedure in the contempt citation challenged in Anderson mirrors the traditional methods used in inherent contempt cases. In 1818, Anderson, a non-Member, was accused of bribery by a House Member. The Speaker ordered the Sergeant-at-Arms to arrest Anderson and bring him before the House to answer the charge. Anderson was informed of the accusation and granted requests for assistance in his defense. The House adopted a resolution for the arrest of Anderson in a contempt case. Anderson was brought before the House, granted counsel and defense witnesses, and found guilty of contempt. The Speaker reprimanded him and discharged him from custody. The House granted Anderson counsel, compulsory process for defense witnesses, and a copy of the accusatory letter. After calling his witnesses and being questioned by the House, Anderson was found guilty of contempt. The Speaker reprimanded him and discharged him from custody, establishing a pattern of attachment, hearing, determination of guilt, and imposition of penalty in contempt cases. Prompt judicial review seems to be available in the inherent contempt process. The pattern of attachment by the Sergeant-at-Arms, appearance before the bar, provision for charges, identification of accuser, compulsory process, counsel, hearing, determination of guilt, and penalty imposition was established in contempt cases. Prompt judicial review through a habeas corpus petition may be available to review if the House or Senate acted within its jurisdiction and if due process standards were followed. In a habeas corpus proceeding, the court may review whether the House or Senate acted within its jurisdiction and if due process standards were followed in contempt cases. Contemnors must be granted notice and an opportunity to be heard, although not all procedural rights available in criminal proceedings are required. Some requirements imposed by the courts in statutory criminal contempt procedures may be mandated by the due process clause. In inherent contempt proceedings, contemnors must be afforded procedural rights similar to those in criminal proceedings, including notice and an opportunity to be heard. The courts may impose requirements such as pertinency of questions asked, which could be mandated by the due process clause. Monetary fines could be considered as an alternative to incarceration, potentially avoiding habeas corpus proceedings. In inherent contempt proceedings, contemnors must have procedural rights similar to criminal proceedings, including notice and a chance to be heard. Monetary fines could be an alternative to incarceration, potentially avoiding habeas corpus proceedings. Congress could potentially impose fines instead of jail time, drawing on courts' authority to fine for contemptuous behavior. Inherent contempt proceedings require procedural rights similar to criminal proceedings, including notice and a chance to be heard. Congress could potentially impose fines instead of jail time, drawing on courts' authority to fine for contemptuous behavior. Support for this argument is found in dicta from the 1821 Supreme Court decision in Anderson. The 1821 Supreme Court decision in Anderson addressed the punishing power of deliberative assemblies, stating that imprisonment is the least possible power adequate for self-preservation. Other forms of punishment are seen as mere alternatives to confinement. The power of imprisonment is considered the least possible power adequate for self-preservation by deliberative assemblies. Other forms of punishment are viewed as mere alternatives to confinement. In certain cases, Congress may compel testimony in a similar manner as a court of justice. In Kilbourn v. Thompson, the Court suggested that Congress may compel testimony in the same manner as a court of justice in certain cases. The possibility of levying a fine as punishment for contempt of Congress is implied by the language of these cases and the power possessed by courts. The power of Congress to compel testimony is suggested by court cases, but there is no precedent for Congress imposing fines for contempt. Inherent contempt proceedings do not require cooperation from other branches of government. In comparison with other contempt proceedings, inherent contempt does not need cooperation from other branches. The House or Senate can conduct proceedings independently and cite the offender for contempt. The contemnor can seek limited judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus. Inherent contempt allows the House or Senate to conduct independent proceedings and cite offenders for contempt. The contemnor can seek limited judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus, but imprisonment cannot extend beyond the current session of Congress. However, inherent contempt is seen as cumbersome, time-consuming, and relatively ineffective. The inherent contempt process allows Congress to cite offenders for contempt, leading to potential imprisonment until compliance with a subpoena. However, this method is considered outdated and ineffective due to its cumbersome nature and disruption to legislative work. It has not been used since 1935. The inherent contempt process, considered outdated and ineffective, has not been used by Congress since 1935 due to its disruptive nature to legislative work. One suggestion to streamline the process is to have initial fact-finding and witness examination done by a special committee, with the final decision on guilt made by the full House or Senate. Between 1795 and 1857, 14 inherent contempt actions were initiated by the House and Senate, with 8 considered successful in meting out punishment. Proceedings were conducted before a special committee, with the final decision on guilt made by the full body. Between 1795 and 1857, 14 inherent contempt actions were initiated by Congress, with 8 successful in punishing the contemnor. These proceedings were seen as time-consuming and ineffective as punishment could not extend beyond a house's adjournment date. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted, replacing the inherent contempt proceedings. This new procedure allows for judicial trial of the contemnor by a United States Attorney, making the process more efficient and effective. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted, allowing for judicial trial of the contemnor by a United States Attorney instead of a trial at the bar of the House or Senate. This legislation was intended as an alternative to the inherent contempt procedure, not a substitute for it. The legislation in 1857 introduced a criminal contempt procedure as an alternative to the inherent contempt process. Most contempt cases continued to be handled at the bar of the house rather than through criminal proceedings. Today, these provisions are codified as 2 U.S.C. Sections 192 and 194. Under 2 U.S.C. Section 192, a person summoned as a witness by a house or committee who fails to testify or produce documents can be fined up to $100,000 and imprisoned for up to one year. Section 194 outlines the procedure to be followed in such cases. Under 2 U.S.C. Section 192, a witness failing to testify or produce documents can face a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to one year. Section 194 outlines the procedure for referring a non-compliant witness for criminal prosecution. The procedure for referring a non-compliant witness for criminal prosecution involves committee approval, reading the committee report on the floor, House approval of a resolution authorizing the Speaker to certify the report to the U.S. Attorney, and certification by the Speaker to the appropriate U.S. Attorney. The criminal contempt procedure involves committee approval, reading the report on the floor, House approval of a resolution authorizing the Speaker to certify the report for prosecution, and certification by the Speaker to the U.S. Attorney. It is punitive and aims to deter similar conduct. The criminal contempt procedure is punitive and aims to deter similar conduct by punishing a recalcitrant witness. Once a witness is voted in contempt, they lack an incentive to cooperate with the committee. The courts have rejected arguments that defendants can purge themselves, but in some cases, the House has taken action. Once a witness has been voted in contempt, they lack an incentive to cooperate with the committee. In some cases, the House has certified that further proceedings were not necessary if compliance with subpoenas occurred after contempt citations were voted. The House has certified to the U.S. Attorney that further proceedings concerning contempts were not necessary in some cases where compliance with subpoenas occurred after contempt citations had been voted. It is unclear whether the U.S. Attorney's duty to present the contempt to the grand jury is mandatory or discretionary, with conflicting guidance from relevant case law. The U.S. Attorney's duty to present contempt to the grand jury is unclear, with conflicting guidance from relevant case law. In Ex parte Frankfeld, witnesses before the House Committee on Un-American Activities were released after being charged with violating 2 U.S.C. Section 192. In Ex parte Frankfeld, the District Court for the District of Columbia granted habeas corpus petitions for two witnesses charged with violating 2 U.S.C. Section 192 by the House Committee on Un-American Activities. The court ordered their release due to procedural errors in their detention. The court released witnesses due to procedural errors in their detention. Congress prescribed reporting obdurate witnesses to the House or Senate, certifying facts to the district attorney. Congress intended to leave no discretion to the Speaker of the House or President of the Senate in such cases. Congress mandated that obdurate witnesses be reported to the House or Senate committee, with the Speaker of the House or President of the Senate certifying the facts to the district attorney. This process leaves no discretion to the officials involved, as the district attorney is required to submit the facts to the grand jury. The certification of facts to the district attorney is mandatory under the statute, leaving no discretion. The U.S. Attorney is required to bring the contempt citation before the grand jury. The House of Representatives case involved the Section 192 contempt procedure for an executive branch official. The U.S. Attorney is required to bring the contempt citation before the grand jury. The duty of the Speaker to certify contempt citations to the U.S. Attorney during adjournments is discretionary, not mandatory, according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the duty of the Speaker to certify contempt citations to the U.S. Attorney during adjournments is discretionary, not mandatory, based on legislative history and congressional practice. Congress's view is that a committee's contempt resolution can only be referred to the U.S. Attorney after approval by the parent body when in session, and by the Speaker or President of the Senate when not in session. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit determined that the Speaker's duty to certify contempt citations during adjournments is discretionary, not mandatory. Congress's practice indicates that a committee's contempt resolution requires approval by the parent body when in session, and by the Speaker or President of the Senate when not in session. In Wilson, convictions were overturned because the Speaker certified the contempt citations without exercising discretion. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the Speaker's duty to certify contempt citations is discretionary, not mandatory. In Wilson, convictions were overturned because the Speaker certified the contempt citations without exercising discretion. This suggests that the U.S. Attorney's function may also be discretionary, despite previous court rulings. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the U.S. Attorney's function may be discretionary, despite previous court rulings. Congress may appeal to the judicial branch to enforce a congressional subpoena when inherent or criminal contempt is not an option. U.S. Attorneys have broad prosecutorial discretion, even with mandatory statutes. Congress can turn to the judicial branch to enforce a congressional subpoena through civil enforcement in federal district court. Noncompliance may lead to contempt of court, rather than contempt of Congress. The Senate has statutory authority to pursue such actions. The House can seek a court declaration for compliance with a congressional subpoena, potentially leading to contempt of court. Unlike the Senate, the House lacks a specific provision for enforcement but has used civil enforcement in the past. Congress enacted a civil enforcement procedure in 1978 as an alternative to inherent contempt power and criminal contempt statutes. The House lacks specific statutory authority for enforcement but has used civil enforcement in the past. In 1978, Congress enacted a civil enforcement procedure as an alternative to inherent contempt power and criminal contempt statutes, applicable only to the Senate. The procedure allows the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to enforce, secure a declaratory judgment, or prevent non-compliance with subpoenas or orders issued by the Senate or its committees. The civil enforcement procedure, applicable only to the Senate, allows the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia jurisdiction over actions to enforce, secure declaratory judgments, or prevent non-compliance with subpoenas or orders issued by the Senate or its committees. The Senate Legal Counsel typically brings such suits on behalf of the Senate or its committees. The Senate may request direct compliance with a subpoena or order, or seek a declaration of validity first. The Senate Legal Counsel may bring a suit on behalf of the Senate or its committees to enforce a subpoena or order. The Senate can choose to seek a declaration of validity before requesting direct compliance from a party. The court will consider the Senate's request for enforcement or a declaratory judgment. The Senate Legal Counsel can bring a suit to enforce a subpoena or order, giving the party a chance to comply before court intervention. The court's jurisdiction is limited to the matter Congress presents, reviewing the subpoena's validity. When petitioned to enforce a congressional subpoena, the court's jurisdiction is limited to the matter Congress presents, focusing on whether to aid in enforcing the subpoena. If the subpoena doesn't meet legal standards, the court can't stop the congressional proceeding but can refuse to order compliance. The court's jurisdiction is limited to deciding whether to aid Congress in enforcing a subpoena. If the subpoena doesn't meet legal standards, the court can't stop the congressional proceeding but can refuse to order compliance. Compliance can be enforced through contempt of court proceedings. If the court orders compliance with a subpoena and the individual still refuses, they may face contempt of court proceedings. Civil enforcement has limitations, especially when the subpoena is issued to a federal government officer or employee. The House of Representatives may authorize a committee to seek civil enforcement action in such cases. The House of Representatives may authorize a committee to seek civil enforcement action to force compliance with a subpoena issued to a federal government officer or employee. This was seen in the 2008 dispute involving former White House Counsel Harriet Miers. The House of Representatives authorized a committee to seek civil enforcement action to compel compliance with a subpoena issued to a federal government officer or employee. This was exemplified in the 2008 case involving former White House Counsel Harriet Miers, marking the first congressional attempt to seek civil enforcement of a subpoena in federal court solely through a resolution of a single house. The jurisdictional questions surrounding such claims were resolved following the federal district court decision in Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers. In 2012, the House authorized a congressional committee to pursue civil action in federal court to enforce a subpoena issued to an executive branch official. The House authorized a congressional committee in 2012 to pursue civil action in federal court to enforce a subpoena issued to an executive branch official. This authorization allows the committee to initiate a civil lawsuit on behalf of the House. In June 2012, the House held Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt for not complying with subpoenas related to Operation Fast and Furious. A resolution authorized a civil lawsuit to enforce the subpoenas, which was filed in August 2012. The court rejected the DOJ's motion to dismiss in September 2013. The committee filed a civil lawsuit to enforce outstanding subpoenas against the Attorney General. The court rejected the DOJ's motion to dismiss in September 2013, addressing jurisdictional and justiciability arguments. Since then, both parties have been denied summary judgment motions. The court addressed jurisdictional and justiciability arguments in a motion to dismiss based on federal court jurisdiction, standing, causes of action, and separation-of-powers concerns. The court has yet to reach the merits of the executive privilege question, following previous decisions in Miers and Holder. The court has ordered the DOJ to provide a list of withheld documents and reasons for privilege. Authorization from the full House is needed for civil enforcement of subpoenas. Without it, courts will not entertain motions on behalf of Congress. Authorization from the full House is required for civil enforcement of subpoenas or other orders. Without this authorization, courts will not entertain civil motions on behalf of Congress. If an authorizing resolution by the House can be obtained, the court is likely to allow civil enforcement of subpoenas or committee orders. Authorization from the full House is required for civil enforcement of subpoenas or other orders. If an authorizing resolution by the House can be obtained, the court is likely to allow civil enforcement of subpoenas or committee orders, despite the executive branch's position that Congress cannot invoke its inherent powers. The DOJ acknowledges that civil enforcement is the preferred method for enforcing subpoenas against executive officials. The executive branch argues that Congress cannot use inherent contempt or criminal contempt procedures against officials invoking executive privilege. The Attorney General has instructed U.S. Attorneys not to pursue criminal contempt in such cases. The Attorney General has directed U.S. Attorneys not to pursue criminal contempt against executive branch officials invoking executive privilege in response to congressional subpoenas. This directive is based on DOJ opinions from the mid-1980s and past actions in contempt proceedings. The DOJ has directed U.S. Attorneys not to prosecute executive branch officials for criminal contempt when invoking executive privilege in response to congressional subpoenas. This decision is supported by past DOJ opinions and actions in contempt proceedings. The House approved contempt citations against executive branch officials, but the DOJ declined to prosecute for criminal contempt, leading Congress to rely on civil enforcement through federal courts to enforce subpoenas. This highlights the limitations of the criminal contempt provision when executive privilege is invoked. The executive branch official invoking executive privilege may render criminal contempt ineffective, leading Congress to seek other ways to enforce subpoenas, such as civil enforcement through federal courts. The 2014 case involving IRS official Lois Lerner suggests a broadening stance on criminal contempt against executive officials. Lois Lerner faced criminal contempt after refusing to testify about her role in the IRS targeting of conservative groups. Appearing before Congress, she invoked the Fifth Amendment but was held in contempt. Lois Lerner faced criminal contempt for refusing to testify about IRS targeting of conservative groups. Despite invoking the Fifth Amendment, she was held in contempt by Congress. The DOJ has not pursued a criminal case against Lerner, despite the House approving the contempt citation. Despite being held in contempt by Congress for refusing to testify about IRS targeting of conservative groups, Lois Lerner invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege and declared her innocence in an opening statement. The DOJ has not taken any action to pursue a criminal case against Lerner, unlike past situations involving executive privilege. The dispute involving Lois Lerner's refusal to comply with a congressional subpoena did not revolve around executive privilege but her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The DOJ has not pursued criminal charges against Lerner for contempt of Congress. Lerner's refusal to comply with a congressional subpoena was based on her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, not executive privilege. The DOJ has not pursued criminal charges against her for contempt of Congress, highlighting the challenges Congress faces in enforcing subpoenas against executive branch officials. The challenges Congress faces in enforcing subpoenas against executive branch officials extend beyond situations of executive privilege. Lessons from past disputes suggest that enforcing a subpoena through criminal contempt may be ineffective, especially when the President supports noncompliance. Efforts to punish executive branch officials for noncompliance with subpoenas through criminal contempt may prove ineffective, especially when the President supports noncompliance. The DOJ may not pursue prosecution for criminal contempt if the President endorses the official's refusal to disclose information. When the President supports an official's refusal to disclose information, the DOJ may not prosecute for criminal contempt. However, if the official's actions were not endorsed by the President, criminal contempt could still be used to punish noncompliance with congressional subpoenas. When the President supports an official's refusal to disclose information, the DOJ may not prosecute for criminal contempt. However, if the official's actions were not endorsed by the President, criminal contempt could still be used to punish noncompliance with congressional subpoenas. In cases where an official disregards a congressional subpoena to protect personal interests, the criminal contempt provision may be an effective avenue for punishment, even if the executive branch chooses not to prosecute to avoid setting a precedent for Congress's authority. The executive branch may choose not to prosecute an official for contempt, either due to the merit of the citation or to avoid setting a precedent. Congress may struggle to enforce its subpoenas through civil action against executive officials, leading to delays in protecting its prerogatives. Congress may face challenges enforcing its subpoenas against executive officials through civil action, leading to delays in protecting its prerogatives. This was evident in the Miers case, where a favorable court decision was received but could not be enforced before the end of the Bush Administration. The Miers case highlighted challenges in enforcing congressional subpoenas against executive officials through civil action, leading to delays in protecting congressional prerogatives. Despite a favorable court decision, the committee was unable to enforce it before the end of the Bush Administration. The Miers case showed difficulties in enforcing congressional subpoenas against executive officials, leading to delays in protecting congressional prerogatives. The resulting litigation could involve a lengthy appeals process, as seen in the Miers case which was dismissed after 19 months without a decision on the merits. Despite gaining access to withheld information, the committee's ability to effectively oversee was diminished over time. Congress may not always be able to rely on the executive branch to enforce subpoenas effectively. The administration's refusal to disclose information has made it difficult for Congress to enforce subpoenas against executive branch officials. Congress may not always be able to rely on the executive branch or the judicial branch to enforce subpoenas promptly, but it can still enforce subpoenas through inherent contempt."
