Congress finds that one-third of minority youth are unemployed, the labor force participation rate is lower for individuals without a high school diploma, African-American and Hispanic students have a lower graduation rate, and high school dropouts from the class of 2004 will cost the nation over $325 billion in lost wages, taxes, and productivity.

Only 52 percent of students in the 50 largest cities in the United States graduate from high school, falling below the national average of 70 percent.

Approximately 75 percent of State prison inmates and 59 percent of Federal prison inmates have not completed high school. Increasing the high school completion rate by 1 percent for all men ages 20 to 60 would save the United States $1.4 billion annually in reduced crime costs. According to a recent study, a 10-percent increase in the male high school graduation rate would significantly reduce arrest rates for various crimes. The purpose of this Act is to provide resources to prevent disproportionate incarceration of eligible youth, especially minority youth, and prepare them for entry into society. The Act aims to reduce crime rates, particularly murder and assault, by providing resources to national nonprofit organizations for youth empowerment and employment readiness. SEC. 3.
