Government interventions to increase scientists and engineers may lead to inefficiencies in the labor market. Government interventions to increase the number of scientists and engineers may lead to inefficiencies in the S&E labor market, such as an oversupply of students with S&E degrees and lower salaries for graduates who find S&E jobs. Workforce projections for S&E occupations are unreliable for predicting shortages, resulting in the potential mismatch of students with S&E degrees and available jobs. Long-term projections for S&E occupations are unreliable due to unexpected changes in industrial output, technological advancements, and factor substitution. Relying on these projections may lead to an oversupply or shortage of students with S&E degrees, causing mismatches between education and market needs. Long-term projections for S&E occupations are unreliable due to unexpected changes in industrial output, technological advancements, and factor substitution. Shortages may exist in certain industries, occupations, or fields, such as new and emerging S&E fields like nanotechnology or cyclical industries like aerospace. Shortages in S&E occupations may arise due to various factors such as changes in prices, retirement behavior, availability of foreign labor, labor market demographics, and government policies. Shortages can be seen in new and emerging S&E fields like nanotechnology, cyclical industries like aerospace, and in fields restricted to employing only U.S. citizens. The labor market will naturally address these shortages if allowed to operate freely. Shortages in S&E occupations, including in new and emerging fields like nanotechnology and cyclical industries like aerospace, may be resolved by the labor market if allowed to operate freely. Government interventions may be necessary to address any adverse consequences of these shortages. Short-term shortages in S&E occupations can be resolved as wages adjust to balance demand and supply, or through increased labor supply in response to market signals. Government intervention may be needed to prevent adverse consequences, such as loss of technological leadership, lower economic performance, and diminished national security. Industry claims of shortages are often driven by a desire to cut costs or enhance current knowledge. Industry claims of shortages in S&E occupations are driven by a desire to lower labor costs and increase current knowledge through a continuous stream of young, lower-cost graduates. The real issue lies in a skills mismatch, not a shortage of people. Employers aim to reduce labor costs by hiring young, lower-cost graduates to replace older, higher-cost workers with outdated knowledge. The main issue is a skills mismatch, not a shortage of workers. Expanding immigration can help address the shortage in the S&E workforce, particularly in information technology. Expanding immigration can help address the shortage in the S&E workforce, particularly in information technology, by bringing in foreign scientists and engineers to meet the specific skills needed by employers. Expanding immigration to increase the number of foreign scientists and engineers in the United States can help address the shortage in the S&E workforce, particularly in information technology, by bringing in specific skills needed by employers. However, this may dampen market signals for more U.S. students to enter science and engineering, and could potentially depress wages and increase unemployment. Expanding immigration to bring in foreign scientists and engineers may dampen market signals for U.S. students in science and engineering, potentially depressing wages and reducing career opportunities. This could also discourage American students from pursuing S&E degrees and careers, as well as cloud labor market signals. U.S. students lag behind those of other nations in STEM knowledge. Federal efforts are needed to improve STEM education in the U.S. as American students lag behind their foreign counterparts in STEM knowledge. This disparity may lead to fewer talented U.S. scientists and engineers, lower economic growth, and reduced competitiveness. Building a stronger K-12 STEM education system through federal policies and programs is crucial. Federal efforts are crucial to improve STEM education in the U.S. as American students lag behind their foreign counterparts. This disparity may lead to fewer talented U.S. scientists and engineers, lower economic growth, and reduced competitiveness. Federal policies and programs can help build a stronger K-12 STEM education system, despite international assessments not accurately reflecting U.S. student STEM knowledge. Standardized tests comparing U.S. student STEM knowledge to other nations do not accurately reflect their preparation for S&E degrees or future capabilities as scientists and engineers. This leads to differing opinions on federal government's role in developing the S&E workforce. The federal government's role in fostering the development of the S&E workforce is a topic of debate, with discussions on increasing the number of students pursuing S&E degrees, admitting foreign scientists and engineers, promoting diversity in science and engineering, improving STEM education, and enhancing career counseling for high school students. Congress is exploring ways to enhance U.S. competitiveness and leadership in science, engineering, technology, and industry. The federal government is considering various strategies to strengthen the S&E workforce, including increasing diversity, improving STEM education, and providing better career counseling for high school students. Congress may take into account these perspectives as it seeks to enhance U.S. competitiveness in science, engineering, technology, and industry. Additionally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes data on the educational requirements for S&E occupations. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes data on the educational composition of occupations using the American Community Survey (ACS) data. This includes S&E Occupational Descriptions and Entry-Level Education Requirements, as well as the Composition of S&E Occupations by Education Level. A crosswalk of SOC codes to ACS codes is provided for reference. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) utilizes data from the American Community Survey (ACS) to analyze the educational composition of occupations. The ACS employs a condensed version of the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system, with a crosswalk provided at the end of the appendix. The occupational breakdown for S&E occupations in the ACS classifications is presented in chart form, with educational levels below associate's degrees grouped as \"Less than an Associate's degree.\" This category encompasses individuals with less than a high school diploma, a high school diploma or equivalent, and some education. The ACS occupational classifications for S&E occupations are shown in chart form, with educational levels below associate's degrees grouped as \"Less than an Associate's degree,\" including individuals with less than a high school diploma, a high school diploma or equivalent, and some college, no degree."
