PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATION. Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to include provisions regarding discrimination based on disparate impact. An aggrieved person must demonstrate that a covered entity has a policy or practice causing a disparate impact on race, color, or national origin. An aggrieved person can file a complaint if a covered entity's policy or practice causes a disparate impact based on race, color, or national origin, and the entity fails to show that it is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals. The covered entity can be held liable if their policy or practice causes a disparate impact based on race, color, or national origin, and they fail to show it is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals. The covered entity can be held liable if their policy or practice causes a disparate impact based on race, color, or national origin, and they fail to show it is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals. The aggrieved person must demonstrate that each challenged policy or practice causes a disparate impact, or show that a less discriminatory alternative exists and the entity refuses to adopt it. The aggrieved person must show that each challenged policy or practice causes a disparate impact, unless the decision-making process cannot be separated for analysis. If a covered entity proves that a specific policy does not cause a disparate impact, they are not required to demonstrate it further. The covered entity's decision-making process may be analyzed as one policy or practice if it cannot be separated for analysis. If a specific policy does not cause a disparate impact, the entity is not required to prove it further. Demonstrating that a policy is necessary for achieving program goals cannot be used as a defense against intentional discrimination claims. No person in the United States shall face discrimination or retaliation for opposing any prohibited policy or practice, or for participating in investigations or hearings related to discrimination. The term 'demonstrates' refers to meeting the burdens of production and persuasion. SEC. 4. RIGHTS OF ACTION.
