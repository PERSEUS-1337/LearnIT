    "content": "The \"Public Domain Enhancement Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. The findings section is included in the Act. The Congress finds that the copyright clause in the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing exclusive rights to authors for limited times, providing an economic incentive for creating new works. The copyright clause in the United States Constitution provides authors with economic incentives to create new works and promotes society's interest in the free flow of ideas and information. The copyright term is limited to ensure that the public is not permanently deprived of the fruits of creativity. The copyright term is limited to prevent permanent deprivation of an artist's work. Both commercial and noncommercial creators benefit from a healthy public domain, with book publishers printing public domain titles at reduced prices. Both commercial and noncommercial creators rely on a healthy public domain for various purposes, such as book publishers printing public domain titles at reduced prices and schools, museums, and libraries using works for educational purposes. The public domain is essential for creators in various industries, including book publishers, schools, museums, and media sources like the World Wide Web. It serves as a source of raw material for new productions and educational/cultural materials. The public domain is crucial for creating educational and cultural materials, benefiting media sources like the World Wide Web. Current law grants copyright protection to works published as early as 1923, but the majority of older works are no longer commercially available. Under current law, abandoned works published as early as 1923 are not commercially available, with only 2 percent retaining value. This hinders entities from utilizing and preserving these works, delaying their entry into the public domain. Under current law, abandoned works published as early as 1923 are not commercially available, hindering entities from utilizing and preserving them. This prevents building upon, cultivating, and preserving abandoned works, contrary to the intent of the Framers of the Constitution and Congress. The existing copyright system does not align with the original intent of the Constitution and Congress, as it hinders the public from accessing abandoned works without commercial or copyright purposes. Therefore, a mechanism is needed to allow abandoned American copyrights to enter the public domain. SEC. 3. MAINTENANCE FEE FOR PUBLISHED UNITED STATES WORKS.
