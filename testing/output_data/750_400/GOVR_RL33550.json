    "content": "Countervailing duty laws aim to help domestic industries facing injury from subsidized imports by imposing additional import duties equal to the estimated subsidy amount. Relief is granted if the International Trade Commission confirms material injury and the International Trade Administration finds the imports subsidized. The International Trade Commission and the International Trade Administration play key roles in determining relief for domestic industries facing injury from subsidized imports. Before a 2007 investigation on coated free sheet paper from China, CVD laws were not applied to nonmarket economy countries like China due to challenges in measuring market distortions caused by subsidies. The ITA found that subsidies could be identified in China for the 2007 CVD investigation on coated free sheet paper, despite previously considering China a nonmarket economy. The ITA found subsidies in China for the 2007 CVD investigation on coated free sheet paper, despite previously considering China a nonmarket economy. The ITA found subsidies in China for the 2007 CVD investigation on coated free sheet paper, despite previously considering China a nonmarket economy. This decision is specific to China and not applicable to other NME countries. The ITA designates countries as nonmarket economies based on various criteria such as currency convertibility, wage rates, foreign investment regulations, and government ownership. The ITA designates countries as nonmarket economies based on criteria like currency convertibility, wage rates, foreign investment regulations, and government ownership. NME designations are determined by factors such as currency convertibility, wage rates, foreign investment regulations, government ownership, and resource allocation control. The ITA designates countries as nonmarket economies based on criteria like currency convertibility, wage rates, foreign investment regulations, and government ownership. NME countries include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. The ITA first decided not to apply CVD action to NME countries in 1983-1984. The ITA decided not to apply CVD action to NME countries in 1983-1984, including China, which is the United States' second largest trading partner. China was designated as an NME country in 1983 and is the largest source of U.S. imports and the third largest export market. China, an NME country since 1983, is the US's second largest trading partner, largest source of imports, and third largest export market. The US trade deficit with China in 2009 was $227 billion, leading to calls in Congress for increased use of trade remedy laws against Chinese products, particularly concerning alleged illegal subsidy programs. Some in Congress support increased use of U.S. trade remedy laws against Chinese products due to the trade deficit and alleged impact on U.S. industries. Concerns include China's \"illegal\" subsidy programs to boost industries and exports. U.S. domestic producers have long claimed adverse effects from China's subsidies, but the 1984 ITA ruling limited recourse. China is the main target of U.S. antidumping actions, with over 80 duty orders in place. The 1984 ITA ruling limited recourse for U.S. domestic producers impacted by China's subsidies. China is the main target of U.S. antidumping actions, with over 80 duty orders in place. AD duty amounts are higher for Chinese imports due to ITA methodology. Concerns also exist about China's significantly undervalued currency compared to the U.S. As of August 12, 2010, there were over 80 AD duty orders in place, with higher amounts for Chinese imports due to ITA methodology. Concerns revolve around China's undervalued currency impacting the U.S. trade deficit and manufacturing sectors. The undervalued Chinese currency is believed to make Chinese exports cheaper, contributing to the U.S. trade deficit and harming U.S. manufacturing sectors. This has led to renewed congressional interest in countervailing actions against Chinese imports. The undervalued Chinese currency contributes to the U.S. trade deficit and harms U.S. manufacturing sectors, leading to renewed congressional interest in countervailing actions against Chinese imports. This includes concerns about alleged Chinese currency manipulation and the application of countervailing measures to address the issue. The ITA reaffirmed the NME classification for China in investigations on certain products. U.S. law considers any country designated as a nonmarket economy for countervailable actions. The ITA reaffirmed China's nonmarket economy classification for countervailable actions, which remains in effect until revoked. Subsidies were not found in NME countries, leading to no countervailing action against China until the CFS paper investigation in 2007. The ITA's nonmarket economy classification for countervailable actions against China remains in effect until revoked. Subsidies were not found in NME countries, leading to no countervailing action against China until the CFS paper investigation in 2007. China's NME designation may only be used for a limited time, as specified in its WTO accession package, allowing for alternative methodologies for antidumping and countervailing actions for 15 years after accession. The NME designation for China may only be used for a limited time, as specified in its WTO accession package, allowing for alternative methodologies for antidumping and countervailing actions for 15 years after accession. After December 11, 2016, the United States and other WTO members cannot use nonmarket economy or \"surrogate country\" methodology in CVD or AD investigations. In 1983-1984, the US had two countervailing duty laws imposing duties on subsidized products from their country of origin. The United States had two countervailing duty laws imposing duties on subsidized products from their country of origin. One law required a finding of injury to a U.S. domestic industry, while the other did not. The earlier law, Section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, was a modified version of a law from 1897. The countervailing duty laws in the United States required a finding of injury to a U.S. domestic industry caused by subsidized imports. The earlier law, Section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, was a modified version of a law from 1897 applicable to products of countries not \"under the Agreement.\" Section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, repealed in 1995, allowed for the levying of countervailing duties on subsidized imports from countries not covered by international trade agreements. Section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, repealed in 1995, allowed for countervailing duties on subsidized imports without the need for injury determination. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 added comprehensive provisions for countervailing legislation applicable to countries \"under the Agreement.\" The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 added countervailing legislation with broader country applicability, implementing provisions agreed upon in multilateral trade negotiations under the GATT in 1979. This legislation allows for countervailing duties on subsidized imports without the need for injury determination. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (P.L. 96-39) added countervailing legislation under the Tariff Act of 1930, implementing provisions from the GATT meeting in 1979. This legislation allows for countervailing duties on subsidized imports without the need for injury determination. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 added countervailing legislation under the Tariff Act of 1930, allowing for countervailing duties on subsidized imports without the need for injury determination. The URAA amended the countervailing duty law by requiring a determination of injury to a US industry caused by subsidized imports. The URAA amended the countervailing duty law to require injury determination in countervailing investigations of subsidized imports from countries other than \"Subsidies Agreement countries.\" The 1979 Act was amended to include provisions similar to section 303, which do not require injury determination in countervailing investigations of subsidized imports from countries other than \"Subsidies Agreement countries.\" Parallel investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland were initiated in 1983 based on petitions filed by U.S. steel manufacturers. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 is still in effect. Investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland were initiated in 1983 based on petitions by U.S. steel manufacturers alleging public benefits in the form of bounties or grants in both countries. The petitions for countervailing action alleged that manufacturers in Czechoslovakia and Poland received public benefits through various programs such as multiple exchange rate systems, hard-currency retention programs, industry-specific trade conversion coefficients, tax exemptions, and price equalization payments for losses incurred in foreign sales. Both cases proceeded in parallel. The Czechoslovakia and Poland cases involved public benefits like multiple exchange rate systems, hard-currency retention programs, industry-specific trade conversion coefficients, tax exemptions, and price equalization payments for foreign sales losses. Determinations were similar with minor country-specific differences. Page references in the report will focus on the Czechoslovak case unless a country-specific issue is discussed. In parallel, the ITA found Czechoslovakia and Poland to be \"countries not under the Agreement\" and conducted countervailing procedures under Section 303 without determining injury. Both countries were considered nonmarket economy (NME) countries, with minor country-specific differences. The ITA found Czechoslovakia and Poland to be \"countries not under the Agreement\" and conducted countervailing procedures under Section 303 without determining injury. They were considered nonmarket economy (NME) countries, with unresolved questions regarding the application of countervailing duty law to NME countries. The ITA found that nonmarket economy countries are not exempt from the countervailing duty law, as per Section 303, in the preliminary determinations of two carbon steel wire rod cases. This issue had previously arisen in a CVD investigation of textile imports from China but was not resolved as the petition was withdrawn. The CVD petition was withdrawn by the petitioners, leading to the termination of the investigation. The issue was addressed in the preliminary determinations of two carbon steel wire rod cases, where it was found that nonmarket economy countries are not exempt from the countervailing duty law. The ITA interpreted Section 303 to apply to \"any country,\" considering the effects of government intervention in market and nonmarket economies. The ITA, based on Section 303, considered the applicability of countervailing duty law to \"any country,\" including nonmarket economies. It decided not to exclude nonmarket economies without further review, aiming to determine if government practices confer countervailable benefits. Government intervention in market and nonmarket economies was considered by the ITA, which aimed to determine if practices in nonmarket economies confer countervailable benefits. In nonmarket economies, prices are set by central planners without considering economic value, leading to prices that do not reflect scarcity or abundance. The ITA analyzed how prices in nonmarket economies are set by central planners without regard to economic value, resulting in prices that do not reflect scarcity or abundance. This can lead to countervailable benefits in nonmarket economies. In nonmarket economies, prices are set by central planners without considering economic value, leading to prices that do not reflect scarcity. The ITA analyzed alleged subsidization programs to determine if they would confer a subsidy in a market economy and concluded that certain practices do not confer a bounty. The ITA analyzed alleged subsidization programs to determine if they confer a subsidy in a market economy. It concluded that multiple exchange rates, currency retention schemes, trade conversion coefficients, and price equalization payments do not constitute a bounty. The Polish adjustment coefficient program was also found not to be a bounty or grant. The ITA did not have enough information to make a determination on the Czechoslovak tax exemption program. The ITA found that multiple exchange rates, currency retention schemes, and price equalization payments do not constitute a subsidy in a market economy. The Polish adjustment coefficient program was also determined not to be a bounty or grant. Insufficient information was available on the Czechoslovak tax exemption program for a decision to be made. As a result, the ITA preliminarily concluded that the alleged practices in Czechoslovakia and Poland did not violate the CVD law, leading to continued investigations into their final phase. The ITA preliminarily determined that the alleged Czechoslovak and Polish practices were not providing bounties or grants within the meaning of the CVD law. The investigations continued into the final phase, focusing on the application of the CVD law to nonmarket economy countries. The ITA concluded that Congress never directly addressed the issue of whether the countervailing duty law applies to NME countries in the two carbon steel wire rod cases. The ITA focused on the application of the CVD law to nonmarket economy countries in the two carbon steel wire rod cases. Congress never directly addressed this issue in 1974 or 1979 when the CVD law was amended. The ITA found that Congress did not debate or legislate on the application of the CVD law to nonmarket economy countries in 1974 or 1979. The CVD law was restructured, focusing on unfair pricing legislation for dumping by NME countries. Congress enacted provisions in the Trade Act of 1974 specifically addressing injurious imports from \"State-controlled-economy\" or \"Communist\" countries, but not for countervailing action. This was highlighted by the ITA, citing the Senate report on the 1974 Act. The Trade Act of 1974 addressed injurious imports from \"State-controlled-economy\" or \"Communist\" countries in the context of antidumping and \"market disruption\" but not for countervailing action. Congress recognized the need for special legislation due to the unique economic conditions in these countries. Congress recognized the need for special remedial legislation for State-controlled-economy countries due to the unique economic conditions where supply and demand forces do not operate to produce prices. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 did not address the application of countervailing duty laws to non-market economy countries. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 did not address the application of countervailing duty laws to non-market economy countries, despite the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade permitting regulation of unfairly priced imports from these countries. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 did not cover countervailing duty laws for non-market economy (NME) countries, despite GATT allowing regulation of unfairly priced imports from NMEs. The ITA found it challenging to identify and quantify subsidies in NMEs due to the lack of market reference points. The ITA consulted with various sources and concluded that identifying and quantifying subsidies in non-market economies is challenging. The countervailing duty law requires measuring state-to-producer resource transfers, which is difficult in nonmarket economies. The extent of subsidization in a nonmarket system will always be unclear. The ITA concluded that identifying and measuring subsidies in non-market economies is challenging, as it is difficult to quantify state-to-producer resource transfers. The extent of subsidization in a nonmarket system will always be unclear. The ITA determined that Czechoslovakia and Poland were non-market economies, operating on nonmarket cost or pricing structures. As a result, manufacturers in these countries did not receive bounties or grants, leading to final negative countervailing duty determinations in 1984. The ITA determined that manufacturers in Czechoslovakia and Poland did not receive bounties or grants, leading to final negative countervailing duty determinations in 1984. Additionally, petitions were filed alleging subsidization of potassium chloride imported from the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union, resulting in investigations initiated in April 1984. The ITA rescinded potassium chloride investigations from the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union in 1984 due to the determination that bounties or grants could not be found in non-market economy countries. Investigations initiated on April 26, 1984 were rescinded by the ITA on June 6, 1984, in the potassium chloride cases due to the determination that bounties or grants could not be found in non-market economy countries. Since then, the ITA has not initiated any countervailing investigations of allegedly subsidized imports from NME countries, except for one specialized exception in 1991. The ITA initiated a countervailing duty investigation of Ceiling and Oscillating Fans Imported from China in 1991, based on a petition claiming that China operates under market principles despite being an NME country. The ITA initiated a countervailing duty investigation of Ceiling and Oscillating Fans Imported from China in 1991, based on a petition claiming that China operates under market principles despite being an NME country. The petitioner argued that the CVD law should apply due to the market-oriented industry in China. The concept of market-oriented industry (MOI) was introduced in antidumping investigations of imports from NME countries to determine if an industry is free from state control. In the Chinese fan CVD case, petitioners claimed the Chinese fan industry was an MOI with reliable self-provided data, allowing for a countervailing investigation. The ITA concluded in the Chinese fan CVD case that the industry cannot be considered a market-oriented industry (MOI) due to non-market-determined input prices, but the investigation was not rescinded and further verification was deemed necessary. The ITA concluded in the Chinese fan CVD case that the industry cannot be considered a market-oriented industry (MOI) due to non-market-determined input prices. The final determination was that the PC fans industry is not an MOI, leading to the CVD law not being applicable to the PRC fan industry. The ITA concluded that the PC fans industry is not an MOI due to non-market-determined input prices, leading to the CVD law not being applicable. The petitioners challenged the ITA's negative determinations in other cases in the U.S. Court of International Trade. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed determinations in the carbon steel wire rod cases and ordered investigations to be resumed in the potassium chloride cases. The court held that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies due to governmental subsidies found in both types of economies. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed determinations in the carbon steel wire rod cases and ordered investigations to be resumed in the potassium chloride cases, citing that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies due to governmental subsidies found in both types of economies. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed determinations in the carbon steel wire rod cases and ordered investigations to be resumed in the potassium chloride cases. The CIT addressed the grounds on which the ITA determined the nonapplicability of countervailing procedure to NME countries, highlighting errors in interpretation. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed determinations in the carbon steel wire rod cases and ordered investigations to be resumed in the potassium chloride cases. The CIT addressed errors in the ITA's interpretation of countervailing procedure for NME countries, emphasizing the need to apply the CVD law to any country regardless of market status. The U.S. Court of International Trade found that the ITA made an error in interpreting the CVD law by excluding subsidies in nonmarket economies. The court emphasized that the CVD law applies to all countries and does not allow for exemptions based on market status. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for creating exemptions for countries with nonmarket economies, which goes against the CVD law that applies to all countries without exceptions. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for creating exemptions for countries with nonmarket economies under the CVD law, which applies to all countries without exceptions. The CIT stated that the ITA has the authority to investigate deviations from regular patterns, regardless of the form of the economy. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for creating exemptions for countries with nonmarket economies under the CVD law. The CIT emphasized that the ITA has the authority to investigate deviations from regular patterns, regardless of the form of the economy. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for creating exemptions for countries with nonmarket economies under the CVD law, stating that the ITA has the authority to investigate deviations from regular patterns regardless of the form of the economy. The court also highlighted that Article 15 of the GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Code allows a country to choose between subsidy law or antidumping law for imports from a country with a state-controlled economy. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for creating exemptions for countries with nonmarket economies under the CVD law. Article 15 of the GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Code allows a country to choose between subsidy law or antidumping law for imports from a state-controlled economy. The court dismissed the ITA's reliance on economic academia's views regarding favoritism towards specific merchandise. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for creating exemptions for countries with nonmarket economies under the CVD law. The court dismissed the ITA's reliance on economic academia's views regarding favoritism towards specific merchandise, stating that the idea violates common sense and conflicts with a rational construction of the law. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for its broad discretion in determining subsidies, challenging administrative actions that were contrary to law. The U.S. government appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which reviewed the legislative history of relevant trade remedy laws in the potash cases. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the legislative history of trade remedy laws in the potash cases and concluded that the countervailing duty statute had remained substantially unchanged since 1897. The appellate court could not determine if the statute applied as Congress had not defined key terms. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that the countervailing duty statute, dating back to 1897, had not been clearly defined by Congress in terms of applying to nonmarket economies. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit grappled with whether the countervailing duty statute, dating back to 1897, should apply to nonmarket economies based on the language of the statute. Congress had not addressed this issue when the law was enacted, leaving the court to determine how Congress would have applied the statute to nonmarket economies if they had existed at the time. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had to determine if the countervailing duty statute from 1897 should apply to nonmarket economies. The court concluded that the economic incentives provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany did not constitute bounties or grants under the law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the economic incentives provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany for their potash exports to the United States did not qualify as bounties or grants under the countervailing duty law. The court upheld the ITA's discretion in determining the existence of bounties or grants. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the ITA's discretion in determining that the benefits provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany for potash exports to the United States were not considered bounties or grants under the countervailing duty law. The court vacated the CIT order and remanded the cases back with instructions to dismiss the complaint. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the ITA's decision that benefits for potash exports were not bounties or grants. The court vacated the CIT order and remanded the cases with instructions to dismiss the complaint. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the ITA's decision regarding potash exports, leading to immediate congressional reaction with H.R. 3 of the 100th Congress addressing countervailing duty laws for nonmarket economy countries. H.R. 3 of the 100th Congress addressed countervailing duty laws for nonmarket economy countries, requiring identification and measurement of subsidies by the ITA. The House version included procedural provisions for injury determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission, while the Senate version did not have a similar provision. The proposed statute on countervailing duty laws for nonmarket economy countries included procedural provisions for injury determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission, but this provision was dropped in the Senate version. Companion bills were introduced to apply CVD provisions to imports from state-controlled economy countries but were not further considered. In the Senate version, the House-passed language was dropped in conference. Companion bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty provisions to imports from state-controlled economy countries but were not further considered. The application of countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries was addressed in subsequent Congresses. In the 103rd and 104th Congresses, the application of countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy (NME) countries was addressed by expanding the definition of \"countervailable subsidy\" and prescribing its determination using a surrogate market-economy country method. Identical provisions were included in bills introduced in subsequent Congresses. In the 106th through 108th Congresses, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy (NME) countries for investigations of subsidies provided after the enactment of the respective act. In the 106th through 108th Congresses, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy (NME) countries for investigations of subsidies provided after the enactment of the respective act. In the 109th Congress, two identical bills were introduced on March 10, 2005, with provisions to address overseas subsidies. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty law to subsidized imports from nonmarket economy (NME) countries, based on petitions filed after the enactment of the legislation. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty law to subsidized imports from nonmarket economy (NME) countries, based on petitions filed after the enactment of the legislation. H.R. 1216 and H.R. 3283 focused on countervailing action against NME countries, including China, in trade-remedial legislation introduced in 2005. The United States Trade Rights Enforcement Act was introduced in 2005 to apply countervailing duty law to subsidized imports from nonmarket economy countries, including China. H.R. 3306, known as the Fair Trade with China Act of 2005, focused on trade issues with China and subjected all NME countries to countervailing action. The United States Trade Rights Enforcement Act of 2005 aimed to apply countervailing duty law to subsidized imports from nonmarket economy countries, including China. H.R. 1498, the Chinese Currency Act of 2005, sought to define foreign exchange-rate manipulation by China as a countervailable subsidy. Several bills in the 110th Congress also proposed applying countervailing duty law to NME countries. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed to address alleged foreign exchange-rate manipulation by China through countervailing duty law, including H.R. 1498 (\"Chinese Currency Act of 2005\") and bills introduced by various representatives. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed to address alleged foreign exchange-rate manipulation by China through countervailing duty law. Bills introduced included S. 364, H.R. 571, H.R. 708, H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, S. 796, H.R. 1229, S. 974, and S. 1919. In the 111th Congress, bills like H.R. 496 and H.R. 499 were introduced to address trade enforcement and nonmarket economy trade remedy. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to address foreign exchange-rate manipulation by China through countervailing duty law. In the 111th Congress, bills like H.R. 496 and H.R. 499 aimed to apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies without considering the ownership of the subsidy recipient. The \"Nonmarket Economy Trade Remedy Act of 2009\" seeks to apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies without considering ownership of the subsidy recipient or the level of economic reforms in the country. The administering authority is not required to consider the effect of the subsidy. The \"Nonmarket Economy Trade Remedy Act of 2009\" does not require the administering authority to consider the effect of the subsidy in determining its existence. It also prevents the ITA from considering market economy treatment for individual businesses in anti-dumping proceedings. The bills aim to prevent the ITA from considering market economy treatment for individual businesses in anti-dumping proceedings and provide a China-specific alternate methodology for determining subsidies. The bills aim to prevent the ITA from considering market economy treatment for individual businesses in anti-dumping proceedings and provide a China-specific alternate methodology for determining subsidies, ensuring independence from government control. Administrative authorities would use appropriate benchmarks to identify and calculate subsidy amounts, considering the unique conditions in China. Authorities would use methodologies to calculate benefits in China, adjusting terms if necessary. If China is deemed an NME country, special difficulties are presumed, and alternative benchmarks may be used. The authority may use terms and conditions prevailing outside of China to calculate subsidies if it is not practicable to determine the amount under Chinese conditions. If China is considered an NME country, special difficulties are presumed, and alternative benchmarks should be used. The bills aim to adjust for Chinese terms and conditions when calculating subsidies, using external benchmarks if necessary. They also propose that a country's NME status can only be revoked with approval from Congress. The Bush Administration started addressing concerns about China's practices in 2006. The Bush Administration took steps in late 2006 to address China's alleged subsidies of exports, including initiating a CVD investigation and consultations in the WTO. The bills propose specific language for a joint resolution of Congress to approve such determinations. In late 2006, the Bush Administration took steps to address China's alleged export subsidies. This included initiating a CVD investigation on a product from China and consultations in the WTO. The ITA announced a CVD investigation on CFS paper against China, with the ITC preliminarily determining that a U.S. domestic industry was threatened by subsidized coated paper from China. The International Trade Commission (ITC) preliminarily determined on December 15, 2006, that a U.S. domestic industry is materially injured or threatened by subsidized coated paper from China. The ITA also announced an affirmative preliminary determination of subsidy in the CVD investigation, with net countervailable subsidy rates ranging from 10.9% to 20.35%. The ITA made an affirmative preliminary determination of subsidy in the CVD investigation on coated free sheet paper from China, with net countervailable subsidy rates ranging from 10.9% to 20.35%. The final determination revealed that countervailable subsidies were provided, with final subsidy amounts ranging from 7.40% to 44.25%. The ITA's final determination in the CVD investigation on coated free sheet paper from China found countervailable subsidies ranging from 7.40% to 44.25%. Despite China's economic reforms, the ITA reaffirmed China as an NME country due to the state's significant role in the economy. The ITA's preliminary investigation on CFS paper found countervailable subsidies ranging from 7.40% to 44.25%. China's economy is significantly different from Soviet-style economies, with state control over investment decisions, money, and credit allocation. China's economy differs significantly from Soviet-style economies as market forces determine prices for over 90% of products, wages are negotiated rather than government-set, and private ownership is limited to consumer goods. The ITA analysis found that in China, market forces determine prices for over 90% of products, wages are negotiated, foreign currency access is easier, and private ownership rights are acknowledged by the government. The Chinese government has reduced the state's role in some areas while maintaining control over the economy. The ITA found that in China, market forces determine prices for over 90% of products, wages are negotiated, foreign currency is more accessible, and private ownership rights are acknowledged by the government. The Chinese government has reduced the state's role in some areas while maintaining control over the economy. This allows the agency to determine if the Chinese government has provided a benefit to Chinese producers, even though China is still considered a non-market economy country. The ITA concluded that China's economy allows for determining benefits to Chinese producers despite being a non-market economy. The ITC announced a negative determination of injury in investigations on CFS paper, citing reasons such as modest production capacity increases in China and Indonesia, no potential for product shifting, and lack of significant price effects from imports. The ITC found no injury in the investigations on CFS paper due to various factors such as modest production capacity increases in China and Indonesia, lack of potential for product shifting, and absence of significant price effects from imports. Based on the ITC's findings of no injury in the CFS paper investigations due to factors like moderate inventories, lack of negative effects on domestic industry, and no vulnerability, it was concluded that material injury from imports from China and Indonesia is unlikely without antidumping and countervailing duty orders. The domestic CFSP industry is not considered threatened with material injury from these imports. The investigation was terminated after the ITC's final negative CVD determination. The investigation into antidumping and countervailing duties on imports from China and Indonesia concluded that the domestic CFSP industry is not at risk of material injury. The ITC's final negative CVD determination led to the termination of the investigation, with duties refunded or canceled. The ITA was able to measure subsidies in China, although no CV duties were ultimately imposed. The investigation into antidumping and countervailing duties on imports from China and Indonesia concluded with duties refunded or canceled. The ITA determined subsidies in China, leading to the first CVD order on products from an NME country since 1983. Countervailing duties have been placed on 13 products from China, with 8 investigations pending. China filed suit in the Court of International. The investigation in late July 2008 resulted in the first CVD order on products from an NME country since 1983. Countervailing duties have been placed on 13 products from China, with 8 investigations pending. China filed suit in the Court of International Trade to prevent the ITA from continuing the CVD investigation. China filed suit in the Court of International Trade to prevent the ITA from continuing the CVD investigation, citing a previous ruling that questioned the application of CVD law to NME countries. The Court ruled it lacked jurisdiction due to no final determination being made, but noted that it was unclear if Commerce was prohibited from applying countervailing duty law to NMEs. China later requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with the United States. The Court of International Trade ruled it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case as no final determination had been made. It was unclear if Commerce was prohibited from applying countervailing duty law to NMEs. China requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with the United States regarding preliminary antidumping and countervailing duty determinations on CFS paper. No further action has been taken in the dispute. China requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with the United States on its preliminary antidumping and countervailing duty determinations on CFS paper. The U.S. Trade Representative announced the move on October 10, 2007, and requested public comments. China has been active in using AD investigations against products from the U.S. and other countries since joining the WTO. As of March 2010, China had 3 ongoing CVD investigations on U.S. products. China has been active in using countervailing duty (CVD) investigations against products from the United States since joining the WTO. By March 2010, Chinese authorities had 3 ongoing CVD investigations on U.S. products. In 2007, the USTR requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China over alleged illegal subsidies, leading to the termination of one challenged subsidy program by China. The USTR requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China over alleged illegal subsidies. China agreed to terminate one challenged subsidy program related to discounted loans for large exporters. The United States pointed to tax laws and measures used by China to provide tax refunds or exemptions to businesses purchasing domestically produced goods. The United States requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China over alleged illegal subsidies, including tax laws and measures providing tax refunds or exemptions to Chinese businesses purchasing domestically produced goods. These subsidies can distort trade conditions for U.S. manufacturers and inhibit exports of a wide range of products. China agreed to terminate subsidies that the U.S. alleged were illegal under WTO rules by January 1, 2008, to avoid distorting trade conditions for U.S. manufacturers and inhibiting exports to China. On November 29, 2007, USTR Schwab announced that China had agreed to terminate all subsidies deemed illegal under WTO rules by January 1, 2008. China signed MOUs with the United States and Mexico to eliminate prohibited subsidies, which were confirmed in the 2010 National Trade Estimate Report. China signed MOUs with the United States and Mexico to permanently eliminate WTO-prohibited subsidies. The USTR reported in 2010 that China had fulfilled this agreement. In December 2008, the US requested consultations with China over certain subsidies, leading to a settlement in December 2009 where China confirmed the removal of challenged export-contingent benefits. Certain measures in China offer grants, loans, and incentives to enterprises based on export performance criteria. A settlement in December 2009 confirmed the removal of challenged export-contingent benefits. Despite the identification of subsidies in China, Congress is considering legislation to combat unfair trade practices. Congress is considering legislation to combat unfair trade practices in China, despite the identification of subsidies. The ITA's decision to identify subsidies in China does not affect its standing as a nonmarket economy country or the NME designations of other countries. The ITA's decision to identify subsidies in China does not impact its status as a nonmarket economy country or the NME designations of other countries. Congress may need to consider legislation to ensure that CVD laws apply to other NME countries like Vietnam. Congress may want to consider legislation to ensure that CVD laws apply to other NME countries besides China, such as Vietnam. Trade with other NME countries like Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan is not significant currently, with no outstanding AD orders or major trade disputes. There are no specific factors or methodologies provided in trade remedy laws for administrative authorities to use. Currently, trade with NME countries like Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan is not significant, with no outstanding AD orders or major trade disputes. There are no specific factors or methodologies provided in trade remedy laws for administrative authorities to use when identifying subsidies in nonmarket economies. The antidumping statute does provide a methodology for determining normal value in NME countries. The antidumping statute provides a methodology for determining normal value in nonmarket economy countries, allowing the use of market economy inputs. Countervailing duties have trade-offs compared to antidumping duties, with duties on imports from nonmarket economy countries being even higher due to the third-country data methodology used. Making CVD procedures available to U.S. industries has trade-offs, with AD duties generally higher than countervailing duties. AD duties on imports from nonmarket economy countries are even higher, partly due to the third-country data methodology. If China retains its NME status and subsidies are found on targeted merchandise with existing AD duties, some companion AD duties may need adjustment to avoid double counting. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted the uncertainty in calculating the total protection level for Chinese products due to the possible revision of companion anti-dumping (AD) duties to avoid double counting of export subsidies. This could result in lower combined rates than expected, raising concerns about the accuracy of targeting subsidies in China. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) raised concerns about the uncertainty in calculating total protection levels for Chinese products due to potential revisions in anti-dumping duties. This could lead to lower combined rates than anticipated, impacting the accuracy of targeting subsidies in China and potentially reducing overall protection levels. The GAO expressed concerns about uncertainties in calculating total protection levels for Chinese products, potentially leading to lower rates than expected. This could affect the accuracy of targeting subsidies in China and result in an overall reduction in protection levels. Additionally, different remedies like legislation amendments or CVD procedures may provide relief to U.S. industries previously unable to obtain it through the AD statute."
