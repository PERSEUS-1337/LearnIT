    "content": "Most civilian federal employees are covered by either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). CSRS covers employees hired before 1984, while FERS covers those hired in 1984 or later. CSRS enrollees do not pay Social Security taxes or earn benefits, while FERS enrollees do. Both systems allow contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), but only FERS enrollees receive employer matching contributions. Employees enrolled in CSRS do not pay Social Security taxes or earn benefits, while those in FERS do. Both systems allow contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), but only FERS enrollees receive employer matching contributions. CSRS and FERS are not subject to ERISA, which protects spouses and former spouses of participants in private-sector retirement plans. ERISA, governing private-sector retirement plans, protects spouses and former spouses by requiring certain benefits and compliance with QDROs. Written consent of both spouses is necessary for retirement plan changes. ERISA mandates that defined benefit pension plans offer a joint and survivor annuity as the default form of benefit. Qualified domestic relations orders (QDROs) from state courts must be followed in dividing retirement benefits during divorce. Married participants in defined contribution plans need spousal consent to name a beneficiary other than their spouse. Federal employees' retirement benefits are regulated separately. In defined contribution plans, spousal consent is required to name a beneficiary other than the spouse in case of the participant's death. Federal employees' retirement benefits are governed by Title 5 of the United States Code, similar to ERISA for private-sector plans but with some differences. Federal employees' retirement benefits under Title 5 of the United States Code are similar to private-sector plans governed by ERISA, with some key differences. Both require spousal consent for certain decisions, such as waiving a survivor annuity, but laws differ on pension division in divorce cases. Title 5, like ERISA, mandates joint and survivor annuity as default for CSRS and FERS benefits, requiring participant and spouse consent to waive it. ERISA and Title 5 differ on when pension payments to former spouses can start post-divorce. ERISA allows payments when the plan participant reaches retirement age, while Title 5 has different criteria. Under ERISA, pension payments to a former spouse can begin when the plan participant reaches retirement age, regardless of whether the participant has retired. In contrast, Title 5 prohibits payment of any part of a CSRS or FERS annuity to a former spouse until the employee has separated from federal service, is eligible to receive an annuity, and has applied for it. This is a key difference between ERISA and Title 5 in terms of when pension payments to former spouses can commence. Title 5 prohibits payment of any part of a CSRS or FERS annuity to a former spouse until the employee has separated from federal service, is eligible to receive an annuity, and has applied for it. Another difference is in the designation of beneficiaries in defined contribution plans, where ERISA requires spousal consent for naming a beneficiary, while federal regulations allow more flexibility. The difference between ERISA and Title 5 lies in the designation of beneficiaries in defined contribution plans. ERISA requires spousal consent for naming a beneficiary, while federal regulations allow more flexibility, allowing a participant in the Thrift Savings Plan to name anyone as the plan beneficiary without spousal consent. Federal regulations for the Thrift Savings Plan allow participants to name beneficiaries without spousal consent. A state court decree can award a former spouse a share of retirement annuity or survivor annuity, or both. The court order must specify both benefits for OPM to pay them. Section 8346 of Title 5 exempts certain regulations. The court order must specify both retirement annuity and survivor annuity for OPM to pay them to a former spouse of a federal employee under Section 8345 of Title 5. Section 8346 of Title 5 exempts CSRS from state court proceedings, but Section 8345 allows a former spouse of a federal employee to receive a share of the employee's CSRS retirement annuity based on a court order. OPM will divide the annuity as directed by the court order and pay the specified share to the former spouse. Payments will only be divided after OPM receives the court order. OPM will divide the retired employee's monthly annuity as directed by a court order and pay the specified share to the former spouse. Payments will only be divided after OPM receives the court order. The former spouse's right to receive a share of the annuity ends upon the retired employee's death. The former spouse's right to receive a share of a retired federal employee's retirement annuity ends upon the employee's death. To receive a survivor annuity, the retiree must have elected it for the former spouse or a court order must specify it. A former spouse may receive a CSRS survivor annuity if the employee elected it or if a state court decree requires it. A former spouse of a deceased federal employee may receive a CSRS survivor annuity if the employee elected a survivor annuity for the former spouse or if a state court decree of divorce, annulment, or separation requires a survivor annuity. The survivor annuity is 55% of the retired worker's single-life annuity. The retired worker's annual pension is reduced to fund the joint and survivor annuity, entitling the spouse or former spouse to a survivor annuity equal to 55% of the original annuity amount. A CSRS survivor annuity is 55% of the retired worker's single-life annuity. The worker's annual pension is reduced to fund the survivor annuity, with the spouse or former spouse entitled to 55% of the original annuity amount. The total survivor annuities paid to spouses and former spouses cannot exceed 55% of the single-life annuity. The CSRS survivor annuity is equal to 55% of the worker's full annuity. If a former spouse has been awarded the full survivor annuity, the current spouse is not entitled to it unless the former spouse dies or remarries before age 55. If a survivor annuity has been awarded to a former spouse through a court order, the employee's current spouse is not entitled to receive it unless the former spouse has died or remarried before age 55. The annuity paid to a former spouse of a federal employee ends if the former spouse dies or remarries before age 55, except if the marriage to the employee lasted at least 30 years after January 1, 1995. If the remarriage ends in death, divorce, or annulment, the annuity restarts in the same amount.

OPM will not honor a court order if the former spouse waived their right to it. Refunding contributions forfeits the right to a CSRS annuity. State courts can block refunds if a former spouse is awarded a share of the annuity. If an employee separates from federal service and chooses to receive a refund of their retirement contributions, they lose the right to a CSRS annuity. State courts can prevent refunds if a former spouse is entitled to a portion of the annuity. FERS retirement annuities can be divided between a federal annuitant and a former spouse according to a state court decree. Section 8467 of Title 5 allows for the division of a FERS retirement annuity between a federal annuitant and a former spouse based on a state court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation. OPM will divide the annuity as directed by the court order and pay the specified share to the former spouse after the employee has separated from federal service. The retired federal employee's monthly annuity will be divided between the employee and former spouse as directed by a court order. OPM will only execute the division after the employee has separated from federal service, is eligible for an annuity, and has applied for it.

A court order can specify a survivor annuity for a former spouse of a federal employee under FERS. The annuity is 50% of the retired worker's single-life annuity, funded by a 10% reduction in the retiree's annuity amount. This allows the spouse or former spouse to receive 50% of the full annuity before the reduction. The survivor annuity under FERS is 50% of the single-life annuity, funded by a 10% reduction in the retiree's annuity amount. The spouse or former spouse is entitled to 50% of the worker's full annuity before the reduction. An employee can provide for one FERS spouse survivor annuity, with the total amount not exceeding 50% of the single-life annuity. The FERS survivor annuity is limited to 50% of the retiree's full annuity. If a former spouse receives the full survivor annuity through a court order, the current spouse is not eligible unless the former spouse dies or remarries before age 55. The survivor annuity ends upon the death or remarriage of the spouse or former spouse before age 55. If a former spouse receives the full survivor annuity through a court order, the current spouse is not eligible unless the former spouse dies or remarries before age 55.

If an employee in FERS dies after 18 months but less than 10 years of service, the spouse is eligible for a lump-sum survivor benefit. If an employee in FERS dies after completing at least 18 months but fewer than 10 years of service, the spouse is eligible for a lump-sum survivor benefit equal to half of the employee's annual basic pay plus a lump-sum payment. This benefit can be paid to a former spouse or divided between a current and former spouse as per a state court order. If the employee dies after completing at least 10 years of service, the surviving spouse or former spouse receives a lump sum and an annuity equal to 50% of the employee's earned annuity at the time of death.
