The training method described involves meta-learning the approximate posterior predictive distribution to minimize the KL-divergence between true and approximate distributions. The goal is to find parameters that best approximate the posterior predictive distribution in an average KL sense, enabling recovery of the true posterior if the approximation is rich enough. Training involves meta-learning the approximate posterior predictive distribution to minimize KL-divergence. Parameters \u03c6 are optimized to approximate the true posterior, supporting accurate prediction through Bayesian decision theory. The training process includes selecting a task, sampling training data, and forming the posterior. The amortized procedure meta-learns approximate inference for accurate prediction by selecting tasks, sampling training data, forming the posterior predictive, and optimizing log-density. This unbiased estimate is then optimized through simulating approximate inference procedures. The procedure involves meta-learning approximate inference for accurate prediction by forming the posterior predictive distribution and optimizing log-density.

The proposed approach involves a shared feature extractor neural network feeding into task-specific linear classifiers for few-shot image classification. The method aims to avoid specifying the number of few-shot classes ahead of time and limits inference to a chosen number, addressing challenges in metalearning systems that output large matrices directly. The approach involves using q \u03c6 (\u03c8|D, \u03b8) to model the distribution over weight matrices in R d \u03b8 \u00d7C. It avoids specifying the number of few-shot classes ahead of time and limits inference to a chosen number. The weight vectors are context-independent and depend only on examples from each class, allowing for individual feature extraction instances pooling regression onto stochastic inputs. The approach involves specifying weight vectors \u03c8 c independently for each class, pooling regression onto stochastic inputs, and mapping them onto new images through a generator \u03b8. An amortization network reduces the number of learned parameters by operating directly on extracted features h \u03b8 (x). The amortization network reduces the number of learned parameters by operating directly on extracted features h \u03b8 (x) and maps k image/angle examples of a particular object-instance to the corresponding stochastic input. End-to-end training is employed, backpropagating to \u03b8 through the inference network. The classification matrix \u03c8 is constructed based on the number of observed examples in each class. In our implementation, end-to-end training is used, backpropagating to \u03b8 through the inference network. The classification matrix \u03c8 is constructed by performing C feed-forward passes through the inference network q \u03c6 (\u03c8|D, \u03b8). The assumption of context independent inference is approximated and justified theoretically and empirically in Appendix B. The classification matrix \u03c8 is constructed by performing C feed-forward passes through the inference network q \u03c6 (\u03c8|D, \u03b8). The assumption of context independent inference is an approximation, supported by theoretical and empirical justification in Appendix B. This approximation addresses the limitations of naive amortization by reducing the number of parameters needed for inference. Ratio Estimation BID36 BID49 shows that full approximate posterior distributions are close to context independent counterparts, addressing limitations of naive amortization. This allows for fewer parameters in the inference network, meta-training with different class numbers, and varying class numbers at test-time. VERSA for Few-Shot Image Reconstruction (Regression) tackles a challenging few-shot learning task. VERSATILE Few-Shot Image Reconstruction (Regression) involves a complex output space where view reconstruction is achieved through multi-output regression from training images to output images with specified orientations. The model allows for meta-training with varying class numbers and class numbers that can change at test-time. The task involves view reconstruction by inferring object appearance from different angles using a generative model similar to GAN or VAE. A latent vector and angle representation are input to the generator to produce images at specified orientations. The generator's parameters are considered global in this setting. Our generative model, similar to GAN or VAE, uses a latent vector and angle representation as inputs to produce images at specified orientations. The generator's parameters are global, while the latent inputs are task-specific. A Gaussian likelihood in pixel space is used for the generator's outputs, with a sigmoid activation to ensure output means between zero and one. The generator network uses global parameters for image generation, with task-specific parameters as latent inputs. A Gaussian likelihood in pixel space is employed for the outputs, with a sigmoid activation for output normalization.

Comparisons are made with previous approaches to VERSA.Gradient-Based Meta-Learning. In ML-PIP, task-specific parameters are estimated using point estimates and comparisons are made with previous approaches to VERSA.Gradient-Based Meta-Learning. This involves semi-amortized inference with shared initialization and learning rate parameters, requiring optimization for each task. Model-agnostic meta-learning is recovered by Eq. (6). The curr_chunk discusses the process of semi-amortized inference in ML-PIP, where only shared initialization and learning rate parameters are used, requiring optimization for each task. It also mentions the recovery of Model-agnostic meta-learning by Eq. (6) and provides a perspective on the update choice. Model-agnostic meta-learning BID10 presents a perspective on semi-amortized ML-PIP, complementary to BID16's justification of one-step gradient parameter update in MAML. The update choice is viewed as amortization trained using predictive KL, recovering test-train splits. VERSA, unlike other methods, is distributional over \u03c8 and eliminates the need for back-propagation through gradient updates. VERSAs approach to update choice is seen as amortization trained using predictive KL, recovering test-train splits. Multiple gradient steps can be input into an RNN to compute \u03c8 * and recover BID44. Unlike other methods, VERSA is distributional over \u03c8, eliminating the need for back-propagation through gradient updates during training and simplifying inference by treating both local and global parameters. Metric-Based Few-Shot Learning involves using task-specific parameters for the top layer softmax weights and biases of a neural network, while the shared parameters are the lower layer weights. Amortized point estimates for these parameters are constructed by averaging the top-layer activations for each class, leading to a predictive distribution that recovers prototypical networks using a Euclidean distance function. The text discusses amortized point estimates for top-layer parameters in few-shot learning, comparing prototypical networks with a distributional approach called VERSA. The latter uses a flexible amortization function beyond simple averaging of activations. In comparison to prototypical networks, VERSA utilizes a more flexible amortization function for distributional learning, going beyond simple averaging of activations. BID43 proposed a method for predicting class weights from pre-trained network activations to support online learning with few-shot classes and transfer learning between high-shot and low-shot classification tasks using hyper-networks. VERSATILE (VERSA) goes beyond simple averaging of activations with a flexible amortization function for distributional learning. It utilizes hyper-networks to support online learning with few-shot classes and transfer learning between high-shot and low-shot classification tasks. The ML-PIP framework pre-trains \u03b8 and performs MAP inference for \u03c8 to amortize learning about weights. The amortization network in VERSATILE is more general, supporting full multi-task learning by sharing information between tasks. It trains conditional models via maximum likelihood, establishing a strong connection to training a conditional model via maximum likelihood estimation.

It shows substantial improvement in log-likelihood and accuracy compared to standard and amortized VI methods. The inference procedure of VERSA significantly improves over amortized VI due to VI's tendency to under-fit, especially for small data points, and using non-amortized VI is slower in forming the posterior. Using non-amortized VI improves performance substantially, but does not reach the level of VERSA.

When reduced to 2-dimensions, weights cluster by class with some overlap and outliers. For tasks containing both class '1' and '2', class '2' weights are located away from their cluster, suggesting independence of class-weights across tasks. If the model lacks capacity to assign class weights properly, inference may be affected for tasks with classes from similar regions of space. For tasks with classes '1' and '2', class '2' weights are often located away from their cluster, indicating independence of class-weights.
