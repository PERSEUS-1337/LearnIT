    "content": "The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program offers private health insurance to federal employees, retirees, and their dependents, with over $40 billion in annual benefits. Approximately 8.2 million individuals are covered each year, with 85% of employees and 90% of retirees participating. Coverage options include individual, family, and self plus one plans starting in 2016. Coverage options in FEHB are voluntary, with 85% of federal employees and 90% of retirees participating. Eligible individuals can choose individual, family, or self plus one coverage in an approved health benefits plan. Plans are either fee-for-service (FFS) or health maintenance organizations (HMOs), with premiums shared between the federal government and the employee or retiree. Benefits and cost sharing vary among FEHB plans. Prior to the creation of FEHB in 1959, federal employees were unable to obtain health insurance through the federal government; instead, they could purchase plans from fee-for-service (FFS) or health maintenance organizations (HMOs) that covered basic services such as hospital and physician care with shared premiums. Cost sharing varies among FEHB plans, covering basic services like hospital and physician care with deductibles, co-payments, or coinsurance. Before FEHB's creation in 1959, federal employees could purchase health insurance independently or through union plans. By 1950, private sector employers commonly offered health insurance, with some covering part of the premiums. President Truman's Commission on Health in 1951 also addressed this issue. By 1950, private sector employers commonly offered health insurance, with some covering part of the premiums. President Truman's Commission on Health in 1951 recommended federal government health insurance coverage for employees. Congress passed the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) to establish eligibility and coverage parameters. President Truman's Commission on the Health Needs of the Nation recommended federal government health insurance coverage for its employees. Congress passed the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA), which established eligibility, coverage parameters, types of health plans, benefits, and the government's share of premiums. It also created an Employees Health Benefits Fund and outlined the role of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established eligibility, coverage parameters, types of health plans, benefits, and the government's share of premiums. It also created an Employees Health Benefits Fund and outlined the role of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM has the authority to contract with insurers and manage FEHB. The general model of FEHB, with enrollees choosing coverage from private insurers, has remained unchanged despite amendments. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established eligibility, coverage parameters, types of health plans, benefits, and the government's share of premiums. OPM has the authority to contract with insurers and manage FEHB. The general model of FEHB, with enrollees choosing coverage from private insurers, has remained unchanged despite amendments. However, many aspects of FEHB have been modified, such as the formula for determining the government's share of premiums. Since its inception, the Federal Employees Health Benefits program has seen various modifications, including changes in the government's share of premiums and expansions in eligibility, services, and benefits. Congress plays a role in proposing and reacting to changes in the program. Policymakers and researchers have shown interest in FEHB. The Federal Employees Health Benefits program has seen an increase in the government's share of premiums and expansions in eligibility, services, and benefits. Congress plays a role in modifying the program. Policymakers and researchers view FEHB as a model for health insurance programs. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program is seen as a successful model for private and public health insurance programs. It allows enrollees to choose from competing insurers with minimal intervention, making cost-conscious decisions. Researchers are exploring ways to apply aspects of the FEHB model to other healthcare programs like Medicare. Expanding access to FEHB or creating similar programs is also being considered to provide coverage to more individuals. The FEHB model is successful in allowing enrollees to make cost-conscious choices and controlling overall cost growth. Researchers are looking into applying aspects of the FEHB model to other healthcare programs like Medicare. Policymakers are considering expanding access to FEHB or creating new programs modeled after it to provide coverage to more individuals. Some have suggested that FEHB features could serve as a good model for state-level health insurance. Some policymakers are considering creating new programs or expanding FEHB eligibility to provide coverage to more individuals, including small business employees and the uninsured. Lessons learned from FEHB may be useful for establishing health insurance exchanges at the state and federal levels. Congressional interest in FEHB extends beyond its potential applicability to other healthcare programs.

Congressional interest in FEHB extends beyond its potential applicability to other healthcare programs. Congress has a financial interest in the program and legislative authority to ensure its viability and sustainability. The report provides information on how Congress has interacted with the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, including its financial interest and legislative authority to restructure the program for viability and sustainability. It also discusses the evolution of FEHB and certain changes to the program. Congress has the legislative authority to restructure FEHB to maintain or improve its function. The report details how Congress has interacted with FEHB in the past, including changes to the program such as conditioning federal funds on policy changes, adjusting the government's share of FEHB premiums, modifying eligibility, and implementing policies affecting Medicare and FEHB. Congress has conditioned the use of federal funds on policy changes in FEHB, changed the formula for determining the government's share of FEHB premiums, modified eligibility for the program, and implemented policies affecting the relationship between Medicare and FEHB. Congress can place conditions on federal funds to make changes to FEHB, as seen in the 1983 law prohibiting the use of appropriated federal funds. In 1983, Congress passed a law prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortions under FEHB, except in cases of danger to the woman's life. This provision was renewed annually with minor changes until 1994 and 1995 when it was excluded by the 103rd Congress. It was later reinstated with restrictions allowing funds for cases of danger to the woman's life, rape, or incest.

In 1978, part-time employees were included, and in 1988, certain temporary workers were also eligible. Additionally, in 1988, Congress authorized temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) for employees separated from service for reasons other than gross misconduct to continue coverage in FEHB by paying the entire premium. In 1988, Congress extended FEHB coverage to certain temporary workers and authorized temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) for separating employees.

In general, TCC is available to separating employees and their dependents for up to 18 months after the date of separation, with exceptions for children aging out of their parents' plans. FEHB was established five years prior to Medicare, and in the early years there was little interaction between the programs largely because federal employees and retirees were not eligible for Medicare based on their federal employment. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program was established five years before Medicare. Initially, there was little interaction between the programs because federal employees and retirees were not eligible for Medicare based on their federal employment. However, in 1982, Congress passed a law that allowed federal workers to be eligible for Medicare based on their federal employment.

Employee Organization Plans provide health benefits to members of the organization, while Comprehensive Medical Plans are group-practice prepayment plans. Employee Organization Plans provide health benefits to members of the organization, including employees, retirees, and their families. These plans are sponsored or underwritten by employee organizations and are administered either through group-practice prepayment plans or individual-practice prepayment plans. Plans\u2014either group-practice prepayment plans or individual-practice prepayment plans provide health services on a prepaid basis.

FEHB plans must comply with various provisions of the ACA, some of which may impose new requirements on the plans. The ACA contains provisions that apply to health insurance coverage, including FEHB plans. Some provisions have no impact on FEHB plans, while others introduce new requirements. OPM has provided guidance to FEHB plans on implementing ACA provisions, sometimes expanding their scope. For example, FEHB plans must implement certain provisions before the specified effective dates, such as allowing adult children up to age 26 to remain on or enroll in their parent's health insurance. OPM has expanded ACA provisions for FEHB plans, requiring implementation before specified dates. Adult children up to age 26 can stay on parent's plan, effective January 2011. TCC available for 3 years post-26. Disabled children can also stay on parent's plan until age 26. The ACA required new plans to offer preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs, while FEHB plans have historically covered many of these services since 2011. Disabled children can remain on their parent's plan indefinitely if the disability occurred before age 26. The ACA required new plans to offer preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs, while FEHB plans historically covered many of these services since 2011.

Plans may waive cost sharing for preventive care only when beneficiaries use in-network providers. The ACA requires plans to waive cost sharing for preventive care services since 2011. Plans must provide a summary of benefits and coverage to applicants and enrollees. The ACA requires plans to provide a summary of benefits and coverage (SBC) and a uniform glossary of terms to applicants and enrollees. The SBC offers clear information on a plan's benefits, while the glossary helps consumers understand health insurance terms. OPM mandated all FEHB plans to offer an SBC and glossary for the 2013 plan year. The ACA also banned lifetime limits on certain health benefits and mandated plans to provide preventive care services without cost sharing since 2011. The ACA required FEHB plans to eliminate lifetime limits on certain health benefits and establish restricted annual limits before January 1, 2014. OPM mandated all FEHB plans to provide a glossary of terms for the 2013 plan year to help consumers understand health insurance terms. The ACA required FEHB plans to establish restricted annual limits on benefits before January 1, 2014, similar to lifetime limits. OPM expected all plans to eliminate limits on specified benefits in 2013 and comply with coverage requirements for clinical trials. The act also prohibited preexisting condition exclusions. The ACA required FEHB plans to eliminate limits on specified benefits and comply with coverage requirements for clinical trials starting in 2013. It also prohibited preexisting condition exclusions, which had little impact on FEHB plans as they were already prohibited. Additionally, FEHB plans must report a medical loss ratio. The ACA required FEHB plans to report a medical loss ratio, which is the ratio of plan-incurred claims to total premium revenue. Starting in 2011, large group plans, including FEHB plans, had to provide annual rebates to enrollees based on this ratio. Starting in 2011, the ACA required large group plans, including FEHB plans, to provide annual rebates to enrollees if the ratio of premium revenue spent on clinical claims and health quality costs is less than 85%. Carriers must issue rebates directly to OPM, which are then deposited into the health plan's contingency reserve to reduce the following year's premiums. The act also modified the definition of qualified medical claims. The ACA requires carriers to issue rebates to OPM if the premium revenue spent on clinical claims and health quality costs is less than 85%. The rebate is deposited into the health plan's contingency reserve to reduce the following year's premiums. The act also changed the definition of qualified medical expenses for tax-advantaged accounts. OTC medicines are not covered unless prescribed by a physician, with insulin being the only exception. The act modified the definition of qualified medical expenses for tax-advantaged accounts, excluding over-the-counter medicines unless prescribed by a physician. The penalty for nonqualified HSA withdrawals for those under 65 was raised from 10% to 20%. Maximum annual contributions to Health Care Flexible Spending Accounts were lowered starting in 2013.

Eligible Indian tribes can purchase FEHB for their tribal employees since May 1, 2012. The ACA allowed eligible Indian tribes to purchase FEHB for tribal employees, with the tribe paying the government's share of the premium. Administrative requirements were imposed on employers affecting federal agencies. Coverage is not available to retirees. The ACA allowed eligible Indian tribes to purchase FEHB for tribal employees, with the tribe paying the government's share of the premium. The act imposed administrative requirements on employers, including providing the aggregate cost of employer-sponsored coverage on an employee's W-2. Insurers, self-insuring employers, government agencies, and employers were required to file a return with the names of individuals receiving minimum essential coverage starting in 2014. After December 31, 2010, the ACA required employers to provide the aggregate cost of employer-sponsored coverage on an employee's W-2, becoming mandatory in 2012. Starting in 2014, insurers, self-insuring employers, government agencies, and employers had to file a return with individual names receiving minimum essential coverage. The effective date of this requirement was delayed until 2015. The ACA requires employers to provide the cost of employer-sponsored coverage on an employee's W-2 starting in 2012. Insurers and employers must file a return with individual names receiving minimum essential coverage, effective in 2015.
