    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature of California prioritizes improving occupational health and safety for family child care providers to ensure a safer environment for both providers and the children under their care. Family child care providers face occupational health and safety hazards such as toxic chemicals, illness, stress, and physical strain. They have musculoskeletal injury rates similar to industrial workers. Since they lack workers' compensation insurance, it is crucial for them and the children in their care to receive proper training to prevent injuries and illnesses on the job. The director must annually publish a list of licensed child day care facilities, excluding small family day care homes, detailing their services and licensed capacity. The department must protect the privacy of small family day care homes by not including their names and addresses on the lists.
