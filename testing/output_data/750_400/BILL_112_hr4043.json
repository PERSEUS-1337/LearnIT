    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Military Readiness and Southern Sea Otter Conservation Act\" and focuses on the conservation of Southern Sea Otters. The Congress finds that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service developed a relocation and management plan for southern sea otters as authorized by Public Law 99-625. The plan has been administered since August 1987. National defense-related activities at San Nicolas Island have not adversely affected southern sea otters. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service developed a relocation and management plan for southern sea otters in 1987, in accordance with Public Law 99-625. National defense-related activities at San Nicolas Island have not harmed the otters, but the expansion of the otter population into the designated management zone may pose national security concerns. Military training programs need flexibility to adapt to real-world events. The management zone designated by Public Law 99-625 may have national security impacts due to evolving military training programs that require flexibility. Sikes Act Compliant Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans in California address special management needs for threatened species and provide conservation benefits to marine environments. Public Law 99-625 allows otters at San Nicolas Island to be a nonessential experimental population, providing flexibility for military training programs. Public Law 99-625 designates otters at San Nicolas Island as a nonessential experimental population to accommodate military readiness requirements. The purpose is to enhance conservation of the southern sea otter and promote its growth towards an optimal sustainable population. The designation should continue to provide flexibility for military readiness requirements as guaranteed by Public Law 99-625. The purpose is to enhance conservation of the southern sea otter and its growth towards an optimum sustainable population while allowing for military readiness activities. The Secretary of Defense shall establish Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas for national defense purposes, including the area that includes Naval Base Ventura County San. The Secretary of Defense shall establish Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas for national defense purposes, including Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island and Begg Rock, with specific coordinates delineated. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas include Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island, Begg Rock, and Naval Base Coronado San Clemente Island, with specific coordinates delineated for each area. The San Clemente Island 3NM Safety Zone includes Naval Base Coronado San Clemente Island and adjacent waters up to 3 nautical miles from the shore, designated on May 20, 2010. Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and surrounding waters are also included within specific coordinates. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas include Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and adjacent waters within specific coordinates designated on May 20, 2010. Activities within this area may result in incidental takings under the Endangered Species Act. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas, including Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, are designated coordinates where incidental takings of southern sea otters during military activities are exempt from the Endangered Species Act. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas, such as Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, are exempt from the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act for incidental takings of southern sea otters during military activities. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas are exempt from the Marine Mammal Protection Act for incidental takings of southern sea otters during military activities. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas allow for the incidental taking of southern sea otters during military activities, treating them as species proposed to be listed under the Endangered Species Act. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas treat otters as endangered species under the Endangered Species Act, allowing them to remain in the areas without removal. The Secretary of the Interior can revise or terminate exceptions. The Secretary of the Interior can revise or terminate exceptions for military activities in the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas if they impede otter conservation. Monitoring of the situation is also required. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of the Navy, can revise or end military activities in the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas if they hinder otter conservation efforts. The Secretary of the Navy is responsible for monitoring the otter population growth or decline in these areas every three years. The Secretary of the Navy is required to monitor the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas every three years to track the population growth or decline. Reports must be submitted to Congress and the public on the monitoring efforts. The Secretary of the Navy must report to Congress and the public every three years on monitoring efforts in the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas. This section does not override any other federal laws. Ecosystem management plans must comply with relevant laws and regulations. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service, along with the Marine Mammal Commission, are required to develop an ecosystem management plan for waters off the coast of California to ensure the recovery of the southern sea otter and the endangered black abalone. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, and Marine Mammal Commission will develop an ecosystem management plan for California waters to recover the southern sea otter, black abalone, and white abalone, while maintaining shellfish fisheries at current levels. The US Fish and Wildlife Service will assess carrying capacity within one year. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service will assess the carrying capacity of the habitat for southern sea otters within one year, including the impacts of water quality and causes of degradation. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service will continue implementing the relocation and management plan for southern sea otters until the completion of the assessment of carrying capacity and water quality impacts. Definitions include incidental taking. The management plan for southern sea otters authorized by Public Law 99-625 will continue until completion of the assessment. Definitions include incidental taking and optimum sustainable population. The term 'optimum sustainable population' refers to the maximum number of animals that will ensure the productivity of a population, considering habitat capacity and ecosystem health. 'Southern sea otter' is defined as a member of the Enhydra lutris nereis subspecies. The term 'take' in reference to activities regulated by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 is defined within the statute. The term 'take' in reference to activities regulated by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 is defined within the statute. Military readiness activity is also defined in a specific section. The term 'take' in activities regulated by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 is defined within the statute. Military readiness activity is defined in a specific section of the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003. The term 'military readiness activity' is defined in the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 as training and operations related to combat, testing military equipment for combat use. Establishment of the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas."
