Congress finds that responders to the 9/11 terrorist attacks required coordination and support from various levels of government and private entities. Regional planning and coordination of emergency response efforts involving various levels of government and private entities are crucial to minimize loss of life and property damage. Coordination among local elected officials, neighboring jurisdictions, regional councils of governments, and development districts is essential for effective communication and mutual support during emergencies. Regional planning and coordination of emergency response efforts are crucial for minimizing loss of life and property damage. Regional councils of governments, planning commissions, and development districts play a key role in coordinating comprehensive regional plans involving Federal, State, and local governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders to ensure community security. The purpose of this Act is to encourage and coordinate comprehensive regional plans involving Federal, State, and local governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders for effective emergency preparedness and recovery. Coordination of training, equipment acquisition, and recovery planning is essential for regional preparedness and mitigation efforts. The Act aims to promote regional emergency preparedness and coordination plans among Federal, State, and local governments, as well as the private sector. Coordinated training, equipment acquisition, and recovery planning are crucial for effective regional preparedness and mitigation efforts. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

REQUIREMENT TO COORDINATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONAL EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS, COORDINATION, AND RECOVERY PLANS. The regional councils must convene all stakeholders to coordinate emergency preparedness plans and assess targets for destruction and available resources. The emergency response plan required for the region must include an assessment of potential targets, available resources, equipment needs, a communication system, and a secure information repository for stakeholder coordination. The emergency response plan for the region should include assessing potential targets, resources, equipment needs, establishing a communication system among stakeholders, and creating a secure information repository. This includes details on emergency medical facilities, fire, police, and emergency equipment locations and contacts. The emergency response plan should include information on response resources such as locations, contacts, and capabilities of emergency medical facilities, fire, police, and emergency medical technician services, as well as appropriate medical facilities and first responders. The emergency response plan should include listings for fire, police, and emergency medical technician services, 24-hour contacts for medical facilities and first responders, contacts for essential service stakeholders, and key military personnel and facilities. Locations and contacts for key military personnel and facilities, existing shelters, schools, colleges, universities, churches, and other public buildings, major water and food locations. Locations of existing shelters, schools, colleges, universities, churches, and other public buildings, major water and food supplies, water treatment and storage facilities, utilities lines, pipelines, and generating facilities. The infrastructure includes water treatment and storage facilities, utilities lines, pipelines, generating facilities, sewer mains, communication facilities, and radio and television sites. The curr_chunk discusses the locations of various communication facilities, including voice, data, video, microwave, satellite uplink, radio, television studios, transmission sites, shortwave radio facilities, major bridges, dams, and educational facilities. The curr_chunk provides information on the locations and capacities of shortwave radio facilities, major bridges, dams, educational facilities, transportation facilities, and at-risk populations. Locations and capacities of major transportation facilities, lines, and terminals, including ports and airports, as well as local and regional transportation routes. At-risk populations include large population concentrations, schedules of major public events, and population statistics. At-risk populations include locations of large population concentrations, schedules of major public events, population statistics, school enrollment numbers, and locations of elderly, infirm, and disabled persons who need special assistance. Potential targets are also considered. Population statistics, school enrollment numbers, and locations of elderly, infirm, and disabled persons needing special assistance are included in the data. Potential targets consist of major concentrations of hazardous chemicals and fuel depots meeting EPA thresholds. Potential targets include major concentrations of hazardous and biohazard chemicals, fuel depots meeting EPA thresholds, munitions and explosives, and other potential targets like nuclear power plants in the region. Debris disposal locations are also identified. Locations of major concentrations of munitions and explosives and other potential targets like nuclear power plants in the region, as well as identification of locations for debris disposal and potential health hazards to personnel involved in debris disposal, are part of planning activities under this section. Planning activities under this section involve analyzing the possibility of a disaster, assessing hazards using Geographic Information Systems, and evaluating potential consequences on life, property, and the environment. The plan must be approved by the regional planning agency's governing body and the Governor. The regional plan for disaster management must be approved by the designated agency's governing body and Governor within 12 months of receiving the initial planning grant. The plan should be reviewed annually and updated based on revised threat assessments, trainings, and drills. The regional plan for disaster management must be approved by the designated agency's governing body and Governor within 12 months of receiving the initial planning grant. It should be reviewed annually and updated based on revised threat assessments, trainings, and drills. The information in the plan is only accessible to officials and agencies responsible under the plan for security purposes. Security measures for mapping and infrastructure information within the regional disaster management plan include restricting access to authorized officials and agencies. Computer technology is necessary to secure key resources and critical infrastructure outlined in the plan. Collaboration with other agencies is essential to protect these assets in each region. Computer and software technology are required to secure key resources and critical infrastructure outlined in the regional plan. Collaboration with various agencies and entities is necessary to protect these assets. Continual review and analysis are needed to improve security policies and procedures for sharing information.

SEC. 5. FUNDING. From allocated emergency preparedness and homeland security funds, not less than three percent must go to the Department of Homeland Security for regional plan preparation, review, and updates. Allocations to regions will be based on population, plan preparation needs, vulnerability to disasters, and the presence of critical facilities. The funds allocated to designated regional councils for emergency preparedness and homeland security purposes will be based on a formula considering population, regional plan needs, vulnerability to disasters, and critical facility presence. Federal funding for local, regional, or state projects related to emergency preparedness must align with regional plans."
