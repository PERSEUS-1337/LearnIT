The DOD's alternative fuels policy aims to enhance military readiness, battlespace effectiveness, and fuel source diversity. Investments in alternative fuels initiatives seek to increase resilience against supply disruptions, mitigate petroleum price volatility, provide more fuel options for commanders, and enhance expeditionary effectiveness. The DOD's alternative fuels policy aims to enhance military readiness and battlespace effectiveness by investing in alternative fuels initiatives. Specific considerations for DOD investments include increased resilience against supply disruptions, dampened petroleum price volatility effects, and increased expeditionary effectiveness. Alternative fuels for DOD operational use must be \"drop-in,\" cost-competitive, and available in sufficient quantities, with other desirable characteristics such as production from non-food crop feedstock and low lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. The DOD's alternative fuels policy requires alternative fuels for operational use to be \"drop-in,\" cost-competitive, and available in sufficient quantities.

The collaboration between the Navy, Department of Agriculture, and DOE to develop innovative technologies for jet and diesel fuels for military use is supported. The Department of Defense's early adoption of alternative fuels will likely lead to wider marketplace acceptance. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 4310) includes provisions that affect the Department of Defense's procurement and production of biofuels. Two provisions of H.R. 4310 affect the Department of Defense's procurement and production of biofuels: exemption from alternative fuel procurement requirement and limitation on funds for alternative fuel procurement. The Department of Defense is exempt from the alternative fuel procurement requirement under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Additionally, funds for alternative fuel procurement are limited in fiscal year 2013, with a restriction on using funds if the cost exceeds that of traditional fossil fuels for the same purpose. The Department of Defense in fiscal year 2013 is restricted from using funds for alternative fuel procurement if the cost exceeds that of traditional fossil fuels for the same purpose.

The Secretary of Defense may purchase limited quantities of alternative fuels for fleet certification for 50/50 blends using competitive procedures to ensure the best purchase price. S. 3254 does not contain provisions restricting the Department of Defense's ability to procure or produce biofuels. S. 3254, as passed by the Senate, does not restrict the Department of Defense's procurement or production of biofuels. Two provisions that would have affected biofuel procurement were removed via floor amendments, including S.Amdt. 2985 sponsored by Senator Mark Udall. The Senate passed S. 3254 without restrictions on the Department of Defense's biofuel procurement. Two provisions affecting biofuel procurement were removed through floor amendments, including S.Amdt. 2985 sponsored by Senator Mark Udall. The Senate passed S. 3254 without restrictions on the Department of Defense's biofuel procurement. S.Amdt. 3095, sponsored by Senator Hagan and co-sponsored by several senators, struck Section 313 and Section 2823 from the bill, which would have limited the purchase of alternative fuels and prohibited contracts for biofuels refinery construction. The Senate passed S. 3254 without restrictions on the Department of Defense's biofuel procurement. An amendment, passed 54-41, removed Section 2823 which would have prohibited the Department of Defense from entering into biofuels refinery infrastructure contracts without specific authorization by law. These sections were originally added by Senator Inhofe and Senator McCain but were struck down. The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted amendments sponsored by Senator Inhofe and Senator McCain, respectively, to restrict biofuels refinery infrastructure construction unless authorized by law. A third amendment by Senator Inhofe, which aimed to exempt the Department of Defense from a 2007 law prohibiting the purchase of alternative fuels with higher greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fuels, failed in a tie vote. Inhofe's amendment to exempt the Department of Defense from a 2007 law prohibiting the purchase of alternative fuels with higher greenhouse gas emissions failed in a tie vote of 13-13 in the Senate Armed Services Committee. This would have allowed the Department of Defense to purchase alternative fuels regardless of their emissions compared to conventional fuels. The amendment in question, similar to Section 313 in H.R. 4310, aimed to limit funds for the procurement of alternative fuels by the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2013. This was part of a larger debate on whether the Department should be allowed to purchase alternative fuels with higher greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional fuels. Limitation on funds for procurement of alternative fuels by the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2013, unless the cost is lower than traditional fossil fuels for the same purpose. The Secretary of Defense may purchase limited quantities of alternative fuels for engine or fleet certification for 50/50 blends, using authorized funds for research and ensuring competitive pricing. Additionally, there is a prohibition on biofuel refinery construction. The Secretary of Defense can buy alternative fuels for engine certification using research funds and competitive pricing. Prohibition on biofuel refinery construction is in place. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited from entering into contracts for biofuels refinery construction without specific authorization by law. Funding for alternative fuel procurement by the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2013 is restricted. The committee recommends a provision to limit funds for procurement of alternative fuel by the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2013 if the cost exceeds traditional fossil fuels, except for testing purposes. In December 2011, the Defense Logistics Agency purchased 450,000 gallons of biofuels for $12.0 million, equating to $26.66 a gallon. The Defense Logistics Agency, on behalf of the Department of the Navy, purchased 450,000 gallons of biofuels for $12.0 million in December 2011, at $26.66 a gallon. This was the largest biofuel purchase in government history, aimed at demonstrating the capability of a Carrier Strike Group to burn alternative fuels. Despite using operation and maintenance funds, the purchase was considered a success. The Department of the Navy made the largest biofuel purchase in government history, buying 450,000 gallons for $12.0 million at $26.66 a gallon. The purchase aimed to demonstrate the Carrier Strike Group's ability to use alternative fuels. Despite using operation and maintenance funds, the purchase was justified as a research initiative. The Vice Chief of Naval Operations testified about the pressure on readiness accounts from rising fuel prices. The Navy purchased 450,000 gallons of biofuel for $12.0 million at $26.66 a gallon to demonstrate the Carrier Strike Group's use of alternative fuels. The high cost of fuel has a direct impact on readiness accounts, with every $1 increase in fuel prices resulting in $31M of additional costs annually. The Department of Defense is working to reduce fuel demand. The committee supports DoD initiatives to reduce fuel demand through new technologies, but is concerned about using operation and maintenance funds for higher biofuel costs in RDTE efforts. The committee supports DoD efforts to reduce fuel demand with new technologies but is concerned about using operation and maintenance funds for higher biofuel costs in RDTE. The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide guidance on the difference between operational use of alternative fuels and RDTE initiatives. The committee supports DoD efforts to reduce fuel demand with new technologies but is concerned about using operation and maintenance funds for higher biofuel costs in RDTE. The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide guidance on the difference between operational use of alternative fuels and RDTE initiatives, as mandated by H.R. 4310 / P.L. 113-6 Section 315. The National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 4310 / P.L. 112-239) limits the use of Department of Defense funds for biofuel refinery construction until matching contributions are received from the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture. In 2013, funds for biofuels production cannot be used for refinery construction by the Department of Defense until matching contributions are received from the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture.
