    "content": "The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" may be cited as the official title. It includes a requirement for cellulosic biofuel. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the provision of estimates for volumes of cellulosic biofuel under the Clean Air Act. The estimation method for projected volumes is specified in the amendment. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates estimates for cellulosic biofuel volumes under the Clean Air Act, specifying the estimation method for projected volumes. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the Energy Information Administration to estimate cellulosic biofuel production volumes for facilities producing during a specified period. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates the Energy Information Administration to estimate cellulosic biofuel production volumes for facilities producing during a specific period from January 1 to October 31 of the current calendar year. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the Energy Information Administration to determine the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by facilities during a specific period. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates the Energy Information Administration to calculate the monthly production volume of cellulosic biofuel at facilities to estimate the annual production for the current year. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the Energy Information Administration to track monthly cellulosic biofuel production at facilities to estimate annual production for the current year, including new facilities starting production after January 1. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates tracking monthly cellulosic biofuel production at facilities to estimate annual production for the current year, including new facilities starting production after January 1. The Act requires determining the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by each facility based on actual production. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires tracking monthly cellulosic biofuel production at facilities to estimate annual production for the current year, including new facilities starting production after January 1. The Act mandates determining the actual volume produced by each facility from initial production of cellulosic biofuel to October 31 of the current calendar year. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates determining the estimated annual volume of cellulosic biofuel production for facilities based on their average monthly production. Total production estimate for the following calendar year of cellulosic biofuel production is based on the projected volume from all facilities described in the legislation. The Clean Air Act is amended to calculate the total cellulosic biofuel production for the current calendar year. This is based on the estimated annual volumes from all biofuel production facilities described in the legislation. The Clean Air Act is amended to calculate total cellulosic biofuel production for the current calendar year using exact volumes. The definition of cellulosic biofuel is also revised to specify the same volume. The Clean Air Act is amended to specify that total cellulosic biofuel production must be calculated using exact volumes. The definition of cellulosic biofuel is revised to exclude compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or any other forms. The Clean Air Act is amended to specify that total cellulosic biofuel production must be calculated using exact volumes. The definition of cellulosic biofuel is revised to exclude compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or electricity used for electric vehicles produced from biogas from landfills or municipal wastewater treatment facilities. The Clean Air Act is amended to specify that total cellulosic biofuel production must be calculated using exact volumes. It excludes compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or electricity used for electric vehicles produced from biogas from specific sources like landfills or wastewater treatment facilities. The Clean Air Act is amended to specify that total cellulosic biofuel production must be calculated using exact volumes, excluding certain sources like landfills or wastewater treatment facilities. Additionally, the regulation of cellulosic and advanced fuel pathways is addressed in the final rule of the Environmental Protection Agency. The Environmental Protection Agency's rule on cellulosic biofuel pathways under the renewable fuel standard is nullified if it conflicts with new amendments. The EPA is required to reissue the rule. The EPA must nullify its rule on cellulosic biofuel pathways if it conflicts with new amendments and reissue the rule to conform to the changes. The mandate for cellulosic biofuel volumes for 2014 is removed."
