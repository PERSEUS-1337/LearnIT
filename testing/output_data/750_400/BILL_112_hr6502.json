    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Life-Threatening Diseases Compassion through Combination Therapy Act of 2012\" and promotes the development of combinations of investigational new drugs for serious diseases by providing marketing exclusivity and priority review for significant drug combinations. The Secretary may designate a combination of drugs as significant if it includes 2 or more drugs that offer the potential to advance treatment for a serious or life-threatening disease. The Secretary may designate a combination of drugs as significant if they offer the potential to advance treatment for a serious or life-threatening disease and meet criteria for codevelopment of drug combinations. The Secretary may designate a combination of drugs as significant for codevelopment if they offer potential to advance treatment for a serious or life-threatening disease and include at least 2 unapproved drugs. The Secretary may designate drug combinations as significant for codevelopment if they include at least 2 unapproved drugs to encourage their joint development for serious diseases. Task force recommendations are considered in the designation process. The Secretary considers task force recommendations when designating drug combinations for codevelopment. Manufacturers or sponsors can request the Secretary to determine if a combination of 2 or more drugs is significant. The Life-Threatening Diseases Compassion through Combination Therapy Act of 2012 allows manufacturers to request the Secretary to determine if a combination of 2 or more drugs is significant within 30 days of submission. The Act allows manufacturers to request the Secretary to determine if a drug combination is significant within 30 days of submission. If the combination meets the requirements, the Secretary will notify the requester. If a drug combination meets the requirements for a significant designation, the Secretary will notify the requester within 30 days of submission. The Secretary will designate a drug combination as significant if it meets the requirements, providing notice to the requester within 30 days of submission.

A request for designation under subparagraph (A) shall be made concurrently with, or after, submission of an application. The request for designation of a significant drug combination must be made concurrently with or after the submission of an application for drug investigation. The deadline for this request is not later than the completion of phase I trials for any of the drugs involved in the combination. The Secretary must develop and publish an initial list of significant drug combinations within 180 days of the enactment of the Life-Threatening Diseases Compassion through Combination Therapy Act of 2012. The Secretary must develop and publish an initial list of significant drug combinations within 180 days of the enactment of the Life-Threatening Diseases Compassion through Combination Therapy Act of 2012, and update the list annually with additional drug combinations designated as significant. The Secretary must update the list of significant drug combinations annually to include new combinations and exclude those no longer meeting the requirements. The Secretary annually updates the list of significant drug combinations, adding new ones and removing those that no longer meet the criteria. This includes excluding combinations previously designated as significant but no longer meeting the requirements. Market exclusivity may be extended if a drug is approved under section 505(b) before its application. Extension of Market Exclusivity: If a drug is designated as part of a significant drug combination before its approval under section 505(b), market exclusivity periods can be extended as outlined in subsections (c)(3)(E)(ii) and (j)(5)(F)(ii) of section 505. If a drug is designated as part of a significant drug combination before approval under section 505(b), market exclusivity periods can be extended by 6 months as specified in subsections (c)(3)(E)(ii) and (j)(5)(F)(ii) of section 505. The market exclusivity period for a drug can be extended by 6 months under subsection (j)(5)(F) of section 505. This extension does not apply to supplements for designated significant drug combinations or subsequent applications by the same entity. The market exclusivity period for a drug can be extended by 6 months under subsection (j)(5)(F) of section 505. This extension does not apply to supplements for designated significant drug combinations or subsequent applications by the same entity. For a drug in a designated significant drug combination, an extension can be granted if the original application's extension is in effect or has expired, or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer for a change that does not modify the drug's structure. The market exclusivity period for a drug can be extended by 6 months under subsection (j)(5)(F) of section 505. This extension does not apply to supplements for designated significant drug combinations or subsequent applications by the same entity. For a drug in a designated significant drug combination, an extension can be granted if the original application's extension is in effect or has expired, or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer for a change that does not modify the drug's structure, such as a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device, or strength. The FDA may grant an extension to the market exclusivity period for a drug if there is a modification to the drug's structure resulting in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, device, or strength, or if the modification does not affect safety or effectiveness. If a drug is part of a significant drug combination, the FDA will prioritize and review any applications for such drug. The FDA will prioritize and review applications for drugs in significant drug combinations, ensuring action within 6 months. \"Significantly advance treatment\" refers to modifications that do not impact safety or effectiveness. The FDA will prioritize and review drug combination applications within 6 months. \"Significantly advance treatment\" means treating life-threatening diseases without existing therapies or improving existing treatments through clinical investigations. The FDA will prioritize and review drug combination applications within 6 months for treating life-threatening diseases without existing therapies or improving existing treatments through clinical investigations. The drug combination must demonstrate improved effects on serious outcomes of the disease, such as superiority or minimizing drug resistance. The FDA will prioritize and review drug combination applications within 6 months for treating life-threatening diseases without existing therapies or improving existing treatments through clinical investigations. The drug combination must demonstrate improved effects on serious outcomes of the disease, such as superiority or minimizing drug resistance in active controlled trials assessing serious morbidity. The FDA will prioritize and review drug combination applications within 6 months for treating life-threatening diseases without existing therapies or improving existing treatments through clinical investigations. The drug combination must demonstrate improved effects on serious outcomes of the disease, such as minimizing drug resistance in active controlled trials assessing serious morbidity. Additionally, a Fast Track Product designation is available for drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and those in significant drug combinations designated under section 505E(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Codevelopment Task Force is established. The Secretary of Health and Human Services establishes an interagency task force to promote codevelopment of drugs in significant combinations.
