    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Existing law requires landlords to provide written notification to tenants before applying pesticides in certain ways without a licensed pest control operator. The bill aims to ensure that owners and tenants in common interest developments are notified in writing before pesticides are applied by the homeowner association or its agents, similar to the notification required when pesticides are applied by a licensed pest control operator. Section 4777 of the Civil Code defines terms related to pesticide application in common interest developments, including \"adjacent separate interest,\" \"authorized agent,\" \"broadcast application,\" and \"electronic delivery.\" In common interest developments, terms related to pesticide application are defined in Section 4777 of the Civil Code. These terms include \"licensed pest control operator\" for those authorized to apply pesticides, and \"pest\" referring to organisms causing damage or transmitting diseases. A \"licensed pest control operator\" is someone licensed by the state to apply pesticides. A \"pest\" is a living organism that causes damage or transmits diseases. A \"pesticide\" is any substance intended to control, destroy, repel, or mitigate pests or organisms, excluding certain types of pesticides defined by federal law. An association or its agent must provide written notice to the owner and tenant of a separate interest before applying pesticides without a licensed pest control operator. The notice should include the pest to be controlled and the name of the pesticide product to be used. The curr_chunk requires information on the pest to be controlled and the pesticide product to be used, as mandated by state law. CAUTION \u2013 PESTICIDES ARE TOXIC CHEMICALS. Proper use of certain pesticides is allowed based on scientific evidence to outweigh risks. Minimize exposure to reduce risk. If experiencing symptoms after pesticide application, contact a healthcare provider or Poison Control. If experiencing symptoms similar to influenza within 24 hours of pesticide application, contact a physician or California Poison Control System (1-800-222-1222). For more information, contact County Health Department for health questions or Department of Pesticide Regulation for regulatory information (916-324-4100). The association must provide notice at least 48 hours before applying pesticide, including the date, time, and frequency of application. The notification should state that these details are subject to change. Individual notice must be given to owners and tenants of the separate interest and adjacent units that need to be informed. At least 48 hours before pesticide application in a common area, the association must post written notice if possible. If not feasible, individual notice must be given to adjacent unit owners and tenants. Notice to tenants of separate interests must be provided through first-class mail, personal delivery to tenants 18 years or older, or electronic delivery if an electronic mailing address is available. If the pest poses an immediate threat to health and safety, the association must post written notice within one hour after pesticide application. Upon receipt of written notification, the owner or tenant of a separate interest may agree to pesticide application by the association through first-class mail, personal delivery, or electronic delivery if an electronic mailing address is provided. Upon receipt of written notification, the owner or tenant of a separate interest may agree to pesticide application by the association through first-class mail, personal delivery, or electronic delivery if an electronic mailing address is provided. The owner or tenant may also agree in writing or electronically to immediate pesticide application by the association or authorized agent before the 48-hour notice period if requested. Prior to receiving written notification, the association or authorized agent can orally agree to immediate pesticide application if requested by the owner or tenant.
