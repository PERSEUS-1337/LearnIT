    "content": "In this work, imitation learning is used to tackle challenges in high-dimensional sparse reward tasks for reinforcement learning agents. Adversarial imitation can effectively learn a representation of the world from pixels and explore efficiently despite the rarity of reward signals. The adversary, acting as the reward function, can be small with just 128 parameters and trained using a basic GAN formulation. This approach overcomes limitations of contemporary imitation methods by not requiring demonstrator actions, only video input. Our approach in high-dimensional sparse reward tasks uses adversarial imitation to learn a compact reward function with just 128 parameters. It requires only video input, no demonstrator actions, and no explicit tracking of demos. The agent can solve complex tasks like block stacking faster than other methods that rely on imitation. The proposed agent can solve a challenging robot manipulation task of block stacking from only video demonstrations and sparse reward. It learns much faster than competing approaches that depend on hand-crafted dense reward functions and outperforms standard GAIL baselines. Additionally, a new adversarial goal recognizer allows the agent to learn stacking purely from imitation in some cases. The new adversarial goal recognizer allows the agent to learn stacking without task reward, purely from imitation, exploiting minute differences between the agent and expert. GAIL can handle high-dimensional pixel observations using a single layer discriminator network when provided with the right features. In this work, it is shown that GAIL can easily handle high-dimensional pixel observations with a single-layer discriminator network when provided with the right features. Additionally, efficiency can be improved by using a Deep Distributed Deterministic Policy Gradients (D4PG) agent, which utilizes a replay buffer to store past experiences. The efficiency of GAIL can be enhanced by using a D4PG agent with a replay buffer. Different types of features, such as self-supervised embeddings and value network features, can be successfully utilized with a single-layer adversary. In addition to enhancing GAIL efficiency with a D4PG agent and replay buffer, self-supervised embeddings and value network features can be effectively used with a single-layer adversary. This approach can solve challenging tasks like robotic block stacking from pixels with only demonstrations and sparse rewards. The proposed approach in BID21 modifies GAIL for off-policy D4PG agents with experience replay, demonstrating the ability to solve a challenging robotic block stacking task from pixels using only demonstrations and sparse rewards. This method reduces the reliance on hand-crafted rewards and achieves faster stacking compared to previous approaches. The paper introduces a 6-DoF Jaco robot arm agent that learns block stacking from demonstration videos and sparse rewards, achieving a 94% success rate on a simulated Jaco arm. It also presents an adversary-based early termination method for actor processes to improve task performance. The paper introduces a 6-DoF Jaco robot arm agent that learns block stacking from demonstration videos and sparse rewards, achieving a 94% success rate on a simulated Jaco arm. It also presents an adversary-based early termination method for actor processes to improve task performance and learning speed. Additionally, an agent learns with no task reward using an auxiliary goal recognizer adversary, achieving 55% stacking success from video imitation only. Ablation experiments on Jaco stacking and a 2D planar walker benchmark are conducted to understand the reasons for improvement. The curr_chunk discusses processes that improve task performance and learning speed for an agent, including using an auxiliary goal recognizer adversary to achieve 55% stacking success from video imitation only. Ablation experiments on Jaco stacking and a 2D planar walker benchmark are conducted to understand the reasons for improvement in the agent. The curr_chunk discusses the use of random projections and value network features in improving agent performance in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) setting. The goal is to find a policy that maximizes the expected sum of discounted rewards. The DDPG algorithm utilizes actor-critic neural networks to maximize expected rewards in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) by updating policy and action-value functions. Transitions are stored in a replay buffer for training the agent. DDPG BID23 is an actor-critic method using neural networks to represent the policy and action-value function. New transitions are added to a replay buffer for training, with actions sampled from the policy for exploration. The action-value function is trained to match 1-step returns by minimizing the error between the current and target networks. This approach aims to improve the stability of weight updates. The policy network in DDPG is trained to maximize the action-value function using deterministic policy gradient. Target actor and critic networks are updated every K learning steps for stability. Additional improvements are made to the basic DDPG agent. In DDPG, the policy network is trained to maximize the action-value function using deterministic policy gradient. Target networks are updated every K learning steps for stability. D4PG builds on DDPG with further enhancements. GAIL involves learning a reward function by training a discriminator network to distinguish between agent and expert transitions. In GAIL, a reward function is learned by training a discriminator network to distinguish between agent and expert transitions. The GAIL objective involves the agent policy, expert policy, and an entropy regularizer. To utilize all training data, a D4PG agent is used for off-policy training with experience replay. The actor and critic updates are similar to D4PG, with the additional joint training of the reward function using a modified equation. In GAIL, a reward function is learned by training a discriminator network to distinguish between agent and expert transitions. To make use of all available training data, a D4PG agent is used for off-policy training with experience replay. The reward function is jointly trained using a modified equation. The reward function in GAIL is learned by training a discriminator network to distinguish between agent and expert transitions. A modified equation is used for off-policy training with experience replay, where the reward function interpolates imitation reward and a sparse task reward. The discriminator does not use actions in its decision-making process, only assuming access to videos of the expert. The reward function in GAIL interpolates imitation reward and sparse task reward, using the sigmoid of the logits to bound the imitation reward between 0 and 1. This allows for intuitive values for early termination of episodes in the actor process. The discriminator does not use actions in its decision-making process, only assuming access to videos of the expert. The actor process in GAIL uses the sigmoid of the logits to bound the imitation reward between 0 and 1, allowing for intuitive early termination of episodes. Multiple CPU actor processes run in parallel, receiving updated network parameters every 100 steps. Early termination occurs when the discriminator score falls below a threshold \u03b2. In GAIL, multiple CPU actor processes run in parallel, with a single learner process on GPU. Early termination of episodes occurs when the discriminator score is below a threshold \u03b2 to prevent drifting from expert trajectories. The actor uses early termination based on the discriminator score and a critical design choice is the type of network used in the discriminator. The discriminator score is kept below a threshold \u03b2 to prevent drifting from expert trajectories. Setting \u03b2 = 0.1 helps avoid wasting computation time. The type of network used in the discriminator is a critical design choice for the agent's performance. The type of network used in the discriminator is crucial for the agent's performance. If the network has too much capacity, it may be too easy for it to distinguish agent from expert. If it has too little capacity, it may not capture the differences between them. Expert demonstrations provide valuable data for feature learning. The discriminator architecture is crucial for the agent's performance, as it needs to capture the differences between agent and expert. Expert demonstrations are valuable for feature learning, providing sufficient coverage of the state space needed to solve the task. Access to expert actions is not assumed, ruling out behavior cloning for feature learning. High-resolution images are used, beyond what current generative models can realistically generate. Based on the need to observe task details without expert actions, behavior cloning is not an option for feature learning. High-resolution images are used, ruling out pixel space prediction for feature learning. Contrastive predictive coding (CPC) is considered a suitable option for representation learning. Contrastive predictive coding (CPC) is a representation learning technique that maps observations into a latent space for long-term predictions. It uses a probabilistic contrastive loss with negative sampling, allowing joint training of the encoder and autoregressive model without the need for a decoder model. In addition to moving from hand-crafted dense staged rewards to sparse rewards, one can also eliminate task rewards entirely by replacing them with a neural network goal recognizer trained on a latent space generated by Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC). This technique allows for long-term predictions without the need for a decoder model. One way to eliminate task rewards entirely is by using a neural network goal recognizer trained on expert trajectories. However, there is a risk of the agent exploiting blind spots in the recognizer to receive imitation rewards without solving the task, as observed in practice. To address this issue, the approach can be replaced. To address the issue of agents exploiting blind spots in a neural network goal recognizer trained on expert trajectories, a secondary discriminator can be used to detect if the agent has reached a goal state. This modified reward function aims to prevent agents from receiving imitation rewards without actually solving the task. To address the issue of agents exploiting blind spots in a neural network goal recognizer trained on expert trajectories, a secondary discriminator can be used to detect if the agent has reached a goal state. The modified reward function replaces the sparse task reward with this new discriminator, which identifies whether the agent has reached a goal state defined as the latter 1/M proportion of the expert demonstration. Training the secondary goal discriminator network is similar to the primary discriminator, but expert states are only sampled from the latter 1/M portion of each demonstration trajectory. DISPLAYFORM0 introduces D goal as a secondary discriminator network that operates on the same feature space as D but does not share weights. Training D goal involves sampling expert states from the latter 1/M portion of each demonstration trajectory. This approach allows the agent to surpass the demonstrator by learning to reach the goal faster, combining imitation learning with goal-reaching capabilities. By training a second discriminator to recognize goal states, an agent can surpass the demonstrator in imitation learning by reaching the goal faster. The environment includes a Kinova Jaco arm with 9 degrees of freedom and two blocks on a tabletop. Visual representation is shown in FIG2. The agents are trained with combined imitation and sparse task rewards in environments visualized in FIG2. The Kinova Jaco arm has 9 degrees of freedom, controlled by policies setting joint velocity commands. Observations are 128x128 RGB images, and hand-crafted reward functions are described in section 7.4. Demonstrations are collected using a SpaceNavigator 3D motion controller, with a human operator gathering 500 episodes for each task. The hand-crafted reward functions (sparse and dense staged) are used to collect demonstrations with a SpaceNavigator 3D motion controller. A human operator controls the jaco arm to gather 500 episodes of demonstration for each task, with an additional 500 trajectories collected for validation purposes. Another dataset of 30 \"non-expert\" trajectories is collected for CPC diagnostics by performing behaviors other than stacking. The dataset includes 30 \"non-expert\" trajectories collected for CPC diagnostics, involving behaviors like random arm motions and stacking incorrectly. The D4PG agents use 64x64 pixel observations from 200 expert demonstrations. The second environment involves a 2D walker from the DeepMind control suite BID33. Demonstrations were collected using a D4PG agent trained from proprioceptive states to match a target velocity. The comparison between the imitation method and other agents shows favorable results. In this section, the D4PG agents were used with specific hyperparameter settings. A comparison was made between the imitation method and other agents on dense and sparse rewards, as well as GAIL agents with discriminator networks. The proposed method using a tiny adversary showed favorable results. The Conditional Predictive Coding (CPC) model accurately predicted future observations for expert sequences but not for non-expert sequences. Conditioning on k-step predictions improved the performance of the method. The Conditional Predictive Coding (CPC) model accurately predicts future observations for expert sequences but not for non-expert sequences. Conditioning on k-step predictions improves the performance of the method, especially on stacking tasks when the discriminator also uses CPC embeddings. D4PG with sparse rewards struggles due to exploration complexity, while dense rewards lead to slow learning pace. In contrast, imitation methods show quick learning and superior performance despite only utilizing sparse rewards. Our method improves performance on stacking tasks when the discriminator uses CPC embeddings.

Additionally, temporal predictions made by CPC were explored, visualizing features learned from training trajectories. The discriminator network with CPC features did not succeed in Jaco or Walker2D. Temporal predictions from CPC were visualized using features learned from training trajectories. In Jaco stacking ablation experiments, adding layers to the discriminator did not improve performance, and early termination hurt performance. With 60 demonstrations, the agent learned stacking as well as with 500 demonstrations.

The experiment aims to determine if a tiny discriminator is optimal for imitation learning or if a deeper network can improve results. The effect of the number of layers on the discriminator's performance is shown in Figure 6(a), indicating the advantage of a small discriminator on a meaningful representation. The experiment shows that adding layers to the discriminator can degrade performance, highlighting the advantage of a small discriminator for meaningful representation. Early termination criterion was introduced to stop episodes when the discriminator score is low, leading to slower learning when disabled. The average episode length during training is plotted to show the impact of early stopping on learning. When early stopping is disabled, the model learns slower. The discriminator improves over time in distinguishing expert from agent trajectories, leading to longer episodes. The task and imitation rewards are also shown in the plot. Another experiment evaluates the data efficiency of the method using expert demonstrations. In a study with over 2000 episodes, trajectories are often cut short early on. As the agent improves after 6000 episodes, the imitation of the expert takes longer. Data efficiency is evaluated with 60, 120, 240, and 500 demonstrations, showing that even 60 demos can lead to good performance. An outlier occurred with 120 demos. Results on the planar walker are also presented, similar to the Jaco experiments. In a study with over 2000 episodes, trajectories are often cut short early on.

Videos of the trained agent are included in the supplementary videos linked in the appendix. In the Jaco experiments, our proposed method using value network features and random projections learned to run without any task reward. Two out of five runs were successful without providing rewards. Videos of the trained agent are available in the supplementary videos linked in the appendix. In the Jaco experiments, the agent learned without rewards using expert states as positive examples. Two out of five runs achieved success without task rewards, with a 55% success rate. The agent stacked more efficiently than the human demonstrator, completing the task in under 2s compared to 30s. Additionally, an agent exploit was observed where the top block was rolled to the background to appear as a completed stack without actually stacking. The best agent without task rewards achieved a 55% success rate in stacking tasks more efficiently than the human demonstrator. Leveraging expert demonstrations to improve agent performance has a long history in robotics. In robotics, leveraging expert demonstrations to enhance agent performance has a long history. Recent work shows that priming a Q-function on expert demonstrations can improve agent performance in tasks like cart-pole swing up. However, our task differs as we only have access to pixel observations, not states and actions, making it challenging to prime the value function in the same way. Imitation learning in robotics involves leveraging expert demonstrations to enhance agent performance. Unlike tasks with access to states and actions, our task relies solely on pixel observations, making it challenging to prime the value function. Recent work aims to extend deep learning success to tasks involving interactions with environments, with supervised imitation being a simple yet effective approach. Imitation learning in robotics involves using expert demonstrations to improve agent performance, especially in tasks with pixel observations. Supervised imitation, like behavioral cloning, is a simple and effective approach that extends deep learning success to tasks involving interactions with environments. One-shot imitation, introduced by BID10, infers behaviors from single demonstrations using an encoder network and a state-to-action decoder with an attention mechanism to replicate desired behaviors on new problem instances, such as stacking blocks into target arrangements. One-shot imitation learning involves inferring behaviors from single demonstrations using an encoder network and a state-to-action decoder with an attention mechanism. Different approaches, such as using gradient-based meta learning, have been explored to perform one-shot learning of observed behaviors in robotics tasks. Our approach uses a gradient-based meta learning approach for one-shot learning of observed behaviors in robotics tasks, aiming for the agent to learn through interaction with the environment rather than supervised learning. This method avoids cascading failures that can occur with behavioral cloning when the agent encounters states not seen in expert demonstrations, allowing for better generalization. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is proposed as an alternative to behavior cloning in robotics tasks, aiming to learn a reward function from interactions with the environment rather than relying on supervised learning. This approach avoids cascading failures and the need for a large number of demonstrations, allowing for better generalization without requiring access to demonstrator actions. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is proposed as an alternative to behavior cloning in robotics tasks. IRL learns a reward function from demonstrations and then uses reinforcement learning to optimize that learned reward. Deep Q-Learning from demonstration (DQfD) adds expert trajectories to experience replay to train agents along with their own experiences, later extended to handle sparse-exploration Atari games. BID26 and BID36 developed methods to optimize learned rewards in robotics tasks by incorporating expert trajectories and agent experiences. These approaches show success in solving tasks without access to dense shaped rewards. BID36 developed deterministic policy gradients from demonstration (DPGfD) to solve a peg insertion task on a real robot without expert actions.

Our major contribution is using minimal adversaries to solve sparse reward tasks with high-dimensional input spaces. Through the use of minimal adversaries, we successfully solve sparse reward tasks with high-dimensional input spaces. Additionally, we learn compact representations for imitation learning using expert observations without actions. Our approach focuses on learning self-supervised features from third person observations to bridge the domain gap between different viewpoints. Unlike other methods that track a single expert trajectory, we aim to generalize across various initializations of a challenging task. We leverage both static self-supervised features like contrastive predictive coding and dynamic value network features that evolve during the learning process.

It consists of an encoder mapping observations to latent representations and an autoregressive model summarizing past latents into a context vector. The model optimizes a loss function with negative samples and bilinear mappings for predicting future latent steps. The ELU model achieves 15% stacking accuracy in visualizing CPC on video data by optimizing a loss function with negative samples and bilinear mappings for predicting future latent steps. The context vector is maximized to extract slow features and compact representations. By optimizing CPC, mutual information between z t+k and c t is maximized, linearly embedding common variables into compact representations. This is useful for extracting slow features, especially when z t+k and c t are far apart in time. The approach involves training a CPC expert model, then training an agent using CPC future predictions without the need to predict in pixel space. Reward functions are modified from BID37, with each episode lasting 500 time steps without early stopping. After optimizing CPC to maximize mutual information between z t+k and c t, a CPC expert model is trained. The agent is then trained using CPC future predictions without the need to predict in pixel space. Reward functions are slightly modified from BID37, with episodes lasting 500 time steps without early stopping. Dense staged rewards include five stages with corresponding rewards, while sparse rewards have two stages with rewards.
