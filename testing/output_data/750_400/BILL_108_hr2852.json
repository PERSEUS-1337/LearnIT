The Congress finds that research has shown the feasibility of using cord blood for clinical applications, including bone marrow reconstitution for certain diseases. Cord blood, obtained from the placenta and umbilical cord, can be used for bone marrow reconstitution in recipients with malignancies, genetic disorders, and acquired diseases. This cord blood, a source of stem cells, is normally discarded after childbirth but can be collected as donor tissue without risk and preserved for many years through freezing. Cord blood, containing stem cells, is typically discarded after childbirth but can be collected as donor tissue without risk. It can be frozen for preservation and used for transplantation or scientific research. The advantages of cord blood stem cell transplants over bone marrow transplants include reduced risks. Advantages of cord blood stem cell transplants include reduced risks to the donor, availability of donor cell units in days, and lower risk of transplant complications compared to bone marrow transplants. Finding a fully matched unrelated donor optimizes the chances of successful bone marrow transplantation, especially for patients of ethnic minorities who generally have difficulty finding fully matched donors. Finding a fully matched unrelated donor is crucial for successful bone marrow transplantation, particularly for ethnic minority patients who struggle to find fully matched donors. Partially matched transplants lead to high complication rates, including graft versus host disease and mortality. Cord blood stem cell banks increase genetic diversity in donor supply, providing fully matched and partially matched transplant units. This reduces complications like graft versus host disease and mortality associated with partially matched transplants. Cord blood stem cell banks enhance genetic diversity in donor supply, facilitating the identification of fully matched and partially matched transplant units. This reduces the risk of graft versus host disease and mortality compared to conventional bone marrow transplantation. Identifying an unrelated bone marrow donor from the national registry can take months to over a year, while an inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units provides a quicker alternative. An inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units, considering ethnic diversity, can provide matches for 90% of those needing transplants within days. Matched donors are more likely within the same ethnic group as the patient. An inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units, taking into account ethnic diversity, can provide appropriate matches for at least 90% of those seeking transplants within days of a formal request. Matched donors are more likely within the same ethnic group as the patient, with some genetic conditions being more prevalent in specific ethnic groups. Sickle Cell Anemia is prevalent in certain ethnic groups, like African-Americans, affecting one in 500 newborns. Patients face high risks of bacterial infections and frequent painful crises, with a median lifespan of 42 years. Severe cases in childhood have a higher mortality rate. Children with Sickle Cell Disease face recurrent crises, chest syndrome, and strokes, with a high risk of mortality before age 20. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has shown promising results in curing Sickle Cell Anemia, especially when done early in the course of severe disease. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has cured patients with Sickle Cell Anemia, especially when done early in the course of severe disease. Unrelated cord blood transplants are beneficial for African American and other ethnic minority patients. An ethnically balanced national cord blood bank of at least 150,000 units would greatly benefit African American patients with Sickle Cell Anemia, as they are more likely to find a suitable unrelated cord blood donor compared to a matched bone marrow donor. Since 1987, the National Marrow Donor Program has facilitated 17,000 bone marrow transplants. Cord blood transplantation complements bone marrow transplantation by providing matched units for successful treatment. Cord blood transplantation complements bone marrow transplantation by providing appropriately matched units to patients, especially those of non-caucasoid ethnicity, who have a lower probability of finding a match through the National Marrow Donor Program. Cord blood is a source of stem cells used in transplantation, with specific systems and expertise required for its collection, preparation, storage, and dissemination. Radiation exposure can cause bone marrow failure, necessitating treatment such as bone marrow reconstitution. Cryopreserved cord blood stem cell units may be crucial for rapid availability in these cases. Radiation exposure can lead to bone marrow failure, requiring treatment like bone marrow reconstitution. Cryopreserved cord blood stem cell units may be essential for rapid availability in such cases. Additionally, there is an increased risk of leukemia or lymphoma years later, which may also necessitate stem cell transplantation. Research on cord blood stem cells could provide insights into chronic diseases. Recent scientific developments suggest that further research on cord blood stem cells may lead to a greater understanding of chronic diseases like Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, potentially improving therapies and finding cures. Research on cord blood stem cells may lead to a better understanding of chronic diseases like Parkinson's, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, potentially improving therapies and finding cures for these debilitating conditions. These diseases contribute significantly to chronic disabilities and healthcare costs in the United States.
