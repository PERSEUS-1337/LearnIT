The House of Representatives passed H.R. 2989, the FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill, providing $85.8 billion. Key financial differences from the Administration request include an additional $4.4 billion in highway funding and the deletion of $3.4 billion for grants-in-aid to airports. Starting from FY2004, appropriations for the Department of Transportation and the Department of the Treasury are being considered together. Beginning in FY2004, appropriations for the Department of Transportation and the Department of the Treasury are being considered together in a single bill, due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and reorganization of subcommittees. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security led to the consolidation of appropriations for the Department of Transportation and the Department of the Treasury into a single bill. This change also resulted in the transfer of the United States Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration to the Department of Homeland Security. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security led to the consolidation of appropriations for the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, creating new subcommittees for Homeland Security and combining former Transportation and Treasury subcommittees. The United States Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, Customs Service, United States Secret Service, and Office of Homeland Security were transferred to DHS from their respective departments. Budget numbers prior to FY2004 have been adjusted for comparison. The Department of Homeland Security was created, leading to the consolidation of appropriations for House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Various agencies were transferred to DHS from different departments. Budget numbers were adjusted for comparison. The House divides its appropriation bill into six titles, while the Senate has five titles. The House and Senate appropriation bills are divided into different numbers of titles. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution included a 0.65% across-the-board rescission affecting the Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury. The FY2003 figures in this report reflect the rescission. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution included a 0.65% across-the-board rescission affecting the Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury. The Administration's FY2004 budget request for these departments was $85.9 billion, $740 million below the final FY2003 figure. The Administration's FY2004 budget request for the Departments of Transportation and Treasury was $85.9 billion, $740 million lower than the final FY2003 figure. Table 2 shows the allocation of funding within the overall request. Table 2 shows Transportation/Treasury Appropriations for FY2003-FY2004 in millions of dollars. The Senate and House have different budget divisions, with the Postal Service falling under \"Related Agencies\" in the Senate report. Total budget reflects scorekeeping adjustments. The Senate divides the budget differently from the House, putting the Postal Service into the \"Related Agencies\" Title. The Postal Service appropriation has been subtracted from the Senate and Conference totals for Title V. During House deliberations on H.R. 2989, funding for two programs was struck on points of order. During House deliberations on H.R. 2989, funding for two programs was struck on points of order: FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border Enforcement program. This reduced total transportation funding in the bill from $58.4 billion to $54.9 billion. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 reduced transportation funding by $3.425 billion for FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program and $47 million for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border Enforcement program. Total funding in the bill dropped from $89.3 billion to $85.8 billion.

The FY2004 budget proposed a DOT budget of $54.3 billion, 2.6% below FY2003's enacted level of $55.7 billion. The FY2004 DOT budget proposed $54.3 billion, 2.6% lower than FY2003's $55.7 billion. The budget request aligned with TEA-21 and FAIR21 authorizing acts for highways, transit, and aviation funding. The FY2004 DOT budget request proposed $54.3 billion, slightly lower than the previous year. It aligned with TEA-21 and FAIR21 authorizing acts for highways, transit, and aviation funding, with some proposed changes to the funding structure. The FY2004 DOT budget request proposed changes to the highway and transit funding structure in line with the Administration's reauthorization proposal. Figures in the Department of Transportation Appropriations table may differ slightly from the Administration's totals due to differing treatment of offsets. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury Appropriations bill Conference Report Budget Authority table provided figures that may differ from the Administration's totals due to various funding actions and rounding discrepancies. Funding for two programs was removed during House deliberations on H.R. 2989 due to a dispute over the way funds were allocated. During House deliberations on H.R. 2989, funding for two programs was struck due to a dispute over fund allocation: FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program ($3.425 billion) and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border Enforcement program ($47 million), reducing total transportation funding in the bill by those amounts. Funding for these programs may be restored in conference. The House deliberations on H.R. 2989 resulted in the removal of funding for FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program ($3.425 billion) and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border Enforcement program ($47 million), reducing total transportation funding in the bill by those amounts. Funding for these programs may be restored in conference. Additionally, there was a 0.65% across-the-board rescission included in P.L. 108-7, and these amounts are in addition to the $50 million annual authorization for the Essential Air Service program, bringing the total FY2004 funding to $102 million. The FY2004 funding includes a 0.65% rescission from P.L. 108-7 and does not reflect the 0.59% rescission from H.R.2673. Additionally, $52 million is added to the $50 million annual authorization for the Essential Air Service program, totaling $102 million. Funding for the Appalachian Development Highway System is $187 million.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 provides the FAA with $13.93 billion, a $440 million increase over the FY2003 enacted level. The majority of the increased funding would be used for Operations & Maintenance expenses, with no major new initiatives. The FAA funding in FY2004, including the House bill and Senate bill, differs slightly with the majority allocated for Operations & Maintenance expenses. The funding comes mainly from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, with a small portion from the Treasury general fund. In FY2004, FAA funding primarily comes from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, with a small portion from the Treasury general fund. The Administration proposed an increase in general fund contribution for Operations & Maintenance expenses, with both the House and Senate agreeing on $3.4 billion for FY2003. The Administration proposed a general fund contribution of $3.3 billion for FY2003, which was ultimately raised to $3.4 billion. For FY2004, the general fund contribution was initially suggested at $1.5 billion but was raised to $3.5 billion in the House. The Senate proposed $1.5 billion, but the FY2004 Act increased the general fund contribution to $4.5 billion. The House Appropriations Committee initially suggested $1.5 billion from general funds, but the FY2004 Act raised it to $4.5 billion. This funding split is a key part of the annual FAA budget debate. The rationale behind the general fund contribution is that the public benefits from aviation, whether they use the system or not. Operations and Maintenance spending for FY2004 is set at $7.5 billion. The FY2004 Act increased the general fund contribution to $4.5 billion, a significant part of the annual FAA budget debate.

Project earmarking was a common practice in the annual appropriations bills during the TEA-21 authorization cycle. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $34.7 billion for FHWA, a 6% increase over FY2003. Project earmarking was prevalent in discretionary programs under FHWA's control. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act heavily earmarked discretionary programs under FHWA's control, including Interstate Discretionary, Bridge Discretionary, TCSP, CORBOR, and core formula programs like IM, NHS, and STP. This marked a departure from traditional practice. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 earmarked funds for core formula programs that were previously under state control, totaling over $1 billion in unobligated funds. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 earmarked over $1 billion in unobligated funds for core formula programs (STP, CMAQ, Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program).

The TEA-21 Funding Framework is extended until February 29, 2004, as Congress considers reauthorization proposals. The TEA-21 Funding Framework, which was extended until February 29, 2004, is expected to retain existing program funding. It created the largest surface transportation program in U.S. history, mostly continuing existing highway and transit programs. The authorizing legislation expected to emerge will likely retain a large part of the existing program funding framework from TEA-21, which created the largest surface transportation program in U.S. history. It mostly continued existing highway and transit programs from its predecessor legislation, ISTEA. The major federal-aid highway programs include the National Highway System (NHS) and Interstate Maintenance (IM). The FHWA has several sets of highway programs, including the National Highway System (NHS), Interstate Maintenance (IM), Surface Transportation Program (STP), Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation (BRR), and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ). These programs receive annual apportionment by formula and are not individually appropriated. There is also a separate \"exempt\" category for highway funding.

The President's advisers recommended a veto if the bill included a funding prohibition for public-private competitions. The Office of Management and Budget influenced changes to competitive sourcing provisions in H.R. 2989, part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. This initiative is part of the President's Management Agenda to promote competitive sourcing in federal executive agencies since February 2001. The Office of Management and Budget successfully influenced changes to competitive sourcing provisions in federal executive agencies. This initiative is part of the President's Management Agenda to promote competitive sourcing since February 2001. Circular A-76 provides policy and guidance for public-private competitions, with the enacted versions of the provisions found in Section 647 of H.R. 2673 (P.L. 108-199). The revised OMB Circular A-76 promotes competitive sourcing by requiring agencies to submit inventories of inherently governmental activities. Section 647 of H.R. 2673 (P.L. 108-199) outlines competitive sourcing provisions, including conditions for competitions involving more than 10 federal employees. Section 647(a) of H.R. 2673 (P.L. 108-199) imposes conditions on competitions involving more than 10 federal employees, requiring agencies to develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO). This MEO requirement, already mandated for standard competitions by Circular A-76, may aid in preparing a competitive in-house cost estimate but could pose challenges due to the time needed to complete it. Section 647(a) of H.R. 2673 (P.L. 108-199) mandates a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO) for competitions involving more than 10 federal employees. This requirement, already necessary for standard competitions, may help with cost estimates but could be challenging due to time constraints. Section 647(a) of H.R. 2673 (P.L. 108-199) mandates a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO) for competitions involving more than 10 federal employees. The circular's 90-day deadline for streamlined competitions may be extended to 135 days. Consideration of the conversion differential in streamlined competitions is required by Section 647(a), which is more stringent than Circular A-76. Section 647(a) mandates consideration of the conversion differential in streamlined competitions, directing the competitive sourcing official to assess how it would impact the contractor's cost. The official must determine if contracting out the activity would result in savings of $10 million or 10% of personnel costs. The competitive sourcing official must consider the cost impact of the conversion differential in streamlined competitions. They must assess if contracting out the activity would result in savings of $10 million or 10% of personnel costs, without clear criteria for comparison. The competitive sourcing official must consider the cost impact of the conversion differential in streamlined competitions, comparing contractor performance costs to government personnel costs. It is unclear how this decision would affect performance evaluations and if it could override them. The more stringent requirements for standard competitions are different from streamlined competitions. The CSO must consider the conversion differential in streamlined competitions, which may impact performance evaluations. Standard competitions have more stringent requirements, with agencies adding the conversion differential to non-incumbent costs as per Circular A-76. Executive agencies must submit annual reports on competitive sourcing activities as per Section 647(b). The Circular A-76 requires agencies to add the conversion differential to non-incumbent costs in standard competitions. Section 647(b) mandates executive agencies to submit annual reports on competitive sourcing activities, including completed competitions and associated costs. The Circular A-76 requires agencies to add the conversion differential to non-incumbent costs in standard competitions. Section 647(b) mandates executive agencies to submit annual reports on competitive sourcing activities, including completed competitions, costs, savings, and future plans. Reporting requirements aid congressional oversight and information collection. The Circular A-76 mandates agencies to include conversion differentials in standard competitions. Section 647(b) requires executive agencies to report on competitive sourcing activities, including costs, savings, and future plans. Establishing a reporting requirement could enhance congressional oversight and inform OMB policy, but the lack of a defined methodology for collecting this information may limit its usefulness and increase competitive sourcing costs. The absence of a methodology for collecting required information may reduce the usefulness of agency reports for informing OMB policy and agency decisions. Additionally, fulfilling this requirement could increase competitive sourcing costs. Agency heads are not required to limit the performance period in a letter of obligation to an MEO to five years or less under Section 647(c), allowing for more flexibility in recompetitions. Agency heads are not required to limit the performance period in a letter of obligation to an MEO to five years or less under Section 647(c), allowing for more flexibility in recompetitions. This modification could result in different treatment for government agencies and private sector sources, with contractors subject to recompetition under the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Allowing agencies to write letters of obligation with performance periods longer than five years could mitigate recruitment or retention problems among federal government employees. This could result in different treatment for government agencies and private sector sources in public-private competitions. Allowing agencies to write letters of obligation with performance periods longer than five years could mitigate recruitment or retention problems among federal government employees. Section 647(d) permits agency heads to use funds for monitoring the performance of activities after public-private competitions, supporting oversight efforts and enhancing decision-making. Section 647(d) allows agency heads to use funds for monitoring the performance of activities post public-private competitions, enhancing oversight and decision-making. Section 647(e) prohibits moving work previously done by federal government employees in the US to contractors outside the country, potentially impacting contractors' ability to bid competitively based on labor costs. The provision in the FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill prohibits moving work previously done by federal government employees in the US to contractors outside the country, potentially affecting contractors' ability to bid competitively based on labor costs. This could help retain jobs for US residents and benefit employers with workforce proximity to their facilities in the US. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill provision aimed to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on travel or travel-related transactions, benefiting US residents by retaining jobs and employers with workforce proximity to their facilities. The appropriations bill, H.R. 2989, initially included provisions to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions, but these were dropped in the final Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. Additionally, two Cuba-related provisions on remittances and educational exchanges were removed from the bill due to the White House's threat of vetoing any legislation that weakened economic sanctions against Cuba. The final Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 dropped provisions on Cuba from H.R. 2989, including remittances and educational exchanges, due to the White House's veto threat over weakening economic sanctions against Cuba. U.S. policy towards Cuba has focused on isolating the Communist government since the 1960s. The Administration's Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 2989 warned of a veto if the bill weakened sanctions against Cuba. U.S. policy towards Cuba has aimed to isolate the Communist government since the 1960s, with comprehensive economic sanctions in place. The Communist government of Fidel Castro faced comprehensive economic sanctions, including a trade embargo and prohibitions on U.S. financial transactions with Cuba, enforced through the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The sanctions were strengthened by congressional initiatives in 1992 and 1996 with the passage of the Cuban Democracy Act and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, known as the Helms/Burton legislation. These sanctions, particularly on financial transactions related to travel, have been a point of controversy. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act (P.L. 104-114), also known as the Helms/Burton legislation, imposed sanctions on financial transactions with Cuba, including travel, under the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Recent initiatives in the 108th Congress have aimed to lift or ease restrictions on Cuba sanctions, reflecting differing views on U.S. policy objectives towards Cuba. In the 108th Congress, various initiatives have been proposed to lift or ease Cuba sanctions, reflecting differing views on U.S. policy objectives towards Cuba. There is broad congressional agreement on the overall objective of promoting democracy and human rights in Cuba, but there are different approaches on how to achieve this goal. Some advocate for maximum pressure on the Cuban government, while others suggest lifting certain sanctions believed to harm the Cuban people, and some call for swift normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations by lifting the embargo. In the 108th Congress, there are differing views on U.S. policy towards Cuba. Some advocate for maximum pressure on the Cuban government, while others suggest lifting certain sanctions believed to harm the Cuban people, and some call for swift normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations by lifting the embargo. The House-approved version of H.R. 2929 had provisions to prevent funds from being used to enforce restrictions on travel and remittances, and to eliminate the travel category of people-to-people educational exchanges. The House-approved version of H.R. 2929 in the 108th Congress included provisions to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions and remittances, as well as eliminating the travel category of people-to-people educational exchanges. H.Amdt. 375, approved by a vote of 227-188, specifically aimed to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions, which have been a contentious component in U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been a contentious issue in U.S. efforts to isolate the country. Certain categories of travelers can visit Cuba under a general license, without needing special permission from OFAC. Certain categories of travelers can visit Cuba under a general license, including U.S. government officials, journalists, persons with close relatives in Cuba, full-time professionals, and amateur athletes participating in international competitions. Other travelers engaging in educational, religious, or other activities may be eligible for specific licenses. Certain categories of travelers, including full-time professionals, amateur athletes in international competitions, and various travelers engaging in educational or religious activities, may be eligible for specific licenses to visit Cuba. Supporters of the Flake amendment argue that U.S. policy towards Cuba restricts the rights of Americans to travel to countries with communist or authoritarian governments, and that such travel can promote freedom and expose Cubans to alternative information. Opponents of the amendment disagree. Supporters of the Flake amendment argue that U.S. policy towards Cuba restricts Americans' rights to travel to countries with communist or authoritarian governments, believing such travel can promote freedom and expose Cubans to alternative information. Opponents fear not enforcing travel restrictions would provide the Cuban government with tourist revenue while cracking down on democracy activists. H.Amdt. 377 (Delahunt), approved 222-196, aimed to address these concerns. Opponents of the amendment argued that not enforcing travel restrictions would benefit the Cuban government financially while it suppresses democracy activists. H.Amdt. 377 (Delahunt) aimed to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on remittances, becoming section 746 of the House bill. OFAC amended Cuba travel regulations in March 2003 to allow travelers to carry up to $3,000 in remittances. The Delahunt amendment, passed by a vote of 222-196, aimed to lift the cap on remittances to Cuba, allowing Cuban Americans to send unlimited financial support to their families. Supporters argued for no limits, while opponents feared more money would go to the Cuban regime through government-owned stores with inflated prices. The Delahunt amendment, approved by a vote of 246-173, aimed to lift the cap on remittances to Cuba, allowing Cuban Americans to send unlimited financial support to their families. Supporters argued for no limits, while opponents feared more money would go to the Cuban regime through government-owned stores with inflated prices. H.Amdt. 382 (Davis) would have prohibited funds from being used to eliminate the travel category of people-to-people educational exchanges. In March 2003, OFAC announced tighter regulations on Cuba travel, restricting certain types of educational exchanges. Some groups supported the restrictions, while others criticized the decision to limit travel opportunities to Cuba for ordinary people. The Senate approved a measure to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on Cuba travel, which had become a contentious issue due to tighter regulations on educational exchanges. Some supported the restrictions, while others criticized the limitations on travel opportunities for ordinary people. The Senate approved a measure to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on Cuba travel, allowing ordinary people to travel and exchange with counterparts on the island. The Senate provision, similar to the House version, aimed to ease restrictions on Cuba travel and transactions. The Dorgan amendment, defeated by a vote of 59-36, stated that the provision would take effect one day after enactment of the bill. Momentum behind legislative proposals to ease U.S. sanctions on Cuba was impacted by Cuba's human rights crackdown in 2003. The provision by S.Amdt. 1901 (Craig) would take effect one day after bill enactment. Cuba's human rights crackdown in 2003 affected legislative proposals to ease U.S. sanctions on Cuba. The House-approved Cuba amendments to H.R. 2989 had less support compared to 2002. The Flake amendment to H.R. 2989 was approved by a vote of 227-188, while a similar Flake amendment to the FY2003 Treasury Department appropriations bill had a vote of 262-167.

The curr_chunk discusses various legislative initiatives and programs related to transportation, including ARC, AIP, AIR21, ARAA, ATSA, BRR, BTS, CG, CMAQ, and DOT. The curr_chunk provides a list of legislative initiatives and programs related to transportation, including ATSA, BRR, BTS, CG, CMAQ, DOT, EAS, F&E, FAA, FAHP, and FAIR21. The curr_chunk lists various transportation programs and legislative initiatives, including FHWA, DOT, EAS, F&E, FAA, FAHP, FAIR21, FRA, FTA, Hazmat, HPP, HTF, IM, ITS, and MCSAP. The curr_chunk provides a list of transportation programs and agencies, including FHWA, FRA, FTA, Hazmat, HPP, HTF, IM, ITS, MCSAP, New Starts, NHS, NHTSA, NMCSA, and O&M. The curr_chunk lists various transportation programs and agencies such as MCSAP, New Starts, NHS, NHTSA, NMCSA, O&M, OIG, OST, RABA, RD&T, RE&D, RSPA, and SCASD. The curr_chunk provides acronyms for various transportation programs and agencies such as FAA's O&M, DOT's OIG, OST, RABA, FHWA's RD&T, RE&D, RSPA, SCASD, STB, STP, TCSP, TEA-21, and TIFIA. The SCASD program is part of the FAA, while STB and STP are under FHWA. TCSP is also a FHWA program. TEA-21 is the current highway and transit legislation. TIFIA is a financing program. TSA is the Transportation Security Administration. Transportation is part of the unified congressional budget and funded mainly through trust funds. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program (TIFIA) is part of the FHWA. Transportation is a function in the annual unified congressional budget and is funded mainly through dedicated transportation trust funds. These trust funds include the highway trust fund, airport and airway trust fund, and inland waterways trust fund, with funding also coming from federal Treasury general funds. The Department of Transportation (DOT) funding comes from transportation trust funds and federal Treasury general funds. Trust funds, such as the highway trust fund and airport and airway trust fund, are funded by specific taxes and accounted for over two-thirds of federal transportation spending in FY2002. Highway and transit programs are primarily funded through contract authority linked to the highway trust fund, making it significant for budgeting purposes. In FY2002, trust funds, including the highway trust fund, accounted for a significant portion of federal transportation spending. Highway and transit programs receive funding through contract authority linked to the highway trust fund, allowing for automatic availability of authorized funds at the start of each fiscal year. Contract authority in transportation funding allows for automatic availability of authorized funds at the beginning of each fiscal year, without the need for new budget authority. This differs from other federal programs that require annual appropriations. Outlays for transportation projects are covered by appropriations at a later date, even though the authority to spend already exists. During the 105th and 106th Congresses, major legislation changed the relationships between transportation trust funds and the federal budget, with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) linking annual spending for highway programs. Transportation appropriators face the unique situation where the authority to spend for their largest programs already exists, and the mechanism to obligate funds is in place. During the 105th and 106th Congresses, major legislation changed the relationships between transportation trust funds and the federal budget. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) linked annual spending for highway programs directly to revenue collections for the highway trust fund, creating a \"firewall\" around highway and transit spending programs. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) created a \"firewall\" around highway and transit spending programs by linking annual spending for highway programs directly to revenue collections for the highway trust fund. Funding guarantees were established to make it difficult for funding levels to be altered, with additional highway funds provided through a mechanism called \"Revenue Aligned Budget Authority\" (RABA). TEA-21 established funding guarantees for highway and transit programs, making it challenging to alter funding levels. Additional highway funds can be provided annually through Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA). However, in FY2003, the RABA adjustment would have caused a significant drop in highway obligational funding if left intact during the appropriations process. This changed the role of House and Senate committees in determining annual spending levels for highways. TEA-21 established funding guarantees for highway and transit programs, making it challenging to alter funding levels. The RABA adjustment in FY2003 would have caused a significant drop in highway obligational funding if left intact during the appropriations process, changing the role of House and Senate committees in determining annual spending levels for highways. The appropriations committees are limited in setting annual obligations for highway and transit programs due to TEA-21 regulations. The House and Senate committees are restricted from altering spending levels for specific programs or projects. In FY2000, there were attempts to regain some discretion over highway spending through fund redistribution and adding new projects. In FY2000, appropriators took steps to regain discretion over highway spending by redistributing funds and adding new projects. This trend continued in FY2001 with additional funding for earmarked projects and redirection of funds between programs. FY2002 saw an acceleration of this trend with significant funding increases for TEA-21 programs. In FY2001, appropriators added funds for earmarked projects and redirected funding between programs. The FY2002 Act saw major redistributions of RABA funds and transfers to agencies not eligible for RABA funding under TEA-21. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (FAIR21 or AIR21) provided a guarantee for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FY2002 Act saw redistributions of RABA funds and transfers to ineligible agencies. The FAIR21 provides a guarantee for FAA program spending, different from TEA-21, relying on two point-of-order rules for the House and Senate. Supporters believe it requires significant new spending on aviation programs. The FAIR21 guarantee for FAA program spending differs from TEA-21 by relying on two point-of-order rules for the House and Senate. Supporters believe it necessitates increased spending on aviation programs. Spending grew significantly for FY2001 and FY2002 appropriations cycles. Congress can waive points-of-order during legislation consideration. Significant new spending on aviation programs under FAIR21 guarantees, viewed as weaker than TEA-21. Congress can waive points-of-order during legislation consideration. Transportation appropriators have control over spending for TSA, Coast Guard, Federal Railroad Administration, and smaller DOT agencies concerned about funding prospects in constrained budgetary environments. Transportation budgeting involves various agencies. TEA-21 and FAIR21 give transportation appropriators control over spending for TSA, Coast Guard, Federal Railroad Administration, and smaller DOT agencies. Transportation budgeting uses a confusing lexicon of budget authority and contract authority. Contract authority provides funding for trust fund-financed programs like the federal-aid highway program. Contract authority, a form of budget authority, provides obligational authority for trust fund-financed programs like the federal-aid highway program. Changes in the transportation budget component were previously achieved by combining changes in budget/contract authority and placing limitations on obligations to control outlays in line with congressional budget agreements. The annual transportation budget component achieved spending changes through a combination of budget/contract authority adjustments and limitations on obligations to control outlays in line with congressional budget agreements. Contract authority provides obligational authority for trust fund-financed programs, allowing funds to be automatically available to states at the start of each fiscal year without the need for appropriations legislation. Under Title 23 U.S.C., TEA-21 authorized funds are automatically available to states at the start of each fiscal year for highway and transit projects. Appropriations are needed for future outlays to cover these obligations. TEA-21 limited the role of appropriations in core programs by setting obligation levels for FY1999-FY2003. States pay for projects upfront under reimbursable highway and transit grant programs. TEA-21 limited the role of appropriations in core highway and transit programs by setting obligation levels for FY1999-FY2003. States pay for projects upfront and federal payments are made only upon completion of work. Work in progress is considered obligated funds in the trust fund. The trust fund balances appear high because funds must remain available to cover current and future commitments for highway and transit projects. Payments are made when projects are completed, leading to substantial short- and long-term commitments. Trust fund balances appear high due to funds needed for current and future commitments for highway and transit projects. This includes payments for completed projects and outstanding obligations for future payments. Additionally, there are unobligated amounts dedicated to projects but not yet committed. Contract authority funds are distributed to states and programs. Contract authority funds are distributed to states and programs through apportionments and allocations. Apportionments are formula-driven funds for state projects like the national highway system, while allocations are administratively distributed funds for federal programs like the federal lands highway program. The terms apportionments and allocations refer to the distribution of contract authority funds to states and programs. Apportionments are formula-driven funds for state projects like the national highway system, while allocations are administratively distributed funds for federal programs like the federal lands highway program. These terms provide a frame of reference for highway program recipients. The federal lands highway program allocates funds to federal agencies, states, Indian tribes, or other governmental entities. Recipients may mistakenly assume that state apportionments are part of the federal budget."
