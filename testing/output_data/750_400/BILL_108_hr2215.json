Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States each year due to inadequately treated sewage, leading to various gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses. Swimming in contaminated waters can lead to various illnesses such as gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and giardiasis. Millions of Americans get sick annually from exposure to sewage in water, resulting in significant economic losses. Swimming in contaminated waters can lead to illnesses like gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and giardiasis. The economic impact of beach closings due to pathogen contamination is valued at $1-2 billion annually in the US. Economic losses from swimming-related illnesses are estimated at $28 billion yearly. Improved monitoring and reporting of sewer overflows could prevent millions of Americans from getting sick. Public health authorities are not routinely notified of sewer overflows that threaten public health, estimated at $28 billion annually.
