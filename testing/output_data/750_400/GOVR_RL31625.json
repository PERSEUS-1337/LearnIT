It is one of the oldest federal support programs for higher education, established in 1958. The Higher Education Act's Title VI, established in 1958, supports foreign language and area studies programs in colleges and universities. It prioritizes diplomacy, national security, and trade competitiveness. The Higher Education Act's Title VI, established in 1958, supports foreign language and area studies programs in colleges and universities, prioritizing diplomacy, national security, and trade competitiveness. Interest in federal programs supporting FLAS has increased due to concerns about terrorism from regions not commonly included in American curricula. The program has a long history reflecting the government's emphasis on FLAS. The funding for Title VI and other federal programs supporting FLAS has increased recently due to concerns about terrorism from foreign regions not commonly included in American curricula. The report provides an overview of Title VI programs and reauthorization issues, with appropriations remaining at $93.1 million in FY2007 and $95.6 million in FY2008. The report provides an overview of Title VI programs, including specific activities and funding details. The U.S. Department of Education has discretion in allocating funds among these activities, with separate authorization levels for Parts A, B, and C. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 authorized Title VI programs with separate authorization levels for Parts A, B, and C. The U.S. Department of Education has discretion in allocating funds among these activities, with grants made on a multi-year basis. The statutory authorities in the Higher Education Act expired at the end of FY2004. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 authorized Title VI programs with separate authorization levels for Parts A, B, and C, with grants made on a multi-year basis. The statutory authorities in the Higher Education Act expired at the end of FY2004 but have been recently extended. The last specific authorization was for FY1999, allocating $80 million for Part A, $18 million for Part B, and $10 million for Part C. No more than 10% of Part A funds may be used for Undergraduate International Studies and Foreign Language Programs. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 authorized Title VI programs with separate authorization levels for Parts A, B, and C, with grants made on a multi-year basis. The HEA expired at the end of FY2004 but has been recently extended. The last specific authorization was for FY1999, allocating $80 million for Part A, $18 million for Part B, and $10 million for Part C. No more than 10% of Part A funds may be used for Undergraduate International Studies and Foreign Language Programs. HEA Title VI authorizes various activities, with a majority of funds allocated to National Language and Area Centers (NLACs) and FLAS Fellowships. Studies and Foreign Language Programs under HEA Title VI primarily allocate funds to National Language and Area Centers (NLACs) and FLAS Fellowships. NLAC grant recipients also offer FLAS Fellowships to graduate students, with these programs being the core activities supported under Title VI. Other smaller-scale activities serve more specific goals. Grant recipients receive FLAS Fellowships for their graduate students, with NLAC grant recipients also offering these fellowships. The core activities supported under Title VI are the NLACs and FLAS Fellowships, while other programs serve more specific goals or support the primary programs. Funds are allocated competitively under each HEA Title VI program. Funds under HEA Title VI programs are allocated competitively to support specific goals and primary programs, emphasizing excellence and equitable distribution. The allocation of funds under HEA Title VI programs emphasizes excellence and equitable distribution, particularly in the selection of National Language and Area Centers, FLAS Fellowship recipients, and Language Resource Centers. Funding provisions specify the languages or world regions in which aided students are to specialize. The increased funding for Title VI comes with provisions specifying activities and languages for aided students. The FY2002 Department of Education Appropriations Act included earmarks for increased funds. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution omitted these earmarks. The FY2002 Department of Education Appropriations Act and FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution specified regions and languages for Title VI funds, aiming to sustain investments in training experts with foreign language proficiency and cross-cultural skills. The Resolution and conference report specified regions and languages for Title VI funds to sustain investments in training experts with foreign language proficiency and cross-cultural skills in strategic world areas important to national security interests. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (P.L. 108-447) and conference report (H.Rept. 108-792) allocate resources to build foreign language capacity in strategic world areas important to national security interests, with no constraints on languages or fund distribution. One percent of the total appropriation is earmarked for program evaluation and outreach, with $1,500,000 for an independent review of Title VI programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (P.L. 108-447) and conference report (H.Rept. 108-792) do not impose restrictions on language emphasis or fund distribution. One percent of the total appropriation is allocated for program evaluation, outreach, and an independent review of Title VI programs. The National Foreign Language Center (NFLC) at the University of Maryland is a key source of evaluations for HEA Title VI programs. An independent review of Title VI programs is conducted by the National Research Council. The National Foreign Language Center (NFLC) at the University of Maryland provides evaluations for HEA Title VI programs. Funds under the International Research and Studies program can be used for assessing the effects of these programs, including the utilization of program graduates. ED has provided funds to the NFLC for the \"Evaluation of Exchange, Language, International and Area Studies (EELIAS) Project.\" Funds under the International Research and Studies program can be used for assessing the effects of HEA Title VI programs, including the utilization of program graduates. ED has provided funds to the NFLC for the \"Evaluation of Exchange, Language, International and Area Studies (EELIAS) Project\" to meet evaluation and assessment needs for HEA Title VI and the Fulbright-Hays program. The EELIAS project aims to evaluate HEA Title VI programs and the Fulbright-Hays program by developing performance indicators, an Internet-based data reporting system, and program evaluations. It also seeks to assess the need for advanced foreign language and international studies at IHEs. The EELIAS project is developing performance indicators, an Internet-based data reporting system, and program evaluations for HEA Title VI programs and the Fulbright-Hays program. It aims to assess the need for advanced foreign language and international studies at IHEs through internal and external evaluations over a five-year period. The EELIAS project is evaluating the need for advanced foreign language and international studies at IHEs through internal and external evaluations over a five-year period. A 2000 report assessed the impact of HEA Title VI support on national language capacity. The impact of HEA Title VI support on national language capacity, specifically focusing on the less commonly taught languages, has been deemed critical. IHEs receiving Title VI NLAC grants enroll a significant percentage of graduate students in these languages, highlighting their strategic importance for the United States. The HEA Title VI support has been crucial for maintaining the nation's capacity in less commonly taught languages, which are strategically important for the United States. IHEs receiving Title VI NLAC grants enroll a large percentage of graduate students in these languages and have supported the development of textbooks. The Higher Education Act may be up for reauthorization during the 110th Congress. The Higher Education Act Title VI grants have been vital for supporting less commonly taught languages at IHEs, with over half of textbooks in these languages being developed with this funding. The reauthorization of the Higher Education Act during the 110th Congress may lead to debates on issues related to Title VI, as there is a growing importance of interactions between American society and cultures worldwide, raising national security concerns. There is a consensus that the interaction between American society and global cultures is increasing, leading to national security concerns. It is crucial for the nation to provide education and support for individuals to acquire advanced knowledge of languages and cultures of current global importance. It is important for the nation to provide education and support for individuals to acquire advanced knowledge of languages and cultures of current global importance, including both major and minor ones. It is crucial to provide ongoing support for instruction in all major and minor languages and cultures globally, not just those with major security or trade interests. The question is whether federal government support should be provided for instruction in critical foreign languages and cultures, focusing on colleges, universities, or federally-operated institutions. The federal government is considering providing support for instruction in critical foreign languages and cultures, with a focus on colleges, universities, and federally-operated institutions. This includes two foreign language schools operated by the government to meet immediate language requirements. The federal government is considering supporting instruction in critical foreign languages and cultures at colleges and universities, as well as federally-operated institutions. This includes two government-operated language schools in Monterey, California, and Arlington, Virginia. The structure of Title VI, which provides grants to institutions for specific educational programs, differs significantly from the general approach of the Higher Education Act (HEA). The HEA primarily focuses on student aid based on financial need, leaving subject selection to students. Title VI of the Higher Education Act departs from the general approach by providing institutional aid for specific subject areas and fellowships limited to students in those fields. It is one of the few HEA programs focused on particular subjects, unlike most aid which is based on financial need. Title VI of the Higher Education Act focuses on providing institutional aid for specific subject areas, such as advanced study of foreign languages and regions, with a special emphasis on national security, defense, and economic importance. The continuation of subject area-specific aid under Title VI is crucial for advanced study of foreign languages and regions, especially for national security, defense, and economic competitiveness. Maintaining research and instructional programs in critical areas is a national priority that should be supported in federally-operated institutions and colleges. Supporters argue that maintaining research and instructional programs in critical foreign language and area studies is a national priority for national security, defense, and economic competitiveness. These skills are essential not just for federal employees but also for international trade and diplomacy. The importance of foreign language and area studies in colleges and universities extends beyond federal employee needs to include national defense, diplomacy, international trade, and cultural outreach. Research and language instruction are more likely to thrive in higher education institutions than in federal institutions focused solely on language training. The quality of Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) programs is heavily reliant on the resources available in these academic settings. The importance of foreign language and area studies in colleges and universities extends beyond federal employee needs to include national defense, diplomacy, international trade, and cultural outreach. Research and language instruction are more likely to thrive in higher education institutions than in federal institutions focused solely on language training. The quality of FLAS programs depends significantly on the development of linkages between American and foreign educational institutions, which is easier for colleges and universities to establish. The development of linkages between American and foreign educational institutions is crucial for the quality of FLAS programs. It is easier for colleges and universities to establish such ties compared to federal government institutions. Additionally, support for specific subject areas under HEA Title VI is not unique, as other federal agencies also provide support for instruction in specific fields on a larger scale. Title VI is not unique when considering federal agencies beyond ED. Other agencies support specific subject areas on a larger scale, such as health care education by NIH, science and math education by NSF. These areas are seen as nationally important. The National Institutes of Health and other agencies of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as the National Science Foundation, provide support for health care education, science, and mathematics education, which are considered nationally important subject areas. These areas are perceived as worthy of targeted federal support. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of targeted federal support for critical foreign languages and area studies in higher education. It suggests that federal aid could be limited to start-up costs for initiating programs, rather than ongoing costs. Additionally, it proposes more systematic efforts to identify and utilize language skills. The curr_chunk suggests that federal support for foreign language and area studies in higher education should focus on start-up costs rather than ongoing expenses. It also recommends utilizing the language skills of recent immigrants and mentions the support provided by private foundations, colleges, universities, and corporations. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of offering instruction in rare languages like Pashto or Farsi in higher education. It highlights the support provided by private foundations, colleges, universities, and corporations for foreign language and area studies. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of federal aid, specifically under programs like Title VI, to support the teaching of rare languages such as Pashto or Farsi in higher education. It emphasizes the need for national support due to the lack of incentive for individual institutions or states to fund such programs, highlighting the role of economies of scale in ensuring ongoing support for critical languages and world regions.

It highlights the need for national support due to the lack of incentive for individual institutions or states to fund such programs. The report focuses on Title VI of the HEA as a key source of federal support for FLAS in U.S. colleges and universities. It questions the coordination of Title VI with other programs and suggests potential consolidation for improved efficiency. The report examines federal support for FLAS in U.S. colleges and universities through Title VI of the HEA. It raises concerns about the coordination of Title VI with other related programs and proposes potential consolidation for better efficiency. One of the purposes of Title VI is to coordinate federal programs in foreign language, area studies, and international studies. This includes programs like the Fulbright-Hays Act, NSEP, Gilman International Scholarship Program. The Fulbright-Hays Act authorizes international exchange activities administered by the Department of State, including programs like NSEP and the Gilman International Scholarship Program. The Fulbright-Hays Act authorizes international exchange activities administered by the Department of State, including exchanges of graduate students, scholars, and professionals in various fields. Participants are primarily citizens of nations other than the United States. The Fulbright-Hays Act authorizes international exchange activities administered by the Department of State for graduate students, scholars, and professionals from various fields. These activities include exchanges primarily involving citizens of nations other than the United States, while the Fulbright-Hays programs relevant to HEA Title VI support foreign travel-related activities for American graduate students and professors. The Fulbright-Hays programs relevant to HEA Title VI, administered by ED's Office of Postsecondary Education, support foreign travel activities for American graduate students and professors. These activities focus on improving FLAS instruction in U.S. colleges and universities and are available only to U.S. citizens or nationals. The total appropriation for these programs was $12.9 million for FY2003, much smaller in scale than HEA Title VI. The Fulbright-Hays programs, administered by ED's Office of Postsecondary Education, support foreign travel activities for American graduate students and professors to improve FLAS instruction in U.S. colleges and universities. These activities are available only to U.S. citizens or nationals. The total appropriation for these programs was $12.9 million for FY2003, smaller in scale than HEA Title VI. The NSEP, under the David L. Boren National Security Education Act, provides aid for international education and foreign language studies for American undergraduate and graduate students. The David L. Boren National Security Education Act (NSEA) authorizes aid for international education and foreign language studies by American students. It includes scholarships for undergraduate students, grants for institutions to establish programs, and fellowships for graduate students. The goal is to allocate one-third of annual grant funding to each of these activities, with a trust fund of $150 million. The NSEA provides aid for international education and foreign language studies through scholarships for undergraduate students, grants for institutions to establish programs, and fellowships for graduate students. A trust fund of $150 million was established in FY1992 for this purpose. Recipients of NSEP fellowships and scholarships are required to seek employment in a national security position for a limited period of time. A trust fund of $150 million was provided in FY1992 for NSEP scholarships and fellowships. Recipients are required to seek employment in a national security position or work in higher education related to their field of study if unable to find such positions. Institutional grants have supported instructional and exchange programs. In FY1992, a trust fund of $150 million was allocated for NSEP scholarships and fellowships. Recipients must make a \"good faith\" effort to secure national security positions or work in higher education related to their field of study if unsuccessful. Institutional grants have focused on supporting instructional and exchange programs involving less commonly taught languages, increasing disadvantaged/minority student participation in international programs, and integrating foreign language and international studies with professional education. The revised strategy for institutional grants starting in 2003 includes a Flagship Language Initiative to support advanced study of critical foreign languages, authorized by P.L. 107-306. The revised strategy for institutional grants starting in 2003 includes a Flagship Language Initiative to support advanced study of critical foreign languages, authorized by P.L. 107-306. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) aims to complement existing foreign language and area studies programs. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) was authorized by P.L. 107-306 to complement existing foreign language and area studies programs. It includes unique elements such as a service requirement and support for travel grants to undergraduate students. There may be potential overlap between NSEP institutional grants and HEA Title VI National and Language Resource Center grants. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) includes a service requirement and supports travel grants for undergraduate students. There is potential for overlap between NSEP institutional grants and HEA Title VI National and Language Resource Center grants. NSEP is administered by the Department of Defense's National Defense University under the guidance of a National Security Education Board (NSEB) to determine critical areas for national security. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) is administered by the Department of Defense's National Defense University under the guidance of a National Security Education Board (NSEB). The Board determines critical areas for national security, with grants largely administered through non-governmental organizations like the Institute of International Education (IIE) for undergraduate students. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) is largely administered through non-governmental organizations like the Institute of International Education (IIE) for undergraduate students. In the 104th Congress, there were attempts to eliminate the program and return its $150 million trust fund to the Treasury. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) is administered through non-governmental organizations like the Institute of International Education (IIE) for undergraduate students. In the 104th Congress, attempts were made to eliminate the program and return its $150 million trust fund to the Treasury. The trust fund was eventually cut in half to $75 million. Annual funding for NSEP was set at $8 million in Fiscal Year 2003. Additional appropriations have been authorized as well. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) trust fund was initially $150 million but was reduced to $75 million in a final compromise with the Senate. The annual funding level for NSEP is $8 million, with additional appropriations authorized. NSEP differs from HEA Title VI as it has a service requirement, focuses on national security-related FLAS skill needs, is financed via a trust fund, and supports international travel for undergraduate students. NSEP is administered by the Department of Defense (DOD) and not the Department of Education (ED). The National Security Education Program (NSEP) differs from HEA Title VI as it has a service requirement, focuses on national security-related FLAS skill needs, is financed via a trust fund, and supports international travel for undergraduate students. NSEP is administered by the Department of Defense (DOD) and is authorized by the International Academic Opportunity Act of 2000. The NSEP program, administered by DOD, is smaller than Title VI and offers scholarships of up to $5,000 for U.S. citizen undergraduate students. Eligible students must receive financial aid under ED's Pell Grant program, with preference given to first-time recipients. The scholarships for community college students can be used for travel, tuition, and study abroad expenses. Eligible students must be Pell Grant recipients from low-income families, with preference given to first-time study abroad students. There are no restrictions on subjects or regions, except for Cuba or countries under a travel warning. The Gilman program offers scholarships for study abroad to students who have not studied abroad before, with no specific focus on subjects or regions. The program aims to provide opportunities to students who may not otherwise be able to participate. Administered by the Department of State, 179 students received Gilman Scholarships for the 2002-2003 academic year. The Gilman program provides study abroad opportunities to students who may not otherwise be able to participate. Administered by the Department of State, 179 students received Gilman Scholarships for the 2002-2003 academic year. The program is funded by the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) under Title VII, Part B of the HEA. The Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) administers programs to foster innovative approaches in U.S. postsecondary education. FIPSE is authorized by Title VII, Part B of the HEA and supports activities related to international education through specific programs like the Program for North American Mobility in Higher Education and the U.S.-Brazil Higher Education Consortia Program. Some grants under FIPSE's general program support international education programs, while targeted support for activities related to international education is provided through specific programs like the Program for North American Mobility in Higher Education, the U.S.-Brazil Higher Education Consortia Program, and the European Community-United States of America Cooperation Program. These programs offer multi-year grants to U.S. institutions to collaborate with foreign institutions on student and staff exchange, curriculum development, and other activities. The European Community-United States of America Cooperation Program in Higher Education and Vocational Education and Training, along with other similar programs, provide multi-year grants to U.S. institutions to collaborate with foreign institutions on student and staff exchange, curriculum development, and other activities. Funding levels for these programs in FY2002 are $2,043,000 for the Program for North American Mobility in Higher Education, $1,495,000 for the U.S.-Brazil Higher Education Consortia Program, and $2,254,000 for the European Community-United States of America Cooperation Program. The FY2002 funding levels for various higher education programs are $2,043,000 for the Program for North American Mobility, $1,495,000 for the U.S.-Brazil Higher Education Consortia Program, and $2,254,000 for the European Community-United States Cooperation Program. There is a question of whether these programs should be consolidated for efficiency. Consolidation of related education and training programs is being questioned for efficiency. Coordination or consolidation may not be as crucial for smaller programs compared to Title VI. Programs like Fulbright-Hays, FIPSE, and NSEP institutional grant programs are discussed. The importance of coordination or consolidation of education and training programs is being questioned for efficiency. Programs like Fulbright-Hays, FIPSE, and NSEP institutional grant programs are similar to activities funded by HEA Title VI. Coordination among these programs could be enhanced by potential consolidation. The grant programs described are similar to activities funded by HEA Title VI, and coordination among them could be enhanced by potential consolidation. However, the NSEP has unique characteristics emphasizing national security needs and a service requirement for aid recipients, which may make coordination more consistent with its purposes than consolidation with Title VI. The NSEP has unique characteristics emphasizing national security needs and a service requirement for aid recipients, distinguishing it from other programs. Coordination through representation on the National Security Education Board may be more consistent with its purposes than consolidation with Title VI. The NSEP, with its unique emphasis on national security needs and service requirements for aid recipients, currently coordinates through representation on the National Security Education Board. However, questions arise about the efficiency of maintaining a separate program similar to Title VI, especially considering the NSEP's reduced trust fund and uncertain long-term viability. The Gilman International Scholarship Program also provides funding for undergraduate students. The NSEP faces questions about its long-term viability due to a reduction in its trust fund, while the Gilman International Scholarship Program provides funding for undergraduate students but lacks a national security focus. Transferring the Gilman program to the Department of Education and incorporating it under the Undergraduate International Studies and Foreign Language Programs of HEA is being considered. The Gilman International Scholarship Program provides funding for undergraduate students to travel abroad but lacks a national security focus. Consider transferring the program to the Department of Education and incorporating it under the Undergraduate International Studies and Foreign Language Programs of HEA Title VI. Additionally, proposals could be made to establish a multi-agency board or independent federal entity to coordinate all federal programs related to foreign language and international studies. Proposals may include establishing a multi-agency board or independent federal entity to coordinate federal programs for foreign language and international studies, including Fulbright-Hays activities and the K-12 Foreign Language Assistance Program. This entity could focus on long-range planning to meet the nation's needs for FLAS specialists. A proposal to establish a board or federal entity to coordinate foreign language and international studies programs, including Fulbright-Hays activities and the K-12 Foreign Language Assistance Program. The entity would focus on long-range planning to meet the nation's needs for FLAS specialists and improve coordination between HEA Title VI funded institutions and federal agencies offering language instruction. Currently, there is a question about the coordination between HEA Title VI funded institutions and federal agencies offering language instruction. Should there be explicit coordination in targeting fellowships and grants with the foreign language needs of government agencies, or more sharing of resources and instructional programs between federal language training institutions and IHEs supported by Title VI? The HEA Title VI grants are dispersed across various languages and regions, including critical areas like the Middle East and South. There is a question about coordinating grants with the language needs of government agencies and sharing resources between federal language training institutions and IHEs supported by Title VI. The NLAC and FLAS Fellowship grant recipients for FY2000-2002 cycle reflect a balance among world regions, including critical areas like the Middle East and South Asia, as well as Western Europe. The definition of \"critical\" regions may change over time. Title VI funding in U.S. IHEs covers various world regions, including the Middle East, South Asia, and Western Europe. There is a need to identify stable languages or regions that are not frequently taught in American IHEs for targeted grants. The decision-making process for allocating funds is a key consideration. It is important to identify stable languages or regions that are not frequently taught in American IHEs for targeted Title VI grants. The decision-making process for allocating funds is a key consideration, whether it should be done by ED alone, ED through an interagency advisory body, a new entity responsible for federal FLAS programs, or Congress through legislation. The decision-making process for allocating funds for Title VI grants raises questions about who should be responsible - ED alone, an interagency advisory body, a new entity for federal FLAS programs, or Congress through legislation. Federal funds for FLAS studies often require matching non-federal resources, leading to the argument that Title VI grants attract additional funding beyond direct support. The HEA Title VI programs require federal funds to be matched with non-federal resources, attracting additional funding from various sources. However, there are concerns about whether the program's scale is sufficient to meet national needs. The Title VI grants attract additional funds from various sources, but there are concerns about whether the program's scale is adequate to meet national needs. Opponents argue that predicting critical languages and regions in the future is challenging. Opponents of increased targeting of HEA Title VI grants argue that predicting critical languages and regions in the future is challenging. They suggest relying on the initiative of IHEs to develop proposals for new grants rather than directing grants through a central coordinating body. The uncertainty of predicting critical languages and regions in the future makes it challenging to determine where grants should be focused. Opponents suggest relying on the initiative of IHEs to develop proposals for new grants rather than directing grants through a central coordinating body. It is difficult to quantify national needs precisely, but efforts like the annual survey of Federal Language Needs linked to the NSEP help in assessing these needs. The annual survey of Federal Language Needs, linked to the NSEP, identifies foreign languages, world regions, and disciplines of major national security interest that are not commonly taught in colleges and universities. The annual survey of Federal Language Needs, linked to the NSEP, identifies a large number of foreign languages, world regions, and disciplines of major national security interest that are not commonly taught in colleges and universities. Another study by the General Accounting Office focused on federal departments and agencies concluded that the changing security environment and increasing globalization are important factors. The General Accounting Office conducted a study on federal departments and agencies, highlighting the increasing need for employees with foreign language skills due to the changing security environment and globalization of the U.S. economy. Shortages of translators, interpreters, diplomats, and intelligence specialists were reported, impacting agency operations. The changing security environment and globalization of the U.S. economy have led to a significant demand for federal employees with foreign language skills. Shortages of translators, interpreters, diplomats, and intelligence specialists have been reported in four agencies, impacting various operations including military, law enforcement, intelligence, counterterrorism, and diplomatic efforts."
