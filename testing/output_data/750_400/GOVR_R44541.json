    "content": "Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves exploiting the international trade system to transfer value and conceal the origins of illicit wealth. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) defines TBML as disguising crime proceeds through trade transactions to legitimize their illegal source, often by misrepresenting prices, quantities, or quality of goods. This method is used by terrorist groups to finance activities and disguise money flow and beneficiaries. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves disguising proceeds of crime through trade transactions to legitimize their illicit origin. TBML schemes, also known as TBML/FT when used by terrorist groups, implicate financial institutions in facilitating international trade transactions. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves disguising proceeds of crime through trade transactions to legitimize their illicit origin. Financial institutions are implicated in TBML and TBML/FT schemes when used to settle, facilitate, or finance international trade transactions. The U.S. Department of the Treasury identified TBML as a challenging form of money laundering in June 2015. In June 2015, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued reports on money laundering, highlighting trade-based money laundering (TBML) as a significant challenge. TBML schemes were described as capable of laundering billions of dollars annually, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also issued an advisory on TBML in February 2010. The U.S. Department of the Treasury highlighted trade-based money laundering (TBML) as a significant challenge, capable of laundering billions of dollars annually. A 2010 advisory by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network mentioned over 17,000 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) related to TBML, totaling more than $276 billion. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers also use the international financial system and cash couriers to disguise their activities. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves transactions totaling over $276 billion between January 2004 and May 2009. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers exploit the complexity of the international trade and finance system to obscure their activities through various means. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers exploit the international trade and finance system to obscure transactions through various means, including multiple foreign exchange transactions, co-mingling of funds, and exploiting vulnerabilities in financial arrangements. According to FATF, TBML techniques vary in complexity. Money launderers exploit vulnerabilities in financial arrangements necessary for cross-border trade to launder funds, using techniques like over- and under-invoicing of goods to obscure the money trail. TBML activities involve misrepresenting the price, quality, or quantity of goods as they cross borders or supply chains. TBML techniques involve misrepresenting goods' price, quality, or quantity during cross-border trade. Over- and under-invoicing of goods and services is a common method used to launder funds across borders, according to the FATF. Money laundering through over- and under-invoicing of goods and services is a common method for shifting funds across borders. In these transactions, exporters can transfer value to importers by invoicing below market value or extract value by invoicing above market value. Money laundering through over- and under-invoicing of goods and services involves exporters transferring or extracting value from importers by manipulating prices. Collusion between parties is necessary for these transactions, which can have significant tax implications. Complex products and those in supply chains are more likely to be involved in these activities, complicating customs officials' ability to determine true market value. Money laundering through over- and under-invoicing involves collusion between parties to manipulate prices of goods and services, leading to significant tax implications. Complex products and those in supply chains are more susceptible to these activities, making it difficult for customs officials to determine the true market value. Multiple invoicing can be used to justify multiple payments for the same transaction, allowing money launderers to use multiple financial institutions for these payments. Multiple invoicing of goods and services can be used by money launderers to justify multiple payments for the same transaction, increasing complexity and complicating detection efforts. If detected, launderers can offer plausible explanations to evade detection. Money launderers can manipulate transactions by over- and under-shipments of goods and services, misstating quantities, or colluding to not ship any goods at all while processing shipping and customs documents. This complicates detection efforts by officials and financial institutions. Money launderers can manipulate transactions by misstating quantities, quality, or type of goods and services, creating discrepancies in shipment and customs forms. This complicates detection efforts by officials and financial institutions. Money launderers use various techniques like misstating goods and services to hide illicit transactions. The Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE) is a common scheme involving the laundering of drug proceeds from Latin America. Colombian drug traffickers used sophisticated trade-based schemes to disguise billions in narcotics profits in the 1980s. The Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE) is a classic money-laundering scheme used by Colombian drug traffickers in the 1980s to disguise billions in narcotics profits. TBML is a common form of international money laundering and a method used by terrorist organizations, yet it is less understood by academics and policymakers compared to traditional money laundering methods. TBML is a common form of international money laundering used by terrorist organizations and less understood by academics and policymakers compared to traditional methods. Despite this, TBML can have significant consequences for global trade and government revenue. TBML's effects can have substantial consequences for international commerce and government revenue, potentially more destructive than other money laundering schemes. Transnational criminal organizations may dump imported goods purchased with illicit proceeds at a discount into a market to expedite the money laundering process. TBML can have a more destructive impact on legitimate commerce than other money laundering schemes. Transnational criminal organizations may dump imported goods purchased with illicit proceeds at a discount into a market to expedite the money laundering process, creating barriers to entrepreneurship and robbing governments of tax revenue. Pricing in money laundering creates a competitive disadvantage for legitimate businesses, crowding out economic activity and reducing tax revenue for governments. Global trade trends are exploited by criminal organizations to hide gains from illegal activities. The global trends that facilitated a quadrupling of global trade over the past quarter century are being used by criminal organizations to hide gains from illegal activities. Organized crime has expanded its activities into new markets following advances in communications, lower transportation costs, and the digital revolution. The digital revolution, global value chains, and urbanization have interconnected economies, creating new market opportunities. Organized crime has expanded into these markets, diversifying into profitable activities with low detection risks, according to a report by the OECD. According to a report by the OECD, global markets provide criminal organizations with new opportunities to diversify into profitable activities with low detection risks. Criminal groups have adapted to connect production to distant consumers, creating economies of scale and efficiencies similar to legitimate trade. This illegal trade allows for the diversification into new illicit markets and facilitates financial flows. Criminal groups have adapted to new market trends by engaging in diverse illicit activities to reach distant consumers, creating economies of scale and efficiencies similar to legitimate trade. The OECD warns that these illegal activities not only pose challenges for law enforcement but also have wide-ranging economic consequences, potentially leading to reduced domestic expenditure and investment in developing countries. Illicit trade and financial flows pose challenges for law enforcement and can have economic consequences, especially for developing countries. Criminal organizations and terrorist groups can exploit the international trade system with low risk of detection. The enormous volume of trade flows makes individual transactions difficult to track, creating vulnerabilities for illicit exploitation. According to FATF, the international trade system is vulnerable to exploitation by criminal organizations due to the enormous volume of trade flows, complex foreign exchange transactions, diverse financing arrangements, and the practice of mixing illicit funds with legitimate business cash flows. According to FinCEN, trade-based money laundering (TBML) is on the rise globally, facilitated by the complexity of foreign exchange transactions, diverse financing arrangements, commingling illicit funds with legitimate business cash flows, lack of verification procedures, and limited resources for customs agencies to detect illegal trade transactions. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) is increasing globally, with most activity identified in transactions involving Mexico, China, Panama, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela. Limited resources hinder customs agencies' ability to detect illegal trade transactions. Between January 2004 and May 2009, TBML activity was frequently identified in transactions involving Mexico, China, and Panama, potentially linked to the Panama Colon Free Trade Zone. The Dominican Republic and Venezuela showed rapid growth in potential TBML activity. The U.S. Department of State's 2016 report highlighted TBML concerns in various countries including Afghanistan, Australia, Belize, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, China, Colombia, Greece, Guatemala, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, the Philippines, and Singapore. According to the U.S. Department of State's 2016 report, TBML concerns have been identified in various countries including Afghanistan, Australia, Belize, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, China, Colombia, Greece, Guatemala, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, the Philippines, Singapore, Saint Maarten, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Uruguay, Venezuela, and the West Bank and Gaza. TBML is often associated with significant losses. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 highlighted TBML issues in Trinidad and Tobago, including potential revenue losses, corruption, and money laundering activities. TBML is associated with various illicit activities such as trade in gold and precious gems, circumvention of capital restrictions, and exploitation of free trade zones. The Treasury Department's June 2015 National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment found that while TBML is associated with various illicit activities, it is not a dominant method for terrorist financing. The Treasury Department's June 2015 National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment stated that TBML is not a dominant method for terrorist financing, despite anecdotal case studies showing its use by groups like Hezbollah. The main methods for moving money to terrorists are through physical cash movement and the banking system. Based on U.S. law enforcement investigations, terrorist financing involves moving money through physical cash, banks, licensed MSBs, and unlicensed money transmitters. Movement of cash and banking transactions are the primary methods for funding terrorists, according to the Treasury Department's National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment. The movement of funds for terrorist financing involves cash, banks, licensed MSBs, and unlicensed money transmitters. Cash movement accounted for 28 percent, banks 22 percent, licensed MSBs 17 percent, and unlicensed entities 18 percent. The remaining 15 percent involved checks, wire transfers, and TBML. TBML is a terrorism-related concern in Tunisia and Syria, used by hawala brokers with corrupt customs. The State Department's latest Country Reports on Terrorism highlighted trade-based money laundering (TBML) as a terrorism-related concern in Tunisia and Syria. TBML is used by hawala brokers in conjunction with corrupt customs and immigration officials. Hawala is an informal fund transfer method common in regions with limited formal banking systems. Hawala brokers work with corrupt officials to transfer funds through an informal system in regions with limited banking infrastructure. Trusted money brokers facilitate transfers among clients, settling balances outside traditional financial institutions. Unregulated hawala systems are favored for their speed, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. Unregulated hawala systems are preferred for their speed, reliability, and cost-effectiveness in transferring funds among clients. However, government authorities view them as lacking transparency and vulnerable to exploitation by terrorist groups. The State Department's 2016 report highlighted specific countries at risk of TBML/FT schemes. Unregulated hawala systems are seen as lacking transparency and vulnerable to exploitation by terrorist groups. The State Department's 2016 report identified specific countries at risk of TBML/FT schemes, such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Lebanon. The State Department's 2016 report identified countries vulnerable to TBML/FT schemes, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Lebanon. In Lebanon, individuals are involved in a TBML scheme with trade in vehicles and weapons to launder drug proceeds linked to Hezbollah. U.S. law enforcement traced money wires from Jordanian and Lebanese entities to domestic vehicle dealerships in the United States. In a TBML scheme, individuals trade vehicles and weapons to launder drug proceeds linked to Hezbollah. Money wires from Jordanian and Lebanese entities are sent to U.S. vehicle dealerships to purchase vehicles exported to Lebanon and Jordan, sometimes with hidden weapons. The transactions in the U.S. seem legitimate, but the ultimate destination of the vehicles is unknown, and proceeds may go back to Hezbollah in Lebanon. In Paraguay's Tri-Border Area, TBML schemes involving vehicle dealerships are used to purchase vehicles exported to Lebanon and Jordan, with hidden weapons. The ultimate destination of the vehicles is unknown, and proceeds may be directed back to Hizballah in Lebanon. TBML schemes in Paraguay's Tri-Border Area involve vehicle dealerships used to purchase vehicles exported to Lebanon and Jordan with hidden weapons, potentially directing proceeds back to Hizballah. In the United Arab Emirates, TBML schemes may support sanctions-evasion networks and terrorist groups in various countries. The Lebanese Canadian Bank was designated as a primary money-laundering institution in February 2011. The State Department reports that TBML schemes in the United Arab Emirates may support terrorist groups in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Somalia.

Woody Toys, Inc. owners received cash payments from drug trafficking and laundered funds in a BMPE scheme. In the late 2000s, owners of Woody Toys, Inc. received cash payments from Colombian and Mexican narcotics trafficking, which were laundered through a BMPE scheme. The cash deposits were kept under $10,000 to avoid reporting requirements. The toy company used the funds to purchase toys from China, which were then exported to Colombia. The Colombian pesos from toy sales were used to reimburse the drug traffickers. The toy company Woody Toys received cash payments from Colombian and Mexican drug traffickers, which were laundered through small deposits under $10,000 to avoid reporting requirements. The cash was used to buy toys from China, exported to Colombia, and the profits were used to reimburse the traffickers through the BMPE. Some employees had ties to a similar scheme at Angel Toy Company. The investigation benefited from information sharing between the US and Colombia through Trade Transparency Units.

The investigation benefitted from information sharing between the US and Colombia through Trade Transparency Units. Another money laundering scheme in the early 2000s involved cash couriers and money transfer services. In the early 2000s, a money laundering scheme involved cash couriers, money transfer services, and trade finance mechanisms managed by an Indian national in Dubai with businesses and affiliates worldwide. The individual opened letters of credit in Dubai. The money laundering scheme involved cash couriers, money transfer services, hawala, and trade finance mechanisms managed by an Indian national in Dubai. The individual operated businesses in Dubai and affiliates worldwide, opening letters of credit for importers to benefit affiliated exporters in India and other locations. The LCs were in amounts higher than market value, facilitated through connections with certain banks. The individual opened letters of credit (LCs) through his companies for importers, benefiting affiliated exporters in India with inflated export values. Bogus trade documents were used to satisfy banks, and drug trafficking funds were remitted along with the LCs to the exporters in India. The individual arranged for bogus trade documents with inflated export values to transmit LCs to affiliated exporters in India, along with drug trafficking funds, moving money through the financial system under the guise of trade financing. The exporters in India distributed the drug proceeds and sold the exports at market value, while offshore funds were moved through hawala operators by the same individual, who also facilitated trade in banned goods through falsified documents. The individual in India facilitated trade in banned goods by falsifying trade documents and using hawala operators to move funds offshore. The scheme involved exporting banned goods with falsely described values to circumvent restrictions. The individual in India facilitated trade in banned goods by falsifying trade documents and using hawala operators to move funds offshore. To circumvent restrictions, goods were falsely described and valued in trade documents. U.S. government policy responses to address trade-based money laundering include participation in the Financial Action Task Force and regulatory measures by the Treasury Department. The U.S. government's responses to trade-based money laundering (TBML) include participation in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), Treasury Department regulatory measures, and the use of Trade Transparency Units by the Department of Homeland Security. FATF develops AML/CFT guidelines and relies on member compliance through self-assessments and mutual evaluations. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) develops and promotes AML/CFT guidelines with 34 member countries and 2 regional organizations. FATF relies on self-assessments and mutual evaluations for member compliance and can suspend countries that fail to comply. Since 1989, FATF has been combating money laundering by examining techniques, trends, and issuing recommendations in 1990. Since its establishment in 1989, FATF has been combating money laundering by examining techniques, trends, and issuing recommendations. In 1990, FATF issued a report with 40 recommendations to fight against money laundering. The Treasury Department's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes leads the U.S. delegation to FATF, supporting global efforts to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit financing threats. The Treasury Department's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes leads the U.S. delegation to the FATF, supporting global efforts to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit financing threats. The U.S. delegation includes members from various government departments. The United States strongly supports the FATF in combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The U.S. delegation, led by the Treasury Department, includes members from various government departments and implements actions domestically to meet U.S. commitments to the FATF. In 2012, FATF members adopted a revised set of the FATF 40 Recommendations, integrating CFT guidelines into the core. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) develops U.S. positions, represents the United States at meetings, and implements actions domestically to meet commitments. In 2012, FATF adopted a revised set of 40 Recommendations integrating CFT guidelines and added the financing of weapons of mass destruction to areas of surveillance to deepen global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats. The FATF adopted a revised set of 40 Recommendations in 2012, integrating CFT guidelines and adding the financing of weapons of mass destruction to areas of surveillance. The new mandate aims to deepen global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats, strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and support efforts to raise standards, especially in low capacity countries. The revised recommendations address new and emerging threats, clarify existing obligations, and strengthen requirements for higher-risk situations. Countries are now allowed to take a more focused approach to areas with high risks. The revised recommendations by FATF aim to strengthen global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats, enhance partnerships with the private sector, and support efforts to raise standards, particularly in low capacity countries. The new standards address new and emerging threats, clarify existing obligations, and strengthen requirements for higher-risk situations. Additionally, the standards focus on transparency requirements related to beneficial ownership and control of legal entities to combat tax evasion, improve corporate governance, and address various criminal activities. The FATF standards aim to address high-risk areas and enhance implementation, including transparency requirements for beneficial ownership information. Recommendations to counter trade-based money laundering are not included in the current set of FATF 40 Recommendations, despite the recognition of increased opportunities for abuse by money launderers and terrorist financiers. The FATF 40 Recommendations do not include specific recommendations to counter trade-based money laundering (TBML), despite recognizing the increased opportunities for abuse in the international trade and financing system. The FATF has issued stand-alone reports on TBML and best practices, but surveys show a lack of comprehensive data on the extent of the TBML issue. Many jurisdictions do not identify TBML as a separate activity under the general topic of money laundering. The FATF has issued reports on TBML and best practices, but there is a lack of comprehensive data on the extent of the issue. Most jurisdictions do not identify TBML as a separate activity under money laundering and do not offer specific training on TBML activities. The FATF concluded that most jurisdictions do not offer specific training on trade-based money laundering (TBML) activities. They recommended developing training programs focused on financial and trade data analysis to detect TBML activities. FinCEN plays a central role in combating TBML by issuing advisories. The FATF recommended jurisdictions develop specific training programs for detecting TBML, focusing on financial and trade data analysis. FinCEN issues advisories and applies special measures to combat TBML, red flagging activities indicative of money laundering for financial institutions. FinCEN issues advisories and special measures to combat TBML, red flagging activities indicative of money laundering for financial institutions. The advisories assist in reporting suspicious activity related to TBML, based on law enforcement experience involving U.S. trade with Central and South America. In November 1997 and June 1999, FinCEN highlighted TBML and BMPE in advisories to aid financial institutions in reporting suspicious activity. In February 2010, an advisory on TBML was issued based on U.S. trade with Central and South America, outlining basic schemes and red flags. Financial institutions were urged to include TBML or BMPE on SARs due to inconsistent reporting and substantial delays. In May 2014, FinCEN issued an updated advisory on TBML, focusing on increased activity involving funnel accounts after restrictions on U.S. currency in Mexico. The advisory highlighted the basic schemes and red flags related to TBML, emphasizing the importance of including TBML or BMPE on SARs due to inconsistent reporting and significant delays. In May 2014, FinCEN issued an updated advisory on TBML, focusing on increased activity involving funnel accounts after restrictions on U.S. currency in Mexico. The advisory provides red flags associated with TBML activity conducted by Mexican criminal organizations. FinCEN also relies more on Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) to combat such activities. FinCEN issues advisory on TBML, highlighting red flags for suspicious activity by Mexican criminal organizations. Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) are increasingly used to combat criminal activities, imposing recordkeeping and reporting requirements in specific geographic areas. Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) were first authorized in 1988 to impose time-limited recordkeeping and reporting requirements on financial institutions or businesses in specific areas to help identify criminal activity. GTOs can only last for a maximum of 180 days and violators may face civil or criminal penalties. Recent GTOs have been used to combat trade-based money laundering (TBML), including one issued in April 2015 in Miami. In April 2015, FinCEN issued a GTO in Miami targeting electronics exporters, requiring them to report cash transactions over $3,000 to combat TBML. Violators may face civil or criminal penalties. In October 2015, FinCEN renewed the GTO targeting Miami-based electronics exporters, requiring them to report cash transactions over $3,000 to combat TBML schemes by drug and transnational crime organizations. In October 2015, FinCEN renewed the GTO targeting Miami-based electronics exporters to combat TBML schemes by drug and transnational crime organizations. Another GTO issued in the same month aimed at businesses in the Los Angeles Fashion District to frustrate drug traffickers exploiting fashion industry businesses for BMPE schemes. The GTO targeting businesses in the Los Angeles Fashion District aimed to combat drug traffickers exploiting the fashion industry for BMPE schemes. FinCEN may require financial institutions to take special measures against money laundering concerns. The U.S. agencies can impose regulatory special measures against foreign entities deemed to be of primary money laundering concern. These measures range from enhanced due diligence to prohibiting certain financial transactions. The Treasury Department, including OFAC, may also take administrative actions targeting designated foreign entities. In April 2013, FinCEN designated two Lebanese exchange houses, Halawi Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange, as primary money laundering concerns. Among eight active cases, two were involved in TBML. In April 2013, FinCEN designated Halawi Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange as primary money laundering concerns for their involvement in TBML, facilitating transactions for a large-scale scheme involving used cars exported to West Africa. US authorities also claim they provided money laundering services for international narcotics trafficking. According to U.S. government information, Halawi Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange were designated as primary money laundering concerns for their involvement in a large-scale TBML scheme. They facilitated transactions for the export of used cars to West Africa and provided money laundering services for an international narcotics trafficking network linked to Hezbollah. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security established the first Trade Transparency Unit in Washington, DC in 2004 to address these issues. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations established the first Trade Transparency Unit in Washington, DC in 2004 to identify instances of trade-based money laundering, customs fraud, contraband smuggling, and tax evasion linked to Hezbollah. Funding support often comes from the Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. Trade Transparency Units (TTUs) analyze trade anomalies and financial irregularities in domestic and foreign trade data to detect trade-based money laundering (TBML), customs fraud, contraband smuggling, and tax evasion for further law enforcement action. HSI and Treasury, often with funding from the Department of State, have established TTUs in various countries as part of plans to create an international network similar to the Egmont Group of FIUs. The 2007 National Money Laundering Strategy prioritizes combating TBML. The State Department, HSI, and Treasury have established Trade Transparency Units (TTUs) in various countries to combat trade-based money laundering (TBML). These TTUs are part of a broader plan to create an international network similar to the Egmont Group of FIUs. The 2007 National Money Laundering Strategy prioritizes attacking TBML, with ICE-led TTUs facilitating the exchange and analysis of trade data among trading partners. The State Department reports a growing number of TBML investigations emerging from TTU activity, with over $1 billion seized so far. The State Department, along with HSI and Treasury, has established Trade Transparency Units (TTUs) to combat trade-based money laundering (TBML) at home and abroad. The 114th Congress has addressed TBML in hearings focusing on specific terrorist groups like Hezbollah and regional security priorities, particularly in Latin America. Over $1 billion has been seized through the U.S.- and foreign-based TTU effort. Since the establishment of Trade Transparency Units (TTUs) by the State Department, HSI, and Treasury, over $1 billion has been seized to combat trade-based money laundering (TBML). The 114th Congress has addressed TBML in hearings focusing on specific terrorist groups like Hezbollah and regional security priorities, particularly in Latin America. Witnesses have raised concerns about the effectiveness and challenges facing U.S. and international efforts to combat TBML. The 114th Congress has focused on policy responses to combat anti-money laundering and terrorist financing, with hearings questioning the effectiveness of efforts, particularly Trade Transparency Units (TTUs). Discussions also revolve around the potential link between U.S. trade policy and commitments to combat TBML through TTUs. The 114th Congress has shown interest in the connection between trade policy, TTUs, and combating TBML and terrorist financing. Some policymakers are concerned about links between terrorism and TBML, despite the Treasury Department downplaying the relationship in a 2015 national risk assessment. Examples implicating Hezbollah in TBML have been cited. The 114th Congress has focused on the connection between TBML and terrorist financing, with concerns raised about links to Hezbollah. In December 2015, the Congress passed the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act to impose additional financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign institutions. The Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 was enacted by the 114th Congress to impose financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign institutions involved in TBML schemes. The Act requires reporting on Hezbollah's financing operations, including its use of TBML, and mandates periodic briefings on Hezbollah's assets and financing activities. The Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 imposed financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign institutions involved in TBML schemes. It required reporting on Hezbollah's financing operations, including its use of TBML, and mandated periodic briefings on Hezbollah's assets and financing activities. OFAC issued a final rule for implementing the Act in April 2016, with President Obama committing to taking strong action against Hezbollah operatives and supporters.
