    "content": "The Act titled \"Coastal Resources Enhancement and Restoration Act of 2000\" mandates that a minimum of 10 percent of engineering research grants from the National Science Foundation be allocated for coastal engineering and shoreline protection research starting in fiscal year 2001. Additionally, supplemental environmental programs in coastal areas are established. SEC. 3 of the Coastal Resources Enhancement and Restoration Act of 2000 amends Section 313 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to allow federal agencies violating the Act to choose to construct artificial reefs or undertake aquatic habitat restoration projects instead of paying fines. SEC. 4. ACCESS TO PUBLICLY OWNED SHORES. (a) Eligibility of Shoreline Protection Projects.--Subsection (d) of the Act authorizing Federal participation in the cost of protecting publicly owned shores is amended to consider shores with insufficient public access as privately owned. (b) Cost Sharing.--Section 103(d) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 is amended to address cost sharing for shoreline projects. The Secretary will consider publicly owned shores with insufficient public access as privately owned for cost-sharing purposes. The Secretary of the Army will issue rules to implement this change. The Secretary of the Army will issue rules to ensure public access to publicly owned shores with insufficient access. Exceptions may be allowed for environmentally sensitive areas. SEC. 5. BEACH NOURISHMENT ACCOUNT. Establishment of the Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury to receive funds from the general fund under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for beach nourishment without needing further appropriation. The Secretary of the Treasury will transfer 2 percent of funds from the general fund under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to the Beach Nourishment Account. The funds in the account do not require further appropriation and will be used for a pilot program by the Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA. Funds from the Beach Nourishment Account do not require further appropriation and will be used for a pilot program by the Secretary of Commerce, NASA, and the Secretary of the Army for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control projects. The Beach Nourishment Account allows the Secretary of the Army to carry out projects for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control. Funds in the account remain available until expended. The Secretary must adhere to cost-sharing requirements and other project-specific regulations. Transactions involving the account must be reported annually. The Beach Nourishment Account allows the Secretary of the Army to control projects and report transactions to Congress. The Secretary of the Treasury can invest funds not needed for current withdrawals. The Secretary of the Treasury can invest funds from the Beach Nourishment Account in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. Investments can be made on original issue or by purchasing outstanding obligations at market price. The Beach Nourishment Account allows the Secretary of the Treasury to invest in interest-bearing obligations of the United States, which can be acquired on original issue or by purchasing outstanding obligations at market price. Any acquired obligation can be sold at the market price, with interest and proceeds from sales or redemptions credited to the account. SEC. 6. COMPREHENSIVE OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM PILOT PROGRAM. The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA will jointly implement a pilot program to establish a comprehensive ocean monitoring network in the United States. They will partner with local and regional entities to collect a wide range of data on coastal oceans and inland waterways for real-time availability to interested parties. The pilot program aims to establish an ocean monitoring network in the US through partnerships with local and regional entities. Data collected will include wave heights, water temperature, coastal currents, and large mammal movement via implanted sensors. The pilot program will collect information in real-time, including wave heights, water temperature, coastal currents, large mammal movement, sewage outfall movement, water quality, fishing boat tracking, oil spill tracking, beach erosion data, and weather. The pilot program will also involve federal cooperation with the Geological Survey, Navy, and Environmental Protection Agency for various activities such as large mammal movement tracking, sewage outfall monitoring, water quality assessment, fishing boat tracking, oil spill tracking, beach erosion data collection, weather monitoring, river mouth sediment observation, and coastal mapping using Global Information System. The pilot program involves federal cooperation with the Geological Survey, Navy, and Environmental Protection Agency for activities such as beach erosion data collection, weather monitoring, river mouth sediment observation, and coastal mapping using Global Information System. Two regional test projects will be established, one in Southern California Bight and the other in Orange County. The pilot program involves federal cooperation with the Geological Survey, Navy, and Environmental Protection Agency to establish two regional test projects in Southern California Bight and Orange County. The projects will focus on activities such as beach erosion data collection, weather monitoring, river mouth sediment observation, and coastal mapping using Global Information System. The Secretary and the Administrator will coordinate with existing efforts of Federal, State, and local entities. The pilot program involves federal cooperation with various agencies to establish test projects in Southern California, with Orange County as the focal point. The Secretary and the Administrator will coordinate with existing efforts and seek to obtain additional information. $4,000,000 is authorized for the program from the Beach Nourishment Account. The pilot program aims to coordinate monitoring efforts for ocean conditions and gather new information. $4,000,000 is authorized annually from the Beach Nourishment Account for regional test projects."
