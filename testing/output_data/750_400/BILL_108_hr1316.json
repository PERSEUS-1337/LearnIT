    "content": "The Act titled \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research Act of 2003\" is cited as the short title. The findings section follows. The Congress finds that Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension research must be expanded to find a cure or effective treatment. Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare, chronic, and incurable lung disorder with a poor survival rate. The National Institutes of Health must be strengthened to address primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), a rare lung disorder with no known cause. Approximately 300 new cases of PPH are diagnosed in the United States each year, with the highest number in women aged 21 to 40. Men and women of all ages can be affected by PPH. PPH is a rare lung disorder with about 300 new cases diagnosed in the US annually, mostly in women aged 21 to 40. It can affect people of all ages and ethnicities. Research on PPH is challenging due to its low prevalence and the lack of a good animal model for the disease. PPH can affect individuals of all age groups and ethnic backgrounds. Research on PPH is hindered by its low prevalence and the absence of a suitable animal model for the disease. In advanced stages, patients with PPH may experience severe limitations in physical activity and symptoms even at rest, potentially leading to complete bedriddenness. In about 6 to 10 percent of cases, PPH is familial and can progress to the point of complete bedriddenness. PPH is difficult to diagnose early on and can be mistaken for other heart and lung conditions. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first PPH-patient registry in 1981. (7) PPH is a diagnosis of exclusion and can be mistaken for other heart and lung conditions. (8) The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute created the first PPH-patient registry in 1981, following 194 PPH patients for up to 7.5 years. Much of our knowledge about PPH comes from this study. (9) Research on PPH is focused on understanding the cause and finding a cure. Research studies are investigating immunologic and genetic factors in the cause and progression of PPH, as well as agents that narrow pulmonary blood vessels and factors that promote smooth muscle growth and scar tissue formation in vessel walls. The study followed 194 PPH patients for up to 7.5 years, contributing significantly to our understanding of the illness. During 1996-1997, around 6,000,000 Americans took anorexic drugs, potentially causing PPH. Many now suffer from PPH, with more cases expected in the future. During January 1996 to December 1997, nearly 6,000,000 Americans used anorexic drugs, leading to PPH in some cases. Many individuals now have PPH, with more diagnoses expected in the future. SPH is caused by known factors such as emphysema, bronchitis, and certain diseases like scleroderma or lupus. Secondary pulmonary hypertension (SPH) is caused by known factors such as emphysema, bronchitis, inflammatory diseases like scleroderma or lupus, congenital heart defects, chronic pulmonary thromboembolism, HIV infection, liver disease, and certain diet drugs. The Public Health Service Act is amended to expand research on pulmonary hypertension under the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The Public Health Service Act is amended to expand research on pulmonary hypertension under the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The Director of the Institute will intensify and coordinate research activities on pulmonary hypertension, collaborating with other national research institutes and agencies related to this condition. Additionally, Centers of Excellence will be established. The Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute will collaborate with other research institutes and agencies to expand research on pulmonary hypertension. Centers of Excellence will be established for research, training, and education on this condition. The Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute will establish Centers of Excellence for research on pulmonary hypertension, providing grants or contracts to public or nonprofit entities for research, training, and education on the condition. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute will establish Centers of Excellence for research on pulmonary hypertension. These centers will conduct research, training programs, and education on the cause, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the disease. The Centers of Excellence for research on pulmonary hypertension will focus on cause, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, training programs for scientists and health professionals, continuing education for health professionals, and dissemination of information to the public. Stipends may be provided for the training of health professionals. The Centers of Excellence focus on research, training programs, and education for health professionals. Stipends may be provided for their training. The Director will coordinate centers and provide reports as needed. The center may use funds to provide stipends for scientists and health professionals in training programs. The Director will coordinate information among centers, ensure regular communication, and require reports on center activities. The Director will coordinate information among centers, ensure regular communication, and require reports on center activities. Each center shall use the facilities of a single institution or a consortium of cooperating institutions. The Director will establish not less than three centers, each using the facilities of a single institution or consortium of cooperating institutions. Support for a center can last up to 5 years, with possible extensions for additional 5-year periods based on center operations. The Director will establish at least three centers, each supported for up to 5 years with possible extensions for another 5 years based on peer review. The Institute's Director will also create a data system for collecting and analyzing information. The Director will establish a data system and clearinghouse for pulmonary hypertension data collection and dissemination. The Director of the Institute will establish an information clearinghouse to disseminate knowledge about pulmonary hypertension to health professionals, patients, industry, and the public, including data on populations at risk. Public input will be solicited for input on these efforts. The Director of the Institute will provide information on pulmonary hypertension to various stakeholders and solicit public input on existing and planned programs. Biennial reports on activities will also be prepared. The Director of the Institute will prepare biennial reports on activities related to primary hypertension and seek public comments. Up to $25,000,000 may be appropriated annually for these purposes. The Director will prepare biennial reports on activities related to primary hypertension and seek public comments.
