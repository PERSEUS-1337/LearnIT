There is consensus in the scientific community that hands-on laboratory experience is essential for learning science. The National Research Council emphasizes the importance of hands-on laboratory experience in science education, stating that current quality is poor and there is a lack of agreement on defining high school science labs. The National Research Council found that the quality of high school science laboratories is poor, with disagreement among educators and researchers on their definition and purpose. Schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students are less likely to have adequate lab facilities. The Government Accountability Office reported that schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students are less likely to have adequate laboratory facilities. 49.1 percent of schools with a minority student population over 50.5 percent do not meet functional requirements for laboratory science well or at all. 40 percent of college students who left science fields cited problems with high school science preparation, including lack of laboratory experience and introduction to theoretical or analytical modes. The Federal Government should invest in research projects to improve teaching of laboratory science in high schools, as 40 percent of college students who left science fields cited problems with high school science preparation, including lack of laboratory experience and introduction to theoretical or analytical modes of thought. The grant program is established to improve teaching of laboratory science in high schools. Section 8(8) of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to redesignate and indent clauses, move language to the right, change \"paragraph\" to \"subparagraph\", and introduce a pilot program initiative. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to redesignate clauses, change language to \"subparagraph\", and introduce a pilot program initiative called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science'. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to establish a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to award grants for improving laboratories and enhancing STEM instruction at the secondary school level. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 establishes a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to award grants for enhancing STEM instruction at the secondary school level through the purchase, maintenance, and improvement of laboratory facilities and scientific educational materials. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 establishes a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to award grants for enhancing STEM instruction at the secondary school level through the purchase, maintenance, and improvement of laboratory facilities, equipment, instrumentation, scientific educational materials, professional development for teachers, and development of instructional programs integrating laboratory experience with classroom. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 establishes a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to award grants for enhancing STEM instruction at the secondary school level through professional development and training for teachers, development of instructional programs integrating laboratory experience with classroom instruction, training in laboratory safety for school personnel, and design and implementation of. The curr_chunk discusses training in laboratory safety for school personnel and hands-on laboratory experiences to encourage interest in STEM fields. The curr_chunk focuses on providing hands-on laboratory experiences to individuals identified in the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act to encourage interest in STEM fields and prepare them for postsecondary studies. The curr_chunk focuses on grants awarded to partnerships for hands-on laboratory experiences in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology to prepare individuals for postsecondary studies in these fields. Grants awarded under this program are for partnerships that include higher education institutions, high-need local educational agencies, and businesses or eligible nonprofit organizations. The program awards grants for partnerships involving higher education institutions, high-need local educational agencies, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. The Federal share of funding is also specified. The program awards grants for partnerships involving higher education institutions, local educational agencies, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. The Federal share of funding shall not exceed 50 percent. SEC. 3. REPORT. The Director of the National Science Foundation will assess the impact of pilot projects funded by the grant program on student performance in math, science, engineering, and technology. A report on the evaluation results will be submitted to specific Senate and House committees within 5 years of the Act's enactment, highlighting best practices. The evaluation report on the impact of pilot projects funded by the grant program will be submitted to specific Senate and House committees within 5 years of the Act's enactment, identifying best practices and materials developed by grant awardees. Authorization of appropriations for the National Science Foundation under this Act includes $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for the following 3 years."
