The Corps develops and maintains infrastructure like navigation channels, harbors, locks, and dams. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages the Inland Waterway System covering 38 states, handling half of all inland waterway freight. They develop, operate, and maintain infrastructure like navigation channels, harbors, locks, and dams. Costs for maintenance and construction are funded by the Corps and the commercial user industry through user fees. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages the Inland Waterway System, which covers 38 states and handles half of all inland waterway freight. They develop, operate, and maintain infrastructure like navigation channels, harbors, locks, and dams. Costs for maintenance and construction are funded by the Corps and the commercial user industry through user fees. Congress is considering proposals for future financing of inland waterway system investments. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages the Inland Waterway System, covering 38 states and handling half of all inland waterway freight. Costs for maintenance and construction are shared between the Corps and the commercial industry. Congress is considering proposals for future financing of inland waterway system investments, as the current revenue source is insufficient to cover nonfederal costs of major capital expenditures. The current revenue source for the Inland Waterway System, a fuel tax agreed upon in the mid-1980s, is inadequate to cover nonfederal costs of major capital expenditures. This has led to federal taxpayers covering over half of these costs in some years, limiting new construction projects. Recent proposals suggest transitioning from the fuel tax to lock usage fees to address these issues. The current financing system for inland waterway construction projects is limiting new and ongoing projects. Recent proposals suggest changes to the system, including increasing the fuel tax and federal share for costs. The use of inland waterways for commercial transport has a long history predating the nation's founding. The user industry proposed increasing the fuel tax and federal share for inland waterway costs, but Congress rejected the idea. Inland waterways have been used for commercial transport since before the nation's founding, with the federal government taking control of interstate commerce in the early 1800s. Inland waterways have been used for commercial transport since before the nation's founding. The federal government gained authority over interstate commerce in the early 1800s, leading to funding and support for waterways. While rail and highway transport have reduced reliance on waterways, they still play a significant role in the nation's transportation system for many goods. The federal government began funding and supporting waterways for commerce, although rail and highway improvements have reduced reliance on inland waterways. Inland waterways still account for 4%-5% of total commercial tonnage shipped annually and remain important for transporting bulk goods over long distances in certain regions. Inland waterway traffic on the federal IWS accounts for 4%-5% of total commercial tonnage shipped annually. Waterways are important for transporting bulk goods over long distances in certain regions, especially for specific commodities like grain, oilseed, coal, petroleum, chemicals, metals, cement, sand, and gravel. Inland waterways are crucial for transporting bulk goods over long distances, especially for commodities like grain, oilseed, coal, petroleum, chemicals, metals, cement, sand, and gravel. Despite projections of increased traffic, actual inland waterway traffic has remained relatively flat over the past 20 years in terms of tonnage and ton-miles. Actual traffic on inland waterways has remained somewhat flat over the last 20 years in terms of both tonnage and ton-miles, despite projections of increased traffic. Overall freight tonnage for all modes of domestic shipping has increased at an average annual rate of 1.2% from 1997 to 2007 and is expected to double over the next 25 years. Inland waterway traffic is projected to increase at a slower rate compared to rail and highway shipping. The Department of Transportation projects that overall freight tonnage will double over the next 25 years, with inland waterway traffic projected to increase at a rate significantly less than rail and highway shipping. Inland waterway tonnage primarily comes through the Mississippi and Ohio River System via bulk shipping on barges. The system of fuel-taxed inland and intracoastal waterways is displayed in Figure 1. The federal government invests in inland waterways, primarily through the Mississippi and Ohio River System, for the value they bring to the nation. This investment began in the early 1800s and includes funding for investigations, operations, maintenance, and construction costs through the U.S. Army Corps. The federal government invests in inland waterways for their value to the nation, with funding for investigations, operations, maintenance, and construction costs through the U.S. Army Corps. Legislation in the 1970s and 1980s changed the funding system, creating user cost-sharing requirements. The funding system for inland waterway projects was changed in the 1970s and 1980s through legislation, creating user cost-sharing requirements. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 established the current financing system for Corps inland waterway projects, shifting away from full federal funding. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 established a fuel tax on commercial barges and cost-share requirements for inland waterway projects, shifting financial responsibility to commercial operators. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 established a fuel tax on commercial barges, cost-share requirements for inland waterway projects, and a trust fund to hold revenues for construction investments, increasing financial responsibility for commercial operators. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 established a fuel tax on commercial barge traffic, creating the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF). The tax started at $0.04 per gallon in FY1980, gradually increasing to $0.10 per gallon in FY1986, and eventually reaching $0.20 per gallon in 1994. No appropriations were authorized from the IWTF until WRDA 1986. WRDA 1986 authorized additional increases to the fuel tax established in the Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978, with the tax set to rise to $0.20 per gallon by 1994. The act also outlined a cost-sharing process for inland waterway construction projects, with funding split 50/50 between the IWTF and other sources. WRDA 1986 authorized increases to the fuel tax from the Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978, with the tax set to reach $0.20 per gallon by 1994. It established a cost-sharing process for construction projects, with 50% funded by the IWTF and 50% by the Treasury's General Revenue fund. Expenditures from the IWTF for projects require authorization from Congress and annual discretionary appropriations. The IWTF is funded by a fuel tax increase authorized by WRDA 1986, with a cost-sharing process for construction projects. O&M costs remain a federal responsibility. Projects funded by the IWTF require authorization from Congress and annual appropriations. Additional projects have been authorized by subsequent Water Resources Development Acts. The IWTF, funded by a fuel tax increase authorized by WRDA 1986, requires authorization from Congress for projects funded by it. Subsequent Water Resources Development Acts have authorized additional projects, with appropriations made by Congress in annual bills. WRDA 1986 maintained 100% federal funding for inland waterway costs, excluding construction and major maintenance expenses. WRDA 1986 established the Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) and maintained 100% federal funding for inland waterway costs, excluding construction and major maintenance expenses. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) was established by WRDA 1986 as a federal advisory committee representing shipping interests on inland waterways. The board consists of 11 members and gives commercial users a voice in setting priorities. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) was established by WRDA 1986 as a federal advisory committee with 11 members representing shipping interests on inland waterways. The board meets three times a year to make recommendations to the Secretary of the Army and Congress on IWTF projects. The IWTF balance has varied between 1986 and 2011, reaching its highest level of $413 million in 2002. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) advises on federal decision-making for IWTF projects, meeting three times a year to make recommendations. The IWTF balance fluctuated between 1986 and 2011, peaking at $413 million in 2002. Executive branch proposals aimed to increase user fees and have IWTF fund operations and maintenance costs. The IWTF balance peaked at $413 million in 2002. The executive branch proposed increasing user fees and having the IWTF fund operations and maintenance costs, but these proposals were not enacted by Congress. From FY2005, appropriations from the IWTF increased significantly, exceeding annual fuel tax collections and interest on the IWTF balance. Beginning in FY2005, appropriations from the IWTF increased significantly as the Bush Administration requested and Congress appropriated greater investments in IWTF-funded projects. These increasing expenditures significantly exceeded annual fuel tax collections going into the IWTF and interest on the IWTF balance. Some projects exceeded their original cost estimates, causing balances to fall sharply from 2005 to 2010. Congress took \"stopgap\" measures to prevent the balance from falling to unsustainable levels. The IWTF balance fell sharply from 2005 to 2010 due to projects exceeding cost estimates. Congress implemented \"stopgap\" measures to prevent unsustainable levels, such as exempting major projects from cost-sharing requirements and limiting access to the IWTF in appropriations. Congress has implemented various \"stopgap\" measures in previous years to address the declining IWTF balance. These measures included exempting major rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements, limiting access to the IWTF in appropriations, providing over $400 million in construction funding under ARRA, and prohibiting the Corps from entering into new projects. Congress has implemented measures to address the declining IWTF balance, including exempting major projects from cost-sharing, limiting access to the fund in appropriations, and providing over $400 million in construction funding under ARRA. Recent actions have prohibited new contracts requiring IWTF funding since FY2009, stabilizing the trust fund balance. The Corps has been prohibited from entering into new contracts requiring IWTF funding since FY2009, limiting appropriations to expected fuel tax revenues. The trust fund balance has stabilized, but funding for new projects is expected to be extremely limited, with most going to the Olmsted Locks and Dam project on the Ohio River. This could increase the project backlog for Corps inland waterways projects. Long-term options to address this situation are being discussed. Funding for new projects is expected to be limited, with most going to the Olmsted Locks and Dam project on the Ohio River. This could increase the project backlog for Corps inland waterways projects. Long-term options to address this situation are being discussed. Other concerns include complaints about structural inefficiencies and inequities in the Corps project planning process for inland waterways. Inland Waterway Financing Proposals address problems with the IWTF financing system and concerns about structural inefficiencies in the Corps project planning process. Complaints from fuel tax payers have led to reforms in FY2006 to improve project implementation and use of tax dollars. Many users criticize past decisions in the Corps project planning process for inland waterways investments, citing inefficiencies like cost escalation and schedule delays. In response, the Corps implemented reforms in FY2006, including risk-based cost estimates and prioritized funding for high-risk projects. While some improvements were recognized, there are calls for additional structural reforms in the planning process. In FY2006, the Corps implemented reforms to its project delivery process, including risk-based cost estimates and prioritized funding for high-risk projects. Some advocate for further structural reforms, citing cost overruns and planning issues at the Olmsted Locks and Dam project as evidence of ongoing needs for reform. The Olmsted Locks and Dam project has experienced significant cost overruns and planning issues, with the estimated cost increasing from $775 million to $2.9 billion. By January 1, 2013, the project was 49% complete, with the lock components finished. This highlights the ongoing need for reform in planning and oversight of the Inland Waterways Transportation Fund. The Olmsted Locks and Dam project's cost increased from $775 million to $2.9 billion in 2013. The project was 49% complete by January 1, 2013, with lock components finished. Dam and demolition components are expected to be completed in 2020 and 2024. Concerns about the solvency of the IWTF and financing system have led to reform proposals since 2008. The Olmsted Locks and Dam project's cost increased to $2.9 billion in 2013, with 49% completion by January 1, 2013. The dam and demolition components are expected to be finished in 2020 and 2024. Concerns about the IWTF's solvency and financing system have led to reform proposals since 2008, including recent recommendations by the Bush and Obama Administrations. The IWUB has also proposed its own revenue-raising plan, differing from the Administration's proposal. The Obama Administration presented a new recommendation to raise revenues for the IWTF, differing from the user industry's proposal to increase fuel tax and federal share for inland waterway investments. Past administrations have also submitted proposals to increase commercial user fees on inland waterways. The user proposal suggests increasing the fuel tax and requiring a higher federal share for inland waterway investments. Past administrations, like Bush and Obama, have proposed raising commercial user fees on inland waterways. The Bush Administration proposed a lock usage fee in 2008 to address concerns about IWTF shortfall. The Bush Administration proposed a lock usage fee in 2008 to address concerns about a potential IWTF shortfall. The fee would have phased in charges for commercial barges based on lock chamber size and tied IWTF balances to user fees after 2012. The Bush Administration proposed lock usage fees in 2008 based on barge size for lock chambers, with fees ranging from $50-$80 for chambers over 600 feet and $30-$48 for chambers under 600 feet. They also suggested linking IWTF balances to user fees post-2012. The House and Senate appropriations committees rejected this proposal, citing concerns about equity in waterborne commerce investments. The Bush Administration proposed lock usage fees in 2008 based on barge size for lock chambers, with fees ranging from $50-$80 for chambers over 600 feet and $30-$48 for chambers under 600 feet. The House and Senate appropriations committees rejected this approach, citing concerns about equity in waterborne commerce investments. Congress provided temporary relief through stopgap measures and requested the executive branch to revisit its approach. The Obama Administration's budget requests to Congress have each proposed changes. The Bush Administration proposed lock usage fees in 2008, but Congress rejected the idea due to concerns about equity in waterborne commerce investments. The Obama Administration's budget requests have each included proposals for new user fees for inland waterways, aiming to increase efficiency by reducing traffic at high-traffic locks. The FY2010 budget proposed new user fees for inland waterways, including the option to increase fees at high-traffic locks to improve efficiency and revenues. Congress rejected the proposal, but subsequent Obama Administration budgets continued to suggest user fees to supplement fuel tax revenues. The Obama Administration proposed user fees to supplement fuel tax revenues for inland waterways in FY2010. Congress rejected the proposal but subsequent budgets continued to suggest user fees. Congress generally rejected user fee proposals but agreed to limit revenues instead of finding a long-term financing solution for inland waterways. Recent budgets assumed around $80 million in new revenues without specifying the source. The Obama Administration proposed user fees to supplement fuel tax revenues for inland waterways, but Congress rejected the proposal. Subsequent budgets suggested user fees, but Congress agreed to limit revenues instead of finding a long-term financing solution. Recent budgets assumed around $80 million in new revenues without specifying the source. The 2011 Obama Administration plan for deficit reduction also included a new inland waterway financing structure recommendation to Congress. The 2011 Obama Administration proposed a new inland waterway financing structure, including a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers set by the Corps to achieve a revenue target. The Obama Administration proposed a new inland waterway financing structure to Congress, which included a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers set by the Corps to achieve a revenue target. The proposed legislation did not specify the fee amount but outlined revenue targets to be met. The Obama Administration proposed a new annual fee for inland waterway shippers, with vessels using locks paying a higher fee. The proposed legislation did not specify the fee amount but aimed to generate approximately $1 billion in additional revenues for the IWTF over 10 years. The balance of IWTF receipts available for appropriation would increase, but the cost share between the General Revenue Fund and IWTF would remain unchanged. The Obama Administration proposed a new annual fee for inland waterway shippers to generate approximately $1 billion in additional revenues for the IWTF over 10 years. The proposal included adding 39 new segments to the inland waterway system, but these are not expected to bring in significant new revenues. The Obama Administration proposed a new annual fee for inland waterway shippers to generate additional revenues for the IWTF. The proposal included adding 39 new segments to the inland waterway system, but these are not expected to bring in significant new revenues. The fee was opposed by the user industry and was not enacted. In 2010, the Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) proposed its own plan for the Inland Marine Transportation Systems Capital Investment Strategy Team. The IWUB proposed a plan for the Inland Marine Transportation Systems Capital Investment Strategy Team in 2010, which has been introduced as legislation in Congress. The IWUB report, representing the preferred alternative of the inland waterway user industry, was introduced as legislation in Congress but not formally endorsed by the Corps or the Administration. Many of its recommendations have been opposed by the Obama Administration. The IWUB report recommended increasing user fees for inland waterways, including raising the existing fuel tax by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon. These recommendations have not been formally endorsed by the Corps or the Administration and have faced opposition from the Obama Administration. The IWUB report recommends increasing user fees for inland waterways, including raising the existing fuel tax by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon. Other proposed changes include modifying cost-share requirements and increasing overall spending on inland waterways. The IWUB report recommends increasing user fees for inland waterways, including raising the fuel tax rate. It also suggests modifying cost-share requirements, increasing overall spending on inland waterways, and enhancing IWUB involvement in project planning and construction. Other recommendations include adopting prioritization criteria through regulations. The IWUB report recommends increasing user fees for inland waterways, including raising the fuel tax rate by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon. This increase would generate approximately $112 million per year in fuel tax revenues. Other recommendations include enhancing IWUB involvement in project planning and construction, and adopting prioritization criteria through regulations. The IWUB report suggests raising the inland waterway fuel tax rate by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon, potentially generating $112 million annually. Most of the new revenue would be saved for future use to replenish balances. The IWUB report proposes increasing the inland waterway fuel tax rate by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon, aiming to generate $112 million annually. Most of the new revenue would be saved for future use to replenish balances. The proposed tax increase would not be indexed for inflation or include a capital recovery mechanism. Additionally, the report suggests shifting more of the cost for inland waterway projects to the federal government. The IWUB report proposes increasing the fuel tax for inland waterways without indexing for inflation or including a capital recovery mechanism. It suggests shifting more project costs to the federal government and exempting certain expenses from cost-sharing requirements. Additionally, the report recommends establishing a cap on the use of IWTF funds. The IWUB report recommends exempting dam-related expenses and rehabilitation projects on locks under $100 million from cost-sharing requirements. It also suggests establishing a cap on IWTF funds to discourage construction cost overruns, affecting the overall cost-share for IWTF projects. The IWUB report proposes exempting dam-related expenses and locks under $100 million from cost-sharing requirements. It also suggests capping IWTF funds to deter construction cost overruns, which would impact the overall cost-share for IWTF projects, increasing the federal share for certain projects to approximately 70% over the next 25 years. The IWUB report proposes increasing federal share for certain projects to approximately 70% over the next 25 years, with an overall increase in funding for inland waterways. Full funding for these investments would require annual expenditures averaging $380 million from the IWTF and General Revenue fund. The IWUB report proposes an overall increase in funding for inland waterways, with full funding requiring annual expenditures averaging $380 million from the IWTF and General Revenue fund, a significant increase over historical averages. The IWUB report proposes a significant increase in funding for inland waterways, with annual expenditures averaging $380 million. The majority of this increase would come from the General Revenue fund to meet the proposed portfolio's requirements. Federal funding of $1.33 billion over five years would be needed to fulfill the IWUB proposal. The IWUB report proposes a $380 million annual funding increase for inland waterways, with federal funding of $1.33 billion over five years. Initially, most funding would come from the GR fund, gradually shifting to the trust fund by 2020. Federal government would still need to provide over 50% of required investments. The report proposes a $380 million annual funding increase for inland waterways, with federal funding of $1.33 billion over five years. By 2020, the proportion of funds from the trust fund would gradually increase, but federal requirements would still exceed 50% of the investments needed. More new funding would be required from the federal government than the IWTF. The report also suggests reforms to improve cost-effectiveness of IWTF projects overseen by the Corps. The report recommends reforms to increase the involvement of the IWUB in overseeing IWTF investments, including appointing representatives to project design teams and obtaining sign-off on project plans funded by the IWTF. The report suggests enhancing IWUB's role in overseeing IWTF investments by appointing representatives to project design teams and obtaining sign-off on project plans funded by the IWTF, to address concerns about conflicts of interest. The IWUB seeks changes in overseeing projects funded by the IWTF, including appointing representatives to project design teams and obtaining sign-off on project plans. Concerns about conflicts of interest and federal control of the planning process are raised due to the involvement of nonfederal entities. Specific projects have been prioritized for funding based on factors like asset condition and likelihood of success. The IWUB report prioritized specific projects for funding based on factors like asset condition and system performance improvement. The report did not mandate funding for these projects, leaving the final decision to Congress during annual appropriations. The IWUB report prioritized projects based on asset condition, performance improvement, and likelihood of success. Final funding decisions would still be made by Congress or the Corps. The proposal recommends that the Corps establish selection criteria for inland waterway projects similar to those used in the IWUB report. Some groups have suggested shifting costs away from the federal government and increasing user-financed share of inland waterway costs. Some advocate for shifting costs from the federal government to increase user-financed share of inland waterway costs due to inequalities in spending. A 1990s analysis by the Congressional Budget Office found the current tax system fails to cover operational costs, leading to distorted maintenance costs. The Congressional Budget Office found that the current tax system for inland waterways does not cover operational costs, leading to distorted maintenance costs. A user fee structure that recovers true costs would increase economic efficiency, especially for waterways with low traffic-to-expense ratios. The CBO found that the current tax system for inland waterways does not cover operational costs, leading to distorted maintenance costs. A user fee structure that recovers true costs would increase economic efficiency, especially for waterways with low traffic-to-expense ratios. Several entities have proposed significant increases to inland waterway fees to achieve savings for the federal government. Several entities have proposed significant increases to inland waterway fees to achieve savings for the federal government. A coalition of taxpayer watchdog and environmental organizations recommended increasing user contributions for inland waterway expenditures, estimating savings of $1 billion over the next five years. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform also included a proposal to make changes to the inland waterways. Several organizations have proposed increasing user fees for inland waterways to save money for the government. The \"Green Scissors\" report suggested raising contributions, estimating $1 billion in savings over five years. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform recommended making inland waterways self-funding, with projected savings of $500 million over five years. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) also proposed raising user fees to cover construction, operations, and maintenance costs. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) proposed increasing user fees on inland waterways to cover costs and save money. The proposal aims to make the waterways \"self-funding\" and could result in savings of $500 million over five years and $4 billion over a 10-year horizon. Specific recommendations on the fee structure are yet to be provided. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) proposed increasing user fees on inland waterways to save approximately $4 billion over a 10-year horizon. Specific recommendations on the fee structure, such as annual licensing fees, congestion pricing, tolls, and lockage fees, have not been provided yet. The 1992 CBO report suggested new user fees for inland waterways, including annual licensing fees, congestion pricing, tolls, and lockage fees. These proposals aim to address issues with the current financing system and require Congress to consider the level of new investment needed. The proposals discussed aim to address issues with the current financing system for inland waterways by suggesting new investment levels and revenue sources. Congress must decide on the level of new investment, potential changes to the fuel tax, and cost-share arrangements for projects. Changes to inland waterways financing were made in the 113th Congress. The 113th Congress made changes to inland waterways financing through the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014. It authorized project delivery recommendations and shifted responsibility for rehabilitation costs under $20 million to the federal government. Discussions continue on new investment levels, fuel tax changes, and cost-share arrangements for projects. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 in the 113th Congress made changes to inland waterways financing. It authorized project delivery recommendations, shifted responsibility for rehabilitation costs under $20 million to the federal government, and reduced the cost-sharing requirement for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 in the 113th Congress made changes to inland waterways financing, including shifting responsibility for rehabilitation costs under $20 million to the federal government and reducing the cost-sharing requirement for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project. It also authorized efforts to provide more information about inland waterways policy options. The bill authorized efforts to provide more information about inland waterways policy options, including studies on revenue collection efficiency, financing options, and stakeholder evaluations. The House and Senate have also made changes related to inland waterways in recent appropriations bills, such as funding the Olmsted Project under a new cost-sharing requirement. The House and Senate have made changes related to inland waterways in recent appropriations bills, including funding the Olmsted Project under a new cost-sharing requirement of 15% from the IWTF. This reduced cost-sharing allowed for significant funding for other inland waterways construction projects at the traditional 50/50 cost-share level for the first time in five years. The changes enacted in WRRDA are seen as insufficient to finance all needed projects. The reduced cost-sharing requirement of 15% from the IWTF for the Olmsted Project allowed significant funding for other inland waterways construction projects at the traditional 50/50 cost-share level for the first time in five years. However, observers believe that the changes in WRRDA may not be enough to finance all necessary waterway upgrades in the long-term. Some support additional user proposals to ensure the long-term solvency of the IWTF. Stand-alone legislation like H.R. 1149 has been proposed in the 113th Congress to address these issues. Some support additional user proposals like H.R. 1149 to address long-term solvency of the IWTF, including a $0.06 per gallon fuel tax increase. The WAVE4 Act and RIVER Act propose increases to the fuel tax to fund infrastructure projects, with the federal government taking on more responsibility for dam construction and rehabilitation costs. The RIVER Act, similar to the WAVE4 Act, proposes a $0.09 per gallon fuel tax increase to fund infrastructure projects. It would authorize the federal government to cover 100% of dam construction and rehabilitation costs under $50 million. Congress faces issues regarding infrastructure investments on federal waterways. Under the RIVER Act, the federal government would fund 100% of dam construction and rehabilitation costs under $50 million. Congress is considering various proposals for infrastructure investments on federal waterways, with commercial users advocating for increased investment due to aging infrastructure and the benefits of inland waterway shipping. Commercial users argue for increased federal investment in inland waterways due to aging infrastructure, expanded capacity needs, and positive environmental benefits compared to other shipping methods. This is opposed by taxpayer and environmental groups who believe the benefits are overstated and oppose increased funding. Despite disagreements, most agree that current financing for inland waterways is insufficient for future needs. The Corps is expected to have appropriations for just one ongoing lock due to recent funding drawdown. Investments for inland waterway projects are not deemed necessary by some, but most agree that the current financing system is inadequate for future needs. The Corps is projected to only have funding for one lock replacement project (Olmstead Lock on the Ohio River) until at least FY2016, leading to potential delays in new construction projects without additional revenue or federal appropriations. The Corps of Engineers is expected to have appropriations for only one ongoing lock replacement project (Olmstead Lock on the Ohio River) through at least FY2016 under its current baseline for IWTF revenues. Without new revenue or federal appropriations, new or ongoing IWTF construction projects may be delayed, as the majority of locks in the United States are past their intended design age of 50 years. The aging infrastructure of Corps inland waterway facilities, with most locks in the United States past their intended design age of 50 years, has led to a decline in efficiency. The overall lock unavailability has increased, prompting debates between favoring new lock construction for expanded capacity and ongoing maintenance. The aging infrastructure of Corps inland waterway facilities has led to a decline in efficiency, with increased lock unavailability. Debates arise between favoring new lock construction for expanded capacity and ongoing maintenance. Some argue against significant new investments, noting that regular maintenance can extend the life of existing locks at a lesser cost than new construction. Environmental groups argue against significant new investments for inland waterway projects, stating that regular maintenance can extend the life of existing locks at a lesser cost than new construction. They believe that the costs of new lock construction outweigh the benefits and advocate for small-scale and nonstructural improvements to overcome infrastructure issues. Environmental groups argue against significant new investments for inland waterway projects, stating that regular maintenance can extend the life of existing locks at a lesser cost than new construction. They believe that the costs of new lock construction greatly exceed the benefits and advocate for small-scale and nonstructural improvements to overcome infrastructure issues. The Corps has noted that new navigation alternatives depend greatly on difficult-to-predict traffic forecasts from future trade scenarios. These forecasts rely on various variables such as commodity prices and the price sensitivity of shippers. The Corps relies on traffic forecasts from future trade scenarios, which are difficult to predict due to various variables like commodity prices and shipper price sensitivity. Total domestic freight traffic is expected to increase by 70% by 2020, with the majority of the increase projected to be on inland waterways. The Corps has noted that total domestic freight traffic is expected to increase by approximately 70% by 2020. The Department of Transportation projects that the majority of this increase will be on freight rail and highway traffic, with waterway traffic projected to increase by 2% per year between 2010 and 2035. Shipping interests suggest that an increase in the efficiency of inland waterways could reduce pressure on highway and rail shipments. Future lock upgrades or new construction on inland waterways could increase demand, but the impact would depend on various external factors. Some groups oppose new lock construction based on traffic demands. Future lock upgrades or new construction on inland waterways could increase demand, but the impact would depend on various external factors. Some groups oppose new lock construction based on traffic projections, noting flat or decreasing traffic at some locks. Critics have also questioned the Corps' optimistic traffic projections. Critics question Corps' optimistic traffic projections for new lock construction on inland waterways, arguing for increased investment based on the overall value of barge shipping. Shipping interests advocate for increased investment in inland waterways, citing studies that show barge shipping is more efficient and environmentally friendly than other modes of transportation. Industry research indicates that railroads are 28.3% less fuel-efficient than inland waterways. Barge shipping is considered more efficient and environmentally friendly than other forms of transportation, with studies showing that railroads are 28.3% less fuel-efficient than inland waterways. Inland waterways also emit fewer greenhouse gases and offer benefits like reduced highway congestion and noise. However, taxpayer and environmental groups question the environmental benefits used to justify new investments in barge shipping. Taxpayer and environmental groups have raised concerns about the environmental benefits of barge shipping, questioning industry fuel-efficiency calculations and the use of conversion factors to account for technical factors like river flow constraints. Environmental groups have criticized industry fuel-efficiency calculations for not considering technical factors like circuity in river flow, advocating for the use of conversion factors for a more accurate comparison of fuel efficiency between barge and rail shipping. They also highlight the negative impact of inland waterway projects on riparian habitat and species. Environmental groups criticize industry fuel-efficiency calculations for not considering technical factors like circuity in river flow. They advocate for using fuel efficiency for \"unit grain trains\" for a more accurate comparison between barge and rail shipping. Inland waterway projects can negatively impact riparian habitat and species through structural changes like locks, dams, and levees. Waterway traffic may also cause bank erosion. Increased construction and expansion of inland waterways, including locks, dams, and levees, can have negative environmental effects such as sedimentation, turbidity, and bank erosion. Congress is considering changes to the system that finances these investments, including options for additional revenue like the IWUB's proposal to increase the fuel tax. The Congress is considering changes to the system that finances the increased construction and expansion of inland waterways, including options for additional revenue such as an increase to the fuel tax proposed by IWUB, new annual fees suggested by the White House, or other options like a lock usage fee or toll system. IWUB's proposal includes an increase to the fuel tax, which would generate additional revenue and fund new investments. Some argue that this would rebuild the trust fund balance, while others are concerned about the associated increases to federal cost share responsibilities. The IWUB proposes an increase in the fuel tax to generate more revenue and fund new investments. Some support this to rebuild the trust fund balance, while others are concerned about the associated increases in federal cost share responsibilities. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees in 2011 to address inadequate revenues from commercial users on the inland waterway system. Lock users would pay higher fees in addition to fuel taxes, while non-lock users would pay new fees. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees in 2011 for commercial users on the inland waterway system. The new system includes fuel taxes and additional fees for non-lock users, with lock users facing even higher fees. The Administration aims to add new waterway segments to the fuel-taxed list to increase revenues, arguing that commercial shippers, as primary beneficiaries, should cover costs for capital investments. The Administration proposes adding new waterway segments to the fuel-taxed list on the inland waterway system to increase revenues. They argue that commercial shippers, as primary beneficiaries, should continue to pay for new capital investments. The IWUB and Congress have opposed this proposal, stating that targeting users of individual segments goes against the idea of the inland waterways as a whole interconnected system. The IWUB and Congress oppose the Administration's proposal to add new waterway segments to the fuel-taxed list, arguing that it unfairly burdens users and goes against the interconnected nature of the inland waterways system. Users are concerned about major fee increases and the delegation of fee-setting authority to the Secretary of the Army. The user industry opposes the proposed new fee for waterways, arguing against fee increases and delegation of fee-setting authority to the Secretary of the Army. Congress has considered alternative revenue-raising methods, such as lock usage fees and annual licensing fees. Congress has considered various alternative revenue-raising methods for inland waterways, including lock usage fees, annual licensing fees, tolls, ton-mile charges, and lock charges for congested areas. These options could potentially supplement or replace the current fuel tax. Potential revenue-raising methods for inland waterways include annual licensing fees, tolls, ton-mile charges, and lock charges. A concept called \"capital recovery\" was proposed in 1978 but not enacted, where user fees would adjust to recover government investments. User fees could increase when the IWTF balance is low. The 1978 proposal for \"capital recovery\" suggested user fees adjusting to recover government investments in inland waterways. This concept could prevent future trust fund shortfalls and prioritize essential projects. The Obama Administration's proposal also includes elements of this idea. User fees tied to trust fund balances after FY2022 could prevent future shortfalls and prioritize essential projects. Critics argue that planning for constantly changing taxes is difficult and could lead to cost increases for a shrinking user base. The Obama Administration proposes tying user fees to trust fund balances after FY2022. Critics argue against capital recovery, citing difficulties in planning for changing taxes and potential cost increases for a shrinking user base. Congress could explore additional ways to ensure revenue stream reliability, such as automatic inflation adjustments in fuel taxes or new lockage fees to increase future revenues and purchasing power. Congress could consider implementing an automatic inflation adjustment for inland waterways fuel taxes or lockage fees to increase revenue stream reliability and purchasing power of IWTF funds. Some argue against this adjustment, claiming it could lead to hidden tax increases in the future. If a long-term solution is not enacted for the IWTF revenue shortfall, Congress may need to take measures to ensure solvency. If no long-term solution is enacted to address the IWTF revenue shortfall, Congress may be forced to take measures to ensure the trust fund's solvency, such as capping withdrawals or putting a hold on new contracts. This could curtail investments in the inland waterway system. Congress may need to take measures to ensure the solvency of the trust fund, such as capping withdrawals or putting a hold on new contracts, which could impact investments in the inland waterway system. There is also a question before Congress about exempting some IWTF investments from cost-sharing requirements, which would have additional costs to taxpayers. Congress may consider exempting some IWTF investments from cost-sharing requirements, similar to the exemption provided in FY2009 appropriations. This exemption would incur additional costs to taxpayers from the General Revenue account. There is a question before Congress about the balance of the current cost-share arrangement for inland waterway projects established by WRDA 1986. The current cost-share arrangement for inland waterway projects established by WRDA 1986 is being questioned by Congress. WRDA 1992 defined \"major rehabilitation\" as upgrades requiring over $8 million in funding. The IWUB proposal aims to modify existing cost-sharing arrangements. The IWUB proposal aims to change cost-sharing arrangements for inland waterway projects, excluding dams and minor rehabilitation from cost-share requirements and shifting funding to 100% federal funding. This is because significant segments of the U.S. population benefit from dams. The IWUB proposes to shift funding for dams and minor rehabilitation projects to 100% federal funding, arguing that these structures benefit a significant portion of the U.S. population. They also suggest a new threshold of $100 million for major lock rehabilitation projects, replacing the previous $8 million threshold established in WRDA 1992. The IWUB proposes a new threshold of $100 million for major lock rehabilitation projects, increasing federally funded maintenance and rehabilitation projects. Cost overruns for IWTF construction projects would become a 100% federal responsibility, providing project managers with added incentive to stay within budget. The IWUB proposes a threshold of $100 million for major lock rehabilitation projects, shifting costs towards the federal government. Cost overruns for IWTF construction projects would be 100% federally funded, potentially adding hidden costs not reflected in estimates. The IWUB's proposed changes would shift costs for inland waterway projects towards the federal government, with a new cost-share arrangement of approximately 68% federal and 32% non-federal. Critics argue that this represents an additional hidden cost to the federal government not reflected in estimates. CRS calculates that the cost-share arrangement for IWTF construction projects would shift from 50/50 to 68% federal, 32% non-federal. While some support the shift to distribute the cost burden, critics argue that the IWTF already receives significant federal funding with no cost-sharing requirements. Groups note that the IWTF already benefits from significant federal support, with federal costs for inland waterways potentially rising to over 90% of total costs under the proposal. Currently, the federal government covers about 80%-85% of these costs annually. Under the proposal, federal costs for inland waterways could increase to over 90% of total costs, compared to the current 80%-85% covered annually. The Obama Administration's proposals suggest changes to user fees but maintain the federal-nonfederal cost-share. New revenues from users would be required, with appropriations from the IWTF needing to be supplemented by funds from the General Revenue fund. The Obama Administration's proposals recommend changes to user fees for inland waterways, but maintain the 50/50 cost-share between federal and nonfederal expenditures. Some groups argue for shifting cost shares away from the federal government and increasing user responsibility for construction, operations, and maintenance. Some groups advocate for shifting cost shares away from the federal government and increasing user responsibility for construction, operations, and maintenance of inland waterways. They propose that waterway users should pay for not only 50% of construction and major rehabilitation costs but also for some or all operations and maintenance costs, currently funded by general treasury revenues. Congress has previously rejected these proposals. Some groups, including environmental and taxpayer interest groups, argue that waterway users should pay for 50% of construction and major rehabilitation costs, as well as some or all operations and maintenance costs. Congress has previously rejected these proposals, but they may be reconsidered in government cost-cutting efforts. The IWUB has also requested Congress to reform Corps IWTF planning processes to increase involvement and improve project prioritization. Industry users support these reforms. The IWUB has proposed reforms to increase its involvement and improve project prioritization for Corps IWTF projects. Industry users believe these reforms will reduce cost overruns, which have been a problem in the past due to inaccurate construction schedules and costs, general cost escalation, and non-optimal funding. Industry users argue that proposed reforms by the IWUB aim to decrease cost overruns in IWTF projects, which have been attributed to inaccurate construction schedules and costs, general cost escalation, and non-optimal funding. Concerns about conflicts of interest may arise due to the degree of involvement by non-federal entities in the planning process. Congressional attention may also focus on the Corps' prioritization method for inland waterway projects. The IWUB proposes reforms to decrease cost overruns in IWTF projects, attributed to inaccurate schedules, cost escalation, and non-optimal funding. Concerns about conflicts of interest may arise from non-federal entity involvement in planning. Congressional attention may focus on the Corps' prioritization method for inland waterway projects. The IWUB proposes a priority ranking system for investments competing for IWTF funds, aiming to change the current practice of decision-making by the Corps, Administration, and Congress. The system recommended in the IWUB report may be established as a regulation, potentially altering Congress's role in project selection and funding. The IWUB report proposes a priority ranking system for investments, potentially changing Congress's role in project selection and funding if established as a regulation. The IWUB report suggests a prioritization system for Corps inland waterway projects, which could shift Congress's role to providing authorizations and funding levels, similar to other agency programs like the EPA's state revolving fund programs."
