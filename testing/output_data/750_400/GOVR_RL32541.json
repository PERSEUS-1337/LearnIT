    "content": "The 9/11 Commission found that al Qaeda terrorists exploited weaknesses in aviation security, including a focus on potential bombers, lax checkpoint screening, lack of in-flight security measures, compliance with hijackers, and a lack of protocols for the Federal Aviation Administration. The 9/11 Commission identified weaknesses in aviation security, including lax checkpoint screening, lack of in-flight security measures, compliance with hijackers, and a failure of imagination among senior policymakers and agencies responsible for intelligence, national defense, and aviation security. The 9/11 Commission found a failure of imagination among senior policymakers and agencies in response to hijackings and suicidal hijackers. Aviation security experts were slow to consider suicide hijackings despite concerns about hijackings. The 9/11 Commission found a failure of imagination among senior policymakers and agencies in response to hijackings and suicidal hijackers. Aviation security experts were slow to consider suicide hijackings despite concerns about hijackings. Congressional oversight of aviation security was lacking before September 11, 2001. The 9/11 Commission found a failure of imagination among senior policymakers and agencies in response to hijackings and suicidal hijackers. Despite concerns about hijackings, aviation security experts underestimated the likelihood of a suicide hijacking scenario. Congressional oversight of aviation security was lacking before September 11, 2001, with a focus on airport congestion and passenger service rather than addressing potential threats. Before September 11, 2001, Congress focused on airport congestion and passenger service rather than terrorism in aviation oversight. After 9/11, Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act to address security weaknesses exploited by the hijackers. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) to address security vulnerabilities in transportation systems. ATSA established the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to oversee security in all modes of transportation, including airports. Key provisions included the creation of a federal security screener workforce and the requirement for explosive detection screening. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) established the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to oversee security in all modes of transportation. Key provisions included federal security screeners at airports, explosive detection screening for checked bags, air marshals on high-risk flights, and hardened cockpit doors. ATSA granted TSA broad authority to assess and address security threats in all transportation modes. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) mandated explosive detection screening for checked bags, air marshals on high-risk flights, and hardened cockpit doors. It granted TSA broad authority to assess and address security threats in all transportation modes. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and placed TSA within it. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and placed the TSA within it. The act also authorized arming airline pilots for aircraft protection. Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act included additional aviation security measures, such as an aviation security capital fund for explosive detection systems. Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act established an aviation security capital fund for explosive detection systems and expanded the program to arm pilots of all-cargo aircraft. Despite this, oversight has identified areas of concern in aviation security. The aviation security capital fund was established to improve baggage screening efficiency and arm pilots of all-cargo aircraft. However, vulnerabilities in air cargo operations, general aviation, access controls for airport employees, screener performance, and potential terrorist attacks using shoulder-fired missiles still persist. The 9/11 Commission also highlighted these vulnerabilities. Aviation security vulnerabilities persist in air cargo operations, general aviation, access controls for airport employees, screener performance, and potential terrorist attacks using shoulder-fired missiles. The 9/11 Commission identified these vulnerabilities and recommended improvements in airport passenger and baggage screening, as well as air cargo security. Major vulnerabilities exist in cargo and general aviation security, along with inadequate screening and access controls, posing ongoing aviation security challenges. The 9/11 Commission made specific recommendations for airport passenger and baggage screening, and air cargo security, but did not address risks related to access controls in airports and general aviation operations. Concerns over possible shoulder-fired missile attacks against commercial airliners were acknowledged but not specifically addressed by the Commission. The 9/11 Commission did not issue recommendations for inadequate access controls in airports and general aviation operations, nor did it make specific recommendations regarding shoulder-fired missile attacks against commercial airliners. The Commission emphasized the need for a multi-layered security system to be implemented by the TSA. The 9/11 Commission emphasized the need for a multi-layered security system in aviation to address various terrorist tactics, ensuring each layer is effective and coordinated to create redundancies. The 9/11 Commission emphasized the importance of a multi-layered security system in aviation to address terrorist tactics effectively and create redundancies. This aligns with aviation security mandates and the concept of \"concentric rings of security\" by TSA. The Commission focused on persisting vulnerabilities in commercial aviation post-9/11 attacks. The 9/11 Commission's aviation security recommendations focused on enhancing passenger pre-screening, improving explosives detection on passengers, addressing human factors at screening checkpoints, expediting baggage screening system deployment. The 9/11 Commission's final report included six aviation-specific recommendations, such as enhancing passenger pre-screening, improving explosives detection, addressing human factors at screening checkpoints, expediting baggage screening system deployment, intensifying efforts on cargo security, and deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft. Additionally, an overarching recommendation was made for transportation security policy to prioritize based on risk. The 9/11 Commission issued six aviation-specific recommendations, including enhancing passenger pre-screening, improving explosives detection, addressing human factors at screening checkpoints, expediting baggage screening system deployment, intensifying cargo security efforts, and deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft. Additionally, a recommendation was made for transportation security policy to prioritize based on risk and implement cost-effective deterrents. On September 11, 2001, passenger pre-screening measures included CAPPS, security questions, and photo ID presentation. Over half of the hijackers were identified through these techniques, but there were minimal consequences at the time. More than half of the September 11, 2001 hijackers were identified through security questions and photo ID presentation. Pre-screening measures like CAPPS were initially used to detect potential bombers but now also screen for possible hijackers. Pre-screening measures like CAPPS were initially used to detect potential bombers but now also screen for possible hijackers. CAPPS, maintained by airlines, uses algorithms to identify \"selectees\" based on behaviors matching hijacker and bomber profiles. CAPPS II, a follow-on system, has faced controversy over data protection and civil liberties concerns. CAPPS, maintained by airlines, uses computer algorithms to identify \"selectees\" based on behaviors matching hijacker and bomber profiles. CAPPS II, a follow-on system, would authenticate a passenger's identity using commercial databases and check their name against terrorist watch lists. If flagged, passengers could be denied boarding or selected for secondary screening. The 9/11 Commission recommended improved passenger screening measures. CAPPS II would implement a two-step process to authenticate a passenger's identity using commercial databases and check their name against terrorist watch lists. If flagged, passengers could be denied boarding or selected for secondary screening. The 9/11 Commission recommended improved passenger pre-screening capabilities utilizing federal government watchlists. The 9/11 Commission recommended improved passenger pre-screening capabilities utilizing federal government watchlists, with limited implementation of CAPPS II until concerns are addressed by the Government Accountability Office. The 9/11 Commission recommended enhanced passenger pre-screening using federal watchlists, with CAPPS II implementation limited until concerns are addressed by the Government Accountability Office. However, GAO found only one concern adequately addressed by TSA in February 2004, with airlines hesitant to provide data for testing due to liability issues. Recent media reports suggest ongoing challenges in implementing passenger pre-screening. The 9/11 Commission recommended enhanced passenger pre-screening using federal watchlists, with CAPPS II implementation limited until concerns are addressed by the Government Accountability Office. TSA has only addressed one of the eight concerns, and airlines are reluctant to provide data for testing due to liability issues. Recent reports suggest CAPPS II has been scrapped over privacy concerns, but a new program may replace it. The CAPPS II program has been scrapped over privacy concerns, but a new program may replace it. Congress may intensify oversight of the Secure Flight program, successor to CAPPS, and debate the best way to proceed. H.R. 10 includes a provision for TSA to take over prescreening from airlines within 180 days of enactment. The 9/11 Commission's report highlights al Qaeda's interest in bombing airliners, supporting the need for a passenger pre-screening system like Secure Flight. H.R. 10 mandates TSA to take over prescreening from airlines within 180 days of enactment, aligning with administration plans. The 9/11 Commission's report emphasized al Qaeda's history of targeting airliners for attacks, leading to the need for the Secure Flight program. H.R. 10 requires TSA to implement passenger pre-screening within 180 days, aligning with administration goals. The report also mentions Ramzi Yousef's 1994 bombing of a Philippines Airlines flight as a precursor to a larger plot to bomb multiple U.S.-bound airliners. The report highlights Ramzi Yousef's 1994 bombing of a Philippines Airlines flight as part of the precursor to the \"Bojinka\" plot to bomb multiple U.S.-bound airliners. Yousef assembled an improvised explosive device on the plane and hid it under a seat with a digital watch timer. Concerns over IEDs were raised in later incidents involving Richard Reid and Nathaniel Heatwole. The 9/11 Commission report acknowledged weaknesses in detecting explosives on passengers, leading to recommendations for improving detection by the TSA and Congress. Nathaniel Heatwole sneaked banned items resembling explosives onto passenger jets, highlighting weaknesses in detecting explosives on passengers. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving explosives screening for all individuals selected for secondary screening due to limited capabilities in current screening technologies. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving explosives screening for individuals selected for secondary screening, as current technologies have limited capabilities in detecting explosives on passengers. New technology using trace detection methods is being tested at various transportation settings, including five airport sites. New technology is being tested at five airport sites to detect bomb-making chemicals on individuals using trace detection methods. Other methods for detecting explosives on passengers include body scan imaging using low dose x-ray backscatter or other techniques. Ongoing field tests are being conducted at five airport sites to detect explosives on passengers. Methods include body scan imaging using low dose x-ray backscatter, bomb-sniffing dogs, and physical searches. Body scan technology is controversial due to privacy concerns. Congress may debate the use of these technologies based on the 9/11 Commission recommendation. Body scan technology, including x-ray backscatter, is controversial due to privacy concerns as it renders a nude image. Congress may debate implementing and funding passenger screening initiatives based on the 9/11 Commission recommendation. The 9/11 Commission recommended implementing and funding passenger screening initiatives, including a human factors study to improve screener performance at checkpoints. Deficiencies in screener performance were highlighted by a recent DHS Inspector General's audit. The TSA conducted a human factors study to address screener performance issues highlighted by a recent DHS Inspector General's audit. Initiatives like threat image projection (TIP) have been implemented to improve on-the-job performance assessment of screeners. The TSA has implemented initiatives like threat image projection (TIP) to assess screener performance at screening checkpoints. They are also focusing on improving recurrent training for screeners and addressing key human factors issues in aviation security. The TSA is looking to enhance recurrent training for screeners and address key human factors issues in aviation security, such as screener selection, training, fitness for duty, and human interaction with screening technologies. However, research and funding for aviation security human factors are lacking compared to programs in the Department of Defense and FAA. There is also a need for a comprehensive strategic plan for addressing human factors in aviation. Ongoing research in aviation security human factors is limited compared to Department of Defense and FAA programs. There is a lack of a comprehensive strategic plan for addressing human factors in aviation security. Congress may conduct oversight to identify areas where TSA's human factors research efforts may be lacking. Congress may conduct oversight to identify areas where TSA's human factors research efforts may not be adequately addressing concerns over passenger and baggage screening performance. They may also consider tasking the National Academy of Sciences or another independent body to examine human factors needs in aviation security. The National Academy of Sciences addressed human factors in a 1999 assessment of aviation security technologies but has not conducted a focused study on this issue since. H.R. 10 includes a provision for TSA to conduct human factors studies to improve screener performance and pilot next-generation checkpoint screening technologies. The National Academy of Sciences has not focused on human factors needs in aviation security since 1999. The 9/11 Commission recommended expediting installation of in-line baggage screening systems. H.R. 10 includes a provision for TSA to conduct human factors studies to improve screener performance and pilot next-generation checkpoint screening technologies. Congress may debate the adequacy of current funding for this activity, as only $250 million was appropriated in FY2004 and requested in FY2005 for integrating EDS equipment at all passenger checkpoints. The installation of in-line baggage screening systems may be debated by Congress due to funding concerns. While Vision 100 authorizes up to $500 million annually for aviation security capital fund, only $250 million was appropriated in FY2004 and requested in FY2005. The total cost of integrating EDS equipment at all passenger airports is estimated to exceed $4 billion, leading to a multi-year completion timeline with current funding levels. Letters of intent (LOIs) issued by TSA to airports serve to stretch limited federal funding over several years. The total cost of integrating EDS equipment at all passenger airports is estimated to exceed $4 billion, with a multi-year completion timeline due to current funding levels. Letters of intent (LOIs) issued by TSA to airports aim to stretch limited federal funding over several years, but the reimbursement approach implemented by TSA could slow down the progress of EDS system integration at airports. The TSA's reimbursement approach for EDS integration through LOIs could hinder progress at airports. The aviation industry is urged to contribute to costs, but defining a fair share is contentious. Airlines already indirectly fund EDS integration up to $250 million. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the aviation industry should contribute to the costs of integrating EDS systems at airports. Large and medium-sized airports contribute 10% of the cost, while small airports contribute 5%. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the aviation industry should contribute to the costs of integrating EDS systems at airports. Large and medium-sized airports currently contribute 10% of the cost, while small airports contribute 5%. However, the TSA has proposed increasing the local share to 25% at large and medium-sized airports and 10% at small airports, a proposal opposed by airports. The TSA has proposed increasing the local share for EDS integration at airports to 25% at large and medium-sized airports and 10% at small airports, a proposal opposed by airports. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the aviation industry should contribute more to the costs, implying that industry is not paying its fair share under the current scheme. Congress may debate the equity of cost-sharing for EDS integration in response to this recommendation. The 9/11 Commission recommended a more equitable contribution from the aviation industry, suggesting that industry is not paying its fair share under the current scheme. Congress may debate the equity of cost-sharing for EDS integration in response to this recommendation. Legislation introduced in the House seeks to increase the amount collected in aviation security fees for the aviation security capital fund. Legislation introduced in the House (H.R. 5121) aims to double the amount collected in aviation security fees for the aviation security capital fund from $250 million to $500 million annually for FY2005 through FY2007. It also seeks to increase TSA's flexibility in meeting checked baggage security screening requirements by allowing multi-year contracts up to 10 years with airports or third-party vendors for EDS imaging capabilities. H.R. 5121 aims to increase aviation security fees to $500 million annually for FY2005 through FY2007 and enhance TSA's flexibility in meeting baggage screening requirements. The 9/11 Commission recommended intensifying efforts to identify and screen suspicious cargo in aviation and maritime operations. The TSA unveiled a strategic plan for cargo security in November 2003, based on recommendations from the Aviation Security Advisory Committee. The plan includes a multi-layered risk-based approach with four key strategic objectives. The TSA's strategic plan for cargo security, unveiled in November 2003, focuses on a multi-layered risk-based approach with four key objectives: enhancing shipper and supply chain security, pre-screening elevated risk cargo, using technology for targeted air cargo inspections, and securing all-cargo aircraft through facility security measures. The plan aims to pre-screen all cargo shipments to determine their risk level and collaborate with industry and federal agencies. The TSA's strategic plan for cargo security, unveiled in November 2003, focuses on enhancing shipper and supply chain security, pre-screening elevated risk cargo, using technology for targeted air cargo inspections, and securing all-cargo aircraft through facility security measures. The plan aims to pre-screen all cargo shipments to determine their risk level and collaborate with industry and federal agencies to ensure enhanced security measures are implemented. The TSA's strategic plan for cargo security includes pre-screening elevated risk cargo, collaborating with industry and federal partners, deploying new technology solutions, and implementing security measures. The 9/11 Commission recommends accelerating progress towards these objectives, especially in the identification, tracking, and screening of cargo. Congress may further scrutinize TSA's efforts in this area. The 9/11 Commission recommends accelerating progress in the identification, tracking, and screening of cargo. Congress may further scrutinize TSA's efforts on cargo security and debate approaches to air cargo security, focusing on the level of physical screening needed. Recent debate in Congress over air cargo security has focused on the level of physical screening or inspection of cargo needed to mitigate risks. Proposals have been made for 100% screening, but Congress supports a risk-based approach using the known-shipper program. H.R. 10 and S. 2845 aim to improve cargo screening and tracking. Congress supports a risk-based approach for air cargo security, relying on the known-shipper program. H.R. 10 and S. 2845 aim to improve cargo screening and tracking, with S. 2845 specifically requiring the TSA to double air cargo screening within one year. The 9/11 Commission recommended deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft carrying cargo. S. 2845 would require the TSA to double air cargo screening within one year. The 9/11 Commission recommended deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft carrying cargo. The National Research Council estimated it would cost $125 million to acquire enough hardened containers, with an annual industry-wide cost of $11 million due to reduced revenue and increased fuel burn. The National Research Council estimated that acquiring hardened cargo containers for passenger aircraft carrying suspicious cargo would cost $125 million. They also projected an annual industry-wide cost of $11 million due to reduced revenue and increased fuel burn. This initiative may face opposition from passenger airlines due to the potential increase in operational costs. Opponents of deploying hardened cargo containers may argue against the need for them if other cargo security measures are implemented. Proponents, however, argue that hardened containers provide an additional layer of defense, similar to hardened cockpit doors, in line with the goal of a multi-layered security system. Opponents argue against hardened cargo containers if other security measures are in place. Proponents believe they add an extra layer of defense, akin to hardened cockpit doors, for a multi-layered security system. However, using only one hardened container per aircraft still leaves vulnerabilities tied to cargo assessments and suspicious items. TSA mandates vetting and verification for all cargo to address these risks. The TSA requires all cargo from unvetted shippers to be carried on all-cargo planes, not passenger planes. There are concerns about adapting the system to allow suspect cargo in hardened containers on passenger planes. The TSA requires cargo from unvetted shippers to be carried on all-cargo planes, not passenger planes. There are concerns about allowing suspect cargo in hardened containers on passenger planes and the criteria for permitting this. Congress may debate the effectiveness of deploying hardened cargo containers for security. From a policy standpoint, it is unclear what criteria could be used to permit shipment of suspicious cargo on passenger aircraft in hardened cargo containers. Congress may debate whether deployment of hardened cargo containers could provide an effective layer of security to protect against potential cargo bombings. A key policy issue in this debate is likely to be the possible implications of allowing suspicious cargo to travel on passenger aircraft even if they are secured in hardened cargo containers. H.R. 10 contains a provision that would require TSA to carry out a pilot program to evaluate the use of blast-resistant cargo containers on board passenger airplanes. The debate over allowing suspicious cargo on passenger aircraft in hardened containers is a key policy issue. H.R. 10 includes a provision for a pilot program on blast-resistant containers, while S. 2845 does not. Senate legislation requires a report on blast-resistant cargo container technology. The 9/11 Commission recommended establishing risk-based priorities for protecting transportation assets, including blast-resistant containers for baggage and cargo on passenger airliners. Legislation passed by the Senate requires a report on blast-resistant cargo container technology. The 9/11 Commission recommended a risk-based approach for protecting transportation assets, including blast-resistant containers for baggage and cargo on passenger airliners. They also advised the TSA to select practical and cost-effective defense measures for transportation assets, assigning roles to federal, state, local authorities, and private stakeholders. The 9/11 Commission recommended a risk-based approach for protecting transportation assets, assigning roles to federal, state, local authorities, and private stakeholders. The TSA's strategic plan for aviation security following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, focused on meeting ATSA mandates. The TSA has set the strategy for aviation security post-9/11 attacks, focusing on ATSA mandates. However, there is a need for a unified strategic plan for national aviation security policy, with a likely risk-based multi-layered approach. TSA has focused on ATSA mandates for aviation security post-9/11 attacks. A risk-based multi-layered approach is likely to be the core of future aviation security policy, in line with 9/11 Commission recommendations. Congress may consider tasking TSA with developing a national strategy for aviation security. A risk-based multi-layered approach to aviation security is likely to be the core of future policy, aligning with 9/11 Commission recommendations. Congress may task TSA with developing a national strategy for aviation security, addressing funding, roles of authorities, and industry involvement. Some argue existing plans suffice, while others advocate for a more formal strategic document. Cooperation is key. A formal strategic planning document for aviation security is needed to address funding, roles of authorities, and industry involvement. Challenges persist in defining roles and allocating resources for state and local participation and industry involvement in aviation security. Cooperation and integration are crucial in aviation security, with challenges in defining roles and allocating resources for state, local, and industry involvement. Local jurisdictions handle physical security at airports, while TSA oversees security enforcement and passenger screening. Local governments and state authorities also play a role in aviation security. Passenger air carriers and local jurisdictions, along with TSA, play key roles in airport security. Local governments and state authorities may provide law enforcement support and presence at screening checkpoints. Airlines are responsible for security procedures, training, and inspections for access to aircraft and secure airport areas. In air cargo and general aviation, similar security measures are in place. Aviation security involves law enforcement support at airports, screening checkpoints, and security measures for passenger air carriers, air cargo, and general aviation. The federal role is oversight and enforcement of security requirements, but a unified plan or strategy is lacking. In air cargo and general aviation, security measures rely on the direct participation of aircraft owners and operators, with federal oversight and enforcement. However, there is a lack of a unified plan or strategy for assigning roles and missions to stakeholders and adopting a systems approach to overall security strategy. Congress and the TSA may consider ways to improve strategic planning and resource allocation in light of the 9/11 Commission recommendation. The lack of a unified plan for assigning roles and missions to stakeholders and adopting a systems approach to security strategy in aviation may need improvement. Congress and the TSA could consider integrating specific aviation security strategies with an overarching transportation security strategy that includes rail, maritime, and highway security. The strategic planning, resource allocation, and integration of federal, state, local, and private-sector resources for aviation security are important. H.R. 10 requires the Department of Homeland Security to prepare and update a transportation security plan, including a modal plan for aviation, to set risk-based priorities and cost-effective methods. H.R. 10 mandates the Department of Homeland Security to develop transportation security plans, including for aviation, to prioritize risks and cost-effective protection methods. Congress has focused on implementing recommendations from the 9/11 Commission report. The 108th Congress passed legislation focusing on aviation security following the 9/11 Commission recommendations. The 108th Congress passed legislation related to aviation security following the 9/11 Commission recommendations, including the Vision 100 -- Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act and the National Intelligence Reform Act.

The Department of Homeland Security is required to study and report on the effectiveness of the aviation security system, including recommendations for improvement. Vision 100 mandated a study by the Department of Homeland Security on the effectiveness of the aviation security system, including recommendations for improvement. It also created the Aviation Security Capital Fund, authorizing up to $500 million per year through FY2007 to be appropriated to the fund. The first $250 million in aviation security fee collections each year through FY2007 were required to be deposited in this fund. Vision 100 mandated a study on aviation security effectiveness and created the Aviation Security Capital Fund with up to $500 million per year through FY2007. The Undersecretary for Border and Transportation Security was given authority to issue grants for integrating baggage explosive detection systems at airports. Vision 100 authorized grants for airports to integrate baggage explosive detection systems, reconfigure terminal baggage areas, and deploy explosive detection systems. The federal share of costs was set at 90% for large and medium hub airports and 95% for all other airports. Vision 100 authorized grants for airports to improve security measures, including baggage handling systems and security programs for air charter operators. It also set guidelines for the allocation of Aviation Security Capital Fund monies and required a review of the proposed CAPPS II passenger prescreening system by the Government Accountability Office. Vision 100 authorized grants for airports to improve security measures, including baggage handling systems and security programs for air charter operators. It also required a review of the proposed CAPPS II passenger prescreening system by the Government Accountability Office. The TSA has since scrapped the CAPPS II program and is developing an alternative prescreening system. The TSA delayed implementing the CAPPS II program until certain issues were addressed. They have now replaced it with the \"Secure Flight\" prescreening system. Vision 100 also allowed flight crew members to participate in the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program for cockpit security. Vision 100 authorized the development of the \"Secure Flight\" prescreening system and expanded the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program to include other flight crew members. It also mandated security regulations for foreign and domestic aircraft repair stations, along with security reviews for foreign repair stations working on air carrier aircraft. Vision 100 mandated security regulations for foreign and domestic aircraft repair stations, including a security review and audit of foreign repair stations working on air carrier aircraft.
