    "content": "North Korea's development of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, along with illicit activities, has been a persistent challenge for U.S. foreign policy since the post-Cold War period. Despite efforts through negotiations, aid, and sanctions, the DPRK's weapons capabilities continue to grow. The United States has never had formal diplomatic relations with North Korea (DPRK). U.S. administrations have tried negotiations, aid, and sanctions to stop North Korea's weapons programs, but without success. U.S. interests in North Korea include security, political, and human rights concerns, with military alliances obligating defense of South Korea and Japan. Thousands of U.S. troops are stationed in these countries. North Korea's increasing nuclear and missile capabilities pose a threat to U.S. interests in the region. The U.S. has military alliances with South Korea and Japan, obligating defense against any attack from the North. Thousands of U.S. troops and civilians in these countries are within range of North Korean missiles, potentially putting the U.S. homeland at risk. Troops in South Korea and Japan, along with U.S. civilians in the region, are vulnerable to North Korean missiles. The escalating nuclear and missile capabilities of North Korea pose a threat to the U.S. homeland. The situation could have significant economic implications globally. Negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program impact U.S. relations with major regional powers like China and South Korea. This complex geopolitical scenario is at the forefront of strategic concerns. The collapse of the government in Pyongyang or the Korean peninsula would have severe implications for the regional and global economy. Negotiations on North Korea's nuclear weapons program affect U.S. relations with major powers like China and South Korea. Dealing with a totalitarian regime that resists outside influences is a complex challenge. North Korea, with a population of about 25 million, was founded on the philosophy of juche (self-reliance). North Korea, with a population of about 25 million, was founded on the philosophy of juche (self-reliance) by Kim Jong-un's grandfather, Kim Il-sung. The Kim family's near-totalitarian control has enabled North Korea to resist outside influences and break diplomatic and commercial agreements, despite being surrounded by more powerful neighbors. North Korea's near-totalitarian control under the Kim family has allowed it to resist outside influences and break agreements, while maintaining one of the world's largest militaries as a deterrent to foreign intervention. This militarization has also helped extract concessions from neighboring countries. North Korea's militarization under the Kim family has created one of the world's largest militaries, acting as a deterrent to outside intervention and providing leverage over foreign powers. This militarization, along with provocative behavior and opaque policymaking, has hindered economic growth by limiting interactions with the outside world. Despite signs of economic strengthening, North Korea's internal situation remains challenging. North Korea's opaque policymaking and provocative behavior have hindered economic growth by limiting interactions with the outside world. Despite signs of economic strengthening, the internal situation remains challenging, with most of the population impoverished. Increasing access to outside information could lead to greater public discontent with the regime if growth does not continue. Congress influences U.S. policy on North Korea through sanctions legislation. The internal situation in North Korea remains difficult, with most of the population deeply impoverished. Increasing access to information from the outside world could lead to greater public discontent with the regime if growth does not continue. Congress has direct and indirect influence on U.S. policy towards North Korea through sanctions legislation and the North Korean Human Rights Act. Congress has set terms for U.S. restrictions on trade with North Korea and the President's ability to lift sanctions. They have also passed the North Korean Human Rights Act, addressing human rights issues and accepting North Korean refugees. Congress has authorized millions in energy assistance in past nuclear agreements, with conditions on aid provision based on North Korean compliance. In future agreements, Congress will need to approve funds for aid in exchange for denuclearization steps by North Korea. In future arrangements, if the United States agrees to provide aid in exchange for DPRK steps on denuclearization, Congress will need to authorize and appropriate funds, as it presumably would if the Administration sought to normalize diplomatic relations as the June 2018 Singapore agreement implies. In its oversight capacity, Congress has held hearings questioning North Korea's capabilities, intentions, human rights record, sanctions evasion, and linkage with. In its oversight capacity, Congress has held hearings with government and private witnesses questioning North Korea's capabilities, intentions, human rights record, sanctions evasion, and linkage with other governments. North Korea's rapid advances in missile and nuclear weapons capabilities have shifted U.S. policymakers' assessment of the regime's threat to the United States. Recent tests have demonstrated that North Korea presents security challenges to U.S. interests. North Korea's rapid advances in missile and nuclear weapons capabilities have shifted U.S. policymakers' assessment of the regime's threat to the United States. Recent tests have shown that North Korea is capable of striking the continental United States with a nuclear-armed ballistic missile, making it a top-line U.S. foreign policy and national security concern. North Korea's accelerated capability to strike the continental United States with a nuclear-armed ballistic missile has become a top U.S. foreign policy and national security concern. Pyongyang's threats have expanded to include nuclear weapons, long-range missile technology, submarine-based missiles, short-range artillery, and cyberattacks. Multiple nuclear tests and missile tests, including the most powerful sixth nuclear test, were conducted between January 2016 and September 2017. Pyongyang's threats have increased across various domains, including nuclear weapons, long-range missile technology, submarine-based missiles, short-range artillery, and cyberattack capacity. North Korea conducted three nuclear tests between January 2016 and September 2017, with the sixth test being the most powerful to date. In 2017, they also tested missiles capable of reaching the continental United States and are developing a submarine-based ballistic missile program. The Trump Administration publicly blamed North Korea for these actions in December 2017. Korea conducted missile tests showing capability to reach the U.S. Pyongyang is developing a submarine-based ballistic missile program. Trump Administration blamed North Korea for cyberattack \"WannaCry\" in 2017. The Trump Administration publicly blamed North Korea for the \"WannaCry\" cyberattack, showcasing North Korea's disruptive cyber capabilities. The administration initially pursued a \"maximum pressure\" policy to coerce Pyongyang through economic and diplomatic measures, similar to strategies employed by the Obama Administration. The Trump Administration pursued a \"maximum pressure\" policy to coerce Pyongyang through economic and diplomatic measures, leading the UNSC to pass four new sanctions resolutions. The Trump Administration successfully pressured Pyongyang through economic and diplomatic measures, leading the UNSC to pass four new sanctions resolutions that expanded requirements for U.N. member states to halt their interactions with North Korea. The Trump Administration pressured countries to cut ties with North Korea, going beyond UNSC requirements. Trump considered a preventive military strike against North Korea, with contradictory statements on negotiations and military action. The Trump Administration considered a preventive military strike against North Korea, with contradictory statements on negotiations and military action. Confusion arose from shifts in public statements, creating uncertainty about U.S. policy. North Korea accepted an invitation to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea after months of outreach to lower tensions. The United States is prepared to launch a preventive strike against North Korea, causing confusion about U.S. policy. North Korea accepted an invitation to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, leading to warmer North-South relations. President Trump later accepted an invitation to meet with Kim Jong-un before the June 2018 Singapore Summit. In 2018, the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea saw a high-level delegation from Pyongyang, including Kim Jong-un's sister, leading to improved North-South relations. President Trump accepted an invitation to meet with Kim before the Singapore Summit, where Kim met with Moon and Xi Jinping to pave the way for the historic U.S.-DPRK meeting. Kim's \"charm offensive\" followed previous provocations, with opinions varying on the reasons for his change in approach. Kim Jong-un, who had never met a foreign head of state or left North Korea since becoming leader, engaged in diplomacy by meeting with Moon and Xi Jinping to prepare for the unprecedented U.S.-DPRK summit. Reasons for Kim's shift to a \"charm offensive\" included harsh rhetoric from the Trump Administration, tough sanctions limiting North Korea's economic growth, and Moon Jae-in's outreach efforts. Kim Jong-un pursued diplomacy due to factors like harsh rhetoric from the Trump Administration, punishing sanctions, Moon Jae-in's outreach, and his confidence in a nuclear deterrent. He found willing counterparts in Moon, Xi, and Trump, leading to a meeting in Singapore on June 12, 2018. Kim Jong-un found willing counterparts in Moon, Xi, and Trump, leading to a meeting in Singapore on June 12, 2018. Trump and Kim issued a joint statement committing to security guarantees for North Korea and complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. In Singapore, Kim and Trump discussed North Korea's nuclear program, peace on the Korean Peninsula, and future U.S. relations. They issued a joint statement committing to security guarantees for North Korea and complete denuclearization. The document focuses on establishing new bilateral relations and building a lasting peace regime. The Singapore document outlines principles for normalization, peace, denuclearization, and POW/MIA remains between the United States and North Korea. It does not address North Korea's ballistic missile program. North Korea commits to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and agrees to recover the remains of U.S. troops from the Korean War. The agreement does not mention North Korea's ballistic missile program. Follow-on negotiations will be led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Trump announces the suspension of U.S.-South Korea military exercises. In the press conference following the summit, Trump announced the suspension of annual U.S.-South Korea military exercises, calling them \"war games\" and \"provocative.\" He mentioned saving money and expressed a hope of withdrawing U.S. troops from South Korea. The Defense Department later confirmed the suspension of the \"Ulchi Freedom\" exercises. The agreement reached at the summit, not reciprocated by Pyongyang, surprised South Korea and U.S. military commanders. Trump mentioned saving money and expressed a desire to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea. The Defense Department later canceled the annual U.S.-South Korea military exercises. Many analysts noted similarities to previous agreements with North Korea, although not directly made by the DPRK leader. Supporters highlight the suspension of missile and nuclear tests as a positive outcome. The cancellation of the annual U.S.-South Korea military exercises surprised many, with analysts noting similarities to previous agreements with North Korea. Supporters highlight the suspension of missile and nuclear tests as a positive outcome, while critics point out the lack of a timeframe and verification mechanisms for denuclearization. The suspension of missile and nuclear tests by North Korea under the agreement lacks a timeframe, verification mechanisms, and commitment to dismantle the ballistic missile program. Uncertainty remains regarding denuclearization, sequencing, peace regime, and diplomatic ties normalization. Some analysts view the regime's push for a peace treaty before denuclearization talks as a tactic to delay and gain recognition. The uncertainty surrounding denuclearization, peace regime, and diplomatic ties normalization in North Korea's agreement has raised concerns. Analysts warn that the regime's push for a peace treaty before denuclearization talks may be a tactic to delay and gain recognition as a nuclear state. Maintaining sanctions pressure while engaging with North Korea remains challenging. North Korea may try to delay denuclearization talks to gain recognition as a nuclear state. Maintaining sanctions pressure is challenging amid engagement efforts. U.N. sanctions are crucial in holding North Korea accountable for its weapons programs. U.N. sanctions are a key tool in holding North Korea accountable for its weapons programs. The UNSC, led by the United States, adopted its first resolution in 2006 requiring member states to impose sanctions following North Korea's nuclear test. A total of 10 sanctions resolutions were passed between 2006 and December 2017. The UNSC, led by the United States, adopted its first resolution in 2006 requiring member states to impose sanctions against North Korea after its nuclear test. A total of 10 sanctions resolutions were passed between 2006 and December 2017, expanding requirements for U.N. member states to halt interactions with North Korea. The U.N. member states have imposed sanctions on North Korea, targeting arms sales, trade in materials for weapons of mass destruction, individuals involved in WMD activities, and luxury goods transfers. Sanctions were expanded after North Korea's fourth nuclear test in January 2016, with six resolutions adopted since then, the most recent in December 2017, banning financial interactions and trade in various industrial sectors with North Korean entities. The U.N. sanctions on North Korea have expanded since the fourth nuclear test in January 2016. Six resolutions have been adopted, the latest in December 2017, banning financial interactions, trade in various industrial sectors, and interactions with North Korea in broad classes of activities. This has resulted in the ban of nearly all major export items from North Korea. The U.N. sanctions on North Korea have expanded since 2016, banning various sectors and interactions with North Korea. This has led to a significant decline in North Korean exports. The Obama and Trump Administrations also urged countries to cut ties with North Korea. Korea's major export items are now banned in international markets, with North Korean exports declining by over 30% in 2017 compared to 2016. The Obama and Trump Administrations pushed countries to cut ties with North Korea, with the US imposing its own unilateral sanctions. The extent of the Trump Administration's current approach is unclear since diplomatic outreach to Pyongyang in 2018. The Trump Administration has aggressively pushed for countries to cut ties with North Korea, going beyond UNSC requirements. They have imposed unilateral sanctions to exert pressure, following in the footsteps of previous administrations. The US has imposed unilateral sanctions on North Korea under Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump. These actions include designating North Korea as a money laundering concern and a state sponsor of terrorism. Congress has also passed specific statutes targeting North Korea. The Trump Administration redesignated North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism in 2017. Congress has passed two North Korea-specific statutes since 2015, imposing sanctions that limit trade to humanitarian goods, prohibit financial transactions, new investments, and grant the President authority to prohibit transactions. U.S. sanctions under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) have limited trade to humanitarian goods, prohibited financial transactions and new investments, and granted the President authority to prohibit transactions involving North Korea's key sectors. Foreign aid to North Korea is minimal and emergency-based, with strict controls to prevent the government from benefiting. U.S. individuals are prohibited from engaging in trade with North Korean entities. The US has new authority to prohibit transactions involving North Korea's transportation, mining, energy, or financial sectors. US persons are prohibited from trading with designated North Korean individuals, entities, and vessels. Foreign financial institutions could face US sanctions for facilitating transactions for designated DPRK entities. Trading with Kim Jong-un is also prohibited for US persons and entities. The US has new authority to prohibit transactions involving North Korea's transportation, mining, energy, or financial sectors. US persons are prohibited from trading with designated North Korean individuals, entities, and vessels. Foreign financial institutions could face US sanctions for facilitating transactions for designated DPRK entities. Trading with Kim Jong-un is also prohibited for US persons and entities. U.S. travel to North Korea is limited and requires a special validation passport issued by the State Department. North Korea's demands in negotiating the cessation of its weapons programs have repeatedly changed. North Korea's demands in negotiations for ending its weapons programs have varied, including recognition as a nuclear weapons state and a peace treaty with the US. Understanding North Korean behavior is complex due to their changing approaches to the outside world. North Korea's demands in negotiations have included recognition as a nuclear weapons state and a peace treaty with the US. Pyongyang's behavior has fluctuated between cooperation and provocations, driven by internal conditions like food shortages or economic desperation. North Korea has a history of denuclearization agreements, testing long-range missiles, and nuclear devices. Their willingness to negotiate is often driven by internal conditions like food shortages or economic desperation. Pyongyang exploits divisions among parties and political transitions to stall nuclear negotiations. North Korea is known to exploit divisions among parties and political transitions to stall nuclear negotiations, often seeking more aid. Some analysts believe negotiations are necessary to reduce conflict and are feasible because Kim Jong-un's goal is economic development. North Korea's demands have sparked debates on negotiating with them. Some analysts argue that negotiations are necessary to prevent conflict and are feasible because Kim Jong-un's main goal is economic development. This could lead to a basic bargain where North Korea receives security, an end to the Korean War, economic benefits, and sanctions relief in exchange for dismantling their nuclear weapons and missiles. Kim Jong-un's focus on economic development in 2018 is seen as a positive sign. In a basic bargain, North Korea seeks a secure relationship with the US, an end to the Korean War, economic benefits, and sanctions removal in exchange for nuclear disarmament. Kim Jong-un's focus on economic development in 2018 suggests a willingness to denuclearize, but analysts doubt North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons voluntarily. Many analysts believe that North Korea, despite inducements, will not give up its nuclear weapons capability as it is seen as essential for regime survival. Pyongyang's frequent statements of determination to denuclearize are viewed as tactical moves, with no intention of giving up nuclear weapons in exchange for aid and recognition. Many analysts believe North Korea sees nuclear capability as essential for regime survival and has no intention of giving it up in exchange for aid and recognition. Pyongyang's frequent statements reaffirming its nuclear weapons program cast doubt on any shift in intentions, as seen in its demand to be recognized as a nuclear weapons state and its plans to enhance its nuclear deterrent. North Korea's determination to maintain its nuclear weapons program has led analysts to doubt any significant shift in intentions, as seen in its demand to be recognized as a nuclear weapons state and its plans to enhance its nuclear deterrent. Pyongyang has reiterated that its nuclear weapons are not negotiable and declared them as essential for regime survival. North Korea has modernized its nuclear deterrent, declaring itself a \"nuclear-armed nation\" in 2012. It stated that its nuclear weapons are not negotiable and will not be relinquished, even for billions of dollars. The successful test of the Hwasong-15 missile in 2017 marked the completion of its state nuclear force. North Korea has indicated it will only give up its nuclear stockpile when all nuclear weapons are eliminated globally. Following the successful test of the Hwasong-15 missile in 2017, North Korea declared itself a \"nuclear-armed nation\" and stated it will not give up its nuclear weapons until all nuclear weapons are eliminated worldwide. The 2011 military intervention in Libya, which gave up its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions removal, may have reinforced the value of nuclear arms for regime security in North Korea. The 2011 military intervention in Libya may have reinforced the value of nuclear arms for regime security in North Korea. The 2018 Singapore summit conferred legitimacy on North Korea as a nuclear state. The 2018 Singapore summit conferred legitimacy on North Korea as a nuclear state by meeting with world leaders and agreeing to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. This satisfied some of North Korea's demands and eased sanctions. The 2018 Singapore summit conferred legitimacy on North Korea as a nuclear state by meeting with world leaders and agreeing to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. This satisfied some of North Korea's demands, including the cancelation of U.S.-ROK military exercises and easing of sanctions implementation. Prior to the Trump Administration's efforts, the United States engaged in various nuclear and missile negotiations with North Korea. The United States engaged in multiple formal nuclear and missile negotiations with North Korea, including the Agreed Framework, bilateral missile negotiations, Six-Party Talks, and the Leap Day Deal. The negotiations aimed for North Korea to halt its nuclear or missile programs in exchange for economic and diplomatic concessions. In 1986, U.S. intelligence detected North Korea's plutonium production reactor and reprocessing plant at Yongbyon, which violated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In 1986, U.S. intelligence detected North Korea's plutonium production reactor and reprocessing plant at Yongbyon, which violated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. North Korea announced its intention to withdraw from the NPT after obstructing International Atomic Energy Agency inspections. A preemptive military strike on North's nuclear facilities was considered during the crisis. In the early 1990s, North Korea announced its intention to withdraw from the NPT after obstructing IAEA inspections. A preemptive military strike on North's nuclear facilities was considered, but discussions of sanctions and a diplomatic mission led to negotiations and the U.S.-North Korea 1994 Agreed Framework for nuclear power plants. The U.S.-North Korea 1994 Agreed Framework was established after discussions of sanctions and a diplomatic mission led by former President Jimmy Carter. The agreement involved North Korea receiving nuclear power plants and fuel oil in exchange for freezing and dismantling its plutonium program under IAEA supervision, with the goal of normalization of relations and security assurances. The 1994 Agreed Framework involved North Korea receiving nuclear power plants and fuel oil in exchange for freezing and dismantling its plutonium program under IAEA supervision. Despite facing delays, the agreement saw North Korea freezing its plutonium program, receiving fuel oil, and starting construction on the power plants. However, North Korea failed to declare all nuclear facilities to the IAEA as agreed. In 2002, the George W. Bush Administration accused North Korea of a secret uranium enrichment program, leading to the halt of fuel oil shipments and construction of power plants. North Korea then expelled IAEA inspectors and announced its withdrawal. In 2002, the George W. Bush Administration confronted North Korea over a suspected uranium enrichment program. North Korea denied the existence of the program publicly, leading to the halt of fuel oil shipments and construction of power plants. North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors, withdrew from the NPT, and restarted its reactor and reprocessing facility after an eight-year freeze. In response to congressional pressure, the Clinton Administration began negotiations with North Korea in 1996 to curb its missile program and exports. In 1999, North Korea agreed to a missile testing moratorium in exchange for the partial lifting of U.S. sanctions. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Pyongyang in 2000 to finalize the terms of an agreement. In September 1999, North Korea agreed to a moratorium on testing long-range missiles in exchange for the partial lifting of U.S. sanctions and bilateral talks. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Pyongyang in October 2000 to finalize terms of a new agreement, aiming to end ballistic missile development and exports in exchange for international assistance in launching North Korean satellites. However, a final agreement was not reached, and North Korea maintained its moratorium until July 2006. In October 2000, negotiations to end North Korea's ballistic missile development and exports in exchange for international assistance in satellite launches failed to reach a final agreement. The George W. Bush Administration expanded talks to include China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia, leading to six rounds of the \"Six-Party Talks\" from 2003 to 2008, which ultimately did not resolve the issue of North Korean nuclear arms. Negotiations to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue expanded to include China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia. Six rounds of the \"Six-Party Talks\" from 2003 to 2008 yielded occasional progress but failed to resolve the fundamental issue of North Korean nuclear arms. The most promising breakthrough occurred in 2005 with the issuance of a Joint Statement in which North Korea agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons programs in exchange for aid, a U.S. security guarantee, and talks over normalization of relations with the United States. Despite the promise of the statement, the process eventually broke down due to an inability to agree on measures to verify North Korea's actions. In 2005, North Korea agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons programs in exchange for aid, a U.S. security guarantee, and talks over normalization of relations with the United States. The process eventually broke down due to an inability to verify North Korea's compliance. The Obama Administration's policy involved pressuring Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks and commit to denuclearization steps. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea, known as \"strategic patience,\" aimed to pressure Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks and commit to denuclearization steps. Key elements included coordination with Japan and South Korea, urging China to take a tougher stance, and applying pressure through arms interdictions and sanctions. U.S. officials were open to a comprehensive deal under the right conditions. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea, known as \"strategic patience,\" aimed to pressure Pyongyang to denuclearize. Key elements included coordinating with Japan and South Korea, urging China to take a tougher stance, and applying pressure through arms interdictions and sanctions. U.S. officials were open to a comprehensive deal under the right conditions, including a freeze on nuclear activities and testing before negotiations. Military exercises were conducted to showcase the strength of the U.S.-South Korean alliance. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea, known as \"strategic patience,\" aimed to pressure Pyongyang to denuclearize through coordination with Japan and South Korea, urging China to take a tougher stance, and applying pressure through arms interdictions and sanctions. A comprehensive deal for North Korea's denuclearization was sought, with a freeze on nuclear activities and testing before negotiations. Military exercises were conducted to demonstrate the strength of the U.S.-South Korean alliance, accompanied by multilateral and unilateral sanctions. The Obama Administration implemented multilateral and unilateral sanctions on North Korea, targeting entities and individuals involved in weapons sales, money laundering, arms sales, counterfeiting, narcotics, and luxury goods. This was in addition to the U.N. sanctions following the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014. The Obama Administration imposed sanctions on North Korea for engaging in illicit activities to fund WMD programs and support the regime, including money laundering, arms sales, counterfeiting, narcotics, and luxury goods. President Obama issued E.O. 13687 after the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, allowing the U.S. government to seize assets of designated DPRK officials. Despite attempts at engagement, provocations by Pyongyang stalled negotiations, leading to a cycle of action and violations of international law. President Obama's E.O. 13687 allowed the U.S. government to seize assets of designated DPRK officials. Despite attempts at engagement, provocations by Pyongyang stalled negotiations, leading to a cycle of action and violations of international law. The U.S. focused on building consensus at the UNSC and pressuring North Korea through enhanced multilateral sanctions. An exception occurred in February 2012 after Kim Jong-il's death, marking a shift in North Korea's leadership. The \"Leap Day Agreement\" in February 2012 committed North Korea to a moratorium on nuclear tests, missile launches, and uranium enrichment at Yongbyon in exchange for nutritional assistance from the Obama Administration. The \"Leap Day Agreement\" in February 2012 committed North Korea to a moratorium on nuclear tests, missile launches, and uranium enrichment at Yongbyon in exchange for nutritional assistance from the Obama Administration. However, North Korea violated the agreement by launching a long-range rocket and conducting a third nuclear test in February 2013, leading to the U.S. relying heavily on China for economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea. The U.S. policy towards North Korea relies heavily on China, its largest trading partner and provider of food and energy aid. China has supported increasingly restrictive UNSC sanctions against North Korea despite not backing Pyongyang's nuclear goals. China, North Korea's largest trading partner, provides essential food and energy aid to the regime. Despite not supporting Pyongyang's nuclear goals, China's main priority is to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula and prevent North Korea's collapse. Analysts believe Beijing fears the destabilizing effects of a humanitarian crisis and significant refugee flows over its borders. China's main priority is to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula and prevent North Korea's collapse. Beijing fears the destabilizing effects of a humanitarian crisis, significant refugee flows, and the uncertainty of other nations' actions in a power vacuum. China also values North Korea as a strategic buffer between itself and democratic, U.S.-allied South Korea, often obstructing U.S. policy goals regarding North Korea in international forums like the U.N. China often obstructs U.S. efforts to punish North Korea in international forums like the U.N. Chinese companies violate sanctions against North Korea, and the government's enforcement of sanctions is inconsistent. China's obstruction of U.S. efforts to punish North Korea in international forums like the U.N. is often influenced by Beijing's seat on the UNSC. Chinese companies frequently violate sanctions against North Korea, with the government's enforcement being inconsistent. However, in 2017, China significantly increased its enforcement of UNSC sanctions, possibly to deter the U.S. from military action against North Korea. Chinese trade and aid to North Korea are believed to be limited compared to what they could be if Beijing fully engaged. In 2017, China increased enforcement of UNSC sanctions to deter US military action against North Korea. Chinese trade and aid to North Korea are limited, possibly to maintain a responsible image internationally. This influences US and South Korean strategies to avoid pressuring China for more diplomatic and economic support. Relations between Beijing and Pyongyang have been strained since Kim Jong-un came to power in 2011. Beijing was unhappy with Kim Jong-un, especially after he executed his uncle Jang Song-taek in 2013, who had been a key intermediary with China. Chinese President Xi Jinping has held multiple summits with former South Korean leaders. Relations between Beijing and Pyongyang soured after Kim Jong-un's rise to power in 2011, with Beijing displeased by his actions, including the execution of his uncle Jang Song-taek in 2013. Chinese President Xi Jinping held summits with South Korean leaders but did not meet with Kim. Chinese academics and public opinion began to question China's friendly ties with North Korea due to the costs involved. In 2017, China agreed to increasingly stringent UNSC sanctions resolutions and to an unprecedented degree. Chinese public opinion turned against North Korea, with many favoring a U.S. preemptive airstrike on North Korea's nuclear sites. Content ridiculing Pyongyang's leadership was regularly deleted by state censors. In 2017, Chinese public opinion turned against North Korea, with many favoring a U.S. preemptive airstrike on North Korea's nuclear sites. Content ridiculing Pyongyang's leadership was regularly deleted by state censors. China agreed to increasingly stringent UNSC sanctions resolutions and appeared to be implementing these measures. Trump and Kim's pursuit of a diplomatic opening in 2018 restored some of the previous closeness of the North Korea-China relationship. Kim traveled to Beijing for the first time, suggesting a shift in dynamics. After Trump agreed to meet Kim, the North Korean leader traveled to Beijing to reaffirm a close relationship with China. Kim's diplomatic efforts led to deescalation of hostilities and the cancelation of U.S.-South Korean military exercises, perceived as victories by China. Kim Jong-un's visit to Beijing suggested a reaffirmation of a close relationship with China. He has achieved results that China sees as victories, including deescalation of hostilities and the cancelation of U.S.-South Korean military exercises. Kim is the third generation of the Kim family to rule North Korea. Kim Jong-un, the third generation of the Kim family to rule North Korea, has gained new goodwill and leverage in his relationship with Beijing. Despite uncertainties about the Pyongyang regime, Kim's bold emergence on the global stage in 2018 suggests a confident assertion of himself in world diplomacy. In December 2011, Kim Jong-un, believed to be in his late 20s, emerged boldly on the global stage in 2018, reinforcing the impression of consolidated power at the apex of the North Korean regime. Kim's two-track policy focuses on economic development and nuclear weapons development. Kim Jong-un has consolidated power in North Korea by pursuing a two-track policy of economic development and nuclear weapons development. He has achieved a \"limited nuclear deterrent\" and is now focusing on improving economic opportunities through a \"charm offensive\" with South Korea and China. Kim Jong-un has consolidated power in North Korea through economic and nuclear weapons development, rejecting external pressures. He aims to improve economic opportunities through a charm offensive with South Korea and China, while also achieving a temporary breakthrough with the United States to avoid harsher sanctions. Despite initial hopes of political reform, Kim's ruthless power consolidation shows his commitment to the dynastic rule. Kim Jong-un has demonstrated a ruthless drive to consolidate power in North Korea, carrying out purges of senior officials and showing a keen desire to maintain the dynastic dictatorship. His actions, including the execution of his uncle and the killing of his half-brother, highlight his brutal leadership style since becoming supreme leader in late 2011. Since becoming supreme leader in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has ruthlessly maintained the dynastic dictatorship in North Korea through purges of senior officials and brutal actions, such as the execution of his uncle and the killing of his half-brother. He has replaced over 300 senior military and civilian officials in his first four years in office, displaying a different ruling style than his father. Kim Jong-nam was assassinated at Kuala Lumpur airport in Malaysia using nerve agent VX, believed to be authorized by Kim Jong-un. South Korean intelligence sources report over 300 senior officials replaced in Kim's first four years. Kim Jong-un has a different ruling style than his father, allowing Western influences and being informal in public appearances. Kim Jong-un has a different ruling style from his father, allowing Western influences and being informal in public appearances. He introduced his wife to the North Korean public, but their children remain hidden. Analysts see these changes as an attempt to appear young and modern, reminiscent of his grandfather Kim Il-Sung. Kim Jong-un's wife was introduced to the North Korean public, while their three children remain hidden. Analysts view these changes as Kim's attempt to appear modern and young, evoking his grandfather Kim Il-Sung's \"man of the people\" image. North Korea has a low per capita GDP and a centrally planned economy, but under Kim, economic policy changes have led to growth and improved living conditions. North Korea, with a per capita GDP of under $2,000, has a centrally planned economy. Economic policy changes under Kim Jong-un have led to growth and improved living conditions for many North Koreans, despite international sanctions. Under Kim Jong-un's economic policy changes, market principles have been allowed to govern some sectors of North Korean business, industry, and agriculture, leading to increased domestic production and lifted living standards for many North Koreans. This has helped North Korea withstand the impact of international sanctions, particularly the decline in exports from 2016 to 2017. Under Kim Jong-un's economic policy changes, market principles have been permitted to govern some sectors of North Korean business, industry, and agriculture, leading to an expansion in markets and ancillary services. Under Kim Jong-un's economic policy changes, North Korea has partially legalized consumer and business-to-business markets, leading to an expansion in market size and ancillary services. Kim emphasizes domestic manufacturing and a shift towards domestically produced goods. International trade with China accounts for over 90% of North Korea's trade, facilitating the marketization process. Agricultural liberalization and favorable planting conditions have also contributed to market growth. North Korea's marketization process, driven by international trade with China, has led to a shift towards domestic manufacturing. Agricultural liberalization and favorable planting conditions have resulted in larger harvests since 2010. Despite stable food prices since 2012, food security remains a concern for many North Koreans. Since 2010, North Korea has seen larger harvests due to agricultural liberalization and favorable planting conditions. Despite stable food prices since 2012, over 10 million North Koreans still suffer from food insecurity and undernutrition. Analysts debate whether Kim's changes can be considered significant reforms. The United Nations Resident Coordinator for North Korea estimates that over 10 million North Koreans, or over 40% of the population, continue to suffer from food insecurity and undernutrition. Analysts debate whether Kim's changes can be considered \"reforms\" due to conflicting evidence on the government's willingness to tolerate marketization. North Korea's economic policies resemble those of socialist countries with strict prohibitions on private enterprise. The government shows conflicting attitudes towards marketization, occasionally cracking down on market activities. Many North Koreans lack access to healthcare and face food shortages, despite the regime's claims of providing universal healthcare. The communist regime in North Korea tightly controls market activities to maintain power. Limited access to healthcare and food shortages are prevalent, despite claims of universal healthcare. Quality medical care is scarce, with only the elite in Pyongyang having access to better facilities. The regime dictates where families can live based on loyalty, restricting access to the capital for many North Koreans. In Pyongyang, only the elite have access to better health facilities, while the regime controls where families can live based on loyalty. Quality medical care is scarce, and many North Koreans cannot afford necessary medications. Pyongyang is losing control over information flow, with some turning to outside news sources. North Koreans struggle to afford medications and bribes for medical care. Pyongyang is losing control over information flow, with citizens turning to outside news sources despite government efforts to prevent access to foreign broadcasts. The North Korean government tries to prevent citizens from accessing foreign broadcasts by jamming stations and altering radios. Despite these efforts, some citizens have illegal or modified radios to listen to outside programs. A 2015 survey found that 29% of North Korean defectors listened to foreign broadcasts while in the country. In 2009, North Korea restarted a mobile phone network in cooperation with Orascom. North Korean citizens use illegal or modified radios to access foreign broadcasts. In 2009, North Korea restarted a mobile phone network with over 3 million subscribers in 2017, possibly for better surveillance. Some reports suggest that North Korean officials consume foreign media and are involved in smuggling operations. The North Korean regime has allowed increased mobile-phone use, possibly for better surveillance. Reports indicate that some officials consume foreign media and are involved in smuggling. Chinese cellphones, although illegal, can be used near the border for international calls. The spread of cell phones enables faster dissemination of information within North Korea. Chinese cellphones can be used near the border to make international calls in North Korea. The spread of cell phones allows for faster dissemination of information, potentially leading to positive changes in the political system. 28% of North Koreans own domestic mobile phones, with 15% using them to access sensitive media content. Increased access to information could weaken the Kim regime. Increased access to information in North Korea, including through domestic mobile phones, could weaken the Kim regime, as 15% of phone users access sensitive media content. Thae Yong-ho believes that outside information could be the regime's Achilles Heel. Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean deputy ambassador to Britain, believes that the regime's Achilles Heel is its indoctrination of citizens to portray the outside world as inferior. North Korea has a large military force and high defense spending, but access to outside information could challenge the regime. North Korea's military is one of the largest globally, with 1.28 million personnel and high defense spending. The military is strategically positioned near the DMZ for rapid deployment in a conflict with South Korea. The regime's control relies on portraying the outside world as inferior, hindering access to outside information. North Korea's military relies on high defense spending, with 70% of ground forces and 50% of air and naval forces near the DMZ for quick deployment. The regime is developing WMD capabilities, focusing on nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Additionally, North Korea possesses a large stockpile of chemical weapons. North Korea is prioritizing the development of nuclear weapons, long-range ballistic missiles, and cyber capabilities to offset deficiencies in its conventional forces. The U.S. intelligence community assesses North Korea as a significant cyber threat in 2018. North Korea has a large stockpile of chemical and possibly biological weapons. Analysts believe they have developed offensive cyber capabilities, with 6,000 cyber warfare troops according to South Korea's Defense Ministry. Despite outdated military equipment, North Korea still poses a significant threat. North Korea's conventional military capabilities have weakened since 1990, but they could still cause significant damage to Seoul with artillery and rocket attacks. Analysts estimate that North Korean artillery forces, stationed in underground facilities, could fire thousands of rounds at the city. If a war were to occur on the Korean Peninsula, the United States and South Korea would likely emerge victorious, but at a high cost. North Korea's artillery and rocket attacks could cause significant damage to Seoul. Despite North Korea's outdated military equipment, the United States and South Korea are likely to prevail in a war on the Korean Peninsula, but at a high cost. North Korea's military equipment is outdated, based on old Soviet designs from the 1950s-1970s. To compensate, North Korea has focused on improving its asymmetric capabilities such as UAVs, cyber operations, special forces, GPS jamming, stealth, and electromagnetic pulse technology. Recent advancements have been made in long-range capabilities. North Korea has sought to improve its asymmetric capabilities in recent years, including advancements in long-range artillery, tanks, armored vehicles, infantry weapons, surface-to-air missiles, and special operations forces. They have also constructed new helicopter-carrier corvettes and may be developing a larger submarine for launching ballistic missiles. North Korea has advanced in long-range artillery, tanks, armored vehicles, infantry weapons, unmanned aerial vehicles, surface-to-air missiles, ballistic missile-capable submarines, and special operations forces. The military suffers from institutional weaknesses that would limit its effectiveness in a major conflict due to its highly centralized command and control structure. War plans are believed to be rigid and inflexible. The North Korean military's command and control structure is highly centralized, limiting independent actions. War plans are rigid and inflexible, with mid-level officers lacking training and authority for initiative. Resource scarcity affects military readiness, such as fuel shortages hindering flight training and logistical issues impacting troop mobility.

Resource scarcity affects military readiness, with fuel shortages hindering flight training and logistical issues impacting troop mobility. U.S. analysts are concerned about North Korea's nuclear weapons development pace and success. Shortages in North Korea could hinder troop travel, reduce equipment availability, and impact combat endurance. U.S. analysts are worried about the progress of North Korea's nuclear weapons development and skeptical of their willingness to denuclearize despite ongoing talks. The U.S. intelligence community believes North Korea's nuclear weapons serve purposes of deterrence, prestige, and diplomacy. Despite talks of denuclearization, skepticism remains about Pyongyang's commitment. The regime's insistence on nuclear weapons for survival suggests they do not intend to negotiate them away. North Korea's nuclear arsenal is seen as a deterrent against the United States, with the regime emphasizing the importance of keeping their weapons for survival. Pyongyang's commitment to possessing nuclear weapons and long-range missiles indicates they do not plan to negotiate them away. North Korean Foreign Ministry official Choe Son Hui stated in October 2017 that their nuclear arsenal is crucial for deterring US attacks and is a matter of life and death. North Korea has been focusing on developing smaller, lighter, and more diversified warheads, conducting multiple nuclear tests since 2006, including a hydrogen bomb in September 2017. North Korea has emphasized developing smaller, lighter, and more diversified warheads, conducting multiple nuclear tests since 2006, including a hydrogen bomb in September 2017 with a higher yield. Despite announcing the closure of its test site in early 2018, North Korea has focused on perfecting nuclear weapons for delivery on intercontinental ballistic missiles. North Korea announced the closure of its nuclear test site in early 2018 after achieving its goals, but fissile material production continues. The nuclear program began in the late 1950s with cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union. The North Korean nuclear program started in the late 1950s with Soviet cooperation on a research program near Yongbyon. They built a small nuclear reactor capable of producing plutonium, which began operating in 1986. Despite closing its test site, fissile material production facilities remain active. North Korea built a small nuclear reactor at Yongbyon in 1986, capable of producing 6 kilograms of plutonium per year. The reactor and reprocessing facility have been alternately operational and frozen under safeguards since 1994 and again in 2007. After the collapse of the Six Party Talks in 2008, North Korea restarted its reactor and reprocessing plant, and openly built a uranium enrichment plant. Since the collapse of the Six Party Talks in 2008, North Korea has resumed its nuclear activities, including restarting its reactor and reprocessing plant, building a uranium enrichment plant, and constructing a new experimental light water reactor. It is estimated that North Korea has produced between 30 and 40 kilograms of separated plutonium for nuclear weapons. North Korea openly built a uranium enrichment plant and is constructing a new experimental light water reactor. It has produced between 30 and 40 kilograms of separated plutonium for nuclear weapons. Intelligence revealed a second route to a bomb using highly enriched uranium (HEU). North Korea acknowledged a uranium enrichment program in 2009, claiming it is for nuclear power production. In 2010, North Korea showed early construction of a 100 MWT reactor to American experts. North Korea's weapons program initially focused on plutonium but later revealed a uranium enrichment program in 2009. In 2010, they displayed construction of a light-water reactor and a uranium enrichment plant at Yongbyon. The operational status of the enrichment plant remains unconfirmed, with suspicions of other clandestine facilities. Visiting American experts observed construction of a 100 MWT light-water reactor and a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment plant at Yongbyon. North Korea claims the enrichment plant is operational, but this is unconfirmed. Reports suggest other clandestine enrichment facilities exist, with one identified at Kangson. Estimating warhead and material stockpiles is challenging due to lack of transparency. U.S. officials have not provided warhead total estimates, but scholarly analyses offer low, medium, and high scenarios. North Korea's nuclear facilities, including a site at Kangson, are difficult to estimate in terms of warhead and material stockpiles due to lack of transparency. Scholarly analyses suggest production estimates could result in 20 to 100 warheads by 2020. The country prioritizes the development of its ballistic missile technology. North Korea prioritizes the development of its ballistic missile technology, conducting numerous test launches since Kim Jong-un came to power in 2011. Estimates suggest they could produce 20 to 100 warheads by 2020. North Korea has conducted over 80 ballistic missile test launches since Kim Jong-un came to power in 2011, aiming to improve offensive weapons range and evade U.S. missile defense systems. In 2016, they conducted 26 ballistic missile flight tests, and in 2017, 18 ballistic missile launches, including suspected ICBM tests. North Korea also possesses around 700 short-range ballistic missiles. In 2016, North Korea conducted 26 ballistic missile flight tests on various platforms. In 2017, they test launched 18 ballistic missiles, including suspected ICBM tests. North Korea also has around 700 short-range ballistic missiles in their arsenal. The U.S. intelligence community believes their nuclear weapons program aims to develop a miniaturized warhead for long-range mounting. North Korea's nuclear weapons program aims to develop a miniaturized warhead for long-range mounting on ballistic missiles, with concerns about the medium-range Nodong missile posing a threat to the Korean Peninsula, mainland Japan, and U.S. military bases. North Korea's nuclear weapons program aims to develop a miniaturized warhead for long-range ballistic missiles, with concerns about the medium-range Nodong missile posing a threat to the Korean Peninsula, mainland Japan, and U.S. military bases. Assessments differ on the progress of miniaturization, which may require additional nuclear and missile tests. The KN-08 and Taepodong-2 are identified as hypothetical ICBMs that North Korea could mount a nuclear warhead on to reach the continental United States. North Korea has the capability to mount a nuclear warhead on the Nodong missile. The KN-08 and Taepodong-2 are identified as hypothetical ICBMs that could deliver a nuclear warhead to the continental United States. North Korea has displayed mock-ups of these ICBMs, and there have been assessments of initial steps towards fielding the system, although it has not been flight-tested yet. In July 2017, North Korea conducted two ICBM tests. North Korea has displayed mock-ups of the KN-08 and KN-14 ICBMs, with assessments of initial steps towards fielding the system. In July 2017, North Korea conducted two ICBM tests, showing limited success in its missile programs. The Department of Defense report in December 2017 acknowledged the tests but suggested additional testing may be necessary. North Korea has shown progress in its medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) and submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) programs. They are also transitioning towards solid rocket motors for their ballistic missiles, with successful tests of the Pukguksong-2 (KN-15) solid fuel MRBM leading to plans for mass production. North Korea is advancing towards solid rocket motors for its ballistic missiles, with successful tests of the Pukguksong-2 (KN-15) solid fuel MRBM leading to plans for mass production. Recent focus is on developing capabilities to counter missile defense systems like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD. North Korea's ballistic missile test program aims to defeat or degrade missile defense systems like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD. Tests in 2016 involved lofting missiles to higher altitudes and shorter ranges, making interception more challenging. In 2017, North Korea demonstrated the ability to launch a salvo attack. North Korea's 2016 missile tests involved launching missiles to higher altitudes and shorter ranges, making interception more difficult. In 2017, they demonstrated the ability to launch a salvo attack with multiple missiles in quick succession, potentially complicating missile defense systems. Their progress with SLBMs suggests a continued focus on developing capabilities for large ballistic missile attacks. In 2017, North Korea demonstrated the ability to launch a salvo attack with multiple missiles in quick succession, potentially complicating missile defense systems. Their progress with SLBMs suggests a focus on developing capabilities for large ballistic missile attacks, possibly countering land-based THAAD defenses by launching attacks from sea positions. North Korea's progress with SLBMs may be aimed at countering land-based THAAD missile defenses by launching attacks from sea positions. The United States has previously tried to negotiate limits on North Korea's missile program, with talks dating back to 1998. Promises were made by Kim Jong-il to lift economic sanctions in exchange for a moratorium on long-range missile tests, but negotiations were inconclusive. After its first long-range missile test in 1998, North Korea and the United States engaged in talks on a moratorium on long-range missile tests in exchange for lifting economic sanctions. Despite promises made by Kim Jong-il to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, a deal was not reached. The Bush Administration prioritized the North Korean nuclear program over ballistic missiles, leading to the abandonment of negotiations. In 2006, UNSC Resolution 1718 prohibited North Korea from missile-related activities, which North Korea violated. The Six-Party Talks led by Albright failed to reach a deal due to the Bush Administration's focus on North Korea's nuclear program. UNSC Resolution 1718 in 2006 banned North Korea from missile activities, but they violated it with a test launch in 2009. Resolution 1874 imposed further restrictions on North Korea's ballistic missile program. The 2012 Leap Day Agreement included a moratorium on ballistic missile tests, excluding satellite launches according to North Korea. Recent talks have not addressed missile issues specifically. North Korea violated UNSC Resolution 1718 with a test launch in 2009. Resolution 1874 imposed more restrictions on their ballistic missile program. The 2012 Leap Day Agreement included a moratorium on missile tests, excluding satellite launches. Recent talks have not focused on missiles. North Korea is reported to have active biological and chemical weapons programs, with one of the world's largest chemical weapons stockpiles according to U.S. official reports.

North Korea's chemical weapons arsenal includes mustard, phosgene, and sarin gas, with production capabilities of up to 4,500 metric tons in a typical year. They are not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention. North Korea's use of VX nerve agent to assassinate Kim Jong Nam in 2017 highlighted their chemical stockpile. The U.S. intelligence community believes North Korea has a longstanding biological weapons capability. South Korea and Japan would be the most likely targets if North Korea were to use chemical weapons. The assassination of Kim Jong Nam in a Malaysian airport in March 2017 brought attention to North Korea's chemical stockpile. The U.S. intelligence community believes North Korea has a longstanding biological weapons capability, including anthrax and smallpox. North Korea's proliferation of WMD and missile-related technology is a serious concern. North Korea has a munitions production capacity that could be used to weaponize biological agents like anthrax and smallpox. The country has also proliferated WMD and missile-related technology to several countries, including Egypt, Iran, Libya, Burma, Pakistan, Syria, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Sales of missiles and telemetric information from missile tests have been a key source of hard currency for the Kim regime. North Korea assisted Syria with building a nuclear reactor. North Korea's proliferation of WMD and missile technology is a serious concern for the United States. The country has sold missile parts and technology to various countries, including Egypt, Iran, Libya, Burma, Pakistan, Syria, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.

Additionally, North Korea and Iran have cooperated on missile development since the 1980s. China, Iran, and North Korea have collaborated on missile development, with China possibly assisting North Korea's missile program. Scientific advisors from Iran were observed in North Korea before a successful missile launch in December 2012. Additionally, the U.N. Panel of Experts reported transfers of chemical weapons-related materials from North Korea to Syria. Israel destroyed a Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007, suspected to be part of a nuclear weapons program. China, Iran, and North Korea have collaborated on missile development since the 1980s. Scientific advisors from Iran were seen in North Korea before a successful missile launch in December 2012. China may have assisted North Korea's missile program by selling heavy transport vehicles. The North Korean regime engages in illicit activities to earn hard currency, including selling heavy transport vehicles converted into missile launchers. They use a global network of entities for support and protection, involved in drug trafficking, counterfeit currency, and other illegal enterprises. The North Korean regime engages in illicit activities to earn hard currency, including drug trafficking, counterfeit currency, and other illegal enterprises. One agency, Office 39, oversees these activities, generating between $500 million and $1 billion per year. The North Korean regime, through agencies like Office 39, engages in illicit activities such as drug trafficking to earn foreign currency. Reports suggest they may generate $500 million to $1 billion annually. In 2013, individuals were arrested for attempting to smuggle North Korean methamphetamines into the US. Sanctions have led to increased production of illegal narcotics since August 2017. North Korea is involved in drug trafficking to earn foreign currency, with reports suggesting they generate $500 million to $1 billion annually. In 2013, Thai authorities arrested individuals conspiring to smuggle 100 kg of North Korean-origin methamphetamines into the US. It is unclear if these illicit activities are directed by state authorities or local criminal gangs. North Korea also sells cheap Cold War-era weapons. North Korea is involved in illicit activities to earn foreign currency, including drug trafficking and selling cheap Cold War-era weapons. Authorities seized a shipment of rocket-propelled grenades in 2016, allegedly destined for the Egyptian military. It is unclear if these activities are directed by state authorities or local criminal gangs. North Korea has sold arms and equipment to states in the Middle East and North Africa, cooperating with Iran and Syria. In 2016, a shipment of rocket-propelled grenades was seized outside the Suez Canal, allegedly destined for the Egyptian military. The regime uses front companies to conceal its illicit dealings and access the international financial system. North Korea cooperates with Iran and Syria, developing ballistic missiles and shipping weapons. The regime uses front companies in China to mask its illicit dealings and keep earnings in overseas bank accounts, avoiding repatriation to North Korea. Some Chinese companies assist North Korean regime by keeping earnings in overseas bank accounts, avoiding repatriation to North Korea. US government sanctions companies working on behalf of North Korea. In one case, a Chinese company used over 20 front companies in the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong to conduct transactions for a sanctioned North Korean bank in U.S. dollars. The U.S. government has been sanctioning companies working on behalf of North Korea, such as banning the Bank of Dandong from the U.S. financial system in November 2017 for facilitating illicit North Korean financial activity. In November 2017, the U.S. Treasury Department banned Chinese bank Bank of Dandong for facilitating illicit North Korean financial activity. This action was similar to the 2005 case involving Banco Delta Asia in Macau, which was identified for distributing North Korean counterfeit currency and laundering money for criminal enterprises. $24 million in North Korean accounts with Banco Delta Asia were frozen, leading to a North Korean boycott of Six-Party Talks until the funds were returned. The U.S. Treasury Department banned Bank of Dandong for aiding North Korean financial activities, similar to the 2005 case with Banco Delta Asia. $24 million in North Korean accounts were frozen, leading to a boycott of Six-Party Talks. North Korea's human rights record has been a concern, with Congress passing bills and holding hearings on the topic. Reports highlight ongoing extreme human rights abuses in North Korea. The U.S. Treasury Department banned Bank of Dandong for aiding North Korean financial activities, freezing $24 million in North Korean accounts. Congress has passed bills and held hearings on North Korea's abysmal human rights record, highlighting extreme abuses and a total denial of liberties by the regime. Reports stress the lack of freedoms of speech, press, assembly, an independent judiciary, and the right to choose government. The reports highlight the pattern of extreme human rights abuses by the North Korean regime, including a total denial of political, civil, and religious liberties. Citizens face severe physical abuse for violating laws, with reports of prison camps housing political prisoners and their families. Reports detail the extensive ideological indoctrination and severe physical abuse faced by North Korean citizens. There are multiple prison camps (kwanliso) holding around 100,000 political prisoners, with harsh conditions leading to high mortality rates. The kwanliso camps in North Korea hold 5,000 to 50,000 political prisoners each, with reports of harsh conditions leading to high mortality rates. A Commission of Inquiry found that close to 400,000 prisoners perished in captivity due to starvation, disease, executions, and torture. According to a UN Commission of Inquiry, around 400,000 prisoners died in North Korea's harsh camps due to starvation, disease, executions, and torture. The number of political prisoners has decreased, likely due to high mortality rates in the camps. The UN has been a key advocate for human rights in North Korea. The United Nations has been actively addressing human rights violations in North Korea, with a focus on the conditions of political prisoners. The establishment of the Special Rapporteur and the Commission of Inquiry in 2013 highlights the ongoing efforts to investigate and report on the country's human rights situation. The UN established the Special Rapporteur and the Commission of Inquiry in 2013 to address human rights violations in North Korea, focusing on inhumane conditions and crimes against humanity. The Commission of Inquiry (COI) was established by the UN in 2013 to investigate human rights violations in North Korea, specifically focusing on crimes against humanity. The COI conducted public hearings to gather information and concluded that the North Korean regime had committed \"crimes against humanity,\" recommending that the situation be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC). In 2014, the UN General Assembly voted for a resolution urging the UN Security Council to take action. The COI concluded that North Korea committed \"crimes against humanity\" and recommended referring the situation to the ICC. Despite a resolution in 2014 urging action, China and Russia have prevented further steps. In 2017, the UN Human Rights Council established a repository for evidence of human rights violations in North Korea. In 2017, the U.N. Human Rights Council established a repository to archive evidence of North Korea's human rights violations, potentially for future prosecution. Tens of thousands of North Koreans have fled to China over the past two decades, facing persecution and evading Chinese security forces. The U.N. Human Rights Council established a repository to archive evidence of North Korea's human rights violations for potential prosecution. Tens of thousands of North Koreans have fled to China over the past two decades, facing persecution and evading Chinese security forces, often becoming victims of further abuse and human trafficking. If repatriated, they risk harsh punishment or execution. The UNHCR has not been granted access to conduct a systematic survey. Reports indicate that many women and children are victims of human trafficking, particularly women lured to China seeking a better life but forced into marriage or prostitution. Some refugees who escape to China make their way to Southeast Asia, seeking passage to a third country, usually South Korea, where all North Korean defectors receive citizenship. Over 30,000 North Koreans have settled in South Korea. In recent years, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined, with 1,127 defectors arriving in 2017, a 21% decrease from the previous year. This decrease may be attributed to tightened border patrols. In recent years, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined, with 1,127 defectors arriving in 2017\u2014a 21% decrease from 2016, possibly due to tightened border patrols. Elite defections in 2016 highlighted a changing demographic profile of defectors, with an increase in defectors with good songbun. The changing demographic profile of North Korean defectors has shifted towards those with good songbun, reflecting increased border security. Diplomats, responsible for earning foreign currency, may choose to defect if unable to meet expectations. Elite defectors are likely to face consequences if caught. The changing profile of North Korean defectors reflects increased border security. Diplomats are now responsible for earning foreign currency and procuring illicit goods for the regime, leading some to defect. Elite defectors face harsh consequences if caught, with many fleeing to China where thousands are in hiding. China has been criticized for repatriating defectors back to North Korea. Many North Korean defectors flee to China, where thousands are in hiding. China has been criticized for repatriating defectors back to North Korea, with accusations of aiding crimes against humanity. China has been criticized for repatriating North Korean defectors back to their country, with accusations of aiding crimes against humanity. The COI's chair suggested Chinese officials could be complicit in these actions, while China's representative to the U.N. Human Rights Council dismissed the COI report as detached from reality. China has intensified its crackdown on North Korean refugees, repatriating them despite violating the U.N. Refugee Convention. They are labeled as \"illegal economic migrants\" and deported under the Mutual Cooperation Protocol for the Work of Maintaining National Security. China's repatriation policy for North Korean defectors violates the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention. The Chinese government considers them \"illegal economic migrants\" and deports them, based on a repatriation treaty with North Korea. Assisting the refugees is also illegal in China. China's repatriation policy for North Korean defectors violates the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention. Beijing considers them \"illegal economic migrants\" and deports them based on a repatriation treaty with North Korea. Assisting the refugees in any way is also illegal in China. Despite facing imprisonment, torture, and executions upon return to North Korea, Beijing maintains its policy to uphold China-North Korea ties. If political refugees reach foreign embassies or consulates, Beijing allows them to leave the country. Despite the risks North Korean defectors face, Beijing maintains its policy of repatriation to uphold ties with North Korea. China fears destabilization from allowing refugees in and treats the issue seriously, similar to how North Korea views Taiwan. The Chinese government treats the refugee issue seriously, fearing that allowing refugees into China could lead to North Korean defections, destabilize northeastern provinces, and potentially cause the collapse of the North Korean regime. In 2004, Congress passed the North Korean Human Rights Act to support human rights efforts and improve information flow in North Korea. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) was passed in 2004 to support human rights efforts and improve information flow in North Korea. It authorized new funds and called for U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance to be linked to human rights improvements in the country. The act also required the appointment of a Special Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea, a position that was later folded into the responsibilities of the Under Secretary of State. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) passed in 2004 called for U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance to be tied to human rights improvements in North Korea. It mandated the appointment of a Special Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea, a position later integrated into the Under Secretary of State's responsibilities. The act allows North Koreans to seek asylum in the U.S., with the State Department facilitating their applications. Congress reauthorized the NKHRA in 2008, 2012, and 2018, making adjustments each time. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) mandates asylum applications for North Koreans in the U.S. Congress reauthorized the act in 2008, 2012, and 2018, enhancing efforts for refugee resettlement and processing. The North Korean Human Rights Act was reauthorized by Congress in 2018, emphasizing increased freedom of information into North Korea and efforts to resettle North Korean refugees in the United States and third countries. President Trump signed the bill into law on July 20, 2018. Analysts have raised concerns about North Korea's overseas workers. H.R. 2061 focused on increasing freedom of information in North Korea, including distributing media devices and providing instructions for radio broadcasts. President Trump signed the bill into law on July 20, 2018. Analysts have highlighted North Korea's overseas workers and their working conditions, as well as how the regime uses them to generate hard currency. The State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report consistently mentions North Korea's overseas labor program. The State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report has consistently cited North Korea's overseas-labor program, highlighting the laborers' working conditions and how the regime uses them to generate hard currency. Many North Korean laborers working abroad face conditions of forced labor, living and working under exploitative conditions akin to \"state-sponsored slavery.\" Their families remain in North Korea, and government minders monitor them while they are overseas. Overseas North Korean laborers, under bilateral contracts with foreign governments, endure exploitative conditions akin to \"state-sponsored slavery.\" They work long hours, with the regime taking a significant portion of their earnings, contributing millions to billions of dollars annually to the regime's coffers.
