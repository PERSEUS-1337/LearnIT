    "content": "Federal job training and employment programs aim to connect vulnerable youth to work and school, focusing on low-income individuals with barriers to employment. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and related services for unemployed and underemployed individuals, including youth. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-220) provides job training and related services for unemployed and underemployed individuals, including youth. It includes programs for job training, adult education, employment services, and vocational rehabilitation. Youth job training programs are authorized under Title I and carried out by the Department of Labor, including the WIA Youth Activities formula program, Job Corps, and YouthBuild. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 authorizes job training programs for youth under Title I, administered by the Department of Labor. These programs include WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild, aiming to connect youth to educational and employment opportunities, leadership development, and community service activities. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 authorizes job training programs for youth under Title I, administered by the Department of Labor. These programs include WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild, aiming to connect youth to educational and employment opportunities, leadership development, and community service activities. WIA programs continue to be funded through annual appropriation acts, with potential reauthorization in the near future. This report provides an overview of issues pertinent to the WIA youth programs, particularly Youth Activities and Job Corps. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 authorizes job training programs for youth under Title I, including WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild. Funding for WIA programs continues through annual appropriation acts, with potential reauthorization in the near future. This report discusses issues related to WIA youth programs, focusing on Youth Activities and Job Corps, as well as relevant provisions of H.R. 803 and S. 1356. The report discusses job training and employment services for youth under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, including WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild. It also mentions two bills: H.R. 803 and S. 1356, which address youth programs and services. The HELP Committee on July 31, 2013 discussed job training and employment services for youth under WIA, including WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants (YOG). YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants (YOG) are job training programs under WIA. Congress continues to fund youth job training programs, except for YOG which has not been funded since FY2003. The YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants (YOG) programs were funded through FY2003 to provide job training services in low-income communities. Congress continues to appropriate funds for youth job training programs, except for YOG which has not been funded since FY2003. Job Corps is administered separately by ETA's Office of Job Corps. Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program, and Youth Opportunity Grants are programs funded by Congress for job training services in low-income communities. Except for YOG, all programs are managed by DOL's Employment and Training Administration. Each program aims to connect low-income youth to educational and employment opportunities, with YouthBuild specifically targeting high school dropouts. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program and Youth Opportunity Grants focus on connecting low-income youth to educational and employment opportunities. YouthBuild targets high school dropouts, while the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program focuses on youth offenders and those at risk of dropping out. Each program provides employment and educational services differently. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program and Youth Opportunity Grants target low-income youth for educational and employment opportunities. YouthBuild focuses on high school dropouts, while the program for youth offenders and those at risk of dropping out provides different services. Youth in the programs receive mentoring, follow-up, and engage in construction-related activities. Job Corps offers residential services for youth participants. Local areas (WIBs) must provide 10 specific elements, including mentoring and follow-up, to youth in the program. YouthBuild participants engage in construction work. Job Corps offers residential services. Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program activities vary and can include mentoring, educational services, and reentry services for youth. Programs are funded differently by DOL. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program offers various activities for youth, including mentoring, educational services, and reentry services. The program is funded differently by the Department of Labor (DOL), which allocates funding based on a formula to states and local Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). DOL also partners with nonprofit and for-profit organizations to operate Job Corps centers and cooperates with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service for Job Corps activities. The Department of Labor (DOL) allocates funding for Youth Activities to states based on a formula, which is then distributed to local Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). DOL partners with nonprofit and for-profit organizations to operate Job Corps centers and cooperates with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service for Job Corps programs. YouthBuild and the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program competitively award grants to organizations and communities. For more information on these programs, refer to CRS Report R40929, Vulnerable Youth: Employment and Job Training Programs. The USDA Forest Service partners with the Department of Labor to carry out Job Corps programs on USDA lands. YouthBuild and the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program competitively award grants to nonprofit organizations and local communities. Congress has taken steps towards reauthorizing the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) youth programs, with recent hearings addressing various issues. The Senate HELP Committee held listening sessions in April 2009 to highlight the positive aspects of WIA and to seek improvements. During the 111th Congress, the Senate HELP Committee held listening sessions in April 2009 to address positive aspects of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) youth programs and potential improvements, focusing on the Youth Activities grant program. Youth advocates, researchers, and stakeholders discussed ways to refine the law for program enhancement. During the 111th Congress, discussions were held to address positive aspects of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) youth programs and potential improvements. Stakeholders focused on refining the law for program enhancement. Subsequently, hearings were conducted in July and October 2009 to update WIA to meet the demands of a changing economy and address declining youth employment. During the 112th Congress, hearings were held to discuss updating the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) to meet the demands of a changing economy and address declining youth employment. The House Education and Workforce Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training focused on removing inefficiencies in job training programs and modernizing WIA in May and October 2011. A hearing on reauthorizing WIA, the Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2012 (H.R. 4297), took place in April 2012. During the 112th Congress, hearings were held to update the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) and address declining youth employment. The House Education and Workforce Subcommittee focused on removing inefficiencies in job training programs and modernizing WIA in 2011. A bill to reauthorize WIA, the Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2012 (H.R. 4297), was discussed in April 2012. In the 113th Congress, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce continued discussions on WIA. During the 112th Congress, hearings were held to update the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) and address declining youth employment. The House Education and Workforce Subcommittee focused on removing inefficiencies in job training programs and modernizing WIA in 2011. A bill to reauthorize WIA, the Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2012 (H.R. 4297), was discussed in April 2012. In the 113th Congress, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce continued discussions on WIA. In the 113th Congress, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce ordered reported H.R. 803 \u2014the Supporting Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong Skills Act (SKILLS Act) introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce ordered reported H.R. 803, the SKILLS Act, introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx. The bill was passed by the House and introduced in the Senate as the Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356). The House Committee on Education and the Workforce ordered reported H.R. 803, the SKILLS Act, introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx. The bill was passed by the House on March 15, 2013. In the Senate, Senators introduced the Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) on July 24, 2013. Issues raised in the WIA reauthorization process include consolidating workforce programs for adults. The Senate HELP Committee marked up S. 1356, the Workforce Investment Act of 2013, on July 31, 2013, and ordered the bill reported by a vote of 18 to 3. Issues in the WIA reauthorization process include proposals to consolidate workforce programs for adults, dislocated workers, and youth, with advocates citing increased efficiency and cost savings. Consolidating workforce programs for adults, dislocated workers, and youth could lead to increased efficiency and cost savings. However, there are concerns that at-risk youth and other vulnerable groups may be overlooked if programs are collectively funded. Coordination between the workforce system and other systems serving youth is also a key issue to address. If workforce programs are consolidated, there is a concern that groups with barriers to employment, such as at-risk youth, may be overlooked. Coordination between the workforce system and other systems serving youth is crucial to meet their varied needs and ensure the effectiveness of youth workforce programs. Members of Congress and stakeholders continue to question the impact and effectiveness of these programs. Stakeholders suggest greater coordination between workforce and education systems to meet youth needs as intended by WIA. Congress is interested in evaluating the effectiveness of youth workforce programs, with only Job Corps impact evaluation completed so far. DOL awarded a contract for an impact evaluation of YouthBuild. Congress also focuses on specific issues in Youth Activities and Job Corps. The impact evaluation of YouthBuild is underway after Job Corps evaluation. Congress is concerned about eligibility requirements for Youth Activities program under WIA, as some needy youth may be excluded due to income verification challenges. The Youth Activities program under WIA has sparked discussions on eligibility requirements, particularly regarding income verification challenges for needy youth. Some argue that requirements are necessary to ensure enrollment of vulnerable young people, while others question the emphasis on serving older youth. The ARRA temporarily allowed youth ages 22 through 24 to access services. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily allowed youth ages 22 through 24 to access services under the Youth Activities program. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the program's emphasis on serving older youth and the school status of participants. Reauthorization legislation could address targeting older youth and potential costs. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily allowed youth ages 22 through 24 to access services under the Youth Activities program. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the program's emphasis on serving older youth and the school status of participants. Reauthorization legislation could address targeting older youth and potential costs. Congress has considered proposals to provide federal funding for states to operate Job Corps centers or to close them due to mixed program results. The program's focus on out-of-school youth and age eligibility is being debated in Congress. Concerns about Job Corps centers' mixed performance have led to proposals to provide federal funding or close centers. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office highlighted overlap in federal workforce programs. The 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office identified overlap in federal workforce programs, noting differences in services and populations served. GAO recommended improvements for the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services. The Government Accountability Office recommended consolidating administration of selected workforce programs to address overlap and differences in services and populations served. The Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services are recommended to consolidate administration of selected workforce programs, including the Employment Service and employment and training services under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Legislation in the 113th Congress aims to consolidate various workforce programs, including those for youth. The Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2013 (H.R. 803) aims to consolidate multiple workforce programs, including Youth Activities, YouthBuild, and Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, into a single Workforce Investment Fund (WIF) allocated to states for employment and training activities. Job Corps would remain separate, with substantive changes proposed in the bill. The Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2013 aims to consolidate various workforce programs into a single Workforce Investment Fund allocated to states for employment and training activities. Job Corps would remain separate, with significant changes proposed in the bill, including providing \"work ready services\" in the one-stop delivery system. The bill proposes substantive changes to the Workforce Investment Program, including required \"work ready services\" in the one-stop delivery system. These services would encompass existing core and intensive services, as well as additional offerings like internships. State allocations would be based on factors such as the number of disadvantaged youth, with funding distributed to local workforce areas after setting aside 15% at the state level. The bill proposes changes to the Workforce Investment Program, including adding internship and work experience services at one-stop centers. Funding allocation to states would be based on factors like the number of disadvantaged youth. States must set aside funding for a competitive grant program for individuals with barriers to employment, including low-income youth aged 16 and older. The bill proposes changes to the Workforce Investment Program, including adding internship and work experience services at one-stop centers. States would be required to set aside funding from the WIF for a competitive grant program for low-income youth aged 16 and older with barriers to employment. Grants could be awarded to local boards or nonprofits to provide employment and training services. State and local workforce investment boards must describe strategies and services in their plans. The bill proposes changes to the Workforce Investment Program, including adding internship and work experience services at one-stop centers. States would set aside funding for a competitive grant program for low-income youth aged 16 and older with barriers to employment. Grants could be awarded to local boards or nonprofits to provide employment and training services, with a focus on assisting at-risk and out-of-school youth in acquiring education, skills, credentials, and employment experience for success in the labor market. The bill proposes changes to the Workforce Investment Program, including adding internship and work experience services at one-stop centers. States would set aside funding for a competitive grant program for low-income youth aged 16 and older with barriers to employment. Grants could be awarded to local boards or nonprofits to provide employment and training services, focusing on assisting at-risk and out-of-school youth in acquiring education, skills, credentials, and employment experience for success in the labor market. \"At-risk youth\" are defined as those ages 16 through 24 who are low-income. The bill aims to provide internship and dropout recovery activities for at-risk youth aged 16-24, including low-income individuals, high school dropouts, youth in foster care, offenders, those with disabilities, children of incarcerated parents, and migrant youth. This is part of consolidating workforce programs to eliminate duplicative and ineffective programs. At the March 6, 2013 markup of H.R. 803, Chairman Kline emphasized consolidating workforce programs to eliminate duplicative and ineffective programs. Concerns have been raised about the proposed Workforce Innovation Fund (WIF) potentially serving fewer youth due to lack of specific funding allocation. The proposed Workforce Innovation Fund (WIF) aims to consolidate workforce programs to eliminate duplicative and ineffective programs, with concerns raised about potential reduced youth services. S. 1356 would maintain existing youth programs and establish Youth Innovation and Replication Grants (YIRG) for states and localities to develop career pathways. S. 1356 aims to maintain existing youth programs and establish Youth Innovation and Replication Grants (YIRG) for states and localities to develop career pathways. Congress may need to consider the role of one-stop centers in serving youth if programs are consolidated with other workforce programs. One-stop centers facilitate connections to job training, employment, and services for youth and adults in a community. Nearly 20 federal programs currently provide services through the one-stop system. These centers offer various services to youth, as highlighted in a 2002 GAO report on the Youth Activities program. One-stop centers provide services to adults and youth in a community, including those ineligible for the WIA Youth program. Various methods are used to attract youth to these centers, such as active recruitment, dedicated youth program staff, and youth-focused training for one-stop staff. Some local areas face challenges in attracting youth to these centers. Some one-stop centers use different methods to attract youth, including active recruitment, dedicated youth program staff, and youth-focused training for one-stop staff. However, some areas struggle to attract youth to these centers, with many only coming if referred or brought by schools or other service providers. Stakeholders recommend that one-stops should cater more to youth and improve training. Local areas face challenges attracting youth to one-stop centers, with many only coming if referred or brought by schools or other service providers. Stakeholders recommend that one-stops should cater more to youth and improve training for service professionals on youth matters. DOL has encouraged centers to target youth by providing funding for planning projects and guidance on enhancing youth connections to the delivery system. DOL has encouraged one-stop centers to target youth by providing funding for planning projects and guidance on enhancing youth connections to the delivery system. This includes methods such as co-locating youth program staff at the center, cross-training staff, and customizing facilities to be more \"youth-friendly.\" Under H.R. 803 and S. 1356, states would be required to continue funding one-stop centers to provide job search and other assistance for youth. The bills do not specify how youth would be served at these centers, but suggest methods like co-locating youth program staff, cross-training staff, and customizing facilities to be more \"youth-friendly.\" Youth councils may also play a role in the possible consolidation of youth services. The bills H.R. 803 and S. 1356 require states to fund one-stop centers for youth, without specifying how youth would be served. Youth councils, currently part of local Workforce Investment Boards, play a role in developing workforce plans for eligible youth. The role of youth councils is to consolidate youth efforts in developing workforce plans for eligible youth. Members include representatives from various agencies and parents seeking assistance through WIA's grant programs. The National Youth Employment Coalition (NYEC) represents youth interests. The National Youth Employment Coalition (NYEC) has documented challenges faced by youth councils in developing beyond advisory roles to Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). GAO's 2002 report also identified difficulties in establishing youth councils, including issues with youth and parent participation. The National Youth Employment Coalition (NYEC) and GAO have identified challenges faced by youth councils in developing beyond advisory roles to Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). Issues include difficulties in establishing youth councils due to lack of youth or parent participation, often caused by transportation or conflicting schedules. A 2002 report for DOL highlighted \"enabling conditions\" that help innovative youth councils develop comprehensive systems for youth activities. Some councils faced challenges in getting youth or parents to participate due to transportation or scheduling issues. A 2002 report for DOL identified key conditions for successful youth councils, including an established intermediary organization, strong school-to-career partnerships, and pre-existing infrastructure. The key conditions for successful youth councils include an established intermediary organization, a strong school-to-career partnership, and a pre-existing community-wide planning process. Stakeholders have suggested a stronger role for youth councils to enable them to have a greater impact. Stakeholders recommend a stronger role for youth councils, suggesting greater flexibility in partner selection and priority setting. They also propose that councils develop a comprehensive youth plan to coordinate activities and consolidate funding streams. Stakeholders recommend giving youth councils more flexibility in partner selection and priority setting. Legislation may make youth councils optional and not require youth representation on local workforce boards, but state boards would still need youth representatives. H.R. 803 in the 113th Congress would make youth councils optional and not require youth representation on local workforce boards, but state boards would still need youth representatives. State and local workforce investment boards would be required to address the needs of vulnerable youth in their plans. S. 1356 would require local workforce development boards to establish standing committees for the one-stop system, youth services, and disability services. The youth committee must include community-based organizations serving eligible youth. The bill requires local workforce development boards to establish standing committees for the one-stop system, youth services, and disability services. The youth committee must include community-based organizations with a proven track record in serving eligible youth. Existing entities can fulfill the requirements for standing committees if they meet the necessary criteria. Congress may consider best practices from existing youth councils in deciding the fate of the councils. The bill requires local workforce development boards to establish standing committees for the one-stop system, youth services, and disability services. Existing entities can fulfill the requirements for standing committees if they meet the necessary criteria. Congress may consider best practices from existing youth councils in deciding the fate of the councils. Coordination between the workforce system and education system is a concern for youth workforce programs. WIA includes provisions to facilitate this coordination. Youth councils facilitate youth workforce activities and coordinate with educational agencies. WIA includes provisions for coordination between the workforce and education system. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIA) requires coordination between workforce and education systems, with local boards including representatives from education entities. Stakeholders suggest that greater coordination can meet youth's multiple needs as intended by WIA, utilizing existing infrastructure like one-stop centers and youth councils. This issue was discussed at a Senate HELP Committee's listening session on WIA and youth in 2004. Some stakeholders suggest that existing WIA infrastructure like one-stop centers and youth councils can help meet the multiple needs of youth as intended by WIA. A 2004 report by the Government Accountability Office highlighted areas where workforce and education systems can improve collaboration, including examining entities local WIBs contract with to provide services to youth. The 2004 report by the Government Accountability Office identified ways in which the workforce and education systems collaborate and areas for improvement, including partnerships with local entities to provide services to youth under the Youth Activities program. Some educators were hesitant to partner despite about half of all youth receiving services through various organizations. The Government Accountability Office's 2004 report highlighted that despite about half of all youth receiving services under the Youth Activities program, some education entities were cautious about partnering due to perceived inconsistencies with schools' academic mission. For instance, in Wisconsin, schools hesitated to allow WIA Youth Activities on school grounds, fearing stigma associated with targeting at-risk youth. The vision for providing comprehensive youth development services to at-risk youth clashed with schools' academic mission. Some schools in Wisconsin were hesitant to allow WIA Youth Activities on school grounds due to the perceived stigma of targeting at-risk youth. At a July 2009 hearing, officials from the Department of Labor and Department of Education testified about their commitment to collaborating for youth development. At a July 2009 hearing, officials from the Department of Labor and Department of Education testified about their commitment to collaborating for youth development, specifically focusing on at-risk youth. They mentioned past collaboration on programs like the School-to-Work (STW) program, which provided grants for education and workforce activities. The collaboration between the Department of Labor (DOL) and Department of Education (ED) aims to ensure that youth receive necessary services and support. The School-to-Work (STW) program, a past joint effort, provided grants for work-based learning, school-based learning, and job training. Lessons from the STW program can inform Congress about successful partnerships between education and workforce systems. H.R. 803 is the reauthorization legislation related to this collaboration. The grants supported programs combining work-based learning in schools, school-based learning in the workplace, and job training. Lessons from the STW program can inform Congress about successful partnerships between education and workforce systems. H.R. 803 includes provisions for coordination of workforce and education systems, but it is not explicit. The reauthorization legislation passed by the House on March 15, 2013 includes provisions for coordination of workforce and education systems, allowing local areas to include education officials on the local workforce investment board. This could facilitate strategies and services to assist youth in acquiring education and skills for the labor market. The local plan under H.R. 803 requires local areas to identify strategies and services to assist youth in acquiring education and skills for the labor market, potentially improving coordination between workforce and education systems. The Senate bill S. 1356 also addresses coordination with the education system, requiring states to submit a Unified State Plan every four years covering Youth Activities and other programs authorized under Titles I. The Senate bill S. 1356 requires states to submit a Unified State Plan every four years that covers various workforce and education programs authorized under Titles I and II of WIA. The plan must include an analysis of state economic conditions and goals for preparing a skilled workforce. The Unified State Plan required by the Senate bill S. 1356 covers workforce and education programs authorized under Titles I and II of WIA, including adult activities, dislocated workers, adult education, employment service, and vocational rehabilitation programs. It must include an analysis of state economic conditions and goals for preparing a skilled workforce, with a focus on youth programs. The current law allows states to submit a unified plan covering workforce and education programs under WIA Title I and Title II, including youth programs. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of youth programs under WIA in serving at-risk youth. Evaluations of Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs are limited. Performance measures are needed to assess these programs. The evaluation of youth programs under WIA, including Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild, is limited. The programs have met or exceeded their goals under a common set of performance measures. Section 172 of WIA requires continuous evaluation of these programs. The three programs under WIA, including Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild, have met or exceeded their performance measure goals. Section 172 of WIA mandates continuous evaluation of these programs to assess their effectiveness and cost efficiency. Additionally, DOL is required to conduct multi-site control group evaluations by the end of FY2005. The evaluations of programs and activities authorized under Title I of WIA are required to assess their effectiveness and cost efficiency. Legislation from the 113th Congress would mandate independent evaluations of these programs every five years. Limited information exists on the overall effectiveness of these programs, as highlighted in a 2011 GAO report on workforce programs. The 113th Congress's WIA reauthorization legislation, H.R. 803, would require DOL to conduct independent evaluations of WIA-funded programs every five years. A 2011 GAO report noted limited information on program effectiveness, with only 5 out of 47 programs undergoing impact studies since 2004. Rigorous impact studies involve randomly assigning individuals to treatment and control groups to determine program outcomes. Only 5 out of 47 identified programs have undergone impact studies since 2004 to determine program effectiveness. These studies involve randomly assigning individuals to treatment and control groups to assess outcomes. None of the programs studied were youth programs authorized under WIA, making it difficult for policymakers to determine their effectiveness. The GAO report identified 5 programs that have not been formally evaluated for effectiveness, including the Youth Activities program. Limited information makes it challenging for policymakers to assess the impacts of these programs. The Department of Labor has conducted some studies on program implementation but not on participant impacts. The Youth Activities program has not been formally evaluated for impacts on participants. A few studies have focused on program implementation. The Department of Labor is conducting an impact evaluation of YouthBuild, with initial results expected in 2015. The Department of Labor is conducting an impact evaluation of YouthBuild, which will randomly assign youth to the program or a control group. Initial results on the program's impact on youth employment and other outcomes are expected in 2015. Additionally, DOL completed a process evaluation of the Job Corps program to identify center practices associated with performance measures such as job placement rate and post-program earnings. The evaluation of center practices associated with performance measures like job placement rate and post-program earnings included a survey of centers and program management data. It examined practices in general center management, academic training, Career Technical Training, student life, staff dynamics, center oversight, and community relations. Strong performance was linked to certain common factors. The study examined center practices in areas such as general management, academic training, Career Technical Training, student life, staff dynamics, oversight, and community relations. Strong performance was associated with robust student support, staff accountability, and strong partner relationships. The most recent impact evaluation for Job Corps is outdated, dating back to the late 1990s and early 2000s. The recent impact evaluation for Job Corps, conducted in the late 1990s through the early 2000s, found positive outcomes in education and employment for youth enrolled in the program. A follow-up report analyzed longer-term impacts on earnings and employment rates. The evaluation of Job Corps for youth ages 16-24 showed positive outcomes in education and employment. A follow-up study found that while the positive employment effects diminished over time, there were increased earnings for youth aged 20-24. The research found that positive employment effects diminished over time for youth ages 26-34 in the program. However, older youth aged 20-24 at the time of application saw increased earnings. YouthBuild program benefits for older youth outweighed the costs. WIA specifies performance measures for Youth Activities and Job Corps, and directs the DOL Secretary to identify measures for YouthBuild. The discussion includes an overview of performance measures for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs. Concerns have been raised about disincentives for serving youth with barriers to employment. H.R. 803, the WIA reauthorization, addresses these issues. The discussion provides an overview of performance measures for the YouthBuild program and addresses concerns about disincentives for serving youth with barriers to employment. H.R. 803, the WIA reauthorization bill, aims to eliminate current youth core performance measures and introduce new indicators for individuals participating in activities funded under the Workforce Investment Fund. The WIA reauthorization bill, H.R. 803, would replace current youth core performance measures with new indicators for individuals in the Workforce Investment Fund program. The proposed indicators include entry into unsubsidized employment, retention in unsubsidized employment, change in earnings, and attainment of postsecondary credentials. The Workforce Investment Fund program measures entry into unsubsidized employment, retention in unsubsidized employment, change in earnings, attainment of postsecondary credentials, participation in education or training programs, and employment in a related field. S. 1356 establishes six performance indicators for eligible youth in WIA Youth Activities program, including entry into education, training, or employment, retention in these activities, earnings for employed youth, and attainment of postsecondary credentials or secondary school diploma. S. 1356 establishes six performance indicators for eligible youth in activities funded by the WIA Youth Activities program, including entry into education, training, or employment, retention in these activities, earnings for employed youth, attainment of postsecondary credentials or secondary school diploma, participation in education or training programs leading to a recognized credential or employment, and program effectiveness in serving employers. States may also require additional performance indicators, and the DOL Secretary must establish performance measures for Job Corps centers. The DOL Secretary must establish performance measures for Job Corps center operators based on six indicators for eligible youth in WIA Youth Activities program. States may require additional performance indicators for program effectiveness in serving employers. Performance measures for Job Corps center operators are based on the six indicators of performance for youth eligible under Youth Activities in WIA. These measures are part of the accountability system to assess the effectiveness of states and local areas in achieving continuous improvement of workforce investment activities funded under this subtitle. Under WIA, state performance measures are used to assess the effectiveness of states and local areas in improving workforce investment activities. Core indicators for youth ages 14-18 include basic skills and secondary school diplomas. Under WIA, state performance measures for youth ages 14-18 and 19-21 include basic skills, secondary school diplomas, postsecondary education, employment entry, retention, earnings, and credential attainment negotiated with DOL. Under WIA, state performance measures for youth ages 14-18 and 19-21 include basic skills, secondary school diplomas, postsecondary education, employment entry, retention, earnings, and credential attainment negotiated with DOL. Stakeholders have raised concerns that performance measures may not fully capture the progress of at-risk youth, potentially leading programs to focus on higher-functioning individuals to meet targets. Performance measures in WIA Section 136 are determined through negotiation between states and DOL. Stakeholders argue that these measures may not accurately reflect the progress of at-risk youth, leading programs to prioritize higher-functioning individuals to meet targets. Some local programs funded with Youth Activities dollars only accept youth at specific grade levels to ensure goal achievement. DOL officials are aware of these issues. In 2008, the Government Accountability Office reported that some local programs funded with Youth Activities dollars only accepted youth at specific grade levels to help them meet performance targets. The Department of Labor issued guidance in 2010 to address concerns that program contracts were unintentionally discouraging lower-skilled youth from participating. In response to concerns raised in 2008, the Department of Labor issued guidance in 2010 to address program contracts that unintentionally discouraged lower-skilled youth from participating. The guidance focused on strategies such as multiyear contracting and using real-time indicators to better serve youth in need. The Department of Labor issued guidance in 2010 to state workforce agencies on strategies to help service providers serve youth most in need while meeting performance goals. The guidance focused on six key strategies, including multiyear contracting, using real-time indicators, and creating positive incentives for providers to enroll and serve at-risk youth. The Department of Labor issued guidance in 2010 on strategies to help service providers serve at-risk youth while meeting performance goals. The guidance included using real-time indicators, factoring participant characteristics into goal negotiations, creating positive incentives for providers, and encouraging interagency collaboration. The GAO suggested using common measures across programs to assess provider performance. The 2010 Department of Labor guidance encouraged local Workforce Investment Boards to adopt real-time indicators for at-risk youth services, promote interagency collaboration, and use common measures to assess provider performance. The 2010 DOL guidance encourages local WIBs to use common measures like changes in attitudes, behaviors, knowledge, and skills for youth programs. These indicators can show learning gains, grade improvements, or increased retention rates in alternative education activities. The 2010 DOL guidance encourages using common measures like learning gains, grade improvements, and increased retention rates for youth programs. Suggestions have been made to adjust performance levels for serving higher-risk youth populations. Some recommendations suggest adjusting performance levels for workforce investment boards serving higher-risk youth populations, similar to the DOL guidance. Insights from the Job Training Partnership Act could inform adjustments for local areas serving the neediest youth. JTPA allowed for adjustments to national performance standards based on economic and demographic factors. Insights from the Job Training Partnership Act could inform adjustments for local areas serving the neediest youth by leveling the playing field across different geographic areas. Governors were able to adjust national performance standards for service delivery areas based on economic and demographic factors. The Job Training Partnership Act allowed governors to adjust national performance standards for service delivery areas (SDAs) based on economic and demographic factors. This process aimed to level the playing field across different geographic areas, with SDAs similar to local workforce investment boards. Performance metrics for Job Corps under WIA include more than 20 core measures covering outcomes like entered employment. Under JTPA, governors could adjust performance standards for SDAs to account for local conditions. WIA mandates Job Corps to establish over 20 core performance metrics, including entered employment and average wage. DOL has added 33 more metrics to evaluate program performance, developed from DOL policy and GPRA requirements. The Department of Labor (DOL) has implemented 33 additional performance metrics to assess the Job Corps program's outcomes, including entered employment, average wage, and retention in postsecondary education or employment. These measures were developed from DOL policy and the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requirements. A 2011 report by the DOL Office of the Inspector General raised concerns about how Job Corps has implemented its performance metrics. The DOL established requirements for agencies to set goals, measure performance, and report to Congress. A 2011 report raised concerns about Job Corps' implementation of performance metrics, citing inaccurate results, missing targets, and miscalculated costs. The office within ETA administering the program reported inaccurate results for some metrics, did not establish targets for others, and failed to publicly publish required results. They also miscalculated the cost per program participant. The YouthBuild program requires applicants to describe results for common performance indicators, as mandated by WIA Section 173A(c)(3)(B)(xii). The final regulation for YouthBuild, issued in February 2012, addresses performance indicators. The YouthBuild program requires applicants to describe results for common performance indicators as mandated by WIA Section 173A(c)(3)(B)(xii). The final regulation for YouthBuild, issued in February 2012, addresses performance indicators for grantees, including placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree or education, and literacy and numeracy gains. Additional indicators may be required by the Secretary. The final regulation for YouthBuild, issued in February 2012, outlines performance indicators for grantees, including placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree or education, and literacy and numeracy gains. DOL will provide details of the performance indicators in administrative guidance, with additional goals for the program such as retention rates. DOL will provide details of performance indicators in administrative guidance for YouthBuild grants, including retention and recidivism rates. The recidivism rate in the YouthBuild program is the percentage of participants re-arrested or re-incarcerated within one year of enrollment. Stakeholders are discussing eligibility requirements for youth in the program. Under H.R. 803, the reauthorization legislation passed by the House in March 2013, states and local areas would need strategies and services to assist at-risk youth, defined as low-income individuals facing barriers to employment. Stakeholders are debating eligibility criteria for the YouthBuild program, including the emphasis on serving out-of-school and older youth. Under H.R. 803, the reauthorization legislation passed by the House in March 2013, states and local areas would need strategies and services to assist at-risk youth, defined as low-income individuals facing barriers to employment. The program's emphasis on serving out-of-school and older youth is being debated. The Youth Activities formula program under H.R. 803 targets individuals with barriers to employment, including out-of-school youth aged 16-24. Eligibility criteria include being low-income and facing various challenges like basic literacy deficiencies, school dropout, homelessness, pregnancy, or involvement in the justice system. The program's focus on serving at-risk youth is a point of ongoing discussion. The WIA Youth program targets individuals aged 14-21 with barriers to employment, such as low-income status and various challenges like basic literacy deficiencies, school dropout, homelessness, pregnancy, or involvement in the justice system. There is ongoing debate about the need for youth to prove their low-income status for eligibility. The WIA Youth program faces challenges in verifying youth's low-income eligibility, as reported by state and local officials. Many eligible youth struggle to provide required documentation, diverting resources from direct services. State and local officials find it challenging to document a youth's income eligibility for the WIA Youth program. Many eligible youth struggle to provide necessary documentation, diverting resources from direct service delivery. According to GAO, state and local workforce officials noted challenges with youth providing required documentation for WIA program eligibility, potentially excluding needy youth. Youth may also struggle to prove eligibility under other WIA criteria, such as involvement in foster care or the juvenile justice system. Some youth face challenges providing required documentation for WIA program eligibility, including proving involvement in foster care or the juvenile justice system. States have requested waivers for certain eligibility criteria. Some states have requested waivers for certain eligibility criteria under the WIA program, but waivers for participant eligibility cannot be granted by the DOL. This poses challenges for youth who have been in foster care, the juvenile justice system, or are homeless in providing required documentation. Under WIA, DOL can waive certain requirements for states or local areas, but not for participant eligibility. States and local governments can establish their own policies for verifying eligibility, but stakeholders argue that WIA regulations do not allow flexibility in documenting income and eligibility. States and local governments have the authority to set their own policies for verifying eligibility under WIA regulations. Stakeholders argue that there is limited flexibility in documenting income and eligibility factors. Some states and localities prefer using eligibility criteria from WIA's predecessor, the Job Training Partnership Act. Eligibility for in-school youth includes qualification for the federal free lunch program or participation in a Title I program. Some states and localities preferred using certain eligibility criteria from WIA's predecessor, the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), for documenting income and other eligibility factors. In-school youth were eligible if they qualified for the federal free lunch program or participated in a Title I program for low-income school districts. Out-of-school youth were eligible if they met the definition of \"economically disadvantaged.\" The program under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act targets low-income school districts. Youth eligible if economically disadvantaged or reside in high-poverty areas. Some suggest adding eligibility based on residency in high-poverty census tracts. Youth in Youth Opportunity grant program sites automatically eligible. Stakeholders propose including at-risk youth like dropouts. Some stakeholders propose expanding eligibility for at-risk youth in the WIA program, including dropouts, foster care youth, and homeless youth, without income requirements. The goal is to serve the most vulnerable youth, potentially by basing eligibility on means-tested programs like the free lunch program. Groups of at-risk youth, such as dropouts, foster care youth, homeless and runaway youth, and those not in school, should be eligible for WIA without income requirements. Stakeholders question if changing eligibility to means-tested programs would affect the number of eligible youth or if those with more opportunities would receive services. Another issue raised is whether the Youth Activities program should focus more on out-of-school youth. The Youth Activities program under WIA focuses on at-risk youth, including dropouts, foster care youth, and homeless/runaway youth. Stakeholders question if changing eligibility criteria to means-tested programs would impact the number of eligible youth. Additionally, there is a debate on whether the program should prioritize out-of-school youth, as required by WIA. The WIA Youth Activities program focuses on out-of-school youth, with at least 30% of funds allocated for this group. However, local programs face challenges in recruiting and retaining these youth, as it is more costly to serve them compared to in-school youth. Maintaining contact with out-of-school youth is also reported as difficult by local officials. The 2002 and 2004 reports highlighted challenges in recruiting and retaining out-of-school youth in local youth programs funded by the WIA Youth Activities program. Serving out-of-school youth is twice as costly as serving in-school youth, and maintaining contact with them is difficult. Stakeholders suggest allocating more WIA Youth funding to dropouts and high-risk youth, even those in school. Some stakeholders recommend allocating a greater share of WIA Youth funding to dropouts and high-risk youth, including those who are not in school or lack enough credits to graduate. This prioritization was also proposed in prior legislation, which aimed to primarily serve out-of-school youth. Maintaining contact with out-of-school youth has been a challenge due to transportation difficulties. The organization focusing on workforce development issues suggests that WIA funds should prioritize youth not in school and in-school youth lacking enough credits to graduate. Some argue for maintaining current funding for out-of-school youth while increasing technical assistance for their needs. Flexibility in local decision-making is seen as crucial. The committee reports on bills addressing federal programs for in-school and out-of-school youth. Some argue for maintaining current funding for out-of-school youth but increasing technical assistance. Localities need flexibility in funding allocation. DOL has issued guidance on serving out-of-school and at-risk in-school youth. DOL has provided guidance to states and localities on serving out-of-school and at-risk in-school youth, recommending strong alternative education programs. Additionally, DOL funded Multiple Education Pathways Blueprint Grants to reconnect youth who have dropped out. DOL funded Multiple Education Pathways Blueprint Grants in FY2007, providing $3.4 million to seven midsize cities to reconnect out-of-school youth to education pathways. A 2004 report highlighted successful strategies in serving out-of-school youth, such as providing technical assistance and resources like Minnesota's list of resources. In 2004, a report for DOL addressed the implementation of WIA programs for out-of-school youth, highlighting successful strategies such as providing technical assistance and resources like Minnesota's list of resources. Some local areas also contracted with service providers experienced in working with out-of-school youth, focusing on GED or high school diploma programs and vocational training. The list of resources for out-of-school youth included articles, guides, and strategies used by Job Corps centers. Some local areas contracted with service providers for GED or high school diploma programs and vocational training. Youth aged 14-21 are eligible for WIA, with the age limit temporarily expanded to 24 under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to reach more unemployed young adults. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily expanded the age limit for WIA Youth services to 24 to reach more unemployed young adults. This change reflects the trend of young people taking longer to transition to adulthood due to factors like delayed marriage and high living costs. The program was extended to reach more unemployed young adults up to age 24, reflecting the trend of delayed transition to adulthood due to various factors. Challenges for vulnerable youth include family conflict, obstacles to employment, and delayed marriage. The transition to adulthood for vulnerable youth is complicated by challenges such as family conflict, employment obstacles, and being disconnected from work or school. There is a debate on whether the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) should target older disconnected youth in any reauthorization legislation. The research literature suggests that older youth are more likely to be disconnected from work or school. There is a debate on whether the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) should target these older disconnected youth in reauthorization legislation. Funding constraints may arise if the age of youth in the program is increased, as seen in a report by GAO on oversight of ARRA activities. About 7% of the 300,000 youth in the Youth program funded by ARRA were ages 22 through 24, totaling around 21,000 youth. The Youth program funded by ARRA may face funding constraints if the age range is expanded, as seen in a report by GAO. DOL has advised workforce investment systems to co-enroll older youth in both the Youth Activities program and Adult Activities program to meet their individual needs. Expanding the age range for the Youth program may lead to an increase in the number of youth seeking services. DOL allows co-enrollment of older youth in both Youth and Adult programs to meet individual needs. Older youth can receive mentoring services under the Youth program and access individual training accounts for occupational skills training under the Adult program. It is unclear whether older youth self-select or are encouraged to participate in the Youth program. Older youth can receive mentoring services under the Youth program and access individual training accounts for occupational skills training under the Adult program. It is unclear the extent to which youth ages 18 through 21 self-select or are encouraged to participate in the programs. Exiters ages 19 to 21 in the Youth program have increased from 28.1% in program year 2008 to 34.8% in a recent period covering program years 2012 and 2013. Exiters ages 19 to 21 in the Youth program have increased from 28.1% in program year 2008 to 34.8% in a recent period covering program years 2012 and 2013. Youth ages 18 through 21 in the Adult Activities program make up 10% of the exiter population during the same time period. The Youth program offers more academic services compared to the Adult program. In the Adult Activities program, individuals aged 19 to 21 make up 10% of the exiter population. The program offers job search assistance and workplace training with related instruction. The Youth program, on the other hand, provides more academic services like tutoring and alternative secondary school services. The Adult program offers job search assistance and workplace training, while the Youth program focuses on academic services like tutoring and secondary school options. The Youth program also emphasizes leadership development and community service activities, which the Adult program does not. Both programs provide occupational skills training and employment links, but these are more limited in the Adult program. The Youth program emphasizes leadership development and community service activities, while the Adult program offers job search assistance and workplace training. Both programs provide occupational skills training and employment links, but these are more limited in the Adult program. Training activities in the Adult program are available only to those in the training component, while the Youth program provides supportive services. The Adult program focuses on job counseling during the intensive phase, while the Youth program provides supportive services like child care and transportation. The Youth program emphasizes adult mentoring and counseling for drug and alcohol abuse, compared to the Adult program's primary focus on job counseling. The Adult program focuses on job counseling during the intensive phase, while the Youth program provides supportive services like child care and transportation. The Youth program emphasizes adult mentoring and counseling for drug and alcohol abuse. DOL published a request for comment on selecting low-performing centers for closure based on performance ratings. The Department of Labor (DOL) published a request for comment on selecting low-performing centers for closure based on performance ratings, on January 10, 2013. The methodology includes criteria such as performance rating, on-board strength (OBS), and facility condition. The Department of Labor (DOL) is considering closing low-performing centers based on performance ratings, including on-board strength (OBS) and facility condition. DOL aims to keep at least one center in each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, exempt certain centers from closure, and consider the impact on specific subpopulations. The Department of Labor (DOL) is considering closing low-performing centers based on performance ratings and facility conditions. DOL aims to keep at least one center in each state, exempt certain centers from closure, and consider the impact on specific subpopulations as part of its reform agenda to improve center performance. The Department of Labor is considering closing low-performing centers as part of its reform agenda to improve performance. The closures are not driven by cost but by the need to maximize results for students and taxpayers. The comment period ended in February 2013, with no further information on the closure proposal as of February 2014. The Department of Labor is considering closing low-performing centers to improve performance, not driven by cost but to maximize results for students and taxpayers. H.R. 803 includes provisions to improve centers and close those that do not improve, with new performance measures and a program improvement plan for underperforming centers. The House bill, H.R. 803, aims to improve low-performing centers by implementing new performance measures and a program improvement plan for centers that do not meet certain criteria. It also includes provisions to close centers that consistently underperform for more than four years. Additionally, the bill mandates an audit of center performance over the past 10 years to rank their effectiveness. The bill H.R. 803 aims to improve low-performing centers by implementing new performance measures and a program improvement plan. It includes provisions to close centers that consistently underperform for more than four years. The bill mandates an audit of center performance over the past 10 years to rank their effectiveness and submit a report to Congress. The bill H.R. 803 aims to improve low-performing centers by implementing new performance measures and a program improvement plan. It includes provisions to close centers that consistently underperform for more than four years. The bill mandates an audit of center performance over the past 10 years to rank their effectiveness and submit a report to Congress. The DOL Secretary is directed to close centers ranked in the bottom quintile within 12 months of enactment. Similar proposals have been made in the past to improve the efficiency of the program. After 12 months of enacting H.R. 803, the DOL Secretary is to close the bottom quintile centers, as proposed in previous Congresses to improve program efficiency. Legislation in the 104th Congress also aimed to close underperforming centers based on audits. The DOL was tasked with identifying the least efficient Job Corps centers, but they were not closed. Legislation in the 104th Congress aimed to close 25 underperforming centers based on various criteria, including program outcomes and costs. The proposal also suggested transferring Job Corps operations from the federal government to the states. The proposal aimed to transfer Job Corps operations from the federal government to states, based on center performance, cost, and state support. Some objected, fearing states might reduce student attendance. The proposal aimed to transfer Job Corps operations from the federal government to states, allowing states to manage centers integrated with their workforce development systems. Some Members raised concerns about potential decreases in student attendance and limited access to programs outside their states. The House and Senate bills passed without convening a conference committee to resolve differences. Arguments for and against changing Job Corps could be relevant to current efforts. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 would direct the Secretary to determine center closures and eliminate existing programs. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) would direct the Secretary to determine center closures and establish expected performance levels for the Youth Activities program. It also requires the development of a performance improvement plan and other necessary actions under current law. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 would direct the DOL Secretary to determine center closures and establish expected performance levels for the Youth Activities program. It also requires the development of a performance improvement plan and other necessary actions within a one-year period. The common measures are performance metrics used across multiple workforce programs. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 requires the Department of Labor to establish performance metrics within a one-year period. These common measures include placement in employment or education, degree attainment, and literacy and numeracy gains. ETA implemented a common measures policy in 2003 to improve program performance reporting. The ETA implemented a common measures policy in 2003 for workforce programs, including Youth Activities and Job Corps. Additional policy guidance has been issued on these measures, which are aimed at improving program performance reporting. ETA introduced three measures for youth in workforce programs, including Youth Activities and Job Corps. The common measures are used to assess program performance and streamline data collection. These measures do not replace existing statutory reporting requirements for WIA, and states will continue to negotiate performance goals for the Youth Activities program. The common measures introduced by ETA for youth workforce programs do not replace existing statutory reporting requirements for WIA. States will continue to negotiate performance goals for the Youth Activities program. The common measures are used to assess program performance under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). Table A-1 shows the goals and outcomes for the common measures in Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs for PY2011 and PY2012. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requires federal agencies to measure program performance. Table A-1 displays goals and outcomes for common measures in Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs for PY2011 and PY2012. Program goals are set ambitiously within the context of prior performance. The data for YouthBuild is based on aggregated program data from the 2007 grant cycle onwards. Program goals are set ambitiously within the budget process, adjusted for individual grantees' circumstances. Performance targets are developed using regression analysis. DOL sets program goals for Youth Activities based on regression analysis, considering factors like prior year results and current labor market conditions to adjust for economic circumstances. The regression model for Youth Activities sets targets based on program results from the prior year, current labor market conditions, and individual characteristics to correct for the effects of the business cycle. Performance targets for YouthBuild and Job Corps are also determined using regression analysis and economic assumptions. The performance targets for YouthBuild and Job Corps are set based on regression analysis and economic assumptions. Each program met or exceeded its goals in PY2011 and PY2012, with placement in employment or education being a key measure of success. The Youth Activities regression model measures program success by tracking placement in employment or education for youth not enrolled in postsecondary education or employed at program entry. The model aims to have these youth enrolled in postsecondary education, advanced training, occupational skills training, or employed in the first quarter after program completion. The measure tracks the share of youth enrolled in postsecondary education, advanced training, or employed in the first quarter after program completion. It excludes those in high school at program entry and includes those who attain a diploma, GED, or certificate by the end of the third quarter after program completion. The program tracks the share of youth enrolled in postsecondary education or employed after completion. It measures the attainment of a diploma, GED, or certificate by participants within the third quarter after program completion. Diploma refers to any credential equivalent to a high school diploma or post-secondary degrees. The term diploma refers to any credential accepted as equivalent to a high school diploma or post-secondary degrees, earned through various educational programs. Work readiness certificates do not qualify as diplomas. The measure excludes youth in postsecondary school and focuses on literacy or numeracy gains for those not in school, aiming to increase educational functional levels. The work readiness certificate does not qualify as a diploma. The measure focuses on literacy or numeracy gains for out-of-school youth, assessing their educational functional levels. The work readiness certificate does not qualify as a diploma. The measure focuses on literacy or numeracy gains for out-of-school youth, assessing their educational functional levels based on pre-tests in reading, writing, and math. Youth are tested at regular intervals after entering the program. The program assesses literacy and numeracy gains for out-of-school youth through pre-tests in reading, writing, and math. Testing is done at regular intervals after entering the program to focus on those needing remediation. Individuals not basic skills-deficient are excluded to reduce testing burden. The program assesses literacy and numeracy gains for out-of-school youth through regular testing after entering the program. Individuals not basic skills-deficient are excluded to focus on those needing remediation and reduce testing burden. DOL provides guidance on types of tests and accommodations for students with disabilities."
