    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011\". Congress finds that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, with 28% of all cancer deaths attributed to it. In 2010, there were 222,520 new diagnoses and 157,300 deaths from lung cancer. Projections suggest a significant increase in lung cancer incidence by 2030, especially among women and men, as well as minority communities. According to projections, the incidence of lung cancer will increase significantly by 2030, with a 46% increase for women and a 58% increase for men. Among minority communities, the increase will range from 74% to 191%. Lung cancer causes more deaths annually than colon, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer combined, with a low 5-year survival rate of only 15%. The 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is only 15 percent, while breast cancer has a 89 percent survival rate, prostate cancer 99 percent, and colon cancer 65 percent. Lung cancer is the least funded major cancer in terms of research dollars per death. In 2001, the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group of the National Cancer Institute highlighted the underfunding of lung cancer research compared to other major cancers, emphasizing the need for an integrated multidisciplinary research program. The Lung Cancer Progress Review Group emphasized the underfunding of lung cancer research compared to other cancers and called for an integrated multidisciplinary research program. Radon was identified as the second leading cause of lung cancer, along with 15 other environmental contaminants strongly associated with the disease. The President's National Cancer Advisory Board Report of 2010 identified radon as the second leading cause of lung cancer, along with 15 other environmental contaminants. Hormonal and genetic factors may also influence the onset of lung cancer. Nearly 20 percent of lung cancer patients have never smoked. Lung cancer, influenced by hormonal and genetic factors, is the most stigmatized cancer blamed on patients, including non-smokers. Nearly 20% of lung cancer patients never smoked, with 60% being former smokers who quit long ago. It is the sixth leading cause of cancer death in non-smokers, with two-thirds of cases in women. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the overall population, affecting men and women who never smoked. It also disproportionately impacts African-American males. Military personnel, veterans, and munitions workers are at risk as well. The impact of lung cancer is significant across all major ethnic groups, with a higher risk for African-American males. Military personnel and workers exposed to carcinogens have an increased risk for lung cancer, with only 16 percent of cases being diagnosed early. Exposure to carcinogens like Agent Orange, silica, arsenic, uranium, beryllium, and battlefield fuel emissions increases the risk of lung cancer. Only 16 percent of lung cancer cases are diagnosed early, with no specific targets for early detection or treatment in health initiatives. Early detection of lung cancer could lead to significant savings, as indicated by an actuarial analysis in 2009. Early detection of lung cancer is crucial as it could save over 70,000 lives annually in the United States. A study by the National Cancer Institute in 2009 showed that a 4% annual decline in lung cancer mortality could reduce the economic burden by more than half by 2020. A National Cancer Institute study in 2009 projected that a 4% annual decline in lung cancer mortality could cut the economic burden by more than half by 2020. In 2010, the National Cancer Institute released initial results from a trial comparing low-dose CT scans and standard chest x-rays on lung cancer mortality. In 2010, the National Cancer Institute found 20% fewer lung cancer deaths among participants screened with low-dose CT scans compared to standard chest x-rays. The Congress emphasizes the need for a national public health priority to reduce lung cancer mortality and calls for a comprehensive program coordinated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This program aims to address all aspects of lung cancer and reduce mortality among current smokers, former smokers, and non-smokers. The Congress calls for a Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program under the Public Health Service Act to reduce mortality among smokers and non-smokers. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates the Secretary to implement a comprehensive program within 180 days in consultation with various health agencies and experts. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 requires the implementation of a program to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020, involving key health agencies and experts.
