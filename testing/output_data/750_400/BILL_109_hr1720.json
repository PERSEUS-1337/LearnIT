    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act\" and includes findings related to the issue. Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States each year due to inadequately treated sewage, leading to various gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses. Inadequately treated sewage can lead to waterborne diseases like gastroenteritis, hepatitis, giardiasis, and respiratory illnesses. Swimming in contaminated waters can cause millions of Americans to fall sick annually, resulting in beach closures valued at $1-2 billion in economic losses. Swimming in contaminated waters leads to annual economic losses of $28 billion due to illnesses. Better monitoring and reporting of sewer overflows could prevent millions of Americans from getting sick. Public health authorities are not routinely notified of sewer overflows that threaten public health, which could save millions of Americans from getting sick annually. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as an overflow of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups caused by blockages in privately owned building laterals. The term \"sanitary sewer overflow\" refers to wastewater overflows from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and backups caused by blockages in privately owned building laterals. It includes overflows reaching US waters, those that do not, and backups caused by blockages in a sanitary sewer other than a building lateral. SEC. 4. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SEWER OVERFLOWS. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include requirements for publicly owned treatment works to implement a system that alerts them to sanitary sewer overflows in a timely manner. Publicly owned treatment works must implement a system to alert the owner or operator of a sanitary sewer overflow promptly, notify the public of any potential health impacts, and inform the public within 24 hours of the occurrence. Publicly owned treatment works must promptly notify the public of any sanitary sewer overflow that may endanger human health, within 24 hours of becoming aware of the overflow. Additionally, they must inform public health authorities and other affected entities immediately. Within 24 hours of becoming aware of the overflow, the owner or operator must immediately notify public health authorities and other affected entities of any sanitary sewer overflow that may endanger human health. They must provide a report to the Administrator or the State within 24 hours of becoming aware of the overflow. The owner or operator must report any overflow to the Administrator or State within 24 hours, providing details on the magnitude, duration, and suspected cause within 5 days. The owner or operator must report any overflow to the Administrator or State within 24 hours, providing details on the magnitude, duration, suspected cause, steps taken to reduce, eliminate, prevent recurrence, and mitigate the impact of the overflow within 5 days. The owner or operator must report all sanitary sewer overflows to waters of the United States on its monthly discharge monitoring report to the Administrator or the State, as well as report the total number of such overflows to the Administrator or the State. The owner or operator must report all sanitary sewer overflows to waters of the United States on its monthly discharge monitoring report to the Administrator or the State, including details of each overflow incident such as wastewater released, duration, and location. The owner or operator must report all sanitary sewer overflows, including details of each incident like wastewater released, duration, and location, to the Administrator or State. If a State receives a report, it must then report to the Administrator. The State must report details of sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator annually, including impacts, cleanup responses, and mitigation actions taken. SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE. Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and notifying the public of sanitary sewer overflows. \n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Amends the Act to authorize $2,200,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2006 to 2012."
