    "content": "The electric utility industry is a significant source of air pollution, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. The EPA released an analysis comparing different approaches to controlling this pollution, focusing on market-oriented mechanisms for cost-effective solutions. The analysis compared versions of the \"Clear Skies\" proposal with bills introduced by Senators Jeffords and Carper. The EPA's new analysis compares different approaches to controlling air pollution in the electric utility industry, focusing on market-oriented mechanisms for cost-effective solutions. The Administration-based \"Clear Skies\" proposal is compared to bills introduced by Senators Jeffords and Carper, with the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee failing to report the Clear Skies bill in March 2005. The EPA conducted a study comparing the Clear Skies bill to bills proposed by Senators Jeffords and Carper after the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee failed to report the Clear Skies bill in March 2005. The study was prompted by concerns about the lack of analysis comparing the provisions of the different bills. The EPA conducted a study comparing the Clear Skies bill to bills proposed by Senators Jeffords and Carper after concerns were raised about the lack of analysis. Electric utility generating facilities are a major source of air pollution due to the combustion of fossil fuels. The EPA conducted a cost-benefit analysis of Clear Skies and other Senate bills, focusing on air pollution from electric utility generating facilities. Emissions from fossil fuels like petroleum, natural gas, and coal pose risks to human health, including pollutants like particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. EPA has finalized rules to regulate mercury and other gases may also be regulated. The emission of gases from U.S. electricity generation poses risks to human health and welfare, including pollutants like particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. Carbon dioxide may contribute to global warming. SO2 and NOx emissions have decreased due to regulations, while CO2 emissions remain a concern. In 2003, fossil-fuel-fired electric generating plants accounted for about 72% of the country's SO2 emissions, 24% of its NOx emissions, and 41% of its CO2 emissions. Hg emissions from utility facilities are uncertain, with current estimates indicating about 45 tons. The evolution of air pollution controls over time has led to Act Amendments taking hold. In 2003, fossil-fuel-fired electric generating plants accounted for a significant portion of SO2, NOx, and CO2 emissions in the country. Additionally, about 45 tons of Hg emissions come from electric generating units. Current estimates indicate that about 45 tons of Hg emissions, more than 40% of the country's total, come from electric generating units. Air pollution controls have evolved over time, leading to a complex system of controls in place, particularly focusing on NOx, SO2, and Hg emissions. Additional controls are being implemented to address these pollutants. The growing scientific understanding of health and environmental impacts has led to a complex system of controls on power plant emissions, including NOx, SO2, and Hg. Additional controls are being implemented, with the US agreeing to voluntary limits on CO2 emissions under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Bush Administration rejected the Kyoto Protocol in favor of a voluntary reduction program. The Bush Administration rejected the Kyoto Protocol in favor of voluntary CO2 emission limits. The Senate passed a resolution for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases without significant harm to the economy, advocating for a simplified \"multi-pollutant\" approach to air quality control. The Senate passed a resolution in June 2005 for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases, advocating for a simplified \"multi-pollutant\" approach to air quality control. This approach aims to balance environmental goals with industry stability by regulating utility emissions of SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2. The \"multi-pollutant\" approach involves regulatory and economic mechanisms for utility emissions of SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2 to balance environmental goals with industry stability. This approach has been incorporated into existing law with finalized rules like CAIR and CAMR. The new approach of a stable regulatory regime has been incorporated into existing law with finalized rules like CAIR, CAMR, and CAVR, focusing on reducing emissions of SO2, NOx, Hg, and improving air quality standards. The Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) was promulgated on July 6, 2005, focusing on reducing SO2 and NOx emissions that impair visibility around national parks and wilderness areas. With new air quality standards for ozone and fine particles in effect nationwide in 2005, further reductions in NOx and SO2 emissions are necessary. Mercury emissions are also a concern, with 44 states issuing fish consumption advisories for mercury. Mercury emissions are a focus of concern, with 44 states issuing fish consumption advisories for mercury. Mercury enters water bodies from air emissions, either directly or through precipitation runoff. Legislation addressing power plant pollution comprehensively is supported by industry, environmental groups, Congress, and the Administration. Mercury enters water bodies from air emissions, either directly or through precipitation runoff. Legislation addressing power plant pollution comprehensively is supported by industry, environmental groups, Congress, and the Administration, with six bills introduced in the 109th Congress for multi-pollutant controls on utilities. In the 109th Congress, legislation known as \"Clear Skies\" aimed to impose multi-pollutant controls on utilities, addressing SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions from electric generating facilities. The proposed system would rely on tradeable allowances similar to the acid rain program, with some proposals including CO2 caps. Key questions in the debate revolve around the stringency of the caps. The \"Clear Skies\" legislation in the 109th Congress aimed to control emissions from electric generating facilities through tradeable allowances, similar to the acid rain program. Key questions in the debate include the stringency of emissions caps, with proposed reductions of 70%-90% for mercury and 70%-80% for NOx and SO2 emissions from 1998 levels. The debate surrounding emissions caps in the \"Clear Skies\" legislation includes discussions on the stringency of the caps, reduction targets for pollutants like NOx, SO2, and mercury, and the use of \"banking\" provisions to delay meeting the reduction targets. The Clear Skies bill (S. 131) imposes the least stringent standards and extends the phase-in period, with final deadlines set for 2018 but potential delays in meeting the 70% reduction targets for up to a decade. The Clear Skies bill (S. 131) proposes reductions of 70%-90% in emissions, with the least stringent standards and a phased-in approach over a long period. The final deadlines for meeting the reduction targets are set for 2018, but actual compliance may be delayed for up to a decade due to the use of \"banking\" provisions allowing utilities to accumulate credits for future emission reductions. The Clear Skies bill proposes significant emissions reductions over a long period, with banking provisions allowing utilities to accumulate credits for future emission reductions. This could lead to overcompliance in the early years, delaying actual reductions in later years. EPA's analysis does not expect immediate compliance with the reduction targets set for 2018. The Clear Skies bill allows banking of emission allowances, leading to overcompliance initially and delaying full emissions reductions. EPA predicts full compliance with 70% reductions by 2026 or later. Jeffords and Carper bills have earlier, stricter caps, enabling quicker compliance without extensive banking. The Clear Skies bill allows banking of emission allowances, leading to delayed full emissions reductions by 2026 or later. Jeffords and Carper bills have earlier, stricter caps, enabling quicker compliance without extensive banking. Clear Skies does not impose controls on carbon dioxide, unlike the Jeffords and Carper bills. This difference may impact compliance strategies, market for coal, and the use of natural gas or renewable fuels by power producers. The Clear Skies bill does not regulate carbon dioxide emissions, unlike the Jeffords and Carper bills. This difference could affect compliance strategies, market dynamics for coal, and the use of natural gas or renewable fuels by power producers. The EPA's cost-benefit analysis compared options from both bills and Clear Skies, highlighting potential impacts on compliance and fuel choices. The EPA's cost-benefit analysis compared options from the Clear Skies bill, Carper's Clean Air Planning Act, and Jeffords' Clean Power Act. The analysis showed little difference between the Clear Skies options, simplifying the discussion to three principal choices: Clear Skies, Carper, and Jeffords. The EPA's analysis compared options from the Clear Skies bill, Carper's Clean Air Planning Act, and Jeffords' Clean Power Act. The results showed little difference between the Clear Skies options, simplifying the discussion to three main choices: Clear Skies, Carper, and Jeffords. The chosen version of Clear Skies was the Managers' Mark version offered at the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee markup of S. 131 on March 9, 2005. EPA's Multi-Pollutant Regulatory Analysis assumes no additional action will be taken in the absence of new legislation. The EPA selected the Managers' Mark version of the Clear Skies bill, assuming no further action will be taken on emissions beyond rules finalized by mid-2004, despite recent EPA rules addressing SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions. The EPA will not take additional action to control SO2, NOx, Hg, or CO2 emissions beyond rules finalized by mid-2004, despite recent EPA rules addressing these pollutants. EPA included the three regulations as a \"sixth proposal\" for controlling these pollutants, which is a curious designation for finalized rules. This report uses the CAIR/CAMR/CAVR case as its baseline for clean air regulation. The current approach to addressing SO2, NOx, and Hg control is unclear. EPA included the regulations as a \"sixth proposal\" for controlling these pollutants, which is a curious designation for finalized rules. This report uses the CAIR/CAMR/CAVR case as its baseline for clean air regulation. The uncertainty surrounding clean air regulation, including specific provisions and implementation, is highlighted. Legislation such as S. 843 introduced in the 108th Congress may see changes in subsequent versions. The regulations supporting passed legislation could face similar uncertainties and delays as finalized regulations not included in EPA's proposals. The EPA's cost analysis focuses on Electric Demand Price Elasticity and two scenarios: zero price elasticity. The regulations supporting passed legislation may face uncertainties and delays similar to finalized regulations not included in EPA's baseline. It is crucial to work from updated baseline projections for controlling air pollution. The EPA's cost analysis emphasizes Electric Demand Price Elasticity and Short-term Construction Constraints. Two scenarios are analyzed for each parameter to account for uncertainties in controlling air pollution. The EPA analyzes two scenarios for electric demand price elasticity and short-term construction constraints, considering zero price elasticity and inelastic demand response. Additionally, they assess assumptions regarding labor shortages and market responsiveness, as well as electricity demand growth and natural gas supply. The EPA analyzes scenarios for electric demand price elasticity, labor shortages, and market responsiveness. Two scenarios are considered for electricity demand growth and natural gas supply, with different baseline assumptions and prices. The EPA developed four scenarios based on different assumptions for electricity demand growth and natural gas prices, which rise under proposed legislation. The scenarios include variations in price demand elasticity and construction constraints. The EPA developed four scenarios based on different assumptions for electricity demand growth and natural gas prices under proposed legislation. These scenarios vary in price demand elasticity and construction constraints. The EPA developed four scenarios based on different assumptions for electricity demand growth and natural gas prices under proposed legislation. These scenarios vary in price demand elasticity and construction constraints. The report uses EPA's Demand Response Scenario as the benchmark analysis, chosen as a compromise based on various factors and lack of alternative combinations. Each scenario raises questions. The report uses EPA's Demand Response Scenario as a benchmark analysis, chosen as a compromise based on various factors and lack of alternative combinations. The strongest case can be made for including a short-term demand response function in the modeling. The report uses EPA's Demand Response Scenario as a benchmark analysis, chosen as a compromise based on various factors and lack of alternative combinations. The strongest case can be made for including a short-term demand response function in the modeling, as electricity price elasticities are well established in the literature. EPA incorporated short-term price elasticities in their Demand Response Scenario, which are within the range suggested by the literature. It is unclear why EPA did not include this refinement in all scenarios, but CRS chose to include it in the one scenario that contains the demand function. The EPA's Demand Response Scenario includes a demand function within the suggested range by the literature. It is unclear why this refinement was not included in all scenarios, but CRS chose to include it in one scenario. EPA's assumption about limited boilermaker labor for constructing control equipment until 2010 is debatable. The EPA's assumption about limited boilermaker labor for constructing control equipment until 2010 is not debatable, as it was also incorporated into the regulatory rulemaking on the Clean Air Interstate Rule. This constraint has been questioned by some, including the Institute of Clean Air Companies. The Institute of Clean Air Companies (ICAC) conducted their own analysis during the rulemaking on the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) and found no constraint on construction, even if the 2015 deadline of CAIR was moved to 2010. ICAC stated that the air pollution control industry has demonstrated the ability to install significant amounts of air pollution control equipment in short periods of time. The ICAC found no constraint on construction for the Clean Air Interstate Rule, even if the deadline was moved to 2010. The air pollution control industry has shown the ability to install significant amounts of equipment quickly, as seen with recent installations in Germany and Japan. The resources needed for projected installations under the IAQR will also require a significant number of installations, but completion is not expected to be an issue. The installation of SCRs for NOx SIP call and control installations in Germany and Japan have shown the ability to quickly install air pollution control equipment. Resources needed for projected IAQR installations will not be limiting, with factors like modular construction methods reducing demand for union boilermakers. Shortage of boilermaker labor can be mitigated by the six-month compliance time window. The demand for union boilermakers will be reduced due to factors like modular construction methods and non-union craft labor. Additional boilermaker labor can be sourced from Canadian boilermaker union, ship builders, and iron workers. There will be sufficient capacity to complete the projected IAQR and control installations for 2010 and 2015, with the possibility of finishing the 2015 requirements by 2010. The Canadian boilermaker union, ship builders, and iron workers can provide additional labor for the projected IAQR and control installations for 2010 and 2015. There will be enough capacity to meet the requirements by 2010, even for the most stringent alternatives. The assumption of limited boilermaker availability only affects the two most stringent alternatives (S. 843 and S. 150) in EPA's analysis scenarios. Despite questions about this assumption, it is important to include a demand elasticity function in the benchmark analysis. The text discusses the importance of including a demand elasticity function in the benchmark analysis despite questions about the feasibility constraint. It also highlights the need for sensitivity analysis to understand the robustness of cost estimates due to uncertainties in future natural gas supply. The text emphasizes the importance of including a demand elasticity function in the benchmark analysis and conducting sensitivity analysis to understand cost estimate robustness due to uncertainties in future natural gas supply. EPA's demand response scenario is chosen as the base case, with natural gas supply curves projecting more availability at lower prices compared to EIA's curves. EPA provides a scenario with steeper EIA supply curves, named Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario. Cost estimates show differences between EPA and EIA natural gas supply curves. EIA's curves may be more representative of future supplies. However, natural gas supply volatility and the 15-year timeframe leave room for debate. EPA's feasibility constraints are questioned. In the current market climate, EIA's natural gas supply curves may be more accurate than EPA's estimates. The analysis acknowledges concerns about EPA's feasibility constraints and the historic volatility of the natural gas market. The Demand Response Scenario is used as the basis for discussion, with Clear Skies projected to cost less in both short- and long-term compared to other bills. Based on the analysis using the Demand Response Scenario, Clear Skies is projected to cost substantially less than other bills in both short- and long-term. This is due to its less stringent requirements and later deadlines, resulting in lower annual costs compared to other approaches. Clear Skies has the lowest cost compared to other bills due to less stringent requirements and later deadlines, resulting in lower annual costs. It aims to revamp the Clean Air Act with a more cost-effective approach, with weak provisions for Hg and no provisions for CO2. Clear Skies bill has weaker provisions for Hg and no provisions for CO2 compared to other bills. Its benefits are substantially less, providing $6 billion in annual benefits in 2010, compared to $51 billion (Carper) and $83 billion (Jeffords). Clear Skies bill's benefits are significantly lower compared to the Carper and Jeffords bills, with Clear Skies providing $6 billion in annual benefits in 2010, while Carper and Jeffords offer $51 billion and $83 billion respectively. The benefits of Clear Skies almost align with the baseline increase in later years and fall behind the other bills, which have higher benefits due to more stringent pollution caps and a stricter implementation schedule. EPA compares the three bills' benefits, highlighting the differences in their effectiveness. The benefits of the Clear Skies bill are lower compared to the Carper and Jeffords bills, with Clear Skies providing $6 billion in annual benefits in 2010. The Clear Skies bill's required pollution caps are less stringent, and the implementation schedule is more relaxed, resulting in lower benefits. Adjusting the baseline to reflect current Clean Air Act requirements shows that Clear Skies has minimal incremental costs and relatively small benefits. The EPA compares the effects of the three bills to a baseline without current Clean Air Act requirements. Adjusting the baseline to include current requirements shows Clear Skies has minimal additional costs and small benefits. This suggests EPA successfully integrated Clear Skies' market-based regulatory scheme into new regulations. Opponents argue that current requirements are sufficient. The EPA's analysis compares the benefits of different bills, with Senator Jeffords' bill showing the greatest benefits in 2010 and 2020. This suggests that Clear Skies has minimal additional costs and small benefits, supporting the argument that current requirements are sufficient. Senator Jeffords' bill (S. 150) is shown to have the greatest benefits in 2010 and 2020, with estimated annual benefits of $83 billion and $66 billion respectively. This surpasses the benefits of the Carper bill and Clear Skies by significant margins. EPA's analysis indicates that current law requirements are at least as effective as Clear Skies. Senator Jeffords' bill (S. 150) has the highest benefits in 2020, estimated at $66 billion annually, surpassing the Carper bill and Clear Skies. EPA's analysis shows that S. 150 would also be the most costly bill. The EPA's analysis of Senator Jeffords' bill (S. 150) shows it has the highest benefits in 2020 at $66 billion annually, making it the most costly bill due to short-term construction constraints limiting scrubber installations. The Jeffords bill, according to EPA analysis, would reduce coal production and coal-fired electric generation by about 40%, leading to a need for an additional 65 gigawatts of generation from renewable sources at great cost. The Jeffords bill would significantly reduce coal production and coal-fired electric generation by about 40%, requiring a substantial increase in renewable fuel generators at great cost. This bill would also lead to an additional 65 gigawatts of generation from renewable sources and nearly 100 gigawatts of additional oil- and gas-fired capacity. The net benefits of the Jeffords bill far exceed those of other options like Clear Skies and the Carper bill. The Jeffords bill would reduce coal production and increase renewable fuel generators at a high cost. It would also add 65 gigawatts of renewable energy and 100 gigawatts of oil and gas capacity. The net benefits of the Jeffords bill surpass those of Clear Skies and the Carper bill. The costs and benefits of the Carper bill are lower than the Jeffords bill but higher than Clear Skies, aiming for substantial emission reductions while allowing time to manage short-term price impacts. The benefits and costs of S. 843 are lower than the Jeffords bill but higher than Clear Skies, aiming for substantial emission reductions while managing short-term price impacts. The bill also includes a phased-in schedule to mitigate EPA constraints and a flexible CO2 requirement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at a nominal cost. The phased-in schedule of S. 843 helps mitigate short-term constraints on the analysis, achieving some reduction in carbon dioxide emissions at a nominal cost. EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on the bill, highlighting variables such as price elasticity, construction constraints, and electricity growth. The EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on the bill, focusing on price elasticity, construction constraints, and electricity growth to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at a nominal cost. Various scenarios were examined, including a No Construction Constraint Scenario assuming zero price. The EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on the bill, focusing on price elasticity, construction constraints, and electricity growth to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at a nominal cost. Different scenarios were examined, including No Construction Constraint, EPA Base Case, and Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas scenarios with varying assumptions on price elasticity and constraints. The EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on reducing carbon dioxide emissions at a nominal cost by examining different scenarios with varying assumptions on price elasticity and constraints. The No Construction Constraint Scenario removes EPA's short-term construction constraint assumption but includes a zero demand price elasticity assumption. The EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on reducing carbon dioxide emissions at a nominal cost by examining different scenarios with varying assumptions on price elasticity and constraints. The No Construction Constraint Scenario removes EPA's short-term construction constraint assumption but includes a zero demand price elasticity assumption, impacting the cost of S. 150. The analysis shows that the removal of zero demand price elasticity assumption has a significant impact on the cost of S. 150, increasing it by 36% in the short-term and 157% in the long-term. This outweighs the savings from removing EPA's short-term construction constraint assumptions. The removal of zero demand price elasticity assumption significantly impacts the cost of S. 150, increasing it by 36% in the short-term and 157% in the long-term. This outweighs the savings from removing EPA's short-term construction constraint assumptions. The EPA Base Case Scenario replaces short-term price elasticity with zero elasticity, leading to cost increases of 63% in 2010 and 147% in 2020 for S. 150. Removal of price elasticity results in an 86% higher cost estimate for S. 843. The removal of short-term price elasticity has a significant impact on the costs of S. 150 and S. 843, with cost increases of 63% in 2010 and 147% in 2020 for S. 150, and an 86% higher cost estimate for S. 843. Demand response and construction constraint assumptions heavily influence EPA's 2010 cost estimates for S. 843, while EPA's assumptions have little effect on long-term costs or the Managers' Mark. The third alternative, the Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario, incorporates zero price elasticity and short-term construction constraint assumptions from the EPA Base Case Scenario, along with EIA's higher electricity growth and steeper natural gas supply curves. Compared to the benchmark analysis, this scenario maintains short-term cost impacts. The Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario combines zero demand response, increased electricity demand, and tighter natural gas supply, leading to higher costs, especially for S. 150. The case maintains short-term construction constraints, removes demand price elasticity, and uses EIA assumptions for electricity growth and natural gas supply. Zero demand response, higher electricity demand, and tighter natural gas supply result in higher costs, especially for S. 150. The impact is most pronounced in 2020, putting pressure on EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity. The effect on S. 843 is less dramatic, and nonexistent for the Managers' Mark. The higher growth and natural gas costs in the context of zero demand response have a significant impact on S. 150, putting pressure on EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity, especially for 2020. The effect on S. 843 is less dramatic, and nonexistent for the Managers' Mark. A more comprehensive analysis of future natural gas availability could be valuable in determining appropriate targets for multi-pollutant legislation. EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity dramatically affects the short and long-term cost estimates for S. 150. The sensitivity analysis is limited, and a more comprehensive analysis of future natural gas availability could be valuable. EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity has a significant impact on cost estimates for S. 150, especially in the long term. EPA's assumptions significantly impact cost estimates for S. 843, especially in the short term. The effects decrease over the long term due to S. 843's less aggressive time frame. EPA's assumptions have little effect on the Managers' Mark cost estimates. In the short term, short-term construction constraints have a significant effect on S. 843, which decreases over the long term. EPA's assumptions have little impact on the Managers' Mark cost estimates, as the Managers' Mark was developed using EPA's model. This ensures that the economic impact of the Managers' Mark is minimal compared to existing laws and regulations. The Managers' Mark has minimal economic impact compared to existing laws and regulations. Two bills analyzed by EPA, S. 150 and S. 843, aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions with specific emissions caps set for each bill. Two bills analyzed by EPA, S. 150 and S. 843, aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions with specific emissions caps set for each bill. S. 150 sets an emissions cap of 2.05 billion tons annually starting in 2010, while S. 843 would set an emissions cap of about 2.655 billion tons in 2009, decreasing to 2.454 billion tons in 2013. The costs for CO2 allowances under S. 843 are significantly lower compared to S. 150 due to a more modest reduction requirement and slower reduction schedule. The emissions cap under S. 843 is estimated to be 2.454 billion tons in 2013, resulting in lower costs for CO2 allowances compared to S. 150. The reduction requirement and schedule of S. 150 are more aligned with the Kyoto Protocol, with estimated costs of $19 a metric ton in 2010 and $33 a metric ton in 2020. The reduction requirement and schedule of S. 150 align more with the Kyoto Protocol than S. 843, with estimated costs of $19 per metric ton in 2010 and $33 per metric ton in 2020, similar to current EU prices. EPA is working on completing the study within a short deadline. The EU market prices for carbon dioxide reduction are around $25 per metric ton, aligning with the Kyoto Protocol requirements. The EPA study relies on data from 2003 for cost and cost-effectiveness analysis, with a short deadline for completion. The EPA study, with a short deadline, did not develop new data on the cost of control technologies for mercury emissions, relying on outdated assumptions from 2003. This may overstate the cost of emission controls significantly. The air pollution control industry argues that the model's assumption of activated carbon injection controls on 40% of coal-fired plants is costly. The effectiveness of mercury control technology has advanced rapidly since 2003, leading to a substantial decrease in the cost of emission controls. The air pollution control industry argues that the cost of activated carbon injection controls on coal-fired plants is now only one-fourth of what it would have been in 2003. EPA's analysis of S. 150 suggests that 40% of coal-fired plants would be shut down by 2010 under the bill. The cost of emission controls on coal-fired plants has decreased significantly since 2003, with activated carbon injection controls now only one-fourth of the cost. EPA's analysis of S. 150 predicts that 40% of coal-fired plants would be shut down by 2010 under the bill, with benefits outweighing costs due to reduced emissions of SO2 and fine particles. EPA's analysis and CRS's reanalysis show benefits outweighing costs for S. 150 and S. 843, mainly from reduced mortality due to emissions reduction. Environmental benefits were not monetized due to methodological challenges. The analysis did not attempt to monetize environmental benefits, such as the significant benefits from reducing sulfur dioxide emissions, which cause acid deposition and harm aquatic life, forest growth, and building materials. These benefits were not estimated in the analysis. Reductions in SO2 emissions could have significant environmental benefits, including reducing acid deposition that harms aquatic life, forest growth, and building materials. The emissions also contribute to regional haze formation and mercury deposition, leading to fish consumption advisories and economic impacts. The environmental benefits were not monetized in the analysis, impacting certain control schemes more significantly. The analysis did not monetize the environmental benefits of reducing emissions, impacting control schemes like S. 150 and S. 843. Mercury deposition has led to fish consumption advisories with economic impacts. The omission of health effects of mercury could have significant economic consequences. The analysis did not model mercury health effects or estimate the benefits of controlling CO2 emissions, impacting control schemes like S. 150 and S. 843. Omitting these benefits could have significant economic consequences. The analysis did not estimate the benefits of controlling CO2 emissions, impacting bills like S. 150 and S. 843. This omission may understate the potential benefits of the Jeffords and Carper bills, especially the Jeffords bill which is the most aggressive in controlling CO2 emissions. The Jeffords bill is more aggressive in controlling CO2 emissions compared to Clear Skies. EPA's analysis shows little cost and a small benefit with Clear Skies, while the Jeffords and Carper bills have more stringent standards. The EPA has successfully incorporated Clear Skies caps into promulgated rules, resulting in little cost and a small benefit. The Jeffords and Carper bills have more stringent standards, with benefits outweighing costs. Carbon dioxide costs depend on reduction requirements and implementation schedules. S. 843 has nominal carbon dioxide reduction costs due to modest reduction requirements and relaxed implementation schedules. The analysis shows benefits outweighing costs for both bills, with carbon dioxide and mercury control costs dependent on reduction requirements and timeliness of data. EPA's benefit analysis is limited, disadvantaging alternatives to Clear Skies with more stringent standards. The EPA's analysis of mercury control costs is incomplete and limited, favoring Clear Skies alternatives by overstating costs and penalizing short-term labor availability constraints. The EPA's analysis of legislative options for mercury control costs is criticized for favoring Clear Skies alternatives, overstating costs, and penalizing short-term pollution reduction schedules. The analysis lacks consideration of natural gas price volatility and is based on outdated 2003 assumptions. The EPA's analysis of legislative options for mercury control costs is criticized for favoring Clear Skies alternatives, overstating costs, and penalizing short-term pollution reduction schedules. The analysis lacks consideration of natural gas price volatility and is based on outdated 2003 assumptions, which may no longer be relevant for current congressional debate."
