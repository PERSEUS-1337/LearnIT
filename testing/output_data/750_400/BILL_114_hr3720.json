Authorization of Appropriations.--$7,500,000 for fiscal year 2016, $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2017, $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2018, and $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2019 and each year thereafter, adjusted for inflation, to carry out water efficiency programs. Federal procurement of water efficient products. In this section, \"agency\" refers to the definition in title 5, \"WaterSense product or service\" is rated for water efficiency, \"WaterSense program\" is established by this Act, and \"FEMP designated product\" is designated by the Department of Energy's Federal Energy Management Program. The \"WaterSense program\" established by this Act defines a \"FEMP designated product\" as one of the top 25% most efficient products designated by the Department of Energy. The terms \"product\" and \"service\" exclude water-consuming items for combat missions. The \"WaterSense program\" defines a \"FEMP designated product\" as one of the top 25% most efficient products. The terms exclude water-consuming items for combat missions and products already covered by Federal procurement regulations. Agencies must meet requirements for water-efficient products. The Federal procurement regulations require agencies to procure WaterSense or FEMP designated water-efficient products. WaterSense plumbing products should be installed by certified plumbers. The Federal procurement regulations mandate agencies to purchase WaterSense or FEMP designated water-efficient products. WaterSense plumbing products should be installed by certified plumbers for optimal performance. Certification guidelines do not exist for WaterSense irrigation systems, but they should be installed, maintained, and audited by a WaterSense-certified professional for optimal performance. Agencies are not required to procure WaterSense products if they are not cost-effective over the product's life. Exceptions to the requirement for agencies to procure WaterSense or FEMP designated products include cases where they are not cost-effective over the product's life or when no suitable products meeting agency requirements are available. The head of an agency must include specifications for water consuming products in all procurements, considering energy, water, and wastewater cost savings, or if no suitable WaterSense or FEMP designated products are available. The head of an agency must incorporate specifications for water consuming products and systems into all procurements, including evaluation criteria for WaterSense and FEMP designated products, and consider additional measures for reducing water consumption, such as water reuse. The head of an agency must consider measures for reducing water consumption, including water reuse, reclamation, and recycling technologies, leak detection, and use of waterless products. WaterSense and FEMP designated products should be clearly identified in federal catalogs. The head of an agency must consider measures for reducing water consumption, including water reuse, reclamation, and recycling technologies, leak detection, and use of waterless products. WaterSense products and FEMP designated products shall be prominently displayed in federal catalogs by the General Services Administration and the Defense Logistics Agency. The General Services Administration and the Defense Logistics Agency are required to supply WaterSense products or FEMP designated products for all product categories, unless specified otherwise in writing due to functional requirements or cost-effectiveness considerations. The Environmental Protection Agency must issue regulations within 180 days of the enactment of the Act regarding cases where WaterSense or FEMP designated products are not available or cost-effective based on functional requirements or life cycle cost savings.
