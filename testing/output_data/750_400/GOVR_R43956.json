Benefits are also available to uranium industry workers between 1942 and 1971 who contracted specified medical conditions after possible radiation exposure. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) provides cash benefits to individuals involved in atomic weapons testing or uranium industry work between 1942 and 1971. Claimants must have specific medical conditions after radiation exposure. The program is managed by the Department of Justice, with over 30,000 approved claims totaling nearly $2 billion. Most claims are related to atomic weapons testing. See Table A-1 in the Appendix for complete program data. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) program, administered by the Department of Justice, has approved over 30,000 claims totaling nearly $2 billion in benefits. Most claims are related to atomic weapons testing. All benefit applications must be filed before July 10, 2022, when the program will end. Benefits under RECA are paid from general revenue and are considered mandatory spending. All benefit applications must be filed before July 10, 2022, when the program will end. The United States conducted the first atomic bomb test in 1945, leading to extensive atomic weapons development and testing until 1992. The United States conducted the first atomic bomb test in 1945 at the Trinity Test Site in New Mexico, leading to the development and testing of atomic weapons until 1992. A total of 1,054 atomic weapons tests were conducted under the Atomic Energy Commission and later the Department of Energy, with the majority (928) taking place at the Nevada Test Site. Between 1945 and 1992, the United States conducted 1,054 atomic weapons tests under the Atomic Energy Commission and later the Department of Energy. The Nevada Test Site was the location for the majority of these tests, with 828 being underground tests and 100 being atmospheric tests. The atmospheric tests released radioactive material into the atmosphere, and were the only ones of their kind conducted in the continental United States and Alaska. The Nevada Test Site conducted 828 underground tests and 100 atmospheric tests between 1951 and 1962. The atmospheric tests released radioactive material into the atmosphere and were the only ones of their kind in the continental United States and Alaska. The largest atmospheric test at NTS was the Hood Test on July 5, 1957. The Nevada Test Site conducted numerous atomic weapons tests between 1951 and 1962, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere. The largest atmospheric test at NTS was the Hood Test on July 5, 1957, with an energy yield equivalent to 74,000 tons of TNT. The RECA program provides benefits to onsite participants and downwinders affected by these tests. The RECA program offers benefits to individuals affected by atomic weapons tests at the Nevada Test Site, including onsite participants, downwinders, and uranium workers. Benefits include one-time lump sum payments of $75,000 for onsite participants, $50,000 for downwinders, and $100,000 for uranium workers. These payments are not adjusted for inflation and are not subject to federal income tax. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) program provides one-time lump sum payments of $75,000 for onsite participants, $50,000 for downwinders, and $100,000 for uranium workers. These payments are not adjusted for inflation and are not subject to federal income tax. Benefits are reduced by any other payments received for illnesses related to radiation exposure. No medical benefits are provided by the RECA program. The RECA program provides one-time lump sum payments for onsite participants, downwinders, and uranium workers. Payments are not adjusted for inflation and are not taxable. Benefits are reduced by payments from lawsuits, workers' compensation, or the VA for radiation-related illnesses. RECA does not provide medical benefits, but eligible uranium workers can receive $50,000 in compensation and medical benefits under EEOICPA. Eligible individuals under RECA receive an additional $50,000 in compensation and medical benefits for covered illnesses. Benefits are paid directly to the claimant or to eligible survivors in a specific order. RECA benefits are paid to eligible survivors in a specific order of precedence: spouse, children, parents, grandchildren, and grandparents. Only these survivors are eligible for benefits, and if none are found, no benefit is paid. Eligibility for benefits requires meeting exposure and disease requirements. To be eligible for RECA benefits, an onsite participant must meet exposure and disease requirements by being present during an atmospheric atomic weapons test conducted by the United States and meeting specific geographic and participation criteria. A person may be eligible for RECA benefits if they were present onsite during an atmospheric atomic weapons test conducted by the United States and meet specific geographic requirements, including being within or above certain designated areas during and after the testing period. During atmospheric atomic weapons testing, individuals may be eligible for RECA benefits if they were present in specific geographic areas, including NTS, Pacific Test Sites, Trinity Test Site, and South Atlantic Test Site for Operation Argus, along with official exclusion zones for non-test affiliated ships for security and safety. The curr_chunk describes designated locations such as test sites for nuclear detonations, exclusion zones for non-test affiliated ships, decontamination sites, and monitoring locations for fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests. The curr_chunk specifies occupations and activities required for individuals who were onsite during atmospheric atomic weapons testing, including military members, civilian employees of the Manhattan Engineer District, and contract employees. Occupations and activities required for individuals onsite during atmospheric atomic weapons testing include military members, civilian employees of specific agencies, and contract employees. Employees of various government agencies and organizations involved in nuclear testing activities, including decontamination duties after atmospheric detonations. Employees involved in nuclear testing activities, including decontamination duties after atmospheric detonations, were required to perform specific tasks within identified operational areas and on the atoll of Enewetak during certain time periods. Employees involved in nuclear testing activities at the atoll of Enewetak between specific time periods were required to perform duties such as cloud tracking, maintenance, or radiological safety monitoring. Eligibility for RECA benefits is based on developing certain cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation from participation in atmospheric atomic weapons tests. An onsite participant must have contracted one of the types of cancers listed in Table 2 after exposure to ionizing radiation from participation in an atmospheric atomic weapons test to be eligible for RECA benefits. Downwinders must have been physically present near NTS for at least 24 consecutive months between January 21, 1951, and October 31, 1958. To be eligible for RECA benefits as a downwinder, a person must have been physically present near NTS for a specified period between 1951 and 1962 and contracted one of the listed cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation from an atomic weapons test. To qualify for RECA benefits as a downwinder or uranium miner, specific exposure and disease requirements must be met. Downwinders must have been near NTS between 1951 and 1962 and developed one of the listed cancers due to radiation exposure. Uranium miners need to have worked in a uranium mine for at least one year between 1942 and 1971 or have been exposed to 40 WLM of radiation during this period. To qualify for RECA benefits, a uranium miner must have worked in a uranium mine for at least one year between 1942 and 1971 or have been exposed to 40 working-level months (WLM) of radiation during this period in specific states. A WLM is defined as one working level of radiation exposure every work day for a month. A WLM is defined as one working level of radiation exposure every work day for a month, or an equivalent exposure over a greater or lesser period of time. One working level of radiation exposure is defined as the concentration of decay products of radon that will release 130,000 MeV of alpha energy per liter of air. Uranium miners, millers, and ore transporters may qualify for RECA benefits if they develop lung cancer or certain respiratory diseases after radiation exposure. A uranium miner must have developed lung cancer or specific respiratory diseases after exposure to radiation to qualify for RECA benefits. Uranium millers and ore transporters may also qualify if they meet certain exposure and disease requirements. Uranium millers must have worked in a uranium mill in specific states for at least one year between 1941 and 1971, while ore transporters must have transported uranium or vanadium-uranium ore. Millers and ore transporters may qualify for RECA benefits if they meet specific exposure and disease requirements. They must have worked in uranium mills or transporting ore from specific states between 1941 and 1971 and developed certain conditions after radiation exposure. Millers and ore transporters may qualify for RECA benefits if they worked with uranium or vanadium-uranium ore from specific states between 1941 and 1971 and developed certain conditions after radiation exposure. The DOJ's Civil Division administers the program and makes eligibility decisions on claims. Benefit claims must be submitted in writing on a standard application. The RECA program provides benefits for individuals who worked with uranium or vanadium-uranium ore between 1941 and 1971 and developed specific conditions after radiation exposure. Claimants must submit written documentation of their illnesses to qualify for benefits, with detailed requirements outlined in the RECA regulations. Native American cases have additional requirements under Section 6(d)(5) of the RECA statute. The RECA program requires written documentation on standard forms for benefits eligibility. Native American cases must consider Native American law, tradition, and custom in the application process. Application decisions are made by an assistant director at the DOJ Civil Division. The DOJ must consider Native American law, tradition, and custom in cases submitted by Native Americans for RECA benefits. Application decisions are made within 12 months, and if no decision is made, benefits are automatically approved. HHS is authorized to provide grants for RECA benefits. The DOJ Torts Branch must consider Native American law, tradition, and custom for RECA benefits. Decisions must be made within 12 months, or benefits are automatically approved. HHS provides grants for cancer screenings and medical documentation assistance for RECA claims. The HHS provides grants for cancer screenings and medical documentation assistance for RECA claims through the Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program (RESEP). There are currently six RESEP clinics operating in five states, with one clinic serving Native Americans exclusively. Applicants for RECA benefits are not required to be screened at RESEP clinics, and denied applicants can file an appeal. The Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program (RESEP) provides grants for cancer screenings and medical documentation assistance for RECA claims. There are six RESEP clinics in five states, including one for Native Americans. Applicants for RECA benefits do not need to be screened at RESEP clinics. Denied applicants can appeal to the DOJ within 60 days. Applicants denied RECA benefits can appeal to the DOJ within 60 days. An appeals officer appointed by the assistant attorney general of the Civil Division will rule on the appeal. If dissatisfied, applicants can seek judicial review in the U.S. district court. Applicants can be represented by licensed attorneys, with Native American claimants having additional representation options. The RECA program allows applicants to appeal benefit denials to the DOJ within 60 days. An appeals officer appointed by the assistant attorney general will review the appeal. Dissatisfied applicants can seek judicial review in the U.S. district court. Representation by licensed attorneys is permitted, with Native American claimants having non-attorney representation options. Non-attorney representatives may not charge fees for their services. Native American claimants can be represented by non-attorney representatives from tribal organizations, who are the only non-attorneys authorized to represent RECA claimants. Non-attorney representatives cannot charge fees for their services. Licensed attorneys representing RECA claimants are limited to collecting fees based on the date of their contract: 2% for contracts after July 10, 2000, 10% for contracts before that date, and 10% for resubmitted denied claims. Attorneys representing RECA claimants can collect fees based on the date of their contract: 2% for contracts after July 10, 2000, 10% for contracts before that date, and 10% for resubmitted denied claims. Additionally, attorneys can recover costs for unsuccessful claims and expenses for successful claims as per a 2007 U.S. court decision and subsequent regulations. Some Members of Congress are proposing legislation to expand benefits for downwinders and uranium workers under the RECA program, which has been providing benefits for 25 years. Attorneys can recover costs for unsuccessful claims and expenses for successful claims, in addition to a 2% or 10% fee based on the date of their contract. Some Members of Congress are proposing legislation to expand benefits for downwinders and uranium workers under the RECA program, which has been providing benefits for 25 years. Legislation aims to expand eligibility for downwinders and provide benefits to uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971. RECA program remains on the congressional agenda with no statutory changes since 2000. To qualify for RECA benefits as a downwinder, a person must have been present in designated counties in Arizona, Nevada, or Utah during atmospheric testing at NTS. Under current law, to qualify for RECA benefits as a downwinder, a person must have been present in designated counties in Arizona, Nevada, or Utah during atmospheric testing at NTS. Residents of other areas or new downwinder eligibility areas cannot be added to the program. Residents of areas outside the current downwinder eligibility area have expressed concern about health effects from atomic weapons testing and tried to seek compensation through civil courts. Before the creation of the RECA program in 1990, residents outside the downwinder eligibility area sought compensation through civil courts for health effects from atomic weapons testing, but were unsuccessful. Congress established the RECA program after downwinders were unable to win civil judgments against the federal government or testing contractors. Bills for compensation were first introduced in 1979 during the 96th Congress. The RECA program was created in 1990 after downwinders failed to win civil judgments for health effects from atomic testing. Bills for compensation were introduced in 1979 during the 96th Congress, aiming to provide damages to downwinders affected by atmospheric testing at NTS. H.R. 4766 from the 96th Congress in 1979 aimed to make the US liable for damages caused by atmospheric atomic testing at NTS. It would provide coverage for downwinders with cancer, onsite participants, and sheep herds affected by tests in 1953. Eligibility for downwinders included those with specific types of cancer in a defined geographical area around NTS. The affected area for downwinder eligibility in H.R. 4766 was a rectangular area around NTS from 112 degrees to 117.5 degrees longitude and from 36.5 degrees to 39 degrees latitude, including parts of Nevada, Utah, California, Arizona, Mohave, and Coconino Counties. The boundaries were proposed in a map in the Appendix. The proposed boundaries in H.R. 4766 for downwinder eligibility include areas in Nevada, Utah, California, and Arizona, specifically Mohave and Coconino Counties. The bill also aimed to hold the United States accountable for damages to affected individuals and sheep herds, as well as uranium miners, with a federal advisory board to oversee specified cancers. The bill (S. 1865) aimed to make the US liable for damages to downwinders, onsite participants, affected sheep herds, and uranium miners. It proposed a federal advisory board to add specified cancers to the list. The affected areas for downwinder eligibility included specific counties in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The bill aimed to make the US liable for damages to downwinders, onsite participants, affected sheep herds, and uranium miners. It included specific counties in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah for downwinder eligibility, with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare having the authority to add more areas. The bill aimed to make the US liable for damages to downwinders, onsite participants, affected sheep herds, and uranium miners in specific counties in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare could add more areas to the downwinder eligibility list. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) covered specific areas in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah for downwinder eligibility. The 2000 RECA amendments expanded the eligibility areas in Arizona and Utah, as shown in Table 3 and the map in the Appendix. Members of Congress have introduced various bills since then. Since the 2000 RECA amendments, efforts have been made by Members of Congress to expand downwinder eligibility areas beyond Arizona, Nevada, and Utah to include Colorado, Idaho, Montana, and New Mexico. Efforts by Members of Congress to expand downwinder eligibility areas have included bills to extend eligibility to individuals in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, and New Mexico, as well as in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah during atomic weapons testing. Legislation has also been proposed for downwinder eligibility in Guam during Pacific testing and for those affected by fallout from the Trinity test in New Mexico. In 2002, Congress responded to a mandate by considering further recovery efforts. In 2002, HRSA asked the NRC to study the health effects of radiation exposure and recommend whether the RECA downwinder area should be expanded. The National Research Council (NRC) was asked by HRSA to study the health effects of radiation exposure and recommend whether the RECA downwinder area should be expanded. The NRC concluded that decisions on additional eligibility for downwinders should not be based solely on geographic area. The NRC recommended a science-based approach to determine downwinder eligibility for RECA benefits, considering factors like where individuals lived, time spent outdoors, and consumption habits. The NTC recommended a science-based approach to determine downwinder eligibility for RECA benefits, considering factors like where individuals lived, time spent outdoors, and consumption habits, especially the ingestion of Iodine 131 through contaminated milk. The NRC report recommended using a model of probability of causation to evaluate individual claims for RECA benefits based on factors like geographic, demographic, and behavioral data. This approach would allow every person in the country to apply for benefits, moving away from solely basing downwinder eligibility on geography and a presumption of eligibility. The NRC report recommended using a model of probability of causation to evaluate individual claims for RECA benefits, estimating absorbed dose of radionuclides based on various factors. This would allow every person in the country to apply for benefits, with Congress setting the threshold for awarding benefits based on the probability of cancer caused by exposure to ionizing radiation. The NRC report recommended using a model of probability of causation to evaluate individual claims for RECA benefits, estimating absorbed dose of radionuclides based on various factors. This model, similar to methods used for eligibility under EEOICPA and VA disability compensation, would calculate the probability that specific cancer types were caused by exposure to ionizing radiation, with Congress setting the threshold for awarding benefits. No legislation has been introduced to implement this model in the RECA program. The probability of causation model, recommended by the NRC report for evaluating RECA benefits, has not been implemented in the program. Unlike EEOICPA and VA disability compensation, RECA eligibility remains based on geography rather than probability of causation. No legislation has been introduced to change this. No legislation has been introduced to change RECA downwinder eligibility from geography-based to probability of causation-based. The probability of causation model recommended by the NRC is not implemented in RECA, unlike in EEOICPA and veterans' programs. The presumptive eligibility model used by RECA may be preferred by some advocates due to the low radiation exposure levels from fallout and the limited cancer-causing effects of ionizing radiation. The eligibility model used by RECA may be favored by some advocates for compensation due to the low radiation exposure levels from fallout and the limited cancer-causing effects of ionizing radiation. The NRC's probability of causation model is likely to result in fewer successful claims, as exposure to radiation from fallout is unlikely to be a substantial contributing cause to developing cancer. The NRC's report states that exposure to radiation from fallout is unlikely to be a substantial cause of cancer, leading to few successful compensation claims for uranium workers under current law. The NRC's report concludes that few successful compensation claims for uranium workers are likely due to the limited eligibility criteria under current law, which includes a cut-off date of December 31, 1971 for exposure to radiation during uranium work. Since 1972, transporters are only eligible for compensation if the worker was exposed to radiation during uranium work before December 31, 1971. Private ownership of uranium for nuclear power plants has been legal since 1964, creating a market for mined uranium post-1971. The 2000 RECA amendments expanded eligibility criteria for compensation. Since the enactment of the Private Ownership of Special Nuclear Materials Act, private ownership of uranium for nuclear power plants has been legal, creating a market for mined uranium post-1971. Legislation has been introduced to expand RECA eligibility to uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971 and include uranium mine core drillers in the program. Research into the health effects of uranium tailing piles is also being considered. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to expand RECA eligibility to uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971, including uranium mine core drillers. Advocates argue that despite safety regulations enacted since 1971, uranium workers remain at elevated risk for radon-induced diseases. Advocates for extending RECA eligibility for uranium work after 1971 argue that despite improved safety regulations, uranium miners are still at risk for radon-induced diseases due to higher radiation exposure limits set by MSHA compared to NIOSH recommendations. The MSHA annual exposure limit for radiation of 4 WLM is higher than the NIOSH recommended limit of 1 WLM for uranium miners, allowing them to be exposed to higher levels of radon while still meeting federal safety standards. The intent of the RECA program is to provide restitution to individuals affected by fallout from atomic weapons tests and uranium miners working for the nuclear weapons program of the US Government. The RECA program aims to provide \"partial restitution\" to individuals affected by fallout from atomic weapons tests and uranium miners working for the US Government's nuclear weapons program. Expanding RECA to cover post-1971 uranium activities would include workers in the commercial uranium sector, broadening the program beyond its original scope. Expanding RECA to cover post-1971 uranium activities would extend coverage to workers in the commercial uranium sector, potentially overlapping with existing state workers' compensation systems for medical benefits and compensation in cases of commercial workplace injuries. Expanding RECA to cover post-1971 uranium activities may extend coverage to workers in the commercial uranium sector, potentially overlapping with existing state workers' compensation systems for medical benefits and compensation. Illnesses from uranium mining, milling, and ore transporting for commercial clients would likely be covered by state workers' compensation systems."
