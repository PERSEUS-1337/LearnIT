    "content": "Surface transportation authorization acts authorize spending on federal highway and mass transit programs, surface transportation safety and research, and some rail programs. The most recent multi-year authorization for federal surface transportation programs, SAFETEA-LU, expired in 2009. Since then, programs have operated on extension acts and continuing resolutions due to budget constraints. The highway trust fund has been the primary source of funding for surface transportation. The SAFETEA-LU authorization for federal surface transportation programs expired in 2009, leading to funding challenges due to declining revenues from highway taxes. Passing a multi-year bill without cutting infrastructure is a current concern. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) has been the main source of funding for surface transportation bills since 1956. However, revenues from highway taxes have decreased due to economic conditions and improved fuel efficiency. The ongoing debate revolves around passing a multi-year bill without cutting infrastructure spending, raising the gas tax, or increasing the budget deficit. Other issues being discussed include alternative finance, tolling, public-private partnerships, project delivery acceleration, and performance management. Equity in distribution is also a key question. The ongoing debate in the surface transportation bill revolves around passing a multi-year bill without cutting infrastructure spending, raising the gas tax, or increasing the budget deficit. Other issues being discussed include alternative finance, tolling, public-private partnerships, project delivery acceleration, and performance management. The question of equity in the distribution of federal spending among states remains unresolved given current revenue forecasts. The question of equity in federal spending distribution among states remains unresolved due to current revenue forecasts. The Senate passed MAP-21 on March 14, 2012, reauthorizing surface transportation programs for two years. For more details, refer to CRS Report R41512. The Senate passed MAP-21 on March 14, 2012, reauthorizing surface transportation programs for two years. The House committees reported favorably on H.R. 7, a five-year bill with a total authorization of $260 billion. The House committees reported favorably on H.R. 7, a five-year bill providing a total authorization of roughly $260 billion. The bill includes provisions to increase oil and gas production to fund highway infrastructure, controversially discontinuing funding for mass transit with Highway Trust Fund revenues. H.R. 7 differs significantly from MAP-21 in programmatic content and treatment of the Highway Trust Fund. The House passed the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012, Part II (H.R. 4348) on April 18, 2012, extending surface transportation authorizations through the end of FY2012. The bill includes provisions related to the Keystone XL Pipeline. The House passed the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012, Part II (H.R. 4348) on April 18, 2012, extending surface transportation authorizations through the end of FY2012. The bill includes provisions related to the Keystone XL Pipeline, Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund guarantee, Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act (H.R. 2273), and environmental streamlining provisions of Title III of H.R. 7. The Senate agreed to an amendment on April 24, 2012, replacing the House-passed language in H.R. 4348 with the language of MAP-21, allowing the measure to go to conference. Negotiations are expected to involve the entire substance of H.R. 7 and provisions of the extension bill. The Senate replaced the House-passed language in H.R. 4348 with MAP-21, allowing the measure to go to conference. Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman John Mica stated that negotiations will include the substance of H.R. 7 and provisions of the extension bill. Surface transportation reauthorization is a complex issue before Congress, involving multiple committees. The report analyzes H.R. 7, a complex surface transportation reauthorization bill that involves multiple committees. The highway trust fund is primarily funded by excise taxes on motor fuels, with sales taxes on tires, trucks, buses, and trailers also contributing. The highway trust fund is financed by various sources including sales taxes on tires, trucks, buses, and trailers, as well as excise taxes on motor fuels. Approximately 90% of trust fund revenue comes from fuel taxes, with 18.3 cents per gallon on gasoline and 24.3 cents per gallon on diesel. The fund consists of two accounts - highway and mass transit, with specific allocations from the fuel taxes. The Highway Trust Fund is funded by fuel taxes, with 18.3 cents per gallon on gasoline and 24.3 cents per gallon on diesel. It has two accounts - highway and mass transit, with specific allocations from the fuel taxes. The fuel tax rates were last raised in 1993, and revenues do not increase with inflation. Economic factors and improved fuel efficiency have reduced fuel tax revenues below projections. The Highway Trust Fund is funded by fuel taxes at fixed rates since 1993, leading to revenue shortfalls due to economic factors and improved fuel efficiency. This has resulted in the need for transfers from the general fund to cover a shortfall of $4.6 billion in the Highway account. The Highway Trust Fund has required multiple transfers from the general fund totaling $29.7 billion to cover revenue shortfalls. The Congressional Budget Office projects a shortfall of $4.6 billion in the Highway account by the end of FY2013, with ongoing gaps of $8-9 billion per year through FY2022. The CBO projects a shortfall of $4.6 billion in the Highway account by the end of FY2013, with gaps of $8-9 billion per year through FY2022. The mass transit account is also projected to face deficits, falling to a negative $1.2 billion shortfall by the end of FY2014 and deepening further in subsequent years. These financial challenges need to be addressed in reauthorization legislation. The Highway account, which received a $4.8 billion general fund transfer in FY2010, will face a shortfall of $1.2 billion by the end of FY2014, increasing to $5 billion by FY2015. Without an increase in fuel taxes, the trust fund system will struggle to support transportation spending, leading policymakers to consider new revenue sources or a smaller program. The Federal-Aid Highway Program faces funding challenges due to a shortfall in the Highway account. Without an increase in fuel taxes, policymakers must find new revenue sources or accept a smaller program. The Highway Program, primarily state-run, has key financial and administrative attributes that have remained consistent over the years. The Federal-Aid Highway Program, administered by FHWA, is primarily state-run with state DOTs determining spending and complying with federal guidelines. Projects require a local matching share. The state departments of transportation (state DOTs) determine spending and comply with federal guidelines for federally funded highway projects. They award contracts, oversee project development, and require a local matching share. The state/local match is 10% for Interstate System projects and 20% for other roads. FHWA notifies states of federal funds availability for four years. FHWA manages the Highway Program by distributing funds through apportionment and allocation. States receive federal funds notification for four years, with a 10% match for Interstate System projects and a 20% match for other roads. Reimbursement occurs after project approval. The states receive federal funds notification for four years through apportionment and allocation. Reimbursement is provided once a project is approved and costs are incurred, to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in the highway program. Contract authority allows for obligation without appropriation. Reimbursement for highway projects is triggered by project approval, work initiation, cost incurrence, and state submission of a voucher to FHWA. The reimbursable nature of the program aims to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Contract authority enables obligation without appropriation, legally committing the federal government to reimburse states for project costs. Limitation on obligations (ObLim) controls annual FHWA spending. The FHWA provides contract authority for highway projects, legally committing the federal government to reimburse states for project costs. The ObLim sets a limit on annual FHWA spending, controlling the total amount of contract authority that can be obligated in a fiscal year. Formula and discretionary programs receive apportioned funds for project funding. The ObLim, or obligation limitation, controls annual FHWA spending by setting a limit on contract authority. There are formula and discretionary programs for project funding, with formula programs apportioning funds among states annually based on specific factors. Discretionary programs are smaller and allocated by FHWA or earmarked by Congress. Under SAFETEA, federal-aid highway money is apportioned annually to state DOTs through core formula programs like the Interstate Maintenance Program (IM) and National Highway System (NHS), which fund most projects. Discretionary programs, smaller and allocated by FHWA or Congress, are also available. The core formula programs, such as Interstate Maintenance Program (IM) and National Highway System (NHS), receive about 80% of SAFETEA's contract authority for federal-aid highway projects. Other programs include Surface Transportation Program (STP), Highway Bridge Program (HBP), Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) Program, Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), and Equity Bonus Program (EB). The total amount authorized for each program is determined by running their respective formulas. The authorization act sets the total amount authorized for each core program and each program's formula is run to determine each state's portion of the program total. State DOTs have increasing flexibility to transfer funds between programs, except for HSIP. The authorization act sets the total amount authorized for each core program, and each state's portion is determined by running the program's formula. State DOTs have flexibility to transfer funds between programs, reducing the importance of funding formulas. Some argue that the program structure limits the use of federal highway funds. The Equity Bonus Program is the largest. The Equity Bonus Program, the largest highway program, guarantees each state a minimum share of funds regardless of funding formulas. Some state DOTs argue that program structure limits the use of federal highway funds. Transferability between programs reduces the importance of funding formulas and program eligibility distinctions. Highway Program funding can also be used for transit projects. The Equity Bonus Program ensures each state receives a minimum share of funds, regardless of funding formulas. It dilutes the policy rationales of core program formulas and includes smaller discretionary highway programs. These programs allocate funds to projects through competition. During SAFETEA, Congress earmarked most funding for smaller discretionary highway programs within the Federal-Aid Highway Program, controlled by FHWA. The term \"program\" is broadly used, with FHWA listing 59 allocated programs that allocate funds to projects through competition. During SAFETEA, Congress earmarked funding for various programs within the Federal-Aid Highway Program, administered by FHWA. The term \"program\" is broadly used, with FHWA listing 59 allocated activities, some resembling specific projects or studies. The federal transit program, managed by FTA, consists of individual programs with different funding amounts and distribution mechanisms. The federal transit program, administered by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), consists of individual programs with different funding amounts and distribution mechanisms. There are four main federal transit programs in SAFETEA, accounting for 85% of authorized transit funding. Funding in two programs is distributed by formula. The federal transit program in SAFETEA consists of four main programs, with funding distributed by formula. The Urbanized Area Formula Program provides funding to urban areas with populations of 50,000 or more, while the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program funds go towards rail modernization. The Urbanized Area Formula Program in SAFETEA accounts for 41% of authorized transit funding and provides funding to urban areas with populations of 50,000 or more. Funds can be used for various expenses including capital, planning, transit enhancements, and operations in urbanized areas with populations of up to 200,000. Fixed Guideway Modernization Program funds, 16% of authorized transit funding, are mainly for the replacement and rehabilitation of transit rail system assets. The New Starts Program and the Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Capital Program are discretionary programs, with New Starts funding available primarily on a competitive basis for new projects. The New Starts Program, accounting for 18% of transit funding, is competitive and funds new fixed guideway systems. It has also supported busways, bus rapid transit, ferries, automated guideway systems, and vintage trolleys. Additionally, a \"Small Starts\" program was enacted to fund projects with lower costs. The New Starts Program funds new fixed guideway systems and extensions, including transit rail projects, busways, bus rapid transit, ferries, automated guideway systems, and vintage trolleys. A \"Small Starts\" program was created to fund projects with total costs of $250 million or less, with $75 million or less in federal share. Small Starts projects receive $200 million annually from the New Starts authorization starting in FY2007. The Small Starts program funds projects with a total cost of $250 million or less, with a federal share of $75 million or less. Bus Program funds are used to purchase buses and related equipment, as well as for building facilities like administrative and maintenance buildings, transfer facilities, bus shelters, and park-and-ride stations. These funds were previously earmarked in legislation but are now allocated by the FTA. Highway transportation funding, including various programs like Rural Formula, JARC, Elderly and Disabilities grants, and New Freedom Program, is now allocated by the FTA. Highway safety is mainly the states' responsibility, with it being the leading cause of transportation-related fatalities and injuries in the US. Highway safety is primarily the responsibility of the states, with federal highway safety programs established to assist in improving highway safety. Three DOT agencies administer these programs authorized in SAFETEA. The states are primarily responsible for highway safety, with federal programs established to assist. Three DOT agencies administer these programs focusing on driver behavior, vehicle safety, commercial driver qualifications, and roadway design. NHTSA provides grants to support states. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) focuses on driver behavior and vehicle safety, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) focuses on commercial driver qualifications and commercial vehicle safety, and FHWA through the Highway Safety Improvement Program focuses on roadway design. NHTSA provides grants to states for traffic safety efforts, regulates motor vehicle safety, and oversees federal grant funds. States must submit approved highway safety plans to receive federal traffic safety funds. NHTSA provides grants to states for traffic safety efforts, regulates motor vehicle safety, and oversees federal grant funds by requiring approved highway safety plans. States must identify safety problems, set goals, and establish performance measures to receive federal traffic safety funds. NHTSA also offers training and technical assistance to states. NHTSA provides grants to states through various programs to address safety problems, set goals, and establish performance measures for traffic safety. The State and Community Highway Safety Program (Section 402 program) and other incentive grant programs support state efforts to improve data collection, reduce speeding, increase seat belt usage, combat drunk and drugged driving. The Section 402 program and other grant programs support state efforts to improve traffic safety by reducing speeding, increasing seat belt usage, combating drunk and drugged driving, and discouraging unsafe driving behaviors. FMCSA focuses on promoting commercial motor vehicle safety through regulation, enforcement, training, and technical assistance. FMCSA promotes commercial motor vehicle safety through regulation, enforcement, training, and technical assistance to reduce drunk and drugged driving, motorcycle crashes, and school bus crashes. It also administers safety grant programs for truck and motor coach operations. The HSIP program aims to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries through highway improvements. The HSIP program administers motor carrier safety grant programs to ensure the safety of truck and motor coach operations. It aims to reduce traffic fatalities and serious injuries by making improvements to roadways, with each state receiving funding based on specific criteria. Additionally, there are dollar set-asides for the Railway-Highway Grade Crossing Hazard Elimination Program within HSIP. The HSIP program aims to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries by improving roadways. States receive funding based on road lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and traffic fatalities. SAFETEA extended funding mechanisms to ensure minimum annual funding levels. SAFETEA extended funding mechanisms to guarantee certain annual funding levels for high-risk rural roads, protecting funds from being used elsewhere. It also specified annual funding levels for FY2005 through FY2009 to ensure funding for construction and operational improvements. SAFETEA extended funding mechanisms to guarantee certain annual funding levels for high-risk rural roads, protecting funds from being used elsewhere. It also specified annual funding levels for FY2005 through FY2009 to ensure funding for construction and operational improvements by amending the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The budget firewalls set in the Budget Enforcement Act ended in 2002, but appropriators honored those guarantees over the life of SAFETEA. The Budget Enforcement Act set funding guarantees for high-risk rural roads under SAFETEA, with protections against lower funding levels. Appropriators honored these guarantees until the House eliminated the rule in the 112th Congress, removing the last protection. RABA allows for adjustments to funding levels based on annual highway receipts. The House eliminated the rule in the 112th Congress, removing the last protection for funding guarantees under SAFETEA. RABA allows for adjustments to funding levels based on annual highway receipts, despite revenues consistently falling below guarantee levels. Despite revenues consistently falling below guarantee levels, Congress has never allowed a negative RABA calculation to result in funding cuts for highway accounts. The issue of RABA has been considered moot in recent years due to general fund transfers supplementing the HTF. However, there may still be consideration for a mechanism to align spending with receipts in reauthorization. In recent years, the issue of RABA leading to funding reductions has been considered moot due to general fund transfers supplementing the HTF. However, there may still be a need for a mechanism to align spending with receipts in reauthorization. The Budget Control Act requires sequestration of certain funding authorizations if a special joint committee fails to reach an agreement on spending reductions. The Budget Control Act mandates sequestration of funding authorizations if a special joint committee fails to agree on spending reductions. The \"Super Committee\" announced its failure to reach an agreement in November 2011. Exemptions under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 suggest that sequestration may not significantly impact surface transportation spending beyond FY2012. Sequestration under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 may not greatly reduce surface transportation spending authorized beyond FY2012. Exempted programs include Federal-Aid Highways, Highway Traffic Safety Grants, NHTSA operations, Motor Carrier Safety, Transit Formula and Bus Grants. The $739 million of annual contract authority exempt from obligation limitations may be subject to sequester, including the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program. SAFETEA expired in 2009, and surface transportation programs have been operating on extension legislation. The Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program, supported by general fund revenues, may be subject to sequester. SAFETEA expired in 2009, and surface transportation programs have been operating on extension legislation. The House-passed STEA-II extends authorization of the HTF and federal surface transportation programs until September 30, 2012, with new legislative provisions included.

The Senate agreed to substitute the full text of MAP-21, enabling the measure to go to conference. The House and Senate agreed to send the transportation bill to conference by substituting the full text of MAP-21 for the House-passed language. Negotiations will involve the entire substance of H.R. 7, with provisions needing to fall within the \"scope of the differences\" between the House and Senate versions. Infrastructure Committee Chairman John Mica has stated that negotiations for the transportation bill will include the entire substance of H.R. 7. Provisions in conference proposals must align with the \"scope of the differences\" between the House and Senate versions. Any provisions in conference reports that are out of scope may face points of order in both chambers. The conference on H.R. 4348 may include 7 new provisions not in the Senate or House versions. Members may question the scope of the conference. House can waive rules on conference report content with a majority vote, while Senate needs 60 Senators' support. Out-of-scope provisions may face points of order in both chambers. The Senate can waive the rule on conference report content with the support of 60 Senators. STEA-II includes provisions unrelated to surface transportation programs, such as the North American Energy Access Act. This Act transfers permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Title II of STEA-II extends authorization for surface transportation programs and activities. It includes the North American Energy Access Act (H.R. 3548), transferring permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The commission must issue a permit within 30 days of enactment. Additionally, it states that the final environmental impact statement from the Secretary of State in 2011 satisfies all requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. Title II of STEA-II extends authorization for surface transportation programs and activities, including the North American Energy Access Act (H.R. 3548) transferring permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The commission must issue a permit within 30 days of enactment. It also establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund financed by penalties from the Deepwater Horizon incident. The bill establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, funded by penalties from the Deepwater Horizon incident. The fund would be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury, with 35% going to Gulf Coast states, 60% to the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, and 5% for research. The bill establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, funded by penalties from the Deepwater Horizon incident. The fund would be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury, with distribution as follows: 35% to Gulf Coast states, 60% to the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, and 5% for research. The House-passed H.R. 4348 would require a future act of Congress for revenue distribution, unlike the Senate-passed version. The House-passed H.R. 4348 requires a future act of Congress for revenue distribution, unlike the Senate-passed version. It would restrict the use of funds to harbor maintenance programs and includes the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act. Title V of the bill adds the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act, allowing states to implement coal combustion residuals permit programs. Title VI includes provisions from H.R. 7 to expedite transportation project delivery. Both House and Senate bills aim to accelerate project delivery and reduce earmarks. The House and Senate bills aim to expedite transportation project delivery and reduce earmarks. MAP-21 is a two-year reauthorization bill that makes substantial changes to the federal highway program. MAP-21 is a two-year reauthorization bill that aims to expedite project delivery and reduce highway programs by two-thirds. It would make significant changes to the structure, formulas, and funding distribution of the federal highway program, with a total authorization of $39.5 billion for FY2012 and $40.5 billion for FY2013. Formula factors under individual programs would be eliminated, and each state would receive a share of the authorized funds. The MAP-21 bill authorizes $39.5 billion for FY2012 and $40.5 billion for FY2013 for the Federal-Aid Highway Program. It eliminates formula factors under individual programs and apportions funds to states based on their past allocations. The MAP-21 bill authorizes funds for the Federal-Aid Highway Program based on past allocations, reducing federal and congressional influence on program direction and project selection. The MAP-21 bill reduces federal and congressional influence on program direction and project selection by changing the programmatic structure and broadening eligibility across programs. This shift eliminates the previous influence of Members of Congress on surface transportation through program formulas or earmarking. National interests and needs are now driven by federal planning, performance management, project delivery, and eligibility requirements. Transferability between core programs is limited to 20% of each formula program's apportionment. MAP-21 reduces federal and congressional influence on program direction and project selection by broadening eligibility across programs. Transferability between core programs is limited to 20% of each formula program's apportionment. The bill eliminates nearly all discretionary grant programs under FHWA's control and reduces the number of programs by two-thirds, mainly by shifting program eligibility to core programs. MAP-21 would reduce the number of programs by two-thirds, mainly by shifting program eligibility to core programs. Discretionary grant programs under FHWA's control would be eliminated, with the Transportation Enhancements Program rolled into the CMAQ program. States can use TE funds for non-TE CMAQ uses after building up an unspent balance. Some TE-type projects would be eligible for funding in other proposed programs, including the National Freight Program. The bill reduces programs by two-thirds, shifting eligibility to core programs. It eliminates some controversial TE uses and allows states to use TE funds for non-TE CMAQ uses after building up an unspent balance. The National Freight Program increases funding for freight projects and the TIFIA program funding is increased nearly ten-fold. Tolling of federally funded roads and bridges is not addressed in the bill. The Senate bill proposes increasing funding for freight projects by ten-fold through the TIFIA program. However, it does not address tolling of federally funded roads and bridges. The House bill would provide modest increases for federal-aid highways from $40.4 billion in FY2013 to $41.0 billion in FY2016. The House bill proposes a five-year reauthorization with modest increases in funding for federal-aid highways and annual funding for research and education. It includes folding existing programs into the National Highway System and retaining programs for congestion mitigation and highway safety improvements. The House bill proposes a five-year reauthorization with increased funding for federal-aid highways and research/education. It consolidates programs into the National Highway System, retains congestion mitigation and highway safety programs, and reduces the number of distinct programs by two-thirds. The Equity Bonus program guarantees a 94% state rate of return on payments to the HTF, and the Mass Transit Account is renamed the Alternative Transportation Account, providing $2.267 billion annually for mass transit. The Equity Bonus program guarantees a 94% state rate of return on payments to the HTF. The Mass Transit Account is renamed the Alternative Transportation Account, providing $2.267 billion annually for mass transit and highway programs. Fuel taxes credited to the Mass Transit Account would be redirected to the Highway Account. Provisions under the streamlining title would extensively change NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects. The House bill would redirect 2.86 cents per gallon of fuel taxes from the Mass Transit Account to the Highway Account, providing $2.267 billion annually for highway programs. The bill also includes provisions to change NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects, exempting projects costing less than $10 million or with federal funding constituting 15% or less of total costs. Additionally, TIFIA funding would increase nearly ten-fold under the bill. The House bill proposes changes to NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects, exempting those costing less than $10 million or with federal funding at 15% or less of total costs. TIFIA funding would also increase significantly. MAP-21 would fund the Federal Transit Administration and programs at current levels, with the Highway Trust Fund providing 79.9% of funding and the general fund providing 20.1%. The HTF would provide 79.9% of the funding for transit programs, with the general fund providing 20.1%. MAP-21 provisions include $10.458 billion annually for transit programs, creation of the State of Good Repair program, elimination of the Bus and Bus Facilities program, and modification of the New Starts process. The Bus and Bus Facilities program would be eliminated, with funding redirected from the New Starts program. H.R. 7 provisions include renaming the Mass Transit Account to the Alternative Transportation Account and authorizing $10.458 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013 through FY2016. H.R. 7 provisions include renaming the Mass Transit Account to the Alternative Transportation Account (ATA), redirecting motor fuel taxes to the Highway Account, transferring $40 billion from the general fund to fund the ATA, and eliminating various programs such as the Clean Fuels Grant Program and the Transit in Parks Program. The ATA would be funded by transferring $40 billion from the general fund and eliminating various programs such as the Clean Fuels Grant Program and the Transit in Parks Program. Additionally, MAP-21 includes provisions for developing a national rail plan and a rolling stock equipment pool for corridor intercity passenger services. MAP-21 includes provisions for a national rail plan, rolling stock equipment pool for passenger services, and positive train control. It also amends the RRIF program for freight rail financing.

The finance title of the Senate bill extends highway-related taxes through FY2015 and extends highway trust fund expenditure authority through FY2013, with provisions to raise revenue or provide offsets for $13.872 billion over ten-and-a-half fiscal years for the Highway Trust Fund. The Senate bill extends highway-related taxes through FY2015 and trust fund expenditure authority through FY2013. It includes provisions to raise revenue for the Highway Trust Fund, totaling $13.872 billion over ten-and-a-half fiscal years. This includes transfers from various sources such as the Leaking Underground Storage Tank trust fund and Gas Guzzler Tax. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is set to receive $9.279 billion in transfers in FY2012-FY2013. This includes funds from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) trust fund balance, Gas Guzzler Tax, revocation of passports of tax delinquents, Medicare provider payments, future import tariffs on automotive products, totaling $13.872 billion over ten-and-a-half fiscal years. Tax revenues totaling $5.74 billion over 10 years will be allocated to the Highway Trust Fund. This includes funds from revoking passports of tax delinquents, levying Medicare provider payments, transferring future import tariffs on automotive products, changing tax treatment of securities in corporate reorganizations, and allowing the IRS to levy federal employees' Thrift Savings Accounts for tax liabilities. $244 million (over 10 years) from a change in tax treatment of securities in corporate reorganizations; $25 million (over 10 years) from allowing the IRS to levy federal employees' Thrift Savings Accounts for tax liabilities; $363 million (FY2014-FY2022) from pension asset transfers to retiree health accounts and applying Section 420 of the U.S. tax code to life insurance benefits; $9.467 billion (over 10 years) from pension funding stabilization. $4.970 billion transfer from the Treasury general fund to the HTF ($2.183 billion in FY2012, $2.277 billion in FY2013, and $510 million in FY2014); $459 million (over 10 years) from allowing federal agencies to offer phased retirement. The curr_chunk discusses various sources of revenue including changes in interest rates, transfers from the Treasury general fund to the HTF, phased retirement, sale of life insurance policies, taxes on cigarette manufacturers, and delaying worldwide interest expense allocation. The curr_chunk discusses revenue provisions totaling $5.992 billion over 10 years, including measures such as the sale of life insurance policies, taxes on cigarette manufacturers, delaying interest expense allocation, and special measures against money laundering. These provisions have raised concerns as they exceed the needed offset for HTF revenue and MAP-21 spending levels. The curr_chunk discusses authorizing special measures against money laundering, with revenue provisions exceeding the offset needed for HTF revenue and MAP-21 spending levels. The Finance Committee also reported favorably on provisions costing money, including changing the Small Issuer Exception. The Finance Committee reported favorably on provisions costing money, including changes to the Small Issuer Exception, resulting in reductions of $761 million, $215 million, and $139 million over 10 years. The Finance Committee reported favorably on provisions costing money, including changes resulting in reductions of $761 million over 10 years. This includes -$215 million from bonds not treated as a tax preference, -$139 million from extending employer-provided benefits parity, and -$305 million from the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Act. The Senate bill includes provisions for TRIP bonds through state infrastructure banks and modifies the Transportation Access for All Americans Act. The Senate bill includes provisions for TRIP bonds through state infrastructure banks and modifies the Transportation Access for All Americans Act by changing the depreciation period for long-term highway leases. This may impact the attractiveness of highway privatization to private-sector investors. The bill proposes changing the depreciation period for long-term highway leases from 15 to 45 years, potentially reducing the attractiveness of highway privatization for private-sector investors. It also ensures that the amortization period for the franchise right to collect tolls is not less than the lease term or 15 years, whichever is greater. The Finance Committee is concerned that the current 15-year amortization period for toll collection rights is often shorter than the lease term. The Finance Committee is concerned about the mismatch between the 15-year amortization period for toll collection rights and the longer lease terms. The bill proposes changing the depreciation period for long-term highway leases to 45 years and establishing a \"solvency account\" for excess funds in the Highway Trust Fund. The revenue provisions for MAP-21, as amended, include a placeholder for the RESTORE Act. A \"solvency account\" would be established to transfer excess funds from the Highway Trust Fund to ensure financial cushioning for both the highway and mass transit accounts. The Senate bill proposes using the LUST trust fund as a new revenue source. The Senate bill proposes using the LUST trust fund as a new revenue source to meet the needs of the Highway Trust Fund. Congress established the LUST trust fund in 1986 to address groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks. The fund receives revenues from a 0.1 cent per gallon excise tax on gasoline and diesel fuels. The LUST trust fund was established in 1986 to address groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks. It receives revenues from a 0.1 cent per gallon excise tax on gasoline and diesel fuels, supporting environmental contamination investigation and cleanup programs. The LUST trust fund, established in 1986, is funded by a per gallon excise tax on gasoline and diesel fuels. Annual appropriations support environmental contamination investigation and cleanup programs. States use the fund to oversee corrective actions by responsible parties and conduct actions in emergencies. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded state and EPA responsibilities. The LUST trust fund, established in 1986, is funded by a per gallon excise tax on gasoline and diesel fuels. It supports environmental contamination investigation and cleanup programs. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded state and EPA responsibilities, authorizing the use of trust fund monies for UST leak prevention and detection programs. Over 85% of the 501,000 reported releases from leaking petroleum tanks have been addressed, leaving a backlog of 88,000 releases requiring cleanup. The LUST trust fund, established in 1986, is funded by a per gallon excise tax on gasoline and diesel fuels. It supports environmental contamination investigation and cleanup programs. Over 85% of the 501,000 reported releases from leaking petroleum tanks have been addressed, leaving a backlog of 88,000 releases requiring cleanup. The fund had an unobligated balance of $3.392 billion at the beginning of FY2012, with estimated interest payments and tax receipts totaling $298 million. Congress has appropriated approximately $113 million from the trust fund in recent fiscal years. The LUST trust fund had an unobligated balance of $3.392 billion at the beginning of FY2012. In FY2012, the fund is estimated to receive $117 million in interest payments and $181 million in tax receipts. Congress has appropriated approximately $113 million from the trust fund in recent years, with states receiving a minimum of 80% as grants. EPA uses the remainder for its responsibilities, including implementing the program on Indian lands. States' LUST programs have primarily relied on nonfederal fund sources due to low appropriations. In FY2012, the LUST trust fund had an unobligated balance of $3.392 billion. Congress has appropriated approximately $113 million from the trust fund, with states receiving a minimum of 80% as grants. States' LUST programs have relied on nonfederal fund sources due to low appropriations. Section 40301 of the Senate bill would transfer $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012. Section 40302 would appropriate one-third of future LUST trust fund receipts to the highway trust fund. The Senate bill proposes transferring $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012. Additionally, one-third of future LUST trust fund receipts would be appropriated to the highway trust fund, providing an estimated $3.685 billion over ten years. The LUST trust fund expenditure authority is set to expire on March 31, 2012. The Senate bill proposes transferring funds from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund, providing $3.685 billion over ten years. The bill would extend the LUST trust fund expenditure authority and reauthorize highway taxes through FY2016. The Senate bill proposes extending the authority of the highway trust fund through September 30, 2013. H.R. 7 includes provisions for reauthorizing HTF expenditure authority through FY2016 and extending existing highway taxes through FY2018. Transfers from the general fund to the HTF would need to be fully offset in both budget authority and outlays. H.R. 7 extends highway taxes through FY2018 and requires future transfers to the HTF to be fully offset. The bill aims to fill revenue gaps and reconfigure the highway trust fund, including $40 billion from the general fund. The finance provisions of H.R. 7 reconfigure the highway trust fund by filling revenue gaps with revenue increases or offsets. Unlike the Senate bill, H.R. 7 does not allocate balances or revenues from the LUST trust fund to the Highway Trust Fund, but instead extends the LUST trust fund until October 1, 2016. $40 billion of general fund resources for the proposed alternative transportation account in H.R. 7. It extends the LUST trust fund until October 1, 2016, and directs federal revenues from energy leasing into the Highway Trust Fund. H.R. 7 aimed to allocate federal revenues from energy leasing and production into the Highway Trust Fund, based on the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The House approved these provisions separately before incorporating them into H.R. 7. The House approved energy leasing and production provisions on February 16, 2012, under a rule to be included in H.R. 7 if passed. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act governs offshore energy development, managed by the Department of the Interior. This program allows leasing for oil and gas resources in federal ocean areas, generating significant federal revenue. The Department of the Interior leases rights for oil and gas development in federal ocean areas, generating $6.5 billion in federal receipts in FY2011. Revenue from offshore lease programs is allocated to various programs, including the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the National Historic Preservation Fund. H.R. 7 renames the mass transit account of the HTF to the alternative transportation account and allocates funds to various programs, including the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the National Historic Preservation Fund. Additionally, Gulf Coast states receive additional funds from specified leases. H.R. 7 renames the mass transit account of the HTF to the alternative transportation account and allocates $40 billion to it. It transfers motor fuels taxes to the highway account and includes Title XVI for offsetting revenues. Gulf Coast states receive additional funds from specified leases. The Senate bill, MAP-21, allocates $40 billion to the alternative transportation account and transfers motor fuels taxes to the highway account. It proposes total authorizations of $80.8 billion over two years and does not reinstate TEA-21 or SAFETEA funding. MAP-21 proposes total authorizations of $80.8 billion over two years, eliminating the Equity Bonus Program and highway program earmarks. It guarantees a state share based on SAFETEA and a 95 cent return on each dollar paid to the highway account. Section 4001 includes Highway Spending Controls. The bill does not reinstate TEA-21 or SAFETEA funding firewalls. MAP-21 eliminates the Equity Bonus Program and includes a provision for Highway Spending Controls to ensure the solvency of the highway account of the HTF. The \"ratchet mechanism\" in 4001, Highway Spending Controls, aims to maintain the solvency of the highway account of the HTF by adjusting the distribution to states if the account balance is projected to fall below certain levels in FY2012 or FY2013. This adjustment involves reducing the FY2012 ObLim to prevent the shortfall, with withdrawn funds lapsing immediately and a corresponding rescission of contract authority. Similar calculations will be made for subsequent years after FY2012. The \"ratchet mechanism\" in 4001 aims to adjust distribution to states if the HTF balance is projected to fall below certain levels in FY2012 or FY2013. This involves reducing the FY2012 ObLim to prevent shortfall, with withdrawn funds lapsing immediately and a corresponding rescission of contract authority. Similar calculations will be made for subsequent years after FY2012, but only under year-long appropriations bills, not short-term continuing resolutions. This provision is related to the pending HTF shortfall under MAP-21 spending levels. The provision in the years after FY2012 requires a calculation to be made under year-long appropriations bills, not short-term continuing resolutions, related to the pending HTF shortfall under MAP-21 spending levels. It commits the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to keeping spending within the means of the HTF, potentially increasing pressure to find additional revenue options to make up the shortfall. Implementing the ratchet mechanism could face resistance in Congress if trigger HTF balances are breached. H.R. 7 proposes a total federal-aid highway program authorization of $205 billion. Congress has a history of overriding negative RABA calculations by drawing down the positive balance in the HTF. Implementing the ratchet mechanism may face resistance in Congress if trigger HTF balances are breached. H.R. 7 proposes a $205 billion federal-aid highway program authorization. Despite negative RABA calculations, Congress has overridden reductions by using the positive balance in the HTF. The bill includes HTF obligation limitations for FY2013 to FY2016 and introduces funding from an Alternative Transportation Account. The highway program authorization in H.R. 7 is $205 billion over five years, with specific obligation limitations for FY2013 to FY2016. Additionally, the bill introduces funding from an Alternative Transportation Account and includes a modified Equity Bonus Program. The Alternative Transportation Account in H.R. 7 provides an additional obligation limitation of $2.7 billion annually for FY2013-FY2016. It includes a modified Equity Bonus Program with a guarantee that each state's total highway grants will equal at least 94% of the motor fuel taxes paid into the HTF. The program authorization is capped at $3.9 billion per year and funds various highway programs. The House bill includes an obligation limitation of $2.707 billion annually for FY2013-FY2016 for various highway programs, such as CMAQ, Ferry Boats, Puerto Rico Highways, and Territorial Highway Program. It also allows expanded tolling of the Interstate system and federal participation in projects to increase highway capacity. The House bill includes an obligation limitation of $2.707 billion annually for FY2013-FY2016 for highway programs, allowing expanded tolling of the Interstate system and federal participation in projects to increase highway capacity. H.R. 7 does not include earmarks and details of the highway authorizations can be found in Figure A-2. Unlike previous acts, MAP-21 does not set core programs' authorization levels and funding separately. The House bill allows for expanded tolling of the Interstate system and federal participation in projects to increase highway capacity under H.R. 7. Unlike previous acts, MAP-21 determines state apportionments for major programs using a single methodology. Initial amounts are calculated based on the total available for apportionment. MAP-21 determines state apportionments for major programs using a single methodology. Initial amounts are calculated based on the total available for apportionment and adjusted to ensure each state's combined apportionments will not be less than 95% of estimated tax payments made by highway users. The initial amounts for state apportionments under MAP-21 are determined based on each state's share of total nationwide apportionments and adjusted to guarantee that each state's combined apportionments will not fall below 95% of estimated tax payments made by highway users. Adjustments may not be necessary due to the excess of federal highway spending over Highway Trust Fund revenues for FY2005-FY2009. Additionally, an amount is allocated based on each state's CMAQ percentage of total apportionments for FY2009, plus 10% of the state's Surface Transportation Program apportionment. The initial amounts for state apportionments under MAP-21 are determined based on each state's share of total nationwide apportionments and adjusted to ensure each state's combined apportionments will not fall below 95% of estimated tax payments made by highway users. Adjustments may not be necessary due to the excess of federal highway spending over Highway Trust Fund revenues for FY2005-FY2009. Additionally, an amount is allocated based on each state's CMAQ percentage of total apportionments for FY2009, plus 10% of the state's Surface Transportation Program apportionment. The new CMAQ program receives a set-aside amount from the state's Surface Transportation Program funding for FY2009. The metropolitan planning amount is determined based on a state's apportionment under Title 23 Section 134 for FY2009. The remaining amount of each state's initial amount is divided among core programs, with 58% going to the National Highway Performance Program. The state's apportionment under Title 23 Section 134 for FY2009 is multiplied by the adjusted initial amount calculated in the first two steps. The remaining amount of each state's initial amount is divided among core programs: 58% for the National Highway Performance Program, 29.3% for the Transportation Mobility Program, 7% for the Highway Safety Improvement Program, and 5.7% for the National Freight Program. Further adjustments to state apportioned amounts are based on privatized highway lane miles and vehicle miles traveled on privatized highways, applying only to formerly publicly operated toll roads. The provision would reduce state apportionments for privatized toll roads based on privatized lane mileage and vehicle miles traveled on those highways. The provision would reduce state apportionments for privatized toll roads based on privatized lane mileage and vehicle miles traveled on those highways, affecting states like Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado. The provision would reduce state apportionments for privatized toll roads based on lane mileage and vehicle miles traveled, affecting Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado. Apportionments for other states would increase, with Illinois seeing a 0.087% reduction, Indiana a 4.375% reduction, and Colorado a 0.045% reduction. All other states would see a 0.115% increase in apportionments. The apportionments for Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado would be reduced by 0.087%, 4.375%, and 0.045% respectively, while all other states would see a 0.115% increase. The Equity Bonus Program historically addressed concerns about federal highway spending proportionality, but MAP-21 does not have a similar program. The Equity Bonus Program historically addressed concerns about federal highway spending proportionality by adding funds to bring all states up to a minimum percentage return on tax payments. MAP-21, however, does not have a similar program but determines the initial amount for each state based on their share of total funding during FY2005-FY2009. Adjustments are in place to ensure all states receive at least a 95% rate of return on their payments to the HTF. The initial amount for each state is determined based on their share of total funding during FY2005-FY2009 to address the donor-donee issue. An adjustment mechanism ensures all states receive at least a 95% rate of return on their payments to the HTF. If Congress does not provide sufficient funding, adjustments may be necessary to guarantee the 95% return. The nationwide rate of return for FY2005-FY2009 was $1.23 on the dollar, potentially lifting all donor states above the 95% level. If Congress does not provide sufficient funding, adjustments may be needed to ensure a 95% return. Some states prefer using state return on payments to the HTF for the \"initial amount\" calculation, rather than their share of total FY2005-FY2009 funding due to earmarking legacy issues. SAFETEA had 6,372 earmarks valued at $24.3 billion, with 67% of $22.1 billion for highway earmarks. Some states prefer using state return on payments to the HTF for the \"initial amount\" calculation, rather than their share of total FY2005-FY2009 funding due to earmarking legacy issues. SAFETEA included 6,372 earmarks valued at $24.3 billion, with 67% of funding for highway earmarks being \"below the line,\" reducing the state's Equity Bonus distribution. 67% of highway earmark funding was \"below the line,\" reducing state Equity Bonus distribution. The remaining 33% was \"above the line,\" increasing funds to receiving states. Extension legislation did not continue individual earmarks, but states benefiting from above-the-line earmarks saw higher base amounts under extensions. MAP-21 eliminated project earmarks. Under MAP-21, states that previously received above-the-line earmarks benefited from higher base amounts, as the apportionment calculation is based on their share of funding from SAFETEA years. MAP-21 removed project earmarks, leading to a more equitable distribution of highway program funding among states. MAP-21's apportionment calculation is based on states' share of funding from SAFETEA years, benefiting states with above-the-line earmarks. The unequal distribution of earmarks under SAFETEA was controversial. MAP-21 reduces funding programs by two-thirds to around 30 programs. The distribution of earmarks among Members of Congress and states was controversial under MAP-21. The number of funding programs was reduced by two-thirds to approximately 30, with eligibilities absorbed into core programs. The five core programs plus metropolitan transportation planning would be authorized at $39.143 billion for FY2012 and $39.806 billion for FY2013. The number of funding programs was reduced by two-thirds to around 30, with most eligibilities absorbed into new core programs. The core programs, including metropolitan transportation planning, would be authorized at $39.143 billion for FY2012 and $39.806 billion for FY2013. The NHPP would receive $20.5 billion for FY2012 and $21 billion for FY2013 to improve the National Highway System. The NHPP program, part of the restructured Federal-Aid Highway program, would receive $20.5 billion for FY2012 and $21 billion for FY2013. It aims to improve the National Highway System by combining three core programs and focusing on achieving national performance goals for infrastructure condition, safety, mobility, and freight movement. The NHPP program, part of the Federal-Aid Highway program, would combine three core programs to improve the National Highway System. It includes projects to achieve national performance goals for infrastructure condition, safety, mobility, and freight movement, as well as construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance of bridges, tunnels, and ferry facilities. The NHPP program focuses on improving the National Highway System through projects for infrastructure condition, safety, mobility, and freight movement. It includes construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance of bridges, tunnels, ferry facilities, bicycle infrastructure, pedestrian walkways, and environmental restoration within NHS corridors. States are limited to spending 40% of their NHPP apportionment average on these projects. The NHPP program focuses on improving the National Highway System through projects for infrastructure condition, safety, mobility, and freight movement. It includes construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance of bridges, tunnels, ferry facilities, bicycle transportation infrastructure, pedestrian walkways, traffic monitoring, intelligent transportation systems, and environmental restoration within NHS corridors. States would have to develop National Highway System asset management plans with performance metrics and targets, with a focus on system maintenance. States are limited to spending 40% of their NHPP apportionment average on new capacity. If bridge conditions fall below minimum standards, funds would be transferred from other specified areas. The NHPP program requires states to develop asset management plans for the National Highway System, focusing on maintenance and performance metrics. If bridge conditions fall below minimum standards, funds would be transferred from other programs. This program aims to improve federal-aid highways and bridges on public roads, replacing SAFETEA's Surface Transportation Program. The Transportation Modernization Program (TMP) would transfer funds from specified programs to improve federal-aid highways and bridges on public roads. It replaces SAFETEA's Surface Transportation Program, excluding the TE set-aside and off-NHS system component of the Highway Bridge Program. TMP authorization is around $10.5 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013, with funds eligible for various transportation uses. The Transportation Modernization Program (TMP) authorizes roughly $10.5 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013. TMP funds are eligible for various transportation uses, including transit, carpool programs, congestion pricing, recreational trails, ferryboats, border infrastructure, scenic roads, truck parking, safe routes to school, and natural habitat mitigation efforts. TMP funds can be used for various transportation projects such as pricing, planning, enhancement activities, recreational trails, ferryboats, border infrastructure, scenic roads, truck parking, safe routes to school, and natural habitat mitigation efforts. Eligibilities from discontinued SAFETEA programs are also included. Maintenance and improvement of public roads are eligible within certain conditions. The Transportation Mobility Program (TMP) funds can be used for natural habitat and wetlands mitigation efforts related to projects under Title 23 U.S.C. Improvement to transportation facilities like freight railroads and intermodal facilities is eligible under specified conditions. States could face penalties if the total deck area of deficient bridges increases. Fifty percent of each state's apportionment is to be sub-apportioned within the state. The Transportation Mobility Program (TMP) funds are allocated for the improvement of public roads near international borders with federally owned vehicles comprising over 50% of traffic. States may incur penalties if deficient bridge deck area increases. Funds are sub-apportioned within states based on population distribution in different areas. The state's apportionment is based on population distribution in urbanized areas, areas with populations above 5,000, and other areas. The Appalachian Development Highway System program would be eliminated, giving states more flexibility in spending. CMAQ would be expanded by absorbing eligibilities of discontinued programs. The Appalachian Development Highway System program would be eliminated, giving states more flexibility in spending. CMAQ funding would be expanded to include demand-shifting projects like telecommuting and ridesharing, receiving roughly $3.3 billion annually under MAP-21. Under MAP-21, CMAQ funding would increase to $3.3 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013, expanding eligibility to include demand-shifting projects like telecommuting and ridesharing. HSIP funding would remain largely unchanged, supporting safety improvements to road infrastructure. The High Risk Rural Roads Program and the Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Program would be abolished under the new NFP program, which aims to improve road infrastructure safety and performance. Funding for HSIP would remain at $2.5 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013. The NFP program, funded at $2 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013, aims to improve the national freight network. The program would abolish the High Risk Rural Roads Program and the Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Program. The MAP-21 program, funded at $2 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013, aims to improve the national freight network. It includes a discussion on the \"Freight Initiative\" and reduces the maximum percentage of funding that states can transfer between programs. Section 1507 of the bill prohibits the transfer of TMP funding suballocated by population. H.R. 7 would consolidate or eliminate many programs under MAP-21, retaining more of the core program structure while expanding the National Highway System Program and the Surface Transportation Program. The bill would prohibit transfers of TMP funding suballocated by population but allow transfers among core formula programs. H.R. 7 would consolidate or eliminate many programs, retaining more of the core program structure while expanding the National Highway System Program and the Surface Transportation Program. The bill would eliminate the 10% STP set-aside for Transportation Enhancements and absorb the Interstate Maintenance program into the National Highway System Program. Highway Safety Improvement Program would be retained. The Highway Bridge Program would be consolidated into the National Highway System Program under H.R. 7. The 10% STP set-aside for Transportation Enhancements is eliminated, but the Highway Safety Improvement Program is retained. The obligation limitations for core highway programs total $150.7 billion for FY2013 through FY2016, with an additional $8 billion provided for Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality. The bill consolidates the Highway Bridge Program into the National Highway System Program. The obligation limitations for core highway programs total $150.7 billion for FY2013 through FY2016, with an additional $8 billion for Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality. H.R. 7 expands funding for the NHS program to help maintain and repair the Interstate Highway system. H.R. 7, the largest formula program in the bill ($70.4 billion for FY2013-FY2016), would expand funding for the National Highway System Program to cover maintenance and repair of the Interstate Highway system and bridges on the NHS. Only projects on the NHS would be eligible for funding, and they must support national performance goals. (For state-by-state apportionments under H.R. 7, refer to Figure A-8 and Figure A-9). H.R. 7 would authorize $42.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014 for the Surface Transportation Program (STP), which would focus on the repair of the Interstate Highway system and bridges on the National Highway System (NHS). Only projects on the NHS would be eligible for funding, and states would need to participate in developing state asset management plans. The Surface Transportation Program (STP) under H.R. 7 would authorize $42.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014, broadening its purpose to include the construction, inspection, rehabilitation, and replacement of bridges and tunnels of all classifications. The bill would eliminate the requirement for 10% of STP funds to be set aside for transportation. The bill under the Surface Transportation Program (STP) would broaden its purpose to include construction, inspection, rehabilitation, and replacement of bridges and tunnels of all classifications. It eliminates the 10% set-aside for transportation enhancement purposes and prohibits projects on roads classified as local or rural minor collectors unless they were on the federal-aid highway system in 1991. Additionally, up to 15% of STP funds can be used in areas with populations under 5,000. H.R. 7 under the Surface Transportation Program (STP) would allocate 10% of funds for transportation enhancement purposes. It allows up to 15% of STP funds for areas with populations under 5,000. The bill reduces the required spending percentage on urbanized areas over 200,000 from 62.5% to 50%. States must consult with local planning organizations for projects in areas of 5,000 to 200,000 population. H.R. 7 would allocate $10.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014 for HSIP, requiring states to have their own highway safety improvement programs and state safety plans to receive funds. Plans must be developed in consultation with stakeholders, set safety goals, identify projects, and align with performance measures. H.R. 7 would provide $10.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014 for HSIP, with states needing their own safety programs and plans to receive funds. Plans must align with performance measures, set safety goals, identify projects, and evaluate progress annually. Additionally, $8 billion would be allocated for CMAQ from the alternative transportation account. H.R. 7 would provide $8 billion over FY2013-FY2014 for CMAQ from the proposed alternative transportation account. It would also guarantee each state a minimum 94% return in core program apportionments on highway users' payments. Total authorization is $15.6 billion annually. H.R. 7 would amend the CMAQ program to ensure each state receives a minimum 94% return on highway taxes. It authorizes $15.6 billion over FY2013-FY2014, with a limit of $3.9 billion per year to fulfill the guarantee. The SAFETEA bill authorizes $15.6 billion over FY2013-FY2014, with a limit of $3.9 billion per year to fulfill the guarantee. If the annual amount is insufficient, the STP authorization would be decreased to provide additional funds. The Senate bill clarifies eligibility criteria for roads and bridges damaged by natural disasters or catastrophic failures. The Senate bill, Section 1107, clarifies eligibility criteria for roads and bridges damaged by natural disasters or catastrophic failures. It states that roads already closed to traffic or scheduled for construction at the time of the disaster are not eligible for ER funds. Additionally, ER funds can only be used on federal-aid highways, with U.S. territories limited to $20 million per fiscal year. The Senate bill clarifies eligibility criteria for ER funds, stating that roads already closed or scheduled for construction at the time of a disaster are not eligible. ER funds can only be used on federal-aid highways, with U.S. territories limited to $20 million per year. The $100 million ceiling for a single disaster in a state would be removed, and adjustments to the 180-day emergency period can be made for time lost due to lack of access to damaged facilities. The Secretary of Transportation may allow a 100% federal share of repair costs at their discretion. Section 1506 of H.R. 7 eliminates the ceiling on a single natural disaster or catastrophic failure in a state. It allows adjustments to the 180-day emergency period for lack of access to damaged facilities and permits a 100% federal share for repair costs exceeding the state apportionment. H.R. 7 also defines \"comparable facility\" in relation to maximum project costs. Section 1111 of H.R. 7 defines \"comparable facility\" for allowable project costs and limits debris removal reimbursement not covered by the Stafford Act. U.S. territories are capped at $20 million per fiscal year for emergency assistance, requiring a declaration by the governor or President. States must meet geometric and construction standards for traffic volume over the facility's design life. The Senate bill, Section 1116, would restructure the Federal Lands Highways Programs to allow ER funding for federal lands highways and tribal roads, even if they are not on the federal-aid highway system. The U.S. territories would be limited to $20 million in emergency assistance per fiscal year, requiring a declaration by the governor or President. States must provide a list of projects and costs within two years for assistance to be provided. The Senate bill, Section 1116, proposes restructuring the Federal Lands Highways Programs to allow ER funding for federal lands highways and tribal roads. A new program, the Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program, would include the Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program. MAP-21 suggests funding the Tribal Transportation Program at $450 million annually. The Federal Lands Highways Programs would be restructured to include the Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program, with three main components: the Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program. The Tribal Transportation Program would receive $450 million annually, while other federal lands programs would receive $550 million annually. Funding distribution for tribes would be based on road mileage and tribal population. H.R. 7 authorizes the Tribal Transportation Program at $465 million annually for FY2013-FY2016, while the Federal Lands Transportation program is authorized at $535 million annually for the same period. Funding distribution for tribes is based on road mileage and tribal population. The Federal Lands Access Program allocation among states considers federal land, recreational visitors, federal roads, and federally owned bridges. The Tribal Transportation Program is authorized at $465 million annually for FY2013-FY2016, while the Federal Lands Transportation program is authorized at $535 million annually for the same period. The Senate bill combines the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, funding them at $180 million annually for FY2012 and FY2013, with a 25% set-aside for Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Puerto Rico would receive a 75% share. The Senate bill combines the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, funding them at $180 million annually for FY2012 and FY2013. Puerto Rico would receive a 75% share, with a set-aside for Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Puerto Rico's set-aside is limited to certain program eligibilities. H.R. 7 retains the Puerto Rico Highway Program and authorizes it at $150 million annually. The Puerto Rico Highway Program under H.R. 7 would receive a 75% per year set-aside of $135 million annually, with specific program eligibilities. The Territorial Highway Program is authorized at $50 million annually for FY2013-FY2016 from the alternative transportation account. The Senate bill incorporates the ADHS eligibilities into the new Transportation Mobility program. The Senate bill eliminates the ADHS program and incorporates its eligibilities into the new Transportation Mobility Program. Section 1530 would increase the federal share for constructing highways on the Appalachian Development Highway System to 95% under certain conditions. H.R. 7 retains the program at $470 million per year for FY2013-FY2016. The Transportation Mobility Program would incorporate the Appalachian Development Highway System eligibilities. H.R. 7 would raise the federal share for highway construction to 95% under certain conditions and authorize $470 million per year for FY2013-FY2016. States can use toll credits for matching share, and funds are apportioned based on cost estimates with no state receiving less than 1% or more than 25%. The Transportation Mobility Program under H.R. 7 authorizes $470 million per year for FY2013-FY2016. States can use toll credits for matching share, and funds are apportioned based on cost estimates with no state receiving less than 1% or more than 25%. The program requires an appropriation before funds can be made available and aims to fund critical high-cost surface transportation infrastructure. The Senate bill, Section 1118, establishes a program with a budget authority of $1 billion for FY2013 to fund critical high-cost surface transportation infrastructure projects. The program aims to increase national and regional economic benefits, improve global competitiveness, reduce congestion, enhance national energy security, improve freight and people movement, and enhance transportation safety. The Senate bill, Section 1118, establishes a $1 billion program for FY2013 to fund high-cost surface transportation infrastructure projects that would generate economic benefits, increase competitiveness, reduce congestion, improve energy security, enhance freight and people movement, and improve transportation safety. H.R. 7 would repeal the SAFETEA PNRS provision, while the Senate bill (H.R. 4348 as amended by MAP-21, Section 1119) would create a program to report on project selection process and justification. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is required to report on the project selection process, factors, and justification for each project under H.R. 7. The Senate bill (H.R. 4348 as amended by MAP-21, Section 1119) establishes a general fund program for Ferries and Ferry Terminal Facilities, with funding distribution based on passenger numbers. The Senate bill (H.R. 4348 as amended by MAP-21, Section 1119) would establish a general fund program for Ferries and Ferry Terminal Facilities. Funding distribution would be based on passenger numbers, vehicles carried per day, and total route miles serviced by ferry systems. $67 million is authorized for each fiscal year FY2012 and FY2013. The Senate bill (H.R. 4348 as amended by MAP-21, Section 1119) establishes a general fund program for Ferries and Ferry Terminal Facilities. Funding distribution is based on passenger numbers, vehicles carried per day, and total route miles serviced by ferry systems. $67 million is authorized for each fiscal year FY2012 and FY2013, requiring an appropriation to be made available. Ferry boats and facilities are eligible for formula funds under the proposed National Highway Performance Program. The House bill (H.R. 7, Section 1113) would modify the existing Ferry Boat and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program under 23 U.S.C. 147, funded at $67 million. The House bill (H.R. 7, Section 1113) proposes funding the Ferry Boat and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program at $67 million for each fiscal year FY2013-FY2016 via the Alternative Transportation Account. Distribution of funds would be based on a different formula compared to the Senate bill proposal, with 35% going to states with eligible ferry systems. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes funding the Ferry Boat and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program at $67 million annually for FY2013-FY2016 through the Alternative Transportation Account. Funds would be distributed based on the total vehicles, passengers, and nautical route miles serviced by ferry systems in each state. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes funding the Ferry Boat and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program at $67 million annually for FY2013-FY2016 through the Alternative Transportation Account. Funding distribution is based on the total vehicles, passengers, and nautical route miles serviced by ferry systems in each state. Additionally, ferry boats and facilities on the National Highway System would be eligible for formula funds under the National Highway System Program. The National Highway System Program would provide formula funds for ferry boats and facilities. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) offers federal credit assistance for large transportation projects, with loans repaid through project-related user fees. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to TIFIA, including increasing federal credit assistance. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA), including authorizing $1 billion annually from the highway trust fund for the program. This would cover administrative and subsidy costs, with administrative costs capped at 1% of the total amount. The bill proposes to enlarge the TIFIA program by authorizing $1 billion annually from the highway trust fund, with administrative costs capped at 1%. This would allow for loans totaling $9.9 billion per year, and increase the share of project costs TIFIA may provide from 33% to 49%. MAP-21 proposes to increase TIFIA's capacity to make loans totaling $9.9 billion per year by allowing credit assistance for a program of projects secured by a common security pledge through a \"master credit agreement.\" This is a significant change from the current project-by-project basis. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to TIFIA, including allowing credit assistance for a program of projects through a \"master credit agreement\" instead of project-by-project basis. This change aims to accelerate financing for transit projects like the 30/10 Initiative by entities like the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The proposed threshold for eligible projects is $25 million for rural infrastructure projects, lower than the current $50 million threshold. The Transportation Authority (Metro) seeks to accelerate financing for 12 transit projects through the 30/10 Initiative. MAP-21 proposes a lower threshold of $25 million for rural infrastructure projects, compared to the current $50 million threshold. Urban projects must charge interest on loans, while rural projects have different criteria for eligibility. The MAP-21 proposal includes lower funding thresholds for rural infrastructure projects, with different eligibility criteria and lower interest rates compared to urban projects. 10% of TIFIA funds are reserved for rural projects, and evaluation criteria for TIFIA assistance would be abolished. Loans for rural projects under MAP-21 are offered at half the Treasury rate, with 10% of TIFIA funds reserved for rural projects. Evaluation criteria for TIFIA assistance would be abolished, and projects would be assessed based on eligibility on a first-come, first-served basis. Once funding is depleted for the year, project sponsors can enter into a master credit agreement for future credit assistance or pay their own credit subsidy for an immediate loan. Loans for rural projects under MAP-21 are offered at half the Treasury rate, with 10% of TIFIA funds reserved for rural projects. Evaluation criteria for TIFIA assistance would be abolished, and projects would be evaluated solely on their eligibility on a first-come, first-served basis. Once funding is exhausted for a year, a project sponsor could enter into a master credit agreement for future credit assistance or pay its own credit subsidy for an immediate loan. Funding may be apportioned to states for the Transportation Mobility Program if not all TIFIA funding is used. H.R. 7 authorizes $1 billion annually for TIFIA from the highway trust fund. H.R. 7 authorizes $1 billion annually for TIFIA from the highway trust fund, with funds available for administrative and subsidy costs. The bill also establishes master credit agreements for credit assistance and eliminates evaluation criteria for TIFIA assistance. Administrative costs are capped at $3.250 million. H.R. 7 authorizes $1 billion annually for TIFIA from the highway trust fund to pay administrative and subsidy costs. It establishes master credit agreements for credit assistance and removes evaluation criteria for TIFIA assistance. Administrative costs are capped at $3.250 million, with thresholds of $50 million for non-ITS projects, $15 million for ITS projects, $25 million for rural projects, and $1 billion for assistance under a master credit agreement. H.R. 7 proposes changes to TIFIA assistance, including maintaining thresholds for project eligibility, adding thresholds for rural and master credit agreement projects, and increasing federal assistance to 49%. It also suggests authorizing $750 million annually for state infrastructure banks. H.R. 7 proposes to increase federal assistance to 49% under a master credit agreement and authorize $750 million annually for state infrastructure banks. There is no separate federal freight transportation program in SAFETEA, with most funding provided to states for freight-related programs. SAFETEA does not have a separate federal freight transportation program, instead, it provides funding for freight-related programs through regular highway programs. State DOTs and metropolitan planning organizations are responsible for prioritizing freight improvements with minor funding dedicated to freight transportation. The Senate bill (MAP-21) proposes a new dedicated funding program for freight transport, while the House bill (H.R. 7) does not create a separate federal freight program. This marks a significant departure from SAFETEA, which leaves decisions about freight funding to state DOTs and planning organizations. The debate over whether the federal government should focus more on funding freight improvements has been a key policy question leading up to reauthorization. The Senate bill (MAP-21) proposes a new dedicated funding program for freight transport, while the House bill (H.R. 7) does not create a similar program. Both bills require the U.S. Department of Transportation to prepare a national freight transport plan. The House bill (H.R. 7) contains provisions that significantly impact freight transport, including requiring the U.S. Department of Transportation to develop a national freight transport plan in consultation with stakeholders. Both the Senate and House bills aim to increase private-sector involvement in financing transportation improvements, potentially enhancing freight carriers and shippers' roles in project planning. Additionally, MAP-21 proposes a new core program to allocate funds to infrastructure segments. The House bill (H.R. 7) and MAP-21 aim to increase private-sector involvement in financing transportation improvements, potentially enhancing freight carriers and shippers' roles in project planning. MAP-21 proposes a new core program to allocate funds to infrastructure segments critical to freight movement, creating a \"primary freight network\" designated by the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary of Transportation would designate critical infrastructure segments for freight movement as the \"primary freight network\" (PFN), consisting of 27,000 centerline miles of existing roadways. States would be guided to prioritize spending on the PFN before other freight-related infrastructure. Up to an additional 3,000 centerline miles could be designated by the Secretary. The Secretary of Transportation would designate a \"primary freight network\" (PFN) consisting of 27,000 centerline miles of existing roadways, with the potential to add up to 3,000 more miles based on future importance to freight movement. States would prioritize spending on the PFN before other freight-related infrastructure, and could designate \"critical rural freight corridors\" based on truck traffic density. The PFN would be re-designated every decade. The PFN consists of 3,000 centerline miles of existing or planned roads based on future freight importance. States can designate \"critical rural freight corridors\" with high truck traffic density connecting to the PFN or Interstate System. States can allocate up to 20% of their freight program funds to these roads, which along with portions of the Interstate System not in the PFN, form the \"national freight network (NFM).\" The PFN or Interstate System allows states to allocate up to 20% of their freight program funds to designated roads. These critical rural freight corridors, along with portions of the Interstate System not in the PFN, form the \"national freight network (NFM).\" States can also use funds on non-Interstate highways or transit projects to improve freight flows on nearby interstates more cost-effectively. Additionally, states can allocate up to 10% of funds for freight rail or maritime projects. States can allocate up to 10% of their freight program funds for public or private freight rail or maritime projects if it would improve freight flows on nearby interstates more cost-effectively. The Secretary of Transportation must determine that the project provides significant improvement to freight flow, with public benefits exceeding federal costs and better returns than a highway project on the PFN. The Secretary of Transportation can allocate funds for rail or maritime projects that improve freight flow, with public benefits exceeding costs and better returns than highway projects on the PFN. Creating a specific funding program for freight movement and developing performance measures by states will enhance consideration of freight needs in project selection. The PFN, consisting of 30,000 miles of highway, focuses funds on critical segments for freight movement. DOT estimates that on 4,700 miles of highway with high truck volume, trucks travel below optimal speeds. The designation of a PFN with 30,000 miles of highway would prioritize funds for critical freight movement segments. DOT estimates that on congested urban interchanges, trucks experience delays during rush hours. States may still be hesitant to address costly bottlenecks despite the freight program relying on apportioned funds. Trucks face congestion and stop-and-go conditions on 3,700 additional miles of highway during rush hours, mainly at urban interchanges. States may be reluctant to address costly bottlenecks that primarily benefit trucks. Funding for these projects may be more suitable under programs like TIFIA, PNRS, and CMAQ. The Senate bill does not change truck size and weight limits. The Senate bill does not change truck size and weight limits, but requires a study on possible changes. The House bill focuses on funding for freight transport by reducing funding for non-shipping programs. The House bill focuses on funding for freight transport by reducing funding for non-shipping programs and seeks greater reliance on tolling to finance highway construction, opposed by trucking organizations preferring fuel tax increases. The House bill aims to increase funding for freight transport by reducing non-shipping programs and relying more on tolling for highway construction. It includes a provision for a DOT study on increasing truck weight limits and permits longer double trailers. H.R. 7 aims to increase truck weight limits and permit longer trailers for carriers. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved a DOT study on truck weight limits instead of the proposed increase to 97,000 pounds. The bill also includes provisions for longer double trailers and auto transporters. The House bill aims to increase truck weight limits and permit longer trailers for carriers. It includes provisions for double trailers up to 33 feet, truckload carriers up to 53 feet, and auto transporters up to 80 feet. A pilot program allows for increased truck weights to 126,000 pounds on certain Interstate Highway segments. Weight exemption for idle reduction equipment was also increased. The House bill includes provisions for increased truck weights to 126,000 pounds on certain Interstate Highway segments. A weight exemption for idle reduction equipment was also increased. MAP-21 would bring substantial changes to transportation planning requirements at national, state, and local levels, including the use of performance management throughout the planning process. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to transportation planning requirements at national, state, and local levels, emphasizing the use of performance management. This includes the incorporation of performance measures and targets in state and metropolitan planning, with a focus on five national goals. MAP-21 proposes that state and metropolitan planning include performance measures and targets, with consequences for not meeting targets being mild. The National Freight Program under MAP-21 would require the development of a national freight system. The consequences for not meeting performance targets set by states and MPOs under MAP-21 are mild, requiring a remedial plan of action. The new National Freight Program would mandate the development of a national freight strategic plan with quantifiable performance measures for the primary freight network. Each state must set performance targets for freight movement to receive funding from the program. The DOT is required to develop a national freight strategic plan with performance measures for the primary freight network. States must set performance targets for freight movement to receive funding. Failure to meet targets requires submission of a performance improvement plan to the Secretary of Transportation. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act (Division C, Title III) of MAP-21 includes provisions for a national surface transportation and freight policy and strategic plan. If a state fails to meet performance targets for freight movement, they must submit a performance improvement plan to the Secretary of Transportation. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act (Division C, Title III) of MAP-21 includes provisions for a national surface transportation and freight policy and strategic plan. These provisions may repeat or conflict with those in Division A, Title I. An example of repetitive provisions is the goal to reduce traffic fatalities, while conflicting provisions include the development of a national strategic freight plan. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act (Division C, Title III) of MAP-21 includes provisions for reducing traffic fatalities and developing national strategic freight plans. Conflicting provisions exist regarding the timeline for these plans' development. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act of MAP-21 includes provisions for developing a national strategic freight plan and a national surface transportation and freight performance plan within specific timelines. States must develop risk-based asset management plans with performance targets and investment strategies. Failure to meet targets requires submission of corrective actions. The Secretary will establish minimum pavement condition standards for the Interstate. The risk-based asset management plan under MAP-21 includes performance targets and an investment strategy. States failing to meet targets must submit corrective actions. The Secretary will set minimum standards for pavement and bridge conditions on the Interstate System and NHS. States may need to redirect federal funds to improve facilities if conditions fall below the minimum. Under MAP-21, states must meet performance targets and investment strategies in their risk-based asset management plans. The Secretary will establish minimum standards for pavement and bridge conditions on the Interstate System and NHS. States may have to use federal funds to improve facilities if conditions do not meet the minimum requirements. State planning requirements remain largely unchanged, with the incorporation of metropolitan transportation plans and programs now mandated in statewide plans and improvement programs. Under MAP-21, states are required to incorporate metropolitan transportation plans and programs into their statewide transportation plans and improvement programs. This includes a stronger requirement for cooperation with nonmetropolitan areas compared to the previous need for consultation. States must also adopt a performance-based approach in their transportation planning. MAP-21 requires states to develop statewide plans in cooperation with MPOs and nonmetropolitan areas, incorporating a performance-based approach into transportation planning. Performance measures must align with national planning efforts, including the national freight strategic plan. Metropolitan transportation planning under MAP-21 proposes creating two tiers of MPOs. MAP-21 proposes creating two tiers of MPOs for metropolitan transportation planning. Tier I would be in areas with populations of 1 million or more, while Tier II would be in areas with less than 1 million. These MPOs would need to meet specific technical requirements related to modeling, data, staffing, and other planning elements. The Secretary would establish minimum requirements through regulations within one year. MAP-21 proposes two tiers of MPOs for metropolitan transportation planning based on population size. Tier I MPOs (1 million or more) must meet specific technical requirements, including performance-based planning and targets. Tier II MPOs (less than 1 million) will have requirements at the discretion of the Secretary, potentially including performance measures. Regulations for minimum requirements will be issued within one year of enactment. MAP-21 introduces two tiers of MPOs for metropolitan transportation planning based on population size. Tier I MPOs (1 million or more) must meet specific technical requirements, including performance-based planning and targets. Tier II MPOs (less than 1 million) will have requirements at the discretion of the Secretary, potentially including performance measures. Both tiers are allowed to select projects from their TIPs in consultation with states, with the addition that it must also be done with the concurrence of the facility owner. Optional development of multiple scenarios, known as blueprint planning, is also included in MAP-21. MAP-21 introduces two tiers of MPOs for metropolitan transportation planning based on population size. Tier I MPOs (1 million or more) must meet specific technical requirements, including performance-based planning and targets. Tier II MPOs (less than 1 million) will have requirements at the discretion of the Secretary, potentially including performance measures. MAP-21 also includes provisions for the optional development of multiple scenarios, sometimes known as blueprint planning. The designation of MPOs is proposed only in urbanized areas of 200,000 population or more, up from 50,000 as required in current law. MPOs in urbanized areas below 200,000 could be designated by agreement between the governor and local officials. MAP-21 proposes to require the designation of MPOs only in urbanized areas of 200,000 population or more, up from 50,000 as required in current law. MPOs in areas below 200,000 could be designated by agreement between the governor and local officials, but must meet minimum technical requirements for Tier II MPOs. Existing MPOs in areas under 200,000 population not reaffirmed by the MPO and governor, and approved by the Secretary, will be terminated three years after regulations are promulgated for Tier II MPOs. The MAP-21 legislation aims to consolidate metropolitan planning by requiring MPOs only in urbanized areas with 200,000+ population. Existing MPOs in areas under 200,000 population not reaffirmed by the MPO, governor, and approved by the Secretary will be terminated after three years. H.R. 7 also includes provisions for national transportation planning and performance. H.R. 7, like MAP-21, aims to consolidate metropolitan planning by potentially allowing more than one MPO in an urban region if deemed appropriate. It includes provisions for national transportation planning, performance measurement, and the development of a national strategic transportation plan by DOT. H.R. 7 mandates the development of a national strategic transportation plan by the Department of Transportation, including a list of projects of national significance from states. It also requires a national performance management system to track progress towards national performance goals for highway and public transportation systems. H.R. 7 mandates a national performance management system to track progress towards performance goals for highway and public transportation systems, including national and state-level targets and reporting requirements. H.R. 7 mandates a state performance measurement system with targets and reporting requirements for transportation planning, including projects of national significance. It also includes measures to address congestion at airports, freight rail corridors, ports, and inland waterways, as well as considerations for intercity buses in reducing congestion. H.R. 7 mandates a state performance measurement system for transportation planning, including projects of national significance. It addresses congestion at airports, freight rail corridors, ports, and inland waterways, and considers the role of intercity buses in reducing congestion and pollution. It also involves regional transportation planning organizations in project selection. H.R. 7 aims to improve the existing intercity bus system and reduce congestion and pollution. It includes regional transportation planning organizations in project selection and proposes increasing the urbanized population threshold for MPO designation. H.R. 7 proposes increasing the urbanized population threshold for MPO designation from 50,000 to 100,000. Existing MPOs under 100,000 can continue unless the governor and localities agree to terminate. The bill also emphasizes considering intercity buses in metropolitan planning due to budgetary pressures and efficient resource utilization in transportation projects. H.R. 7 proposes increasing the urbanized population threshold for MPO designation from 50,000 to 100,000 and emphasizes considering intercity buses in metropolitan planning. Budgetary pressures have raised concerns about resource utilization in transportation projects, leading to provisions in both House and Senate proposals to expedite project delivery by changing elements of the environmental review process. The House and Senate proposals aim to expedite project delivery by changing elements of the environmental review process for highway and transit projects. Activities within the process may start during the planning stage and conclude during the preliminary engineering and design stage. This involves preparing documentation to demonstrate project-related impacts. The environmental review process for highway and transit projects involves preparing documentation and analysis to identify project-related impacts on the human, natural, or cultural environment. Compliance with state, tribal, and federal requirements is necessary to address these impacts. The environmental review process for transportation projects ensures that all potential impacts on the human, natural, or cultural environment are identified and considered during decision-making. Various environmental requirements may apply, such as obtaining permits for bridge reconstruction or mitigating effects on historic sites. Compliance with state, tribal, and federal regulations is essential. Various environmental requirements may apply to transportation projects, such as obtaining permits for bridge reconstruction or mitigating effects on historic sites. Compliance with state, tribal, and federal regulations is essential, and documentation, analysis, and review are required pursuant to NEPA for proposed federal-aid highway or transit projects. To mitigate project effects on historic sites, consultation with State Historic Preservation Office is necessary. Project alternatives should be considered to avoid adverse impacts on parks, recreation areas, wildlife refuges, or historic sites. NEPA requires documentation, analysis, and review for federal-aid highway or transit projects. Federal agencies must assess environmental impacts before proceeding with proposed actions. Approval of NEPA documentation by FHWA or FTA is necessary before final design activities, property acquisition, or project construction can proceed. DOT policy mandates environmental compliance for all projects. The NEPA requires federal agencies to identify and consider environmental impacts before project approval. FHWA or FTA must approve NEPA documentation before design activities or construction. DOT policy mandates coordination of environmental investigations and compliance with all requirements in the NEPA document. Compliance processes may blur distinctions between NEPA requirements and those identified during the process. The DOT policy mandates coordinating environmental investigations and compliance with all NEPA requirements. Recent legislative efforts aim to expedite environmental reviews, focusing on elements of NEPA compliance. Recent legislative efforts, such as SAFETEA, TEA-21, H.R. 7, and MAP-21, aim to expedite environmental reviews by focusing on NEPA compliance for major transportation projects. The House proposal suggests more significant changes to the process compared to MAP-21. The House proposal in H.R. 7 focuses on NEPA compliance for major transportation projects, aiming to expedite project delivery by changing environmental compliance requirements. The proposed changes are more sweeping than those in MAP-21, with potential impacts on accelerating environmental reviews and project delivery. The House proposal in H.R. 7 aims to expedite project delivery by changing environmental compliance requirements more broadly than in MAP-21. The proposed changes may impact environmental reviews and project delivery, potentially accelerating or slowing the process. The environmental review process in transportation project development under MAP-21 may face procedural changes that could either speed up or slow down project delivery. Compliance with environmental requirements, including those under NEPA, may involve coordination with federal, state, or tribal agencies before final design activities. The \"environmental review process\" in transportation project development involves identifying and documenting state, tribal, and federal environmental compliance requirements, including those under NEPA. Input or cooperation from federal, state, or tribal agencies may be necessary for compliance. FHWA or FTA must ensure the completion of the environmental review process before final design activities or project construction can proceed. NEPA mandates an environmental impact statement if the project may significantly affect the environment. Before final design activities, property acquisition, purchase of construction materials, or project construction can proceed, FHWA or FTA must ensure that the environmental review process for the project is complete. This process, mandated by NEPA, includes preparing an environmental impact statement if the project may significantly affect the environment. If the significance of the environmental impacts is unclear, an environmental assessment (EA) is conducted to make that determination. Projects with no significant environmental impacts are categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an EIS or EA, known as categorical exclusions. Since 1998, around 90% of highway projects approved annually by FHWA were processed as categorical exclusions (CEs), while approximately 6% required an environmental assessment (EA) to determine their environmental impacts. DOT's NEPA regulations categorically exclude projects with no significant environmental impacts from the requirement to prepare an EIS or EA. The majority of highway projects approved annually by FHWA since 1998 were processed as categorical exclusions (CEs), with around 6% requiring an environmental assessment (EA) for environmental impact evaluation. These projects, while deemed to have no significant environmental impact under NEPA, may still need to comply with other environmental regulations such as the National Historic Preservation Act, Clean Water Act, and Endangered Species Act. The most significant changes in the environmental review process under MAP-21 focus on streamlining procedures. The changes in the environmental review process under MAP-21 focus on establishing new requirements for issue resolution, specifically under Section 1313 and Section 1316. These provisions aim to ensure compliance with environmental regulations such as the National Historic Preservation Act, Clean Water Act, and Endangered Species Act. Under Section 1313, MAP-21 would amend environmental review procedures to establish criteria for issue resolution and financial transfer provisions for agencies failing to meet project deadlines or resolve disputes. MAP-21 would establish criteria for issue resolution and financial transfer provisions for agencies failing to meet project deadlines or resolve disputes. This includes transferring $10,000 or $20,000 weekly to the agency responsible for delays in issuing permits or approvals. The agency responsible for delays in issuing permits or approvals may be required to transfer $10,000 or $20,000 weekly to the agency or divisions handling the application, under certain conditions. Transfer is mandated after 180 days of a complete application or final project decision, pursuant to NEPA, unless the delay is not the agency's fault. A transfer of funds may be required after 180 days of a complete application or final project decision, pursuant to NEPA, unless the delay is not the agency's fault. Agencies responsible for issuing approvals or permits for DOT projects vary and may include EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Divisional, regional, or local offices within these agencies process permit applications for various regulated activities. The approval process for transportation projects may involve agencies like EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Delays in issuing permits can be due to agency under-staffing or lack of funds. Limited agency funds may need to be redirected to expedite project approvals. The approval process for transportation projects may involve agencies like EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Delays in issuing permits can be due to agency under-staffing or lack of funds. Limited agency funds may need to be redirected to expedite project approvals, which could inadvertently slow down other applications being processed. MAP-21 requires DOT to compare completion times of environmental assessments and impact statements initiated after 2005 to those before 2005. The approval process for transportation projects involving various agencies may lead to delays in issuing permits. Limited agency funds may need to be redirected to expedite project approvals, potentially slowing down other applications. MAP-21 requires DOT to compare completion times of environmental assessments and impact statements initiated after 2005 to those before 2005, with no specific funding authorized for the assessments. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is required by MAP-21 to compare completion times of environmental assessments and impact statements initiated before and after 2005. No specific funding is allocated for these assessments, and determining the time it takes to complete NEPA documents may be challenging. Determining the time it takes to complete NEPA documents, as directed under Section 1316, is challenging. Little data is available for projects processed with EAs or CEs, and State DOTs do not track the time for NEPA compliance. NEPA compliance is a subset of project development, and accurate information on completion times is difficult to extract. State DOTs do not track the time for NEPA compliance, making it challenging to determine completion times for NEPA documents. To meet Congress's directive, DOT may require states to start tracking this information and report it. This would be an addition to the existing environmental clearance process. To comply with Congress's directive, DOT may require states to track and report the time taken for NEPA activities. This addition to the environmental clearance process would involve changes to existing regulatory requirements, including surveying state agencies for new Categorical Exclusions. The CEs involve directives to DOT to change regulatory requirements for projects, including surveying state agencies for new Categorical Exclusions and moving specific projects to a list where no additional DOT approval is needed. The proposed regulations aim to add projects to the list of Categorical Exclusions (CEs) and move certain projects from requiring DOT approval to not needing additional approval. Additionally, DOT would define criteria for designating projects within highway right-of-ways as Categorical Exclusions. The proposed regulations aim to add projects to the list of Categorical Exclusions (CEs) and move certain projects from requiring DOT approval to not needing additional approval. Provisions would specify DOT agency roles in meeting NEPA compliance requirements for multimodal projects and criteria for designating projects within highway right-of-ways as Categorical Exclusions. Provisions under Section 1309 would continue or amend environment-related programs established under SAFETEA, including authorizing federal transportation funds for dedicated staff at a federal agency to support transportation project planning. Before DOT funding approval, the agency and state must establish project priorities through a memorandum of understanding. The section includes provisions for expediting transportation project planning and delivery. Before receiving DOT funding approval, the agency and state must establish project priorities through a memorandum of understanding. States can use transportation funds for attorneys' fees related to eligible activities. The \"surface transportation project delivery pilot program\" may become permanent. The Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program would make permanent a pilot program allowing states to assume federal responsibilities for environmental reviews. States could use transportation funds for attorneys' fees related to eligible activities under this section. Additional environment-specific provisions are included in MAP-21's Subtitle C. The pilot program allowing states to take over federal responsibilities for environmental reviews under NEPA or other laws is being made permanent. Any state can now participate, with DOT making determinations on their ability to implement the program. Additional environment-specific provisions in MAP-21's Subtitle C highlight activities important to Congress and clarify requirements for NEPA compliance. In the House bill, environmental review provisions are mainly under Title III, \"Environmental Streamlining.\" Provisions under MAP-21's Subtitle C reinforce the importance of activities DOT is implementing and clarify NEPA compliance requirements. House bill provisions on environmental review are included in Title III and Subtitle C, which extensively change NEPA requirements. Under Title III, \"Environmental Streamlining\" and Subtitle C, \"Project Development and Review,\" H.R. 7 proposes changes to NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects. NEPA would no longer apply to projects costing less than $10 million or with federal funding below 15% of total costs. For projects still subject to NEPA, the compliance process would be significantly altered. The proposed changes in H.R. 7 would alter NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects. Projects costing less than $10 million or with federal funding below 15% of total costs would no longer be subject to NEPA. For projects still under NEPA, the compliance process would see significant changes, including the consideration of different project alternatives, revised document formats, and evaluation of cumulative project impacts. Additionally, agencies outside DOT would need to adhere to specific timeframes for providing permits. The House bill proposes changes to the NEPA compliance process for federal highway and transit projects, including altering project alternatives, document formats, and evaluation of cumulative impacts. It also establishes specific timeframes for agencies to provide permits and sets a 270-day deadline for completing the environmental review process. Additionally, the bill amends requirements for parks, wildlife refuges, and recreation areas. The House proposal aims to streamline the NEPA compliance process for federal highway and transit projects by setting specific timeframes for permits, establishing a 270-day deadline for environmental reviews, and amending requirements for parks, wildlife refuges, and recreation areas. The Senate has agreed to substitute the language of MAP-21 for the House-passed language of H.R. 4348 and called for a conference with the House. The Senate has agreed to substitute the language of MAP-21 for the House-passed language of H.R. 4348, including streamlining provisions for environmental reviews and making three main changes to existing law to speed up the process. The House-passed H.R. 4348 includes streamlining provisions for environmental reviews and makes three main changes to existing law to speed up project delivery, including specific authority for state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts. The House-passed H.R. 4348 includes streamlining provisions for environmental reviews and makes specific changes to existing law to speed up project delivery, such as allowing state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts. The House-passed H.R. 4348 includes streamlining provisions for environmental reviews and allows state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts, which is an innovative design-build method where a single contractor handles all design and construction work. This method accelerates project delivery by allowing the contractor to start construction tasks before design work is complete. MAP-21 would also increase federal funding share for Interstate Highway projects. The contractor can enter into an agreement and start construction tasks before design work is complete, accelerating project delivery. H.R. 7 allows state DOTs to use CM/GC contracts. MAP-21 increases federal funding share by 5% for highway projects using innovative delivery methods. MAP-21 increases federal funding share by 5% for highway projects using innovative delivery methods such as prefabricated bridge elements, digital modeling technologies, and design-build and CM/GC contracting methods. Additionally, a pilot program in Section 1315 allows for advance construction tasks before design work is complete in up to five states. MAP-21 includes innovations like prefabricated bridge elements, digital modeling technologies, and advance payment pilot program for moving costs in up to five states. H.R. 7 has a similar provision without state limitations. The \"Alternative Relocation Payment Demonstration Program\" in H.R. 7 allows advance payment of moving costs for people and businesses affected by highway projects, without limiting the number of participating states. This program aims to expedite the relocation of individuals from project right-of-ways, but is a minor change compared to other proposed property acquisition and relocation laws. The \"Alternative Relocation Payment Demonstration Program\" in H.R. 7 allows advance payment of moving costs for individuals and businesses affected by highway projects. This program aims to expedite relocation from project right-of-ways, but is a minor change compared to other proposed property acquisition and relocation laws. Under Section 1113 of MAP-21, state transportation officials recommend allowing states to use their own property acquisition and relocation laws if they meet federal requirements. The Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ) would be revised to provide funds for projects reducing transportation-related pollutants exceeding air quality standards set by the EPA. The Clean Air Act directs the EPA to set air quality standards for pollutants, including ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5). Areas that meet these standards are in \"attainment,\" while those that do not are not. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) were established for ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5). Areas that meet these standards are in \"attainment,\" while those that do not are in \"nonattainment.\" The CMAQ program provides funds for projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas. The CMAQ program provides funds for projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas. Proposed amendments would change how program funding levels are established and distributed within states. Proposed amendments to the CMAQ program would change how funding levels are established and distributed within states, with funding no longer being based on specific annual amounts but apportioned differently. The CMAQ program funding levels authorized by Congress in the 1990s have been apportioned to states based on population and pollution levels. Under MAP-21, funding for FYs 2012 and 2013 would be tied to previous allocations plus a percentage of STP funds. Funds within each state would be distributed based on specific limitations and suballocations. Under the new CMAQ program, funds apportioned to each state would be tied to FY2009 amounts plus 10% of STP funds. States must reserve the 10% for specific projects like transportation enhancements and recreational trails. The new CMAQ program requires states to reserve 10% of previously-apportioned STP funds for specific projects like transportation enhancements, recreational trails, and other transportation choices. The remaining CMAQ funds would be suballocated for projects within each state. The CMAQ program involves planning, designing, and constructing road projects that provide transportation choices, such as pedestrian and bicycle facilities. Half of the funds apportioned to each state would be suballocated for projects in nonattainment or maintenance areas, distributed based on a formula approved by DOT and weighted by population and pollution severity. The CMAQ program involves suballocating funds for projects in nonattainment or maintenance areas based on a formula approved by DOT, weighted by population and pollution severity. Half of the funds must be obligated for areas with fine particulate pollution, and 30% must be used for low-emissions construction equipment and vehicles. The CMAQ program under MAP-21 requires half of suballocated funds to be obligated for areas with fine particulate pollution, and 30% to be used for low-emissions construction equipment. Additional provisions in MAP-21 may change how the program is implemented in individual states. Under MAP-21, funds allocated to states for eligible projects in nonattainment or maintenance areas can be used for CMAQ projects. Proposed provisions may alter the implementation of the CMAQ program, including prioritizing projects to reduce pollutants like PM 2.5 and evaluating project effectiveness. Proposed provisions under MAP-21 aim to prioritize CMAQ fund distribution for projects reducing pollutants like PM 2.5, evaluate project cost-effectiveness, and offer optional programmatic eligibility assessments. The proposed provisions under MAP-21 prioritize CMAQ fund distribution for projects reducing pollutants like PM 2.5. DOT and EPA would develop a cost-effectiveness table for projects, and states and MPOs must consider this in performance plans. MPOs can conduct technical assessments for emissions reductions to demonstrate project eligibility. MPOs are required to prepare performance plans for CMAQ-funded projects under H.R. 7. The proposed Section 149(k) of H.R. 7 requires MPOs to prepare performance plans for CMAQ-funded projects, allowing them to demonstrate emissions reductions for project eligibility. The House bill includes provisions to amend project eligibility requirements under 23 U.S.C. \u00a7149(b) but is not as extensive as the Senate bill. Incentives are provided in current laws to promote alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles. The House bill includes provisions to amend project eligibility requirements under 23 U.S.C. \u00a7149(b), focusing on incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles such as tax credits for plug-in vehicles and biofuels from cellulose. Incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles include tax credits for plug-in vehicles and biofuels from cellulose. Non-tax incentives under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy program and various highway programs also provide benefits for automakers producing alternative fuel vehicles. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program and various highway programs offer incentives for automakers producing alternative fuel vehicles, including credits and non-tax benefits. Legislation like H.R. 7 and MAP-21 aim to extend these incentives, such as allowing low-emission vehicles in HOV lanes, with limitations if lanes become congested. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 aim to extend incentives for alternative fuel vehicles, including allowing them in HOV lanes. Both bills would limit states' authority to exempt these vehicles if lanes become congested, regardless of the cause of congestion. The House and Senate bills aim to maintain a minimum average speed of 45 mph during peak travel hours and address degradation issues for exempted vehicles. They also propose using highway funds for new electric vehicle charging stations and amending the Clean Fuels Grant Program. The expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure through H.R. 7 and MAP-21 would allow highway funds to be used for new charging stations at parking facilities. MAP-21 would also amend the Clean Fuels Grant Program to include grants for clean fuel buses and facilities, including zero emission buses. The MAP-21 bill includes provisions for public transportation authorities to purchase alternative fuel, advanced diesel, and low-emission buses, with a focus on clean fuel buses and facilities. It also includes \"zero emission buses\" that do not emit carbon or particulate matter. The bill authorizes $10.458 billion annually for federal transit programs for FY2012 and FY2013. The Senate's public transit provisions in Division B of MAP-21 authorize $10.458 billion annually for federal transit programs for FY2012 and FY2013, with funding from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and the general fund. H.R. 7 proposes renaming the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and authorizing the same funding amount for FY2012. The House surface transportation reauthorization bill, H.R. 7, proposes renaming the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and authorizing $10.498 billion annually for FY2013 through FY2016, with funding from the alternative transportation account and the general fund. The legislation also eliminates the use of motor fuel taxes for mass transit. The legislation in H.R. 7 would authorize $10.498 billion annually for FY2013 through FY2016, with funding from the alternative transportation account and the general fund. It eliminates the use of motor fuel taxes for mass transit and transfers revenue to the highway account. Additionally, $40 billion would be transferred from the general fund into the alternative transportation account, restructuring the federal transit program. The FPTA in MAP-21 proposes transferring $40 billion from the general fund to the alternative transportation account, replacing the existing Fixed Guideway Modernization Program with a State of Good Repair Grant Program for maintenance, repair, and replacement of fixed guideway public transit. The proposed State of Good Repair (SGR) Grant Program would replace the existing Fixed Guideway Modernization Program. It includes four components: The High Intensity Fixed Guideway SGR Formula Program for maintenance, repair, and replacement of fixed guideway public transit. Funding would come from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and be distributed based on vehicle miles and route miles. The proposed State of Good Repair (SGR) Grant Program includes funding for maintenance, repair, and replacement of fixed guideway public transit systems such as rail, passenger ferry, or bus rapid transit. Funding sources include the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and the general fund. Grants would be distributed based on vehicle miles and route miles, with a focus on facilities at least seven years old. The Fixed Guideway SGR Grant Program would distribute competitive grants for the upkeep of fixed guideway systems, funded by the general fund. The High Intensity Motorbus SGR program would distribute funds for public transportation on facilities at least seven years old, funded by the mass transit account. The Bus and Bus Facilities SGR program would provide competitive grants for bus maintenance and facilities, with $75 million set aside from the New Starts program. The Bus and Bus Facilities SGR program, funded by the mass transit account, would distribute competitive grants for bus maintenance and facilities. $75 million would be set aside from the New Starts program for this program. The FPTA proposes eliminating the heavily earmarked discretionary Bus and Bus-Related Facilities program, with some of its funding potentially being added to other formula programs. The FPTA proposes significant changes, including setting aside $75 million from the New Starts program. The heavily earmarked discretionary Bus and Bus-Related Facilities program would be eliminated, with some funding potentially added to other formula programs. Additionally, the Formula Grants for Elderly Individuals and Individuals with Disabilities Program and the New Freedom Program would be combined into a single program called Formula Grants for Enhanced Mobility of Seniors. The FPTA proposes significant changes to transportation funding, including combining the Formula Grants for Elderly Individuals and Individuals with Disabilities Program with the New Freedom Program. The Jobs Access and Reverse Commute program would be shifted to the Urbanized and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs, and a new program called Formula Grants for Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities would be created. Recipients would be required to spend at least 3% of their Urbanized Area apportionments on projects for low-income individuals. The Jobs Access and Reverse Commute program is shifted to the Urbanized and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs. The renamed Access to Jobs program requires recipients to spend at least 3% of their Urbanized Area apportionments on projects for low-income individuals. Two new programs, the Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Program and the Public Transportation on Indian Reservations Program, are also created. The Senate bill introduces new programs to assist low-income individuals with transportation to jobs, including the Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Program and the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program for disaster situations. Funding is allocated from the Non-Urbanized Area funds for these initiatives. The House bill (H.R. 7) introduces a new Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program, similar to the Highway Emergency Relief Program, to provide funding for capital and operating costs in disaster situations. It authorizes necessary sums for this program and doubles the amount set aside for transit on Indian reservations from $15 million to $30 million annually, with $20 million distributed by formula and $10 million competitively. The House bill (H.R. 7) would double the amount set aside for transit on Indian reservations from $15 million to $30 million annually. $20 million would be distributed by formula and $10 million competitively. It eliminates some programs like the Clean Fuels Grant Program and combines others into a single program. The House bill (H.R. 7) maintains the federal transit program structure by eliminating programs like Clean Fuels Grant, Transit in Parks, and Growing and High Density State Formula. It combines New Freedom, Elderly Persons, and Jobs Access programs. Funding for Bus and Bus-Related Facilities would be distributed by formula instead of earmarked discretionary funding. H.R. 7 proposes changes to federal transit programs, including distributing funding for the Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Program by formula instead of earmarking. It also incentivizes contracting out bus services by requiring at least 20% of fixed route services to be contracted out. H.R. 7 proposes changes to federal transit programs, including providing funding for all types of transit agencies in urban and non-urban areas. It incentivizes contracting out bus services by allowing providers to lower their cost share if 20% of fixed route bus service is contracted out. Private intercity and charter operators cannot be excluded from federally funded facilities. The Senate bill would make substantial changes to the New Starts program. H.R. 7 allows providers to lower their cost share for bus and bus facilities capital projects if 20% of fixed route bus service is contracted out. Private intercity and charter operators cannot be excluded from federally funded facilities. The Senate bill proposes changes to the New Starts program, allowing funds for core capacity improvement projects and simplifying the process. The Senate bill proposes changes to the New Starts program, allowing funds for core capacity improvement projects and simplifying the process by reducing the number of major stages from four to three. The new stages are project development, engineering, and construction, with applicants required to apply in writing to the Secretary of Transportation to initiate the NEPA process. The Senate bill proposes simplifying the New Starts process by reducing the stages from four to three: project development, engineering, and construction. Applicants must apply in writing to the Secretary of Transportation to start the NEPA process and eliminate the separate alternatives analysis currently required by law. During project development, sponsors must provide information for the Secretary to review project justification and local financial aspects. The bill aims to streamline the transportation project delivery process by combining the alternatives analysis with NEPA requirements. Project sponsors must provide necessary information for the Secretary to review project justification and local financial commitment during project development. Once the NEPA process is completed with a ROD, FONSI, or Categorical Exclusion, the project can move into the Engineering Phase. The project applicant has two years to complete project development after providing necessary information for project justification and local financial commitment. Once the NEPA process is concluded with a ROD, FONSI, or Categorical Exclusion, the project can enter the Engineering Phase. Successful projects can then move into a full funding grant agreement with the Secretary for federal funding assistance and proceed to the construction phase. The Senate bill also aims to advance projects. The project is selected as the locally preferred alternative, adopted into the metropolitan plan, and justified on its merits. If successful, the project would be eligible for federal funding assistance and move into the construction phase. The Senate bill aims to advance projects more quickly, using special warrants for projects with federal shares of $100 million or less. It would eliminate the Small Starts program for projects requesting $75 million or less in federal assistance. The Senate bill aims to advance projects more quickly by using special warrants for projects with federal shares of $100 million or less. It would eliminate the Small Starts program for projects requesting $75 million or less in federal assistance. Additionally, the bill would create a pilot program for expedited project delivery for certain new fixed guideway capital projects and core capacity improvement projects. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes a pilot program for expedited project delivery for certain projects to test innovative methods. It maintains the distinction between New Starts and Small Starts projects, allocating $150 million for Small Starts projects. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes changes to the New Starts program, maintaining the distinction between New Starts and Small Starts projects. It allocates $150 million for Small Starts projects and includes provisions for expediting projects, such as using special warrants for new urban circulator service. H.R. 7 proposes eliminating alternatives analysis and expediting project evaluations with special warrants. It changes project justification criteria by adding private contributions and intermodal connectivity as factors. H.R. 7 would change project justification criteria by adding private contributions and intermodal connectivity as factors, while maintaining the prohibition on federal funds for operating expenses in urbanized areas with exceptions for small bus transit systems. The Senate bill adds exceptions to the prohibition on federal funds for operating expenses in urbanized areas with 200,000 or more people. Small bus transit systems with 75 or fewer buses can use up to 50% of their Urbanized Area apportionments for operating expenses, while systems with 76 to 100 buses can use 25%. Urbanized Area formula funds can also be used for operating expenses. The House bill (H.R. 7) allows transit systems with 75 or fewer buses to use up to 50% of their Urbanized Area apportionments for operating expenses. Systems with 76 to 100 buses can use 25%. Urbanized Area formula funds can be used for operating expenses in urbanized areas with high unemployment rates for up to three years. The House bill (H.R. 7) allows transit systems in urbanized areas with 200,000 or more people and high unemployment rates to use federal funding for operating expenses. Systems with 100 buses or fewer in peak service can use up to 25% of their apportionment in the first year and 20% for years two and three. H.R. 7 allows transit bus systems in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more with 100 buses or fewer in peak service to use federal funding for operating expenses. The cost share varies based on the number of buses operated, with a maximum of 25% federal funding for systems with 76-100 buses, and 50% federal funding for systems with 75 or fewer buses. H.R. 7 allows transit bus systems to use federal funding for operating expenses based on the number of buses operated, with a cost share of 25% federal for systems with 76-100 buses and 50% federal for systems with 75 or fewer buses. The bill also increases the share of funds for ADA paratransit from 10% to 15% and includes provisions for passenger and freight rail. H.R. 7 increases the share of funds for ADA paratransit from 10% to 15% and includes provisions for passenger and freight rail, calling for the development of a national rail plan to guide future investments and prioritize routes. Regional rail plans will also be developed in coordination with states, excluding the Amtrak-owned Northeast Corridor. Section 35101 of H.R. 7 mandates the development of a national rail plan for passenger and freight rail, with priority routes to be identified on a map. Regional rail plans, excluding the Amtrak-owned Northeast Corridor, will be created in coordination with states to further refine the national plan. States may also develop state rail plans to align with regional plans, which will impact federal capital grants for intercity passenger service. The bill mandates the development of national and regional rail plans, including state rail plans, to identify rail alignments and station stops. Amendments are made to the NEC advisory commission, requiring Amtrak to submit a new plan for high-speed service. DOT must develop guidance on measuring rail service improvements within one year of enactment. The bill mandates amendments to the NEC advisory commission for high-speed service and requires DOT to develop guidance on measuring train delays and conducting a data needs assessment for intercity passenger rail. The bill mandates amendments to the NEC advisory commission for high-speed service and requires DOT to develop guidance on measuring train delays, conducting a data needs assessment for intercity passenger rail, and surveying track access arrangements for intercity passenger rail operating on other railroads' tracks. It also furthers the development of standardized cars for corridor intercity passenger services by creating a corporate or cooperative entity controlled by Amtrak and states funding corridor. The bill aims to develop an equipment pool of standardized cars for corridor intercity passenger services by creating a corporate entity controlled by Amtrak and states funding corridor services. This entity would manage the standardized cars used in corridor service and Amtrak would be included as an eligible recipient in the capital grant program for corridor passenger service. The goal of the equipment pool is to achieve economies of scale in car usage. The bill proposes creating an entity controlled by Amtrak and states to manage standardized cars for corridor passenger service. It aims to achieve economies of scale in car production and maintenance, but may hinder innovation in car design. Federal regulations require passenger cars to limit damage in collisions, and the implementation of positive train control could impact domestic car design. The equipment pool aims to achieve economies of scale in car production and maintenance, potentially discouraging innovation in car design. Federal regulations require passenger cars to limit damage in collisions, leading to heavier U.S. cars with more robust bulkhead requirements. Implementation of positive train control could impact domestic car design by potentially modifying these requirements. The U.S. distinguishes itself from foreign passenger cars by focusing more on crash survival rather than crash avoidance, resulting in heavier cars with robust bulkhead requirements. The implementation of positive train control may lead to modifications in these requirements to align with foreign standards, potentially opening up a global market for passenger car equipment. H.R. 7 proposes to repeal the congestion grant program, which aims to reduce congestion and promote ridership growth on high-priority rail corridors. FRA may modify requirements to align with foreign standards, potentially creating a global market for passenger car equipment. H.R. 7 seeks to repeal the congestion grant program, which aims to reduce congestion on high-priority rail corridors. The congestion grant program, aimed at reducing congestion on high-priority rail corridors, was folded into Track 1 of the Federal Railroad Administration's High-Speed and Intercity Passenger Rail Grant Program in 2009. However, Congress did not provide funding for this program in FY2011 or FY2012. H.R. 7 would also reduce the authorized funding level for Amtrak's operating assistance grants and amend the law regarding food and beverage service on Amtrak trains. H.R. 7 would amend the law on food and beverage service on Amtrak trains, repealing the self-supporting requirement and addressing the issue of providing service despite costs exceeding revenues. Amtrak has continued to provide food and beverage service on trains despite costs exceeding revenues. H.R. 7 would repeal the self-supporting requirement, put the service out to competitive bidding, and only allow subsidies if a net loss is foreseen. The Federal Railroad Administration would put Amtrak's food and beverage service out to competitive bidding, allowing subsidies only if a net loss is anticipated. Section 36401 would expand a grant program to include road relocation, and Section 36408 would amend the RRIF Program for railroads. Section 36408 of SAFETEA-LU proposes amendments to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program, allowing collateral to include state or local subsidies and expanding eligible uses of a RRIF loan to cover pre-construction activities. The Senate bill also suggests minor changes to laws governing the Surface Transportation Board (STB). The Senate bill proposes changes to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program, allowing collateral to include state or local subsidies and expanding eligible uses of a RRIF loan. It also suggests minor changes to laws governing the Surface Transportation Board (STB), including raising the ceiling on the maximum total dollar value of freight charges that shippers can bring before the STB. The Senate bill proposes changes to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program, allowing collateral to include state or local subsidies and expanding eligible uses of a RRIF loan. It also suggests raising the ceiling on the maximum total dollar value of freight charges that shippers can bring before the Surface Transportation Board (STB). The bill would impose shorter procedural deadlines for rate relief cases and require the STB to study incorporating railroad asset replacement costs in its annual examination of revenue adequacy. The bill, H.R. 7, proposes changes to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program, including expanding eligible uses of a RRIF loan and allowing collateral to include state or local subsidies. It also suggests raising the ceiling on the maximum total dollar value of freight charges that shippers can bring before the Surface Transportation Board (STB). Additionally, the bill would impose shorter procedural deadlines for rate relief cases and require the STB to study incorporating railroad asset replacement costs in its annual examination of revenue adequacy. The bill, H.R. 7, proposes changes to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program, including expanding eligible uses of a RRIF loan and allowing collateral to include state or local subsidies. It also suggests raising the ceiling on the maximum total dollar value of freight charges that shippers can bring before the Surface Transportation Board (STB). Additionally, the bill would require the STB to compile and report railroad service complaints on its website, review staffing needs, repeal a capital grant program for smaller freight railroads, and facilitate access to the RRIF loan program. Congress mandated positive train control (PTC) in 2008 in response to safety concerns. The bill, H.R. 7, proposes changes to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program, including expanding eligible uses of a RRIF loan and allowing collateral to include state or local subsidies. Congress mandated positive train control (PTC) in 2008 in response to safety concerns, requiring passenger and freight railroads on certain routes to install PTC to prevent accidents. PTC relies on radio signaling to override human error in train control, although some have raised concerns about the high cost of implementation. Railroads must install Positive Train Control (PTC) technology on routes carrying toxic-by-inhalation products. PTC uses radio signaling to prevent accidents by overriding human error in train control. Some have objected to PTC due to high costs and spectrum limitations in urban areas. The Senate bill allows the Department of Transportation (DOT) to extend the deadline for PTC implementation beyond December 31, 2015, if deemed infeasible by a railroad. The Senate bill allows the Department of Transportation (DOT) to extend the deadline for implementing Positive Train Control (PTC) technology, citing spectrum limitations in urban areas as a challenge. The deadline can be extended in one-year increments, not beyond December 31, 2018. PTC implementation is also eligible for RRIF funding and requires a joint DOT/FCC study on spectrum needs. The House bill proposes extending the PTC deadline to 2021 for routes with passenger traffic and removes the deadline for other routes. The Senate bill allows for extending the deadline for implementing Positive Train Control (PTC) technology in one-year increments, not beyond December 31, 2018. PTC implementation can be funded through RRIF and requires a joint DOT/FCC study on spectrum needs. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes extending the PTC deadline to 2021 for routes with passenger traffic and removes the deadline for routes carrying certain toxic chemicals. Highway safety programs fall under the responsibility of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). H.R. 7 eliminates the deadline for routes carrying certain toxic chemicals, allowing railroads to implement equivalent safety measures. The Senate bill retains existing NHTSA grant programs and creates an incentive grant program for highway safety, including texting while driving and cell phone use by drivers under 18. It also increases the maximum civil penalty for violations of vehicle safety defect rules. The proposed legislation would create an incentive grant program to discourage texting while driving and cell phone use by drivers under 18, increase civil penalties for vehicle safety violations, and require event data recorders in passenger vehicles starting in 2015. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes consolidating multiple highway safety grant programs into one general program with reduced funding. It also prohibits federal funding for measuring motorcycle helmet usage and creating motorcyclist checkpoints. The Senate bill authorizes higher highway safety grants. The House bill, H.R. 7, aims to consolidate various highway safety grant programs into one program with reduced funding. It also prohibits federal funding for measuring motorcycle helmet usage and creating motorcyclist checkpoints. The Senate bill authorizes higher highway safety grants and includes measures to prevent drivers who have failed drug and alcohol tests from avoiding penalties. The Senate bill authorizes significantly higher highway safety grants in FY2012 and FY2013 compared to the House bill. Both bills aim to create a clearinghouse of drug and alcohol test results for commercial drivers and strengthen DOT's ability to act against \"reincarnated carriers.\" They also provide similar levels of funding for truck safety grants to states in FY2013. The bills aim to strengthen DOT's ability to act against \"reincarnated carriers\" and provide funding for truck safety grants to states in FY2013. Additionally, the transit safety section in MAP-21 addresses concerns about state oversight of transit safety following fatal incidents in 2009 and 2010. The transit safety section in MAP-21 aims to authorize DOT to establish and enforce minimum safety standards for rail transit systems not regulated by DOT, following fatal incidents in 2009 and 2010. The Public Transportation Safety Act of 2010 (S. 3638) authorizes DOT to set safety standards for rail transit systems not regulated by DOT, establish a safety certification program, and ensure state safety oversight agencies are financially independent. H.R. 7 would establish a safety certification program for rail transit systems, ensuring state safety oversight agencies are financially independent. It authorizes grants to states for this program and prioritizes safety and state of good repair projects for federal funding. H.R. 7 would authorize grants to states for a safety certification program for rail transit systems, prioritizing safety and state of good repair projects for federal funding. It would also ensure state safety oversight agencies have the necessary resources and authority for their responsibilities. The proposed legislation would prioritize safety and state of good repair projects for federal funding, authorize financial assistance to state safety oversight organizations, and allocate funds for transportation research and education. Both bills aim to enhance technology deployment in transportation. Both MAP-21 and H.R. 7 authorize funding for transportation research and education, with MAP-21 allocating $400 million for FY2012 and FY2013, and H.R. 7 allocating $440 million annually. Both bills include provisions for technology deployment programs, competitive grant programs, and prize competitions to promote transportation innovations. Additionally, both bills direct the Department of Transportation to conduct studies on various aspects of transportation improvement and infrastructure investment needs. MAP-21 also includes a competitive grant program for accelerating ITS deployment. Both MAP-21 and H.R. 7 authorize prize competitions to promote transportation innovations and studies on improving safety, reducing congestion, and assessing infrastructure needs. MAP-21 allocates $400 million for transportation research, while H.R. 7 allocates $440 million annually. Both bills also include provisions for technology deployment programs and competitive grant programs. Both MAP-21 and H.R. 7 authorize grants for transportation research at university centers. They both emphasize the need for full spending of revenues in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for waterside infrastructure maintenance. House-passed H.R. 4348 includes language to ensure budgetary resources match the fiscal year level. The House-passed H.R. 4348 includes language that would require budgetary resources to match the level of receipts credited to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, restricting the use of funds to harbor maintenance programs."
