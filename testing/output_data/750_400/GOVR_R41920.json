    "content": "Both House and Senate bills for the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 address detainee issues at Guantanamo Bay and counterterrorism measures. H.R. 1540 passed the House, while S. 1253 and S. 1867 were reported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee. On December 1, 2011, the Senate passed S. 1867, addressing detainee provisions. The Senate also passed H.R. 1540 with the Senate bill's provisions replacing the original language, pending conference consideration of differences between the House and Senate versions. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, addressing detainee provisions. The Senate also passed H.R. 1540 with the Senate bill's provisions replacing the original language. Differences between the House and Senate versions will be discussed in conference. The White House has criticized aspects of both bills and threatened to veto any legislation that limits the President's authorities. The White House has criticized aspects of both bills addressing detainee provisions and threatened to veto any legislation that challenges the President's critical authorities in collecting intelligence and protecting the Nation. The Administration opposes military detention mandates, limits on executive discretion in prosecuting terrorist suspects, and constraints on transferring detainees from U.S. custody. The report provides a detailed analysis of the House- and Senate-passed bills on detainee provisions, highlighting strong opposition to military detention mandates, limits on executive discretion in prosecuting terrorist suspects, and constraints on transferring detainees from U.S. custody. The bills aim to confirm and potentially expand the detention authority granted to the President post-9/11 attacks. The House- and Senate-passed bills on detainee provisions aim to confirm and potentially expand the detention authority granted to the President post-9/11 attacks, comparing their approach to major issues addressed. The Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) granted the President authority to use force against those involved in the 9/11 attacks. The Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) granted the President authority to use force against those involved in the 9/11 attacks and prevent future acts of terrorism. Many captured individuals have been placed in preventive detention to stop their involvement in hostilities or terrorism. The AUMF authorized the President to use force against those involved in the 9/11 attacks and prevent future terrorism. Many captured individuals have been detained to prevent their involvement in hostilities or terrorism. Some have been tried in military commissions or civilian courts for related crimes. In 2004, the Supreme Court ruled in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld that the President can detain enemy combatants captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens, for the duration of hostilities. Lower courts are tasked with defining the scope of detention authority under the AUMF. The Hamdi decision in 2004 allowed the President to detain enemy combatants captured in Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens, for the duration of hostilities. Subsequent judicial activity in the D.C. Circuit has focused on habeas petitions by Guantanamo detainees challenging the legality of their detention. The D.C. Circuit has been handling habeas petitions by Guantanamo detainees challenging their detention, with rulings generally favoring the government's authority under the AUMF. It is uncertain if the Supreme Court will review these rulings and what their decision will be. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has been favorable to the government's detention authority under the AUMF. It is unclear if the Supreme Court will review these rulings and endorse or reject them. Congress has not passed any legislation to clarify the scope of detention authority granted by the AUMF. The D.C. Circuit has looked to post-AUMF legislation on military commissions for guidance. The D.C. Circuit Court has endorsed the government's detention authority under the AUMF, while Congress has not provided legislation to clarify this authority. The court has looked to post-AUMF legislation on military commissions for guidance on who may be subject to military detention. The D.C. Circuit Court has endorsed the government's detention authority under the AUMF, allowing for the detention of individuals associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban. Most detainees are combatants captured during military operations in Afghanistan or abroad. The AUMF allows for the detention of individuals associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban, most of whom are combatants captured during military operations in Afghanistan or abroad. Many detainees were held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, while others were initially held at different locations for interrogation. Additionally, a U.S.-operated facility in Parwan, Afghanistan, holds a significant number of detainees captured in the region. Many individuals associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban have been detained, with some held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and others at a facility in Parwan, Afghanistan. Future captures outside of Afghanistan do not have a designated detention facility, leading to ad hoc practices. Persons arrested in the United States for terrorist activity on behalf of Al Qaeda are also addressed. Detainees captured in Afghanistan are held at Guantanamo Bay or Parwan facility. Future captures outside Afghanistan lack a designated detention facility, leading to ad hoc practices. Persons arrested in the US for terrorist activity on behalf of Al Qaeda are usually prosecuted in federal court, not placed in military detention. Bush Administration transferred some US citizens arrested in the US into military custody as \"enemy combatants\". Persons arrested in the US for terrorist activity on behalf of Al Qaeda are typically prosecuted in federal court, not placed in military detention. The Bush Administration transferred some individuals into military custody as \"enemy combatants\", including a U.S. citizen and a legal permanent resident alien suspected of being an Al Qaeda \"sleeper agent\". The detainees, labeled as \"enemy combatants\", were initially arrested by law enforcement authorities upon their return from Afghanistan and suspected of terrorist activities. They were transferred to military custody but later returned to civil authorities for trial in federal court, leaving the legality of their prior detention uncertain. There has been controversy over how to handle suspected terrorists in U.S. custody, with some arguing for military detention and trial for those affiliated with Al Qaeda. There is controversy over the appropriate mechanism for dealing with suspected terrorists in U.S. custody, with arguments for military custody and trial before a military commission or transfer to civilian law enforcement for trial before an Article III court. Some suggest a combination of military and traditional law enforcement methods for handling suspected terrorists and belligerents. Disagreement exists over the best approach to handling suspected terrorists in U.S. custody, with some advocating for military trials before a military commission or civilian trials before an Article III court. Others argue for a combination of military and traditional law enforcement methods, while some believe executive discretion should determine the approach on a case-by-case basis. Disagreement over handling suspected terrorists in U.S. custody, with some advocating for military trials or civilian trials before an Article III court. Congress passed funding restrictions to prevent Guantanamo detainee transfers to the U.S. for the 2011 fiscal year. Congress passed funding restrictions in response to the Obama Administration's plans to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the US for trial in Article III courts. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 extended this prohibition through FY2012, along with other measures limiting executive discretion on detainee transfers. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 extends the prohibition on transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US for trial in civilian courts through FY2012. This restriction effectively limits prosecution options to military commissions at Guantanamo. The prohibition on transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US for trial in civilian courts was extended beyond FY2011. This restriction limits prosecution options to military commissions at Guantanamo, as no civilian court operates there. Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a Somali national, was brought to the US to face terrorism-related charges in a civilian court in July 2011 after being detained on a US naval vessel. Some terrorist suspects, like Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, have been brought to the US for trial in civilian courts, sparking controversy over whether they should be held in military custody abroad or transferred to civilian custody immediately. Other instances include the arrests of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and Faisal Shahzad by US civil authorities. Some terrorist suspects, like Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, have been detained on a U.S. naval vessel for two months for interrogation by military and intelligence personnel. Controversy arose over whether Warsame should have remained in military custody abroad or been transferred to civilian custody immediately. Additionally, criticism was directed at the Administration for bringing civilian charges against two Iraqi refugees suspected of insurgent activities against U.S. military forces in Iraq. The Administration faced criticism for bringing civilian charges against terrorist suspects like Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and Faisal Shahzad, instead of detaining them for military interrogation. The 2012 NDAA is expected to address the handling of individuals apprehended in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The 2012 NDAA is expected to address the handling of individuals apprehended in the conflict with Al Qaeda, including provisions on detainee operations and restrictions on transfer of detainees. The 2012 NDAA, H.R. 1540, passed by the House of Representatives, reaffirms the conflict with Al Qaeda and imposes restrictions on detainee transfers and trials for foreign nationals involved in terrorist attacks. The White House expressed support for most aspects of the bill but criticized certain provisions. The 2012 NDAA, H.R. 1540, passed by the House of Representatives, reaffirms the conflict with Al Qaeda and imposes restrictions on detainee transfers and trials for foreign nationals involved in terrorist attacks. The White House supported most aspects of the bill but criticized provisions related to detainee matters. The White House threatened to veto any version of the bill challenging executive branch authority. S. 1253 from the Senate Armed Services Committee would have authorized detention of certain persons. The House was highly critical of provisions in S. 1253 concerning detainee matters, threatening to veto any bill challenging executive branch authority. The bill would have authorized detention of certain persons, regulated status determinations and periodic review proceedings for Guantanamo detainees, and made funding restrictions on detainee transfers permanent. The Senate delayed consideration of a bill regarding detainee matters after objections from the White House and Senate committees. The revised bill, S. 1867, was reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee on November 15, 2011. The Senate passed bill S. 1867 with revised detainee provisions despite objections from the White House and Senate committees. The Department of Defense and the White House threatened to veto any final bill that challenges the President's authorities in handling terrorist suspects. The Senate passed bill S. 1867 with revised detainee provisions on November 15, 2011. The White House objected to the provisions and threatened to veto any final bill challenging the President's authorities in handling terrorist suspects. The Senate clarified that the provision affirming the authority to detain persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda did not modify existing authorities relating to the detention of U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens. The Senate passed S. 1867 with an amendment clarifying detainee provisions, which did not affect existing authorities regarding the detention of U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens. The Senate then amended H.R. 1540 to incorporate the provisions of S. 1867. Differences between the House and Senate versions will be discussed in conference. The current status of U.S. policies and legal authorities on detainee matters in the FY2012 NDAA is addressed in the bill. The House amended H.R. 1540 with provisions from S. 1867. Differences between the House and Senate versions will be discussed in conference. The sections address U.S. policies and legal authorities on detainee matters in the FY2012 NDAA, including detention authority under the AUMF and detainee case reviews. The background also discusses recidivism concerns. The FY2012 NDAA addresses detention authority under the AUMF and detainee case reviews, including recidivism concerns. The scope of detention authority is not clearly defined by the AUMF, leading to differing interpretations. The AUMF is the primary legal basis for detaining individuals linked to Al Qaeda. The scope of detention authority under the AUMF is open to interpretation. The Obama Administration stated that detainees can be held if they were involved in the 9/11 attacks or harbored those responsible. The Obama Administration interpreted the AUMF as granting authority to detain individuals involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting Taliban or al-Qaida forces engaged in hostilities against the United States. The President has the authority to detain persons involved in the 9/11 attacks, supporting Taliban or al-Qaida forces, or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the United States. The inclusion of \"associated forces\" raises questions about the extent of executive detention authority under the AUMF. The AUMF grants the President the authority to detain individuals involved in 9/11, supporting Al Qaeda or the Taliban, or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the US. The inclusion of \"associated forces\" raises concerns about the breadth of executive detention power under the AUMF, particularly regarding the interpretation of \"substantial support\" and the potential for indefinite detention. The Supreme Court has interpreted this authority in reference to principles of the law of war. The AUMF grants the President the authority to detain individuals involved in 9/11, supporting Al Qaeda or the Taliban, or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the US. The \"substantial support\" prong of the executive's detention authority may raise questions regarding indefinite detention under the law of war. The government has not clarified the precise nature and degree of \"substantial support.\" The government has not clarified the precise nature and degree of \"substantial support\" that could lead to indefinite detention under the law of war. The Obama Administration's detention authority definition is similar to the Bush Administration's, requiring \"substantial support\" for individuals to be treated as an \"enemy combatant.\" The Obama Administration's definition of detention authority is similar to the Bush Administration's, requiring \"substantial support\" for individuals to be treated as an \"enemy combatant.\" Recent court decisions have not clarified the specifics of \"substantial support\" needed for detention eligibility. The Obama Administration's definition of detention authority, like the Bush Administration's, requires \"substantial support\" for individuals to be considered enemy combatants. Recent court decisions have not provided clarity on the criteria for \"substantial support\" in determining detention eligibility. The executive branch has included \"associated forces\" in its detention authority since 2004, allowing for the detention of enemy combatants beyond just al-Qaida or the Taliban. In Afghanistan, various armed groups trained and fought alongside these organizations. The AUMF does not limit the organizations it covers to just al-Qaida or the Taliban. In Afghanistan, many different private armed groups trained and fought alongside these organizations. The United States has authority to detain individuals who would be detainable under principles of co-belligerency in a traditional international armed conflict. The AUMF grants the United States authority to detain individuals who would be detainable under principles of co-belligerency in a traditional international armed conflict, including those who fought alongside al-Qaida and the Taliban. This aligns with the Bush Administration's stance on detaining individuals captured in Afghanistan as part of an \"associated force.\" The AUMF allows for the detention of individuals who could be detained under co-belligerency principles in a traditional armed conflict, including those associated with al Qaida or the Taliban. The D.C. Circuit rejected the government's argument in Parhat v. Gates that affiliation with ETIM made a petitioner an \"enemy combatant.\" The court accepted the criteria for membership in an \"associated force\" as being part of or supporting forces associated with al Qaida or the Taliban. The court rejected the government's argument that affiliation with ETIM made a petitioner an \"enemy combatant.\" It accepted the criteria for membership in an \"associated force\" as supporting forces associated with al Qaida or the Taliban. The court found the government's evidence did not support the second and third prongs, so it did not need to address the first. The court rejected the government's argument that affiliation with ETIM made a petitioner an \"enemy combatant.\" It found the government's evidence did not support the second and third prongs, so it did not need to address the first. The government defined \"associated force\" as being closely linked to al Qaida or the Taliban, but the court did not find evidence to support this. The court rejected the government's argument that affiliation with ETIM made a petitioner an \"enemy combatant.\" The government defined \"associated force\" as being closely linked to al Qaida or the Taliban, but the court did not find evidence to support this. If ETIM is closely associated with al Qaida or the Taliban, it is considered part of the same organization, potentially covered by the AUMF. The term 'associated force' may require a close operational nexus in the current armed conflict. The court did not find sufficient evidence to establish that ETIM is closely connected to Al Qaeda to be considered an \"associated force\" in the current armed conflict. The government's definition of \"associated force\" was not met, but a plain-language interpretation might have led to a different outcome. The court did not find sufficient evidence to establish that ETIM is closely connected to Al Qaeda to be considered an \"associated force\" in the current armed conflict. The government's definition of \"associated force\" was not met, but a plain-language interpretation might have led to a different outcome. The term \"associated forces\" has been interpreted in habeas cases to cover armed groups assisting the Taliban or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. In its 2009 brief, the government indicated that the definition of \"associated forces\" needed further development through application to concrete facts in individual cases. The term has been interpreted in habeas cases to cover armed groups assisting the Taliban or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, such as \"Zubayda's militia\" and Hezb\u2013i\u2013Islami Gulbuddin (\"HIG\"). The AUMF has been applied to groups like \"Zubayda's militia\" and Hezb\u2013i\u2013Islami Gulbuddin (\"HIG\") in Afghanistan. The D.C. Circuit also upheld the detention of a cook for the 55th Arab Military Brigade defending the Taliban. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the detention of a cook for the 55th Arab Military Brigade, a force defending the Taliban against coalition forces. The AUMF's scope of detention authority is uncertain when it comes to individuals captured outside of Afghanistan. The AUMF's scope of detention authority is uncertain when it comes to individuals captured outside of Afghanistan, especially U.S. citizens or those with significant ties to the United States. The Administration has suggested that \"associated forces\" outside of Afghanistan may be targeted for use of force under the AUMF. The Supreme Court's decision in Hamdi allowed for the detention of a U.S. citizen captured in Afghanistan, but did not clarify the rules for persons captured elsewhere. The AUMF's detention authority is unclear for individuals captured outside of Afghanistan, especially U.S. citizens or those with ties to the United States. The U.S. Court of Appeals believes the AUMF allows detention of anyone functionally part of Al Qaeda, even if captured outside the U.S. The U.S. Court of Appeals has interpreted the AUMF to authorize the detention of individuals captured outside of Afghanistan who are functionally part of Al Qaeda. This includes cases involving non-U.S. citizens captured outside the United States. The Fourth Circuit upheld the military detention of a U.S. citizen and a resident alien captured in the United States as enemy combatants designated by the executive branch. The detainees were later transferred to civilian law enforcement custody for criminal prosecution. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the military detention of a U.S. citizen and a resident alien captured in the United States as enemy combatants designated by the executive branch. The detainees were transferred to civilian law enforcement custody for criminal prosecution before the Supreme Court could review the cases, leaving the issue of detention authority under the AUMF for individuals captured in the U.S. unsettled. The circumstances of detaining a U.S. citizen or person captured in the United States under the AUMF authority are unclear. Combatant Status Review Tribunals were established by the Pentagon in response to Supreme Court decisions in 2004 regarding \"enemy combatants\" at Guantanamo. These tribunals determine if detainees can be held due to enemy belligerency status. The Pentagon established Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) to determine the enemy belligerency status of detainees at Guantanamo. CSRTs confirmed the status of 539 combatants between 2004 and 2009, allowing for transfer or other actions based on U.S. foreign policy. Detainees not deemed enemy combatants were eligible for transfer or other actions in line with U.S. foreign policy. CSRTs confirmed status of 539 combatants between 2004-2009. CSRT process largely inactive since 2007 due to few new detainees at Guantanamo. New detainees may go through CSRT if brought to Guantanamo. Process only used for Guantanamo detainees. The CSRT process, largely inactive since 2007 due to few new detainees at Guantanamo, would be used for any new detainees brought to the facility. Non-citizen detainees in Afghanistan have a different review process with fewer rights. Guantanamo detainees can challenge their detention in federal court. Detainees held by the United States in Afghanistan have a different status review process with fewer procedural rights compared to Guantanamo detainees. Lower court jurisprudence has not recognized the privilege of habeas corpus for non-citizen detainees in Afghanistan. President Obama created task forces to study Guantanamo detention and U.S. detention policy. The Obama Administration created task forces to study Guantanamo detention and U.S. detention policy, while lower court jurisprudence has not recognized habeas corpus privilege for non-citizen detainees in Afghanistan. The Obama Administration created task forces to study Guantanamo detention and U.S. detention policy. Most proceedings related to military commissions and administrative review boards at Guantanamo were on hold. In 2009, a new review system was implemented for detainees at Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan. The status of persons captured in connection with hostilities remains unclear. The Obama Administration established a review system for detainees at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan, which now applies to the new detention facility in Parwan. President Obama issued Executive Order 13567 for the periodic review of Guantanamo detainees designated for preventive detention or referred for criminal prosecution without conviction. The status of persons captured in connection with hostilities remains unclear. President Obama issued Executive Order 13567 on March 7, 2011, establishing a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess the continued detention of Guantanamo detainees designated for preventive detention or referred for criminal prosecution without conviction. The PRB determines if detention is necessary to protect against a significant threat to the US security. If continued detention is not warranted, the Secretaries of State and Defense are involved. The executive order establishes a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess the continued detention of Guantanamo detainees. If detention is not deemed necessary to protect against a significant threat to US security, efforts are made to transfer the detainee outside of the United States. The Secretaries of State and Defense are responsible for finding suitable transfer locations for Guantanamo detainees outside the US. A review by the PRB must occur within a year, allowing detainees to challenge their continued detention. The PRB conducts initial reviews for detainees within a year of the order's issuance, allowing challenges to continued detention. The process is discretionary and does not change existing detention authority or affect federal courts' jurisdiction. The order establishes a discretionary process for reviewing detainee cases periodically, without changing existing detention authority or affecting federal courts' jurisdiction. Congress has placed limits on detainee transfers to prevent individuals from engaging in terrorist activities after release from Guantanamo. Concerns about detainees released from Guantanamo engaging in terrorist activities have led Congress to restrict transfers, requiring certification of measures in the destination country. Post-release detainee activities are not well-documented, but some have been involved in terrorism after leaving Guantanamo. Some Guantanamo detainees have engaged in terrorist activities after their release, sparking debate over the policy implications of transferring or detaining them without trial. Statistics on post-release activities are classified, but concerns have led to restrictions on transfers. The policy implications of transferring or detaining Guantanamo detainees without trial have sparked debate. In 2007, the Pentagon reported that 30 former detainees had engaged in militant activities or anti-U.S. propaganda after their release, which was disputed by researchers at Seton Hall University. In 2007, the Pentagon estimated that 30 former Guantanamo detainees had engaged in militant activities or anti-U.S. propaganda after their release. Researchers at Seton Hall University disputed these numbers, citing discrepancies in the data and a lack of identifying information for verification. They also disagreed with the Pentagon's classification of the detainees' activities. Researchers at Seton Hall University disputed the Pentagon's claim that former Guantanamo detainees engaged in militant activities post-release, citing discrepancies in data and lack of verification. They disagreed with the classification of detainees' activities as \"recidivism\" or \"reengagement,\" suggesting that post-release behavior could be due to radicalization during internment. The Pentagon released data from CSRT hearings regarding detainees' activities, suggesting that post-release terrorist conduct could be due to radicalization during internment. The Defense Intelligence Agency reported that 36 ex-Guantanamo detainees were confirmed or suspected of returning to terrorism in 2008. The study found that some individuals engaged in deadly activities like suicide bombings after leaving Guantanamo. In 2008, the Defense Intelligence Agency reported that 36 ex-detainees were confirmed or suspected of returning to terrorism. In 2009, the Pentagon reported that 74 out of 534 transferred prisoners were believed to have engaged in terrorism or militant activity. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 required the Director of National Intelligence to make public an unclassified summary of intelligence related to Guantanamo detainees. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 required the Director of National Intelligence to release a report on Guantanamo detainees' recidivism rates. Of the 598 detainees transferred, 81 were assessed to have engaged in terrorism or militant activity. The report released in December 2010 assessed the recidivism rates of Guantanamo detainees. Of the 598 transferred detainees, 81 were confirmed and 69 suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities. Out of the 150 recidivist detainees, 13 are deceased, 54 in custody, and 83 remain at large. The Intelligence Community assesses that 81 detainees are confirmed and 69 are suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities after transfer from Guantanamo. Out of the 150 recidivist detainees, 13 are deceased, 54 in custody, and 83 remain at large. Since Executive Order 13492, 2 detainees are confirmed and 3 suspected of participating in terrorist activities. The accuracy of these numbers has been challenged. Since Executive Order 13492, 2 detainees transferred from Guantanamo are confirmed and 3 suspected of terrorist activities. The accuracy of these numbers has been questioned, with estimates suggesting a higher threat percentage. The discrepancy is due to classified intelligence data. The New America Foundation analyzed Pentagon reports and estimated that around 6% of released detainees posed a threat to the US. The discrepancy in detainee recidivism numbers between the DNI's report and publicly available sources remains unexplained. However, there is agreement that the number of released detainees engaging in terrorism has increased. The following sections summarize subtitle D of title X of H.R. 1540. Subtitle D of title X of H.R. 1540, passed by the House of Representatives on May 26, 2011, defines \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" as non-US citizens or non-US Armed Forces members held at Guantanamo after March 7, 2011. Section 1031 of H.R. 1540, passed by the House of Representatives on May 26, 2011, defines \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" as non-US citizens or non-US Armed Forces members held at Guantanamo after March 7, 2011, under the custody of the Department of Defense. The term is not limited to detainees under the AUMF authority. The provision in H.R. 1540 defines \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" as non-US citizens or non-US Armed Forces members held at Guantanamo after March 7, 2011, under the custody or effective control of the Department of Defense. The term is not restricted to detainees under the AUMF authority, potentially covering detainees found not to be enemy belligerents but still held at Guantanamo. The term \"effective control\" of the Department of Defense is ambiguous, possibly referring to situations beyond immediate physical custody. The term \"effective control\" of the Department of Defense is ambiguous, potentially covering situations beyond immediate physical custody at Guantanamo. This term may include detainees not in DOD custody but under its supervision. The term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" is broadly defined to include foreign nationals brought to Guantanamo for non-hostility reasons, such as foreign refugees intercepted at sea and taken to the Migrant Operations Center at the Naval Station. Executive authorities may not interpret H.R. 1540 provisions regarding Guantanamo detainees to apply to foreign refugees. Section 1033 amends the situation regarding detainees at Guantanamo. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 amends the Military Commissions Act of 2009 to allow guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions. The current MCA only allows the death penalty if all commission members vote to convict and agree on the death sentence. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 amends the Military Commissions Act of 2009 to allow guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions, permitting the death penalty in cases where the accused has pled guilty, as long as military commission panel members vote unanimously. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 amends the Military Commissions Act of 2009 to allow the death penalty in cases where the accused has pled guilty, as long as military commission panel members vote unanimously. It also addresses pre-trial agreements, permitting reductions in maximum sentences but not allowing a military judge to impose the death penalty alone. Section 1034 clarifies the armed conflict with Al Qaeda and other groups. The commission panel members unanimously approve the sentence. Section 1033 amends the MCA to address pre-trial agreements, allowing for a reduction in the maximum sentence but not permitting a military judge to impose the death penalty alone. Section 1034 clarifies the armed conflict with Al Qaeda and other entities, affirming the President's authority to detain captured belligerents. Section 1034 affirms the armed conflict with Al Qaeda, Taliban, and associated forces, granting the President authority to detain captured belligerents for the duration of hostilities and use necessary force under the AUMF. The President is authorized to use all necessary force during the armed conflict with Al Qaeda, Taliban, and associated forces. The current armed conflict includes entities engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 affirms the President's authority to detain individuals who are part of or supporting al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the US. Supporters argue that it confirms the ongoing armed conflict since the 2001 AUMF. The controversial provision in H.R. 1540 affirms the President's authority to detain belligerents, including \"associated forces,\" until the end of hostilities. Supporters argue it confirms the armed conflict since the 2001 AUMF, while opponents question the inclusion of \"associated forces\" without AUMF reference. The provision in H.R. 1540 affirms the President's authority to detain belligerents, including \"associated forces,\" without specific reference to the AUMF requirement for a nexus to the 9/11 attacks. Opponents fear this could expand the armed conflict to cover any new terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda, while proponents argue that concerns about the language are unfounded. The proposed language in H.R. 1540 affirms the President's authority to detain belligerents, including \"associated forces,\" without specific reference to the AUMF requirement for a nexus to the 9/11 attacks. Concerns about the breadth of the language are debated, with some arguing it could expand the armed conflict to cover any new terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda. Others view the removal of the AUMF's limits on identifying parties to the armed conflict as significant. Some argue that the proposed language in H.R. 1540 expands the President's authority to detain belligerents, including \"associated forces,\" without specific reference to the AUMF requirement for a nexus to the 9/11 attacks. Concerns about the broad language are debated, with others noting that Section 1034 goes beyond the executive branch's characterization of the conflict by identifying additional belligerent parties. The proposed language in H.R. 1540 expands the President's authority to detain belligerents, including \"associated forces,\" without specific reference to the AUMF requirement for a nexus to the 9/11 attacks. Section 1034 goes beyond the executive branch's characterization of the conflict by identifying additional belligerent parties who have engaged in or supported hostilities against the United States. The proposed language in H.R. 1540 expands the President's authority to detain belligerents, including \"associated forces,\" without specific reference to the AUMF requirement for a nexus to the 9/11 attacks. Section 1034 identifies additional belligerent parties who have engaged in or supported hostilities against the United States, potentially including entities with past support for Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces. The proposed language in H.R. 1540 expands the President's authority to detain belligerents, including \"associated forces,\" without specific reference to the AUMF requirement for a nexus to the 9/11 attacks. It suggests that entities could be deemed belligerents even if their support for Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated groups occurred prior to September 11, 2001, and involved hostilities with no effect on the United States. The proposed language in H.R. 1540 expands the President's authority to detain belligerents, including \"associated forces,\" without specific reference to the AUMF requirement for a nexus to the 9/11 attacks. It suggests that entities could be deemed belligerents even if their support for Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated groups occurred prior to September 11, 2001, and involved hostilities with no effect on the United States. The legislative history of H.R. 1540 suggests that Section 1034 is not intended to authorize a significant expansion of the ongoing conflict with Al Qaeda and affiliated organizations. The legislative history of H.R. 1540 suggests that Section 1034 is not intended to authorize a significant expansion of the ongoing conflict with Al Qaeda and affiliated organizations, but instead to reaffirm the current interpretation of the AUMF advanced by the executive in habeas litigation involving wartime detainees. The House Armed Services Committee report accompanying H.R. 1540 describes the intent behind Section 1034 as reaffirming the current interpretation of the AUMF in relation to targeting decisions and operations. The House Armed Services Committee report accompanying H.R. 1540 describes the intent behind Section 1034 as addressing the evolving threat posed by Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces to U.S. national security. The committee supports the Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force to address the threat posed by Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces, despite ongoing challenges to U.S. national security. The committee supports the Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force to address the threat posed by Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces, as affirmed in a March 13, 2009 filing before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. This interpretation does not limit the President's existing authority and remains consistent with Congress's scope of authorities. If courts continue to interpret \"associated forces\" as armed organizations fighting alongside the Taliban or Al Qaeda against the United States or coalition forces, it aligns with past interpretations. The Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force aligns with Congress's scope of authorities. The term \"associated forces\" may not expand the authority to use force beyond what is already permitted under the AUMF. The word \"associated\" is not limited to armed organizations fighting alongside the Taliban or Al Qaeda. Congress's codification of the language lacks further definition. The language in H.R. 1540 Section 1034 paragraphs (1) and (2) does not appear to expand the authority to use force beyond what is already permitted under the AUMF. The term \"associated\" is not confined to armed organizations fighting alongside the Taliban or Al Qaeda. Congress's codification of the language lacks further definition, which could lead to a plain-text interpretation of \"associated\" in habeas cases. The language in H.R. 1540 Section 1034 paragraphs (1) and (2) does not expand the authority to use force beyond the AUMF. The term \"associated\" lacks definition, potentially leading to a plain-text interpretation in habeas cases. Paragraph (3) echoes language used by Combatant Status Review Tribunals at Guantanamo, allowing detention of individuals supporting Taliban, Al Qaeda, or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the US or its partners. This includes those who have committed belligerent acts or supported hostilities aiding enemy armed forces. The White House has stated that Combatant Status Review Tribunals at Guantanamo allow for the detention of individuals who support Taliban, Al Qaeda, or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the US or its partners. This includes those who have committed belligerent acts or supported hostilities aiding enemy armed forces. The differing contexts may result in different interpretations for the scope of the conflict. The White House strongly objects to section 1034, arguing that it would recharacterize the scope of the conflict and create confusion. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to establish a review process for Guantanamo detainees. The White House objects to section 1034, stating it would recharacterize the conflict's scope and create confusion. Section 1036 mandates a review process for Guantanamo detainees by the Secretary of Defense to determine the necessity of continued military detention for national security. The White House objects to section 1034, stating it would recharacterize the conflict's scope and create confusion. Section 1036 mandates a review process for Guantanamo detainees by the Secretary of Defense to determine if continued military detention is necessary for national security. The review process under Section 1036 involves military officers on the initial panel, stricter criteria for assessing detention necessity, and limitations on private counsel assistance for detainees. The review process under Section 1036 for Guantanamo detainees requires military officers on the initial panel, stricter criteria for assessing detention necessity, and limits on private counsel assistance. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress within 180 days on establishing a periodic review process for detainee continued detention. This includes a full review every three years for each detainee. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress within 180 days on establishing a periodic review process for detainee continued detention at Guantanamo. This process includes a full review every three years for each detainee, with more limited reviews of detainee files at least once a year. The review process does not apply to detainees undergoing trial or serving a sentence by military commission, or those ordered released by a federal court. The review process for detainee continued detention at Guantanamo includes a full review every three years and more limited reviews of detainee files at least once a year. The review is conducted by a panel of military officers with expertise in operations, intelligence, and counterterrorism, and the detainee is entitled to be assisted by a \"military personal representative.\" The review process for detainee continued detention at Guantanamo involves a panel of military officers conducting a review every three years. The detainee is entitled to be assisted by a \"military personal representative\" with the appropriate security clearance during the review, where they can present statements, evidence, respond to questions, and call witnesses. The detainee is allowed to have a military personal representative with the necessary security clearance advocate on their behalf during the review process at Guantanamo. They can present statements, evidence, respond to questions, and call witnesses to determine if they pose a threat to the US or its allies. The detainee and their representative are provided with relevant information before the hearing. The detainee is provided with relevant information before the hearing to determine if they pose a threat to the US or its allies. The detainee's personal representative can also receive a copy of the government's submission, and outside parties may provide written submissions if authorized by the detainee. The panel may order a substitute for classified information to protect national security. Outside parties, including the detainee's counsel, can provide written submissions with detainee authorization. The annual file review considers new information on the threat posed by the individual for a potential full review by a military panel. The annual file review assesses new information on the threat posed by the individual, including mitigating factors, for a potential full review by a military panel. The panel considers various factors in determining the need for continued internment, such as the likelihood of the individual resuming terrorist activity if released. The military panel considers various factors in assessing a Guantanamo detainee's continued internment, including the likelihood of resuming terrorist activity or reestablishing ties with hostile organizations upon release. The panel also reviews the detainee's behavior in custody and any mitigating information presented during the government's submission. The military panel considers factors like the likelihood of resuming terrorist activity, ties with hostile organizations, behavior in custody, mitigating information, and intelligence value in assessing a Guantanamo detainee's continued internment. Section 1036 mandates an interagency review board to oversee this process. The establishment of an interagency review board, composed of senior officials from various government departments, is required to review the military panel's assessment of Guantanamo detainees for any errors. The board can reject recommendations by majority vote if they disagree with them. The interagency review board, consisting of officials from different government departments, reviews the military panel's assessment of Guantanamo detainees for errors. It can reject recommendations by majority vote. If a detainee is recommended for release, the board finds a suitable country for transfer based on various factors. The interagency review panel finds a suitable country for transferring detainees recommended for release based on various factors, including the country's stance on terrorism, ability to control detention facilities, prosecute individuals, prevent terrorist activities, and assure humane treatment. The criteria used by the panel is similar to that governing Guantanamo transfer decisions. The interagency review panel assesses countries for transferring detainees based on factors like their ability to control detention facilities, prosecute individuals, prevent terrorist activities, and assure humane treatment. The criteria used is similar to that governing Guantanamo transfer decisions. Rejected recommendations can be reevaluated or forwarded to the Secretary of Defense for approval, with detainees having no right to seek redress in U.S. courts. The White House expressed concerns about Section 1036 of H.R. 1540, which, along with other detainee provisions, could lead to a presidential veto. The periodic review process established by Section 1036 was highlighted as undermining the current system. The White House raised concerns about Section 1036 of H.R. 1540, stating it could lead to a presidential veto due to the undermining of the current periodic review process. Section 1036 of H.R. 1540 undermines the President's periodic review process by imposing a rigid system that limits advice from intelligence and law enforcement professionals, hindering informed decision-making on national security interests. Additionally, Section 1039 restricts the transfer or release of non-citizen detainees held abroad in U.S. military custody. Section 1039 of H.R. 1540 limits the transfer or release of non-citizen detainees held abroad in U.S. military custody, including those at Guantanamo, into the United States. It hinders the Department of Defense's ability to manage detention operations. The use of funds authorized for the military in FY2012 is restricted from transferring or releasing Guantanamo detainees into the United States. This measure also applies to non-citizen detainees held abroad by the Department of Defense. Congress enacted funding measures to limit executive discretion in response to the Obama Administration's plan to close the Guantanamo detention facility. Initially, detainees were barred from being released into the US, but executive discretion to transfer them into the country was preserved. The Obama Administration's plan to close the Guantanamo detention facility faced funding limitations imposed by Congress, prohibiting the transfer of detainees into the United States for any purpose, including criminal prosecution. The 2012 Minibus (P.L. 112-55) funding limitations prohibit transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US for criminal prosecution, making military commissions the primary forum for trials. The 2012 Minibus funding limitations prevent transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US for criminal prosecution, leading to military commissions as the main trial forum. House-passed H.R. 1540 includes broader funding restrictions for FY2012, covering all non-citizen detainees held at Guantanamo. The funding restrictions in Section 1039 of House-passed H.R. 1540, effective until the end of FY2012, apply to a broader category of Guantanamo detainees than the 2012 Minibus restrictions. These restrictions also prevent the transfer or release of non-citizen detainees held by military authorities at foreign locations other than Guantanamo. Section 1039 of House-passed H.R. 1540 imposes restrictions on transferring or releasing non-citizen detainees held by military authorities at foreign locations other than Guantanamo. Unlike the 2012 Minibus restrictions, these limitations apply to all federal agencies, not just the Department of Defense. The House-passed H.R. 1540 imposes restrictions on transferring or releasing wartime detainees into the United States, but not on detainees brought in by other government agencies. These restrictions expire at the end of FY2012, but other provisions in the bill, such as a permanent bar on prosecuting enemy belligerents in Article III courts, may discourage detainee transfers. Section 1039 of House-passed H.R. 1540, set to expire at the end of FY2012, imposes restrictions on transferring wartime detainees into the US. The White House strongly opposes this section, claiming it interferes with executive discretion in prosecuting detainees in Article III courts. Additionally, provisions in H.R. 1540, like a permanent bar on prosecuting enemy belligerents in Article III courts, may deter detainee transfers beyond FY2012. The White House strongly opposes Section 1039 of H.R. 1540, which restricts transferring wartime detainees into the US, beyond FY2012. The Obama Administration argues that this measure interferes with executive discretion in prosecuting detainees in Article III courts, posing a challenge to national security interests. The White House opposes Section 1039 of H.R. 1540, which limits transferring detainees into the US, arguing it hinders executive discretion in prosecuting detainees in Article III courts and poses a challenge to national security interests. The White House opposes Section 1039 of H.R. 1540, which limits transferring detainees into the US, arguing it hinders executive discretion in prosecuting detainees in Article III courts and poses a challenge to national security interests. Section 1037 of H.R. 1540 prohibits the use of funds to construct or modify facilities in the US to house Guantanamo detainees under the control of the Department of Defense, impacting counterterrorism efforts and national security. Similar restrictions are also present in the 2012 Minibus. The 2012 Minibus includes restrictions on using funds for constructing or modifying facilities in the US to house Guantanamo detainees under the Department of Defense's control. Additionally, funds are limited for transferring or releasing detainees to foreign countries unless specific criteria are met, with exceptions for court-ordered transfers. Section 1040 of the 2012 Minibus limits funds for transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries unless specific criteria are met, with exceptions for court-ordered releases. These restrictions are similar to those in the 2011 NDAA and the Department of Defense regulations. The 2012 Minibus (Section 1040) restricts funds for transferring Guantanamo detainees unless specific criteria are met, with exceptions for court-ordered releases. These restrictions mirror those in the 2011 NDAA and aim to prevent detainee recidivism. The 2011 CAA imposed funding restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to prevent recidivism, with supporters citing increased security and critics arguing it hampers detainee transfers. No detainee has been released since these restrictions went into effect. The 2011 CAA imposed funding restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to prevent recidivism. Critics argue that these restrictions hamper detainee transfers, but no detainee has been released since they went into effect. Under Section 1039, the Secretary of Defense must certify to Congress before a transfer can occur. The 2011 CAA imposed funding restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to prevent recidivism. Under Section 1039, the Secretary of Defense must certify to Congress before a transfer can occur, ensuring the destination country meets certain criteria. The Secretary of Defense must certify that the destination country meets specific criteria before transferring Guantanamo detainees, including effective control over detention facilities, no threat to detainee control, steps to prevent future threats, sharing relevant information, and allowing US agencies access. The Secretary of Defense must certify that the destination country meets specific criteria before transferring Guantanamo detainees, including effective control over detention facilities, preventing detainee engagement in terrorism, sharing relevant information with the US, and allowing US agencies access. These requirements align with those considered for continued detention of Guantanamo detainees by the interagency review board. Section 1040 requires the Secretary of Defense to certify that the destination country meets specific criteria before transferring Guantanamo detainees, including allowing US agencies access to the individual. This aligns with requirements for continued detention of detainees by the interagency review board. Section 1040 of the 2011 NDAA and CAA requires the receiving foreign entity to allow U.S. authorities access to transferred individuals. It also prohibits funds from transferring Guantanamo detainees to a foreign government if there is a confirmed case of terrorist activity post-transfer. The White House disapproves of these restrictions. The White House disapproves of restrictions on detainee transfers under Section 1040 of the 2011 NDAA and CAA, claiming they interfere with the executive's ability to make foreign policy and national security determinations. The Administration argues for swift action and flexibility in negotiations with foreign countries. The White House opposes restrictions on detainee transfers in the 2011 NDAA and CAA, stating they hinder the executive's ability to make foreign policy and national security decisions. The Administration emphasizes the need for quick action and negotiation flexibility with foreign countries. Section 1035 of the legislation requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a detailed national security protocol for Guantanamo detainees within 90 days. Section 1035 of the 2011 NDAA and CAA mandates the Secretary of Defense to create a national security protocol for Guantanamo detainees within 90 days, outlining limitations and privileges for detainee communications and legal representation, as well as monitoring procedures for national security protection. The 2011 NDAA and CAA mandates the Secretary of Defense to establish a national security protocol for Guantanamo detainees, including restrictions and privileges for detainee communications and legal representation, as well as monitoring procedures for national security protection. Additionally, Section 1038 prohibits DOD funds in FY2012 from allowing family visits to Guantanamo detainees. Section 1043 prohibits Guantanamo detainees. Section 1038 of the 2011 NDAA prohibits the use of DOD funds in FY2012 for family visits to Guantanamo detainees. Section 1043 restricts the rights and benefits of Guantanamo detainees repatriated to certain countries under the Compact of Free Association. Section 1043 of the 2011 NDAA restricts the rights and benefits of Guantanamo detainees repatriated to the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, or the Republic of the Marshall Islands under the Compact of Free Association. Repatriation refers to returning a person to their home country, so this provision does not apply to former detainees resettled in these countries. Section 1043 of the 2011 NDAA restricts the rights and benefits of Guantanamo detainees repatriated to Micronesia, Palau, or the Marshall Islands under the Compact of Free Association. This provision does not apply to former detainees resettled in these countries. Section 1043 of the 2011 NDAA restricts the rights and benefits of Guantanamo detainees repatriated to Micronesia, Palau, or the Marshall Islands under the Compact of Free Association. This provision does not apply to former detainees resettled in these countries. Section 1042 requires consultation among key officials before prosecuting non-citizens for offenses that could be tried by military commission. Section 1042 of the 2011 NDAA mandates consultation among top officials before prosecuting non-citizens for offenses that could be tried by military commission, determining whether the prosecution should occur in a U.S. district court or before a military commission, and if the individual should be transferred to military custody for intelligence interviews. The White House has expressed opposition to this provision. The consultation required by Section 1042 of the 2011 NDAA involves discussing whether prosecution should take place in a U.S. district court or before a military commission, and if the individual should be transferred to military custody for intelligence interviews. The White House opposes this provision, arguing that existing interagency coordination for terrorism-related prosecutions would be undermined. The House opposes Section 1042 of the 2011 NDAA, arguing that it would disrupt existing interagency coordination in terrorism-related prosecutions. They believe it could cause delays in apprehending individuals posing imminent threats to national safety. Section 1046 mandates that foreign nationals involved in terrorism-related activities must be tried by military commission. Section 1046 of the 2011 NDAA mandates that foreign nationals engaged in terrorism-related conduct must be tried by military commission for offenses related to terrorist attacks against the US or its personnel. The provision aims to swiftly detain individuals posing imminent threats to national safety. The 2011 NDAA mandates that foreign nationals engaged in terrorism-related conduct must be tried by military commission for offenses related to terrorist attacks against the US or its personnel. The provision aims to swiftly detain individuals posing imminent threats to national safety, but lacks clarity on what qualifies as a \"terrorist attack.\" The 2011 NDAA mandates that foreign nationals engaged in terrorism-related conduct must be tried by military commission for offenses related to terrorist attacks against the US or its personnel. It is unclear if the provision applies to prospective attacks that are never carried out, and what constitutes a \"terrorist attack\" is not defined. The case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who attempted to destroy an airliner in 2009, may provide insight into how the provision could be applied to failed attacks. The 2011 NDAA mandates that foreign nationals engaged in terrorism-related conduct must be tried by military commission for offenses related to terrorist attacks against the US or its personnel. The case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian suspect accused of trying to destroy an airliner in 2009, may provide insight into how the provision could be applied to failed attacks. If the \"attack\" takes place in international airspace or the airspace of another country, it would apparently be necessary to demonstrate that U.S. government property or personnel were on board. The 2011 NDAA mandates that foreign nationals engaged in terrorism-related conduct must be tried by military commission for offenses related to terrorist attacks against the US or its personnel. To establish jurisdiction for such cases, it would need to be proven that U.S. government property or personnel were on board during the attack. The use of an explosive device to bring down a civilian aircraft could fall under criminal prohibitions within military commission jurisdiction. The use of an explosive device to bring down a civilian aircraft falls under criminal prohibitions within military commission jurisdiction, requiring a connection to hostilities defined by the laws of war. The military commission jurisdiction requires a connection to hostilities defined by the laws of war, meaning a link to forces opposing the United States in an armed conflict must be established for Section 1042 to apply. It is necessary to prove that the accused is not a U.S. citizen and is an unprivileged enemy belligerent for a military commission to have jurisdiction. In order for a military commission to have jurisdiction over an accused, it must be established that the individual is not a U.S. citizen and is an unprivileged enemy belligerent. This includes individuals who have engaged in hostilities against the United States, supported hostilities, or were part of al Qaeda at the time of the alleged offense. The bill expands the criteria for unprivileged enemy belligerents to include those who have engaged in hostilities against the US or its coalition partners, supported hostilities, or were part of al Qaeda at the time of the alleged offense. The bill does not specify how these criteria will be determined. Military commissions have jurisdiction to make their own determinations. The bill expands criteria for unprivileged enemy belligerents to include those who engaged in hostilities against the US or its coalition partners, supported hostilities, or were part of al Qaeda at the time of the alleged offense. The bill does not specify how these criteria will be determined. Military commissions have jurisdiction to make their own determinations, while an Article III court could also determine qualification for treatment under the provision. The provision applies to all foreign nationals who have engaged in relevant conduct. The bill expands criteria for unprivileged enemy belligerents to include those who engaged in hostilities against the US or its coalition partners, supported hostilities, or were part of al Qaeda at the time of the alleged offense. An Article III court could determine qualification for treatment under the provision, which applies to all foreign nationals who have engaged in relevant conduct. The provision could complicate efforts to extradite terrorism suspects from abroad or try those who have already been extradited. The provision in the bill applies to all foreign nationals who have engaged in relevant conduct, potentially complicating extradition and trial efforts for terrorism suspects. It may only apply to foreign nationals in U.S. custody and does not require government action unless specified in Section 1042. The provision in the bill applies to foreign nationals engaged in relevant conduct, potentially complicating extradition and trial efforts for terrorism suspects. It may only apply to those in U.S. custody and does not require government action unless specified in Section 1042. The bill does not preclude trials in Article III courts or require military commission trials for the individuals it describes. The bill applies to foreign nationals engaged in relevant conduct, potentially complicating extradition and trial efforts for terrorism suspects. It does not preclude trials in Article III courts or require military commission trials for the individuals it describes. The provision may be avoidable by framing the offense under a terrorism-related provision of title 18, U.S. Code. The provision in the bill allows for trials of individuals in military commissions for certain offenses, but it can be avoided by charging the offense under a terrorism-related provision of title 18, U.S. Code. This gives the executive branch officials more discretion over prosecutorial decisions. If a federal criminal offense is charged, the defendant could challenge the jurisdiction of the Article III court. The provision in the bill allows for trials in military commissions, giving executive branch officials more discretion over prosecutorial decisions. If a federal criminal offense is charged, the defendant could challenge the jurisdiction of the Article III court. If trial before a military commission is not possible, a criminal trial may not be possible. The Article III court's jurisdiction may be challenged if there is an impediment to trial before a military commission, such as extradition issues. Section 1032 extends the authority to offer rewards for information or assistance to the U.S. government or allies. Executive branch officials criticize this provision for limiting their discretion in choosing the appropriate trial forum. Section 1032 extends the authority to offer rewards for information or assistance to the U.S. government or allies in connection with military operations against international terrorism. Executive branch officials criticize this provision for limiting their discretion in choosing the appropriate trial forum. The provision extends the authority to offer rewards for assistance in military operations against international terrorism. It also requires quarterly briefings on global counterterrorism operations and expresses congressional support for DOD anti-terrorism efforts. Section 1044 requires quarterly briefings on global Department of Defense counterterrorism operations, including legal issues and limitations. Section 1045 addresses the need for improved interagency strategic planning to deny safe havens to Al Qaeda and affiliated groups. Section 1045 requires the President to issue planning guidance for denying safe havens to Al Qaeda and affiliated groups, identifying geographic areas of concern, setting goals, and outlining agency roles and capabilities. The guidance must be reviewed and updated as needed, with copies submitted to Congress within 15 days. The President is required to issue planning guidance for denying safe havens to Al Qaeda and affiliated groups, outlining agency roles and capabilities. Agencies must enter into a memorandum of understanding and submit copies of the guidance to Congress within 15 days. The Senate bill S. 1867 covers \"Detainee Matters\" in subtitle D of Title X, with provisions similar to S. 1253 but with some language revisions. The Senate bill S. 1867 covers \"Detainee Matters\" in subtitle D of Title X, with provisions similar to S. 1253 but with some language revisions. Agencies involved must enter into a memorandum of understanding and submit copies of the guidance to Congress within 15 days. The bill was passed by the Senate on December 1, 2011, with a single amendment clarifying the legal authority to detain persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda. S. 1867 was passed by the Senate on December 1, 2011, with a single amendment clarifying the legal authority to detain persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The detainee provisions were revised to affirm existing authorities relating to the power to detain individuals in the United States. The Senate later passed H.R. 1540, replacing its original provisions with the language of S. 1867. Section 1031 affirms the AUMF's authority. The conflict with Al Qaeda did not change existing authorities for detaining U.S. citizens or lawful residents. Senate passed H.R. 1540 with provisions from S. 1867. Section 1031 confirms AUMF's authority to detain \"covered persons\" as enemy belligerents. The bill defines \"covered persons\". The AUMF affirms the authority to detain \"covered persons\" as enemy belligerents. The bill defines \"covered persons\" as those involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting al-Qaeda or the Taliban. The bill affirms the authority to detain \"covered persons\" as enemy belligerents, defining them as individuals involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the United States. The bill affirms the authority to detain \"covered persons\" as enemy belligerents, defining them as individuals involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the United States. The earlier version of Section 1031 contained similar language but directly authorized the Armed Forces to detain covered persons captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the AUMF as unprivileged enemy belligerents. The bill affirms the authority to detain \"covered persons\" involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting enemy forces. The language in the earlier version directly authorized the Armed Forces to detain individuals captured in hostilities authorized by the AUMF as unprivileged enemy belligerents. The White House objected to the language \"captured in the course of hostilities\" as it could limit detentions to those captured during military operations. The White House objected to language in the bill regarding detainment of individuals captured in hostilities authorized by the AUMF, as it could limit detentions to those captured during military operations. The bill states that dispositions under the law of war may include detention without trial, trial by military commission, transfer for trial by another court, or transfer to a foreign country or entity. The provision under the law of war allows for various options such as detention without trial, trial by military commission, transfer for trial by another court, or transfer to a foreign country or entity. It is unclear if U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens can be considered \"covered persons\" under Section 1031. Section 1031 does not clarify if U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens can be considered \"covered persons.\" S. 1253 endorsed the detention of such individuals based on conduct within the U.S., while S. 1867 states that it does not limit or expand the President's authority or the scope of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force. S. 1867 clarifies that U.S. citizens and resident aliens can be detained in the U.S. based on conduct within the country, without limiting the President's authority under the Authorization for the Use of Military Force. The revised provision of S. 1867 aims to reinforce the executive branch's view of detention authority for U.S. citizens and resident aliens, without modifying the authority under the AUMF. The potential application of Section 1031 to individuals in the United States remains unsettled. The committee-modified version of S. 1867 aimed to reinforce the executive branch's detention authority without changing the AUMF. There was debate about applying Section 1031 to U.S. citizens, with an amendment rejecting a ban on long-term military detention for citizens based on enemy belligerent status. Ultimately, an amendment was added to clarify that existing law and authority would not be affected. The amendment to Section 1031 clarified that existing law and authority regarding the detention of U.S. citizens and resident aliens would not be affected. The amendment to Section 1031 clarifies that it does not expand or limit the executive's existing authority to detain U.S. citizens, resident aliens, or other persons captured in the United States. Detentions of such individuals have been rare and controversial, with no definitive resolution in the courts. The Supreme Court in Hamdi recognized that individuals captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan could be militarily detained in the conflict with Al Qaeda potentially for an extended period. Detentions of U.S. citizens, resident aliens, and persons captured in the United States have been rare and controversial, with no definitive resolution in the courts. The Supreme Court in Hamdi acknowledged that individuals captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan could be militarily detained in the conflict with Al Qaeda potentially for an extended period. However, the circumstances for preventive military detention of individuals captured in other locations have not been definitively adjudicated. Section 1031 does not clarify the circumstances for holding U.S. citizens, resident aliens, or persons captured within the United States. The circumstances for detaining U.S. citizens, resident aliens, or persons captured in the United States under the AUMF have not been definitively adjudicated. Section 1031 does not clarify this issue. The revised provision in S. 1867 may allow for the detention of U.S. citizens captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda, but lacks clarity on key terms like \"substantial support\" and \"associated forces.\" This could lead to a broadening of the conflict's scope. The revised provision in S. 1867 lacks clarity on terms like \"substantial support\" and \"associated forces,\" potentially broadening the conflict's scope. The language requires the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on how the provision applies to \"covered persons\" under section 1031(b), indicating a need for ongoing clarification on entities considered to be \"associated forces.\" The revised provision in S. 1867 lacks clarity on terms like \"substantial support\" and \"associated forces,\" potentially broadening the conflict's scope. The Secretary of Defense is required to brief Congress on how the provision applies to \"covered persons\" under section 1031(b), indicating a need for ongoing clarification on entities considered to be \"associated forces.\" The Administration has not raised specific objections but cautions against unnecessary codification of existing authorities. The Administration has not raised specific objections to the revised Section 1031 in S. 1867, but cautions against unnecessary codification of existing authorities to avoid unintended consequences that could compromise national security efforts. The current language minimizes risks, but future legislative action must ensure that military detention authority in statute doesn't compromise national security efforts. Section 1032 requires temporary military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces, not all detainees. Section 1032 of the legislation mandates temporary military custody for specific Al Qaeda members and associated forces, excluding U.S. citizens but including U.S. resident aliens captured during hostilities. The legislation mandates temporary military custody for specific Al Qaeda members and associated forces, excluding U.S. citizens but including U.S. resident aliens captured during hostilities. It applies to persons detained as \"covered persons\" under Section 1031, captured during authorized hostilities, and determined to be part of al-Qaeda. The legislation mandates temporary military custody for specific Al Qaeda members and associated forces, excluding U.S. citizens but including U.S. resident aliens captured during hostilities. Covered persons captured in authorized hostilities and determined to be part of al-Qaeda must be detained by military authorities pending disposition. The legislation mandates temporary military custody for specific Al Qaeda members and associated forces, excluding U.S. citizens but including U.S. resident aliens captured during hostilities. Covered persons captured in authorized hostilities and determined to be part of al-Qaeda must be detained by military authorities pending disposition. This includes being held in military detention until hostilities under the AUMF are terminated, being tried before a military commission, or being transferred from military custody. The legislation mandates temporary military custody for specific Al Qaeda members and associated forces, excluding U.S. citizens but including U.S. resident aliens captured during hostilities. Covered persons captured in authorized hostilities and determined to be part of al-Qaeda must be detained by military authorities pending disposition under the law of war.

The legislation mandates temporary military custody for specific Al Qaeda members and associated forces, excluding U.S. citizens but including U.S. resident aliens captured during hostilities. Covered persons captured in authorized hostilities and determined to be part of al-Qaeda must be detained by military authorities pending disposition under the law of war. This can involve being held in military detention until hostilities under the AUMF are terminated, being tried before a military commission, or being transferred from military custody for trial by another court or to a foreign government. Section 1032 of S. 1867 applies to members of \"associated forces\" who \"act in coordination with or pursuant to the direction of al-Qaeda.\" The provision in Section 1032 of S. 1867 specifies that covered forces are those who act in coordination with or pursuant to the direction of al-Qaeda. It does not explicitly mention the Taliban, suggesting that they may not be considered associated with Al Qaeda unless their actions are sufficiently coordinated or directed by Al Qaeda. This raises questions about the detention of members of associated forces who act independently but coordinate some activities with Al Qaeda. The provision in Section 1032 of S. 1867 suggests that associated forces need not be treated as a force associated with Al Qaeda unless their actions are sufficiently coordinated or directed by Al Qaeda. This raises questions about the detention of members of associated forces who act independently but coordinate some activities with Al Qaeda. The provision in Section 1032 of S. 1867 raises questions about the detention of members of associated forces who coordinate some activities with Al Qaeda. The determination of whether an individual should be subject to mandatory detention and restrictions on transfer could be based on the specific attack they are involved in. The provision in Section 1032 of S. 1867 raises questions about the detention of individuals involved in attacks against the United States or coalition partners. It clarifies that officials can be turned over to the Afghan government without certification if no Al Qaeda cooperation is suspected, while a Taliban member engaged in planning an attack with Al Qaeda would face mandatory detention. The law does not apply to \"lone wolf\" terrorists with no ties to Al Qaeda. The definition of an \"attack\" is not clearly defined.

The law does not apply to \"lone wolf\" terrorists with no ties to Al Qaeda. The definition of an \"attack\" is not clearly defined, leaving ambiguity on what conduct constitutes an attack against the United States or coalition partners. The provision in Section 1032 of S. 1867 raises questions about the detention of individuals involved in attacks against the United States or coalition partners. The term \"attack\" is not clearly defined, leading to ambiguity on what conduct constitutes an attack against the United States. The possibility of detaining lawful resident aliens based on conduct in the United States supports a broader interpretation of the term \"attack.\" The application of the law of war to circumstances involving the detention of individuals for attacks against the United States is uncertain. The reference to detaining lawful resident aliens based on conduct in the U.S. supports a broader interpretation of what constitutes an attack. The mandatory detention requirement in S. 1867 is related to hostilities authorized by the AUMF and may not apply to insurgents attacking U.S. or coalition targets in Iraq. The mandatory detention requirement in S. 1867 is related to hostilities authorized by the AUMF. It may not apply to insurgents attacking U.S. or coalition targets in Iraq. S. 1867 includes a new requirement for the President to submit a report to Congress within 60 days of enactment, detailing the procedures for implementing the provision. This submission should include procedures for designating who can determine a covered person and the process for making such determinations. S. 1867 requires the President to submit a report to Congress within 60 days of enactment, outlining procedures for designating covered persons and the determination process. This includes preventing the interruption of surveillance or intelligence gathering and delaying the determination process until after ongoing interrogation sessions. Procedures for preventing interruption of ongoing surveillance or intelligence gathering, delaying determination process until after interrogation session, and waiver authority for transfer of covered individuals. The procedures outlined include preventing interruption of interrogation sessions, delaying determinations until after the session, and providing waiver authority for transferring individuals from third countries. It is unclear how these procedures will interact with those required under Section 1036. The procedures outlined include preventing interruption of interrogation sessions, delaying determinations until after the session, and providing waiver authority for transferring individuals from third countries. It is not clear how these procedures will interact with those required under Section 1036 for status determinations for persons detained under the AUMF. The bill does not preclude the implementation of multiple processes for determining if someone qualifies for mandatory military detention under Section 1031. It also does not prevent the use of different procedures based on whether the person is initially in military or law enforcement custody. The bill allows for multiple processes to determine if someone qualifies for mandatory military detention under Section 1032, potentially based on initial custody. This may implicate constitutional due process requirements. The bill allows for various processes to determine if a person is covered by Section 1032 and the appropriate disposition under the law of war. This could involve constitutional due process requirements and potential habeas corpus challenges. The Obama Administration opposes this provision. The Obama Administration opposes Section 1032, as it could complicate trials and limit counterterrorism tools according to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta opposes the provision in Section 1032, expressing doubts about its advantages for DOD and U.S. national security interests. He believes it would restrict the executive branch's ability to effectively use counterterrorism tools and criticizes its lack of clarity in limiting scope to persons captured abroad. Panetta also finds fault with the qualification to \"associated force,\" which complicates the Department's interpretation and implementation of the restriction. Secretary Panetta and the White House object to Section 1032, citing concerns about its impact on counterterrorism tools and national security. Panetta criticizes the lack of clarity in limiting the provision's scope to persons captured abroad and finds fault with the qualification to \"associated force.\" The White House views the restriction as unnecessary, untested, and legally controversial, limiting the President's authority to defend against threats. The White House strongly objects to Section 1032, calling it an unnecessary restriction on the President's authority to defend against terrorist threats. They view the extension of transfer certification requirements to those covered by Section 1032 as inappropriate. The Administration doubts that revisions to the provision will address the fundamental concerns. The Administration strongly opposes Section 1032, believing it restricts the President's authority to defend against terrorist threats. They doubt that revisions to the provision will address the fundamental concerns. The revised text of Section 1032 aims to address fundamental problems by directing the President to develop procedures to prevent issues that may arise from the requirement of military custody. This approach acknowledges the risks but fails to provide a sufficient solution, potentially causing confusion in counterterrorism operations. Section 1033 is also discussed. Requiring the President to devise procedures to address risks of military custody may lead to confusion in counterterrorism operations. Section 1033 extends restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign entities for the fiscal year. Section 1033 extends restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries for the fiscal year, requiring certification by the Secretary of Defense before any transfer can occur. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 prohibits the expenditure of DOD funds for detainee transfers from Guantanamo to foreign countries without certification from the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Director of National Intelligence. The destination country must not sponsor terrorism, have control over detention facilities, and not face significant threats. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State and Director of National Intelligence, must certify that the destination country is not a state sponsor of terrorism, has control over detention facilities, and has taken measures to prevent the individual from engaging in terrorism. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State and Director of National Intelligence, must certify that the destination country is not a state sponsor of terrorism, has control over detention facilities, and has taken measures to prevent the individual from engaging in terrorism.

The Senate bill requires certification that the destination country is not a state sponsor of terrorism, has control over detention facilities, and has measures in place to prevent terrorism. The individual must agree to share information with the United States and take actions to prevent terrorism. Unlike H.R. 1540, the bill does not require access for U.S. authorities to transferred individuals. The Senate bill does not require the Secretary of Defense to certify that the receiving foreign entity agreed to permit U.S. authorities access to transferred individuals. Certification is not needed for detainees transferred under certain circumstances. Section 1033 prohibits transfers from Guantanamo to any foreign country with a confirmed case of a detainee engaging in terrorist activity after transfer. The Section 1033 of the Senate bill prohibits transfers from Guantanamo to any foreign country or entity if a detainee previously transferred there has engaged in terrorist activity. This prohibition can be waived by the Secretary of Defense with the concurrence of the Secretary of State. The Section 1033 of the Senate bill prohibits transfers from Guantanamo to any foreign country or entity if a detainee previously transferred there has engaged in terrorist activity. The prohibition can be waived by the Secretary of Defense with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, except in cases of detainees being transferred pursuant to a pretrial agreement or court order. The certification requirement and recidivism bar may also be waived if alternative actions are taken to address the risks. The Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, may waive the prohibition on transfers from Guantanamo to any foreign country if alternative actions are taken to address the risks. This includes mitigating the risk of recidivism, with any transfer pursuant to a waiver determined to be in the national security interests of the United States. The Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, may issue a waiver for transfers from Guantanamo if alternative actions will mitigate the risk of recidivism. The transfer must be in the national security interests of the United States, with notification to congressional defense committees 30 days prior. The Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, may issue a waiver for transfers from Guantanamo if alternative actions will mitigate the risk of recidivism. The transfer must be in the national security interests of the United States, with notification to congressional defense committees 30 days prior. Copies of the determination and waiver must be submitted to the congressional defense committees along with a statement of the basis for the transfer serving national security interests, an explanation for not certifying all risks eliminated, and a summary of alternative actions contemplated. Transfer restrictions generally apply to any individual detained at Guantanamo except U.S. citizens, servicemembers, or detainees transferred under specific circumstances. The Senate bill's transfer restrictions, similar to the House-passed version of the 2012 NDAA, apply to individuals detained at Guantanamo, excluding U.S. citizens or servicemembers. This could potentially include foreign refugees intercepted at sea en route to the U.S. The interpretation of Section 1033's scope for such persons is still uncertain. The requirements of the section also extend to those subject to mandatory actions. The scope of Section 1033 in the Senate bill remains uncertain, particularly regarding foreign refugees intercepted at sea en route to the U.S. The White House and Department of Defense disapprove of transfer restriction provisions in the 2012 NDAA. The White House and Department of Defense disapprove of transfer restriction provisions in the 2012 NDAA, including Section 1034 which prohibits the use of DOD funds to construct or modify facilities in the US or its territories for Guantanamo Bay detainees. The Department of Defense disapproves of the Senate provision in Section 1034 of the 2012 NDAA, which prohibits the use of DOD funds to construct or modify facilities in the US for Guantanamo Bay detainees unless authorized by Congress. This provision is similar to previous restrictions in the 2011 NDAA and CAA, as well as in the 2012 Minibus and H.R. 1540. The 2012 NDAA includes restrictions on the use of DOD funds for Guantanamo Bay detainees, similar to previous legislation. The White House objects to these restrictions. Section 1034 in H.R. 1540 and S. 1253 imposes restrictions on Guantanamo Bay detainees for the 2012 fiscal year. The White House opposes these restrictions. Unlike previous legislation, the Senate bill allows transfer of detainees to civilian law enforcement for criminal prosecution and does not prohibit their transfer or release into the United States. The Senate bill on defense authorization does not include a provision prohibiting the transfer or release of Guantanamo detainees into the United States. It allows for the transfer of detainees to civilian law enforcement for criminal prosecution and does not prevent the release of cleared detainees into the US. The only restriction in the bill is on transfers for continued military detention. The Senate bill on defense authorization does not prohibit transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US, except for continued military detention. Section 1035 clarifies aspects of Executive Order 13567 on detention reviews at Guantanamo. Section 1035 of the Senate bill clarifies procedures for detention reviews at Guantanamo under Executive Order 13567, without seeking to replace the periodic review process. The Secretary of Defense is required to submit a report to congressional committees within 180 days, outlining the procedures for review panels. The purpose of the periodic review is not to assess the legality of detainees' detention. Section 1035 mandates the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to congressional committees within 180 days, detailing procedures for review panels under Executive Order 13567. The review process is focused on determining if a detainee poses a continuing threat to U.S. security, with the Secretary having the final decision on detainee release or transfer. The periodic review process focuses on assessing if a detainee remains a threat to U.S. security. The Secretary of Defense has the final say on releasing or transferring detainees, considering factors like the likelihood of resuming terrorist activities or receiving support for rehabilitation. The Administration objects to a provision that shifts responsibility for detainee review from a collaborative process to the Defense Department. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress within 90 days as required by Section 1036. The Administration objects to a provision that shifts responsibility for detainee review to the Defense Department.

Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to congressional defense and intelligence committees explaining the procedures for determining the status of persons detained under the AUMF for purposes of Section 1031. It is unclear whether this determination refers to identifying a \"covered person\" under Section 1031 or the disposition of such individuals under the law of war. In cases of long-term detention of unprivileged enemy belligents, procedures must include a military judge presiding over proceedings. The provision in question addresses the determination of status for unprivileged enemy belligerents in long-term detention. It mandates that a military judge preside over proceedings and allows the belligerent to be represented by military counsel. The requirements apply regardless of the detainee's location. The provision mandates a military judge to preside over proceedings for determining the status of an unprivileged enemy belligerent, who may be represented by military counsel. This applies regardless of the detainee's location and grants detainees in Afghanistan greater privileges during status determination hearings. The provision mandates a military judge to preside over proceedings for determining the status of an unprivileged enemy belligerent, granting detainees in Afghanistan greater privileges during status determination hearings. It is unclear how this provision would affect detainees currently held at Guantanamo. The provision in Section 1036 may impact detainees at Guantanamo, especially regarding their status determination and habeas challenges. The implications of this provision on Guantanamo detainees remain uncertain and could potentially lead to new status determinations under Section 1036. Section 1036 may impact Guantanamo detainees' habeas challenges and status determinations, potentially leading to new determinations under the provision. The implications for detainees held at Guantanamo remain uncertain, depending on how the provision is interpreted. The provision under Section 1036 may apply to detainees in U.S. custody designated for long-term detention under the AUMF or those subject to detention after the Senate bill's enactment. It does not clarify how new captures will be determined for long-term detention before a status hearing. \"Long-term detention\" could refer to holding enemy belligerents for the duration of hostilities to prevent their return to combat. The provision under Section 1036 may apply to detainees designated for long-term detention under the AUMF or after the Senate bill's enactment. It is unclear how new captures will be determined for long-term detention before a status hearing. \"Long-term detention\" could mean holding enemy belligerents for the duration of hostilities to prevent their return to combat. The bill allows for the long-term detention of captured enemy belligerents to prevent their return to combat. This may involve disposition decisions before status determinations, potentially requiring multiple status assessments. Detainees designated for trial or transfer would not have military representation or judges at their status hearings. The bill allows for long-term detention of captured enemy belligerents to prevent their return to combat. Those destined for trial or transfer may not have military representation or judges at their status hearings. Multiple status assessments may be needed for disposition decisions. The bill allows for long-term detention of captured enemy belligerents without military representation or judges at status hearings. Multiple status assessments may be required for disposition decisions, including transfer or prosecution.

Detainees not designated for long-term detention may have their status determined through existing administrative review processes. The status review process under Section 1036 may only apply to detainees designated for long-term detention, excluding those not designated for it. The White House disapproves, citing conflicts with established military review procedures.
