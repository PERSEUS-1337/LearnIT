    "content": "A biologic or biological product is a therapeutic drug or vaccine made from living organisms like human, animal, yeast, or microorganisms. They consist of proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, or cells used in transplantation. Biosimilars are similar but not identical to brand-name biologics. A biosimilar, also known as a follow-on biologic, is a therapeutic drug similar but not identical to the brand-name biologic. Unlike most drugs synthesized chemically, biologics are made from living organisms and their molecular structure is more complex. Most drugs are synthesized chemically, unlike biologics which are made from living organisms. Generic drugs are chemically identical to brand-name drugs, with a simpler molecular structure. For example, aspirin has a small molecular structure compared to biologics like Remicade. Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade, was FDA approved in April 2016. The FDA regulates both biologics and chemical drugs. The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) within FDA regulates traditional biologics, vaccines, blood products, and gene therapy products. The FDA regulates biologics and chemical drugs. The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) oversees traditional biologics, gene therapy products, and human tissue used in transplantation. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) regulates prescription and over-the-counter drugs. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) regulates prescription brand-name and generic drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and most therapeutic biologics, including monoclonal antibodies that bind to specific substances in the body. In 2003, the responsibility for regulating therapeutic biologics was transferred from CBER to CDER. CDER regulates monoclonal antibodies like infliximab for various diseases and cytokines such as interleukins and interferons to fight cancer and infections. Monoclonal antibodies like infliximab are used to treat diseases such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Cytokines, including interleukins and interferons, are proteins that control the immune system and fight cancer and infections. Growth factors like somatropin regulate cell division, while enzymes speed up chemical reactions in the body, playing a role in cell functions and cancer treatment. In cancer treatment, growth factors like somatropin, enzymes, and immunomodulators such as vaccines are used to regulate cell division, speed up chemical reactions, and stimulate the immune system to fight cancer cells. Biologics and biosimilars require special handling to avoid contamination. Enzyme inhibitors block enzymes needed for cancer cell growth. Immunomodulators like vaccines stimulate the immune system to fight cancer. Biologics and biosimilars require special handling to avoid contamination and are often administered via injection or infusion. Specialty drugs refer to biologics that require specialized facilities for dispensing. Biologics, also known as specialty drugs, require special handling to avoid contamination and are often administered via injection or infusion. They can be expensive, with some biologic medications costing over $250,000 per patient annually. The cost of specialty drugs, including biologics, can be extremely high, with some medications exceeding $250,000 per patient annually. Spending on biologics in the United States reached $105.5 billion in 2016, showing a 13% increase from the previous year. Spending on biologics in the United States totaled $105.5 billion in 2016, a 13% increase over 2015. Biologics spending has increased by 10% each year since 2011, with $2.9 billion spent on \"original\" biologics and $0.3 billion on biosimilars. Increases in spending in the Medicare Part B program have been driven by biologics, growing by 13.3% between 2006 and 2014. In 2016, biologics spending in the US reached $105.5 billion, a 13% increase from the previous year. Biologics accounted for 63% of prescription drug spending in Medicare Part B in 2014, with annual growth of 13.3% between 2006 and 2014. Biologic drugs are more expensive in the US compared to Europe and Canada. In 2014, biologics accounted for 63% of prescription drug spending in Part B, with annual growth of 13.3% between 2006 and 2014. Biologic drugs are often more expensive in the United States compared to Europe and Canada, where the introduction of biosimilars has significantly reduced prices. Congress has made efforts to lower the price of chemical drugs through legislation like the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act. The introduction of biosimilars has reduced prices for biologics, with price reductions of up to 61% in Portugal. Congress passed the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman Act) to allow FDA approval of generic chemical drugs, providing lower-cost alternatives. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 allowed FDA approval of generic chemical drugs, leading to lower-cost alternatives for consumers and the expansion of the U.S. generic drug industry. Generic medications can decrease prices by 60% to 90% compared to branded oral-solid medications, as they avoid the expense of clinical trials and initial drug research. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 has lowered drug costs for consumers and expanded the U.S. generic drug industry by allowing FDA approval of generic chemical drugs. Generic medications can reduce prices by 60% to 90% compared to branded oral-solid medications, as they avoid the costs of clinical trials and initial drug research. Generic drug companies must demonstrate to the FDA that their product is identical to the original before marketing approval. This \"sameness\" allows them to reference the FDA's previous safety and effectiveness findings. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 has reduced drug costs by allowing FDA approval of generic chemical drugs. Generic drug companies must demonstrate their product's sameness to the original before marketing approval, relying on the FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness. Interchangeability with brand-name and other generic products using the same reference drug is required, along with meeting manufacturing standards and reporting requirements. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 reduced drug costs by allowing FDA approval of generic chemical drugs, which must demonstrate their sameness to the original. Generic drugs are considered interchangeable with brand-name and other generics using the same reference drug. The biotechnology industry developed its first biologics for human therapeutic use during this time, with the FDA approving human insulin (Humulin-R) in 1982, human growth hormone (Protropin) in 1985, and alpha interferon (Intron-A) in 1986. In 1982, FDA approved the first human drug developed by the biotechnology industry, human insulin (Humulin-R), followed by human growth hormone (Protropin) in 1985, alpha interferon (Intron-A) in 1986, tissue plasminogen activator (Activase) in 1987, and erythropoietin (Epogen) in 1989. Biological products are regulated by FDA through a biologics license application (BLA) under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). In 1982, FDA approved the first human drug developed by the biotechnology industry, human insulin (Humulin-R), followed by human growth hormone (Protropin) in 1985, alpha interferon (Intron-A) in 1986, tissue plasminogen activator (Activase) in 1987, and erythropoietin (Epogen) in 1989. Biological products are regulated by FDA through a biologics license application (BLA) under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Regulatory responsibility for biological products was transferred to FDA in 1972. Chemical prescription drugs are regulated by FDA through a new drug application (NDA) or abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The Hatch-Waxman Act provided a mechanism for approval. After the transfer of regulatory responsibility to the FDA in 1972, all chemical prescription drugs are regulated and approved for marketing via a new drug application (NDA) or abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The Hatch-Waxman Act allowed for the approval of generic drugs but did not include a mechanism for follow-on biologics/biosimilars under the PHSA. Companies could only submit follow-on biologics applications for FDA review for a small number of \"natural source\" biologics approved under the Act. After the transfer of regulatory responsibility to the FDA in 1972, all chemical prescription drugs are regulated and approved for marketing via a new drug application (NDA) or abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The Hatch-Waxman Act allowed for the approval of generic drugs but did not include a mechanism for follow-on biologics/biosimilars under the PHSA. Companies were effectively blocked from submitting follow-on applications for the much larger group of therapeutic biologics that had been licensed under the PHSA. In 1941, Congress gave the FDA authority over the marketing of insulin, a small protein regulating sugar metabolism. Despite being similar to other biologics, insulin was regulated as a drug by the FDA. In 1941, Congress granted the FDA authority over insulin marketing, a small protein regulating sugar metabolism. Insulin, along with a few other natural source biological products, was regulated as drugs under the FFDCA rather than as biologics under the PHSA. In 1941, insulin and other natural source biological products were regulated as drugs under the FFDCA. Certain hormones and medical enzymes were also regulated as drugs rather than biologics under the PHSA. FDA lacked clear regulatory authority to approve biosimilars for specialty biologic drug products. The FDA lacked clear regulatory authority to approve biosimilars for specialty biologic drug products, leading to market competition challenges as patent protection approached expiration. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association advocated for FDA to establish a regulatory system for biosimilars, while the Biotechnology Industry Organization filed a citizen petition requesting actions from the FDA. The FDA lacked clear regulatory authority for biosimilars, leading to market competition challenges. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association advocated for FDA to establish a regulatory system, while the Biotechnology Industry Organization filed a petition with the FDA. In contrast, Europe had fewer barriers for marketing biosimilars, with the European Medicines Agency authorizing the first biosimilar product in 2006. The FDA faced challenges in approving biosimilars, while Europe had fewer barriers. The European Medicines Agency authorized the first biosimilar product in 2006, followed by several others. In the US, FDA approval of Omnitrope was granted in June 2006 after a court ruling in favor of the sponsor, Sandoz. In the US, FDA approved Omnitrope in June 2006 after a court ruling in favor of Sandoz, the sponsor. Sandoz alleged FDA violated its obligation to act on the Omnitrope application within 180 days. The court ruled in favor of Sandoz, stating that the FDA must consider the application for Omnitrope, which was deemed \"indistinguishable\" from Pfizer's Genotropin. The 505(b)(2) pathway, created by the Hatch-Waxman Act, was used for Omnitrope's approval in 2006. The FDA indicated that the approval of Omnitrope in 2006 did not establish a pathway for approval of other follow-on biologic drugs. Congress later established a new regulatory authority for FDA in March 2010 by creating an abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products that are \"highly similar.\" In March 2010, Congress established a new regulatory authority for FDA by creating an abbreviated licensure pathway for biologic products that are \"highly similar\" or \"interchangeable\" with an FDA-licensed biological product. This was accomplished through the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009, enacted as Title VII of the Affordable Care Act. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009 established an abbreviated pathway for FDA to approve biologic products that are \"highly similar\" or \"interchangeable\" with an FDA-licensed biological product. This authority allows FDA to collect user fees from industry. The terms biosimilar and interchangeable are defined under the BPCIA, with a sponsor able to seek approval for a \"biosimilar\" product if it is shown to be highly similar to the reference product. Under the BPCIA, FDA can collect user fees from industry. The terms biosimilar and interchangeable are defined, with a sponsor able to seek approval for a \"biosimilar\" product if it is highly similar to the reference product. To meet the higher standard of interchangeability, the biosimilar product must demonstrate the same clinical outcomes. The biosimilar product must demonstrate the same clinical outcomes as the reference product to be considered interchangeable. This includes ensuring that the risk of alternating or switching between the biosimilar and reference product is not greater than staying on the reference product. The FDA held a public meeting in 2010 to gather input on the new biosimilars pathway for interchangeable products. The FDA held a public meeting in 2010 to gather input on the new biosimilars pathway for interchangeable products. Subsequently, the agency released draft guidance documents in 2012 and finalized them in 2015, along with additional guidance on related topics. The FDA released draft guidance documents in 2012 based on public input, finalized them in 2015, and has provided additional guidance on biosimilars. Companies must submit an application demonstrating biosimilarity for marketing in the US. The FDA requires companies to submit an application demonstrating biosimilarity for marketing in the US, including data from analytical, animal, and clinical studies. The agency may determine if certain studies are unnecessary in the application process. The FDA requires data from analytical, animal, and clinical studies for biosimilar applications. Changes to the manufacturing process must demonstrate comparability to maintain product quality. For example, Remicade underwent 37 changes. The FDA requires demonstrations of comparability for changes in the manufacturing process to ensure product quality and safety. For instance, Remicade underwent 37 manufacturing changes between 1998 and October 2014, each requiring a demonstration of comparability through various assays. The FDA requires demonstrations of comparability for changes in the manufacturing process to ensure product quality and safety. Remicade (infliximab) underwent 37 manufacturing changes between 1998 and October 2014, each requiring a demonstration of comparability through various assays. FDA approved seven biosimilars for marketing in the United States, but sales of five biosimilars have been delayed or impacted by actions of brand-name manufacturers. The FDA approved seven biosimilars for marketing in the United States, but sales of five biosimilars have been delayed or impacted by actions of brand-name manufacturers. The marketing launch of three U.S. biosimilars is being delayed by patent infringement lawsuits filed by brand-name manufacturers. Pfizer, with FDA approval to market biosimilar Inflectra, has sued Johnson & Johnson for allegedly using \"exclusionary contracts\" and other tactics. The marketing launch of three U.S. biosimilars is being delayed by patent infringement lawsuits filed by brand-name manufacturers. Pfizer has sued Johnson & Johnson for allegedly using anticompetitive tactics to prevent insurers from covering biosimilar Inflectra. Such practices could negatively impact the sales of another recently approved biosimilar, Renflexis. The high costs of pharmaceuticals, particularly biologics, have led to increased interest in understanding the federal government's role in developing costly new therapeutics. Anticompetitive tactics, like exclusionary contracts, are being used to prevent insurers from covering biosimilars like Inflectra and Renflexis, impacting sales. Six of the seven biosimilars approved by the FDA between March 2015 and October 2017 were originally discovered by public-sector scientists. In March 2015, FDA approved Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz), the first biosimilar product. Several brand-name biologics like Remicade, Enbrel, Humira, and Avastin, discovered by public-sector scientists, are top-selling drugs worldwide and in the United States. In March 2015, FDA approved Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz), the first biosimilar product marketed by Sandoz Inc. It is biosimilar to Neupogen (filgrastim) discovered by scientists at Sloan Kettering and marketed by Amgen Inc. The first biosimilar product approved in the US is Zarxio, marketed by Sandoz Inc., and is biosimilar to Neupogen by Amgen Inc. Neupogen was discovered by scientists at Sloan Kettering, and Zarxio has the same indications. In April 2016, FDA approved Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade by Janssen Biotech, originally discovered by scientists at New York University. In April 2016, FDA approved a second biosimilar, Inflectra (infliximab-dyyb), which is biosimilar to Remicade (infliximab) by Janssen Biotech. Pfizer markets Inflectra in the US at a price 15% below the original drug. In 2016, FDA approved Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade, marketed by Pfizer at a 15% lower price. Pfizer later filed a lawsuit against J&J for anticompetitive practices related to Remicade's sales. In September 2017, Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J for anticompetitive practices related to Remicade sales, alleging exclusionary contracts with health insurers. Pfizer claimed J&J threatened to withhold rebates unless insurers agreed to biosimilar-exclusion contracts, blocking coverage for Inflectra and other biosimilars. FDA approved another infliximab biosimilar, Renflexis, in April 2017. J&J allegedly threatened insurers with rebate cuts to block coverage for biosimilars like Inflectra. This tactic aims to maintain market dominance for their brand-name drug, Remicade, over Pfizer's biosimilar. The strategy was detailed in a June 2017 JAMA article. The rebate is a powerful financial incentive for insurers to prefer the higher-priced brand-name biologic over the biosimilar. The brand-name manufacturer can withdraw the rebate on the branded biologic to counter a biosimilar manufacturer's price discount, creating a \"rebate trap.\" In response to a biosimilar manufacturer offering a price discount, the branded manufacturer can create a \"rebate trap\" by withdrawing the rebate on the branded biologic. This trap doubles the payer's cost for patients continuing the branded biologic, even if the biosimilar is 60% cheaper. If only 50% of patients switch to the biosimilar, the rebate trap ensures the payer's costs remain high. The rebate trap doubles payer costs for patients continuing the branded biologic, even if the biosimilar is 60% cheaper. To avoid this trap, a near-complete switch of patient users from the branded biologic to the biosimilar is necessary. The rebate trap increases payer costs for patients continuing the branded biologic, even with a cheaper biosimilar available. To avoid this, a near-complete switch to biosimilars is needed, but many chronic disease patients are unlikely to switch. Pfizer's lawsuit claims providers have declined to purchase Inflectra. According to Pfizer's lawsuit, providers have declined to purchase Inflectra, with only 4% market share among health care providers using infliximab. Pfizer's lawsuit states that health care providers have largely not purchased Inflectra, with minimal coverage from national commercial health insurers. J&J's Remicade price increases and reimbursement changes are highlighted as anticompetitive practices. Pfizer's lawsuit accuses J&J of anticompetitive practices with Remicade, stating that Inflectra has only secured less than 4% of total infliximab unit sales in the US. J&J raised Remicade's list price by close to 9% and increased government reimbursement by over $190 per dose since Inflectra's FDA approval in April 2016. J&J's president of Janssen Biotech, Scott White, responded to the lawsuit. The lawsuit accuses J&J of anticompetitive practices with Remicade, claiming Inflectra has only secured less than 4% of total infliximab unit sales in the US. J&J's president, Scott White, stated that competition is bringing down the overall cost of Remicade and will continue to do so in the future. FDA approved a third biosimilar, Erelzi, in August 2016. The Pfizer lawsuit claims lack of value in Remicade competition, with FDA approving biosimilar Erelzi in August 2016. FDA approved a third biosimilar, Erelzi (etanercept-szzs), manufactured by Sandoz, which is biosimilar to the brand-name drug Enbrel (etanercept) by Amgen. Enbrel is a top-selling drug in the world and the US, with Erelzi approved for all Enbrel indications. The approval was based on comprehensive data. Erelzi (etanercept-szzs) by Sandoz, a biosimilar to Enbrel (etanercept) by Amgen, was FDA approved. Erelzi is approved for all Enbrel indications based on comprehensive data including clinical studies. Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, has been approved by the FDA based on data confirming its similarity to the reference product. Clinical studies included PK studies in healthy volunteers and a safety study in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. The marketing release date is pending due to a lawsuit filed by Amgen against Sandoz and Novartis. The FDA approved Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, based on its similarity to the reference product. A marketing release date is pending due to a lawsuit filed by Amgen against Sandoz and Novartis. Amjevita, another biosimilar, was approved by the FDA in September 2016. In September 2016, FDA approved Amjevita (adalimumab-atto), a biosimilar to Humira (adalimumab) manufactured by Amgen. Amjevita was approved for 7 indications, while Humira is approved for 10 indications. Humira is a top-selling drug globally and in the United States. In 2002, Abbott Laboratories was licensed by FDA to market Humira. Amjevita, a biosimilar to Humira, was approved for 7 indications, while Humira is approved for 10 indications. Humira is a top-selling drug globally and in the United States. Amjevita's commercial availability is delayed due to patent infringement litigation. FDA approved Renflexis, a biosimilar to Remicade, in April 2017. Amjevita's commercial availability is delayed due to patent infringement litigation. FDA approved Renflexis, a biosimilar to Remicade, in April 2017, made by Samsung Bioepsis. In 1998, FDA licensed infliximab to Centocor Inc., now Janssen Biotech Inc., making Remicade one of the top-selling drugs globally. Samsung partnered with Merck to launch Renflexis in the US at a lower price than Remicade. FDA also approved Cyltezo, a biosimilar to adalimumab-adbm, manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim in August 2017. In August 2017, FDA approved Cyltezo, a biosimilar to Humira (adalimumab), manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim, following the launch of Renflexis in the US at a lower price than Remicade. Boehringer Ingelheim's Cyltezo is a biosimilar to Humira (adalimumab) by AbbVie, a top-selling drug in the US. AbbVie filed a lawsuit against BI for patent infringement, delaying Cyltezo's launch date. FDA approved Mvasi (bevacizumab-awwb) by Amgen, a biosimilar to Avastin (bevacizumab) by Genentech. AbbVie filed a lawsuit against Boehringer Ingelheim for patent infringement on Humira, delaying the launch of Cyltezo. FDA approved Mvasi by Amgen, a biosimilar to Avastin by Genentech, a top-selling drug in the US. Genentech received FDA approval to market Avastin (bevacizumab) in 2004, a top-selling drug in the US. The proprietary name of a drug product is the trademarked name used for marketing, usually capitalized with a superscript R in a circle (\u00ae). The Purple Book lists biological products licensed by FDA under the PHS Act. The Purple Book lists biological products, including biosimilar and interchangeable products, licensed by FDA under the PHS Act, along with the date of licensure. Appendix D provides examples of proprietary and nonproprietary names for CDER and CBER licensed biological products. The nonproprietary name is used in drug labeling, regulation, and scientific literature to identify the active substance. The FDA released guidance on the nonproprietary naming of biological products in August 2015, finalized on January 12, 2017. This guidance provides the FDA's rationale for naming conventions for biosimilars. The FDA released guidance on nonproprietary naming of biological products in August 2015, finalized on January 12, 2017. The guidance provides FDA's rationale for naming conventions for biosimilars, using the term \"proper name\" instead of \"nonproprietary name\" in accordance with the PHSA. The FDA guidance on nonproprietary naming of biological products uses the term \"proper name\" instead of \"nonproprietary name\" in accordance with the PHSA. The nonproprietary name for each biological product will be a combination of a core name and a distinguishing suffix composed of four lowercase letters. The FDA is still considering the appropriate suffix format for interchangeable products. The FDA guidance on nonproprietary naming of biological products uses a core name combined with a four-letter suffix for unique identification. The core name, like filgrastim, is combined with a suffix, such as filgrastim-xzwy. The FDA is still deciding on the appropriate suffix format for interchangeable products. For reference biological products, the FDA will use the core name adopted by the USAN Council, ensuring safety and consistency in naming. The FDA uses a core name combined with a four-letter suffix for unique identification of biological products. The core name is adopted by the USAN Council for reference products. In Europe, reference drugs and biosimilars use the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) system. The WHO selects INNs based on expert advice, and in 2016, proposed the Biological Qualifier (BQ) for biosimilar naming. The WHO uses the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) system for reference drugs and biosimilars in Europe. In 2016, the WHO introduced the Biological Qualifier (BQ) proposal for biosimilar naming, which consists of a code with four random consonants in two 2-letter blocks separated by a 2-digit checksum. The Biological Qualifier (BQ) is used in conjunction with the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) to uniquely identify biological substances for prescription and dispensing of medicines. Biosimilar industry groups support shared nonproprietary names, while innovator companies prefer distinguishing between reference biologic products and biosimilars. The Federal Trade Commission expressed concerns about the FDA's naming proposal in October 2015. The Federal Trade Commission expressed concerns about the FDA's naming proposal in October 2015, stating that it could lead to physicians incorrectly believing that biosimilars differ significantly from reference biologics, potentially deterring them from prescribing biosimilars and hindering market competition. The FDA's naming proposal has raised concerns that physicians may incorrectly perceive biosimilars as different from reference biologics, potentially discouraging their prescription and hindering market competition. The FTC explains that historically, all originator biologics meeting the same identification tests received the same nonproprietary name, like somatropin for human growth hormone products from different manufacturers. The FTC comment further explains that historically, all originator biologics meeting the same identification tests received the same nonproprietary name, such as somatropin for human growth hormone products from different manufacturers. The addition of unique differentiating suffixes in nonproprietary names may lead physicians to mistakenly believe there are pharmacological and chemical differences between products. The FDA's proposal for biosimilars aims to use the same USAN as the core name for each biosimilar and its reference biologic, but the addition of unique suffixes may lead to misconceptions about clinical differences. Differences in nonproprietary names could contribute to misunderstandings about the similarity of biosimilars to their reference biologics. Participants at an FTC workshop on biosimilars argue that the term \"identical\" is misused to create fear and confusion among physicians. Biosimilars are not required to be identical to their reference biologics, as variability is inherent in biologics. The term \"identical\" is misused to create fear and confusion among physicians regarding biosimilars. Variability is inherent in biologics, even between different batches of the same product. FDA issued a final rule in 2006 on the content and format of labeling for prescription drug products, including biological products. The FDA issued a final rule in 2006 on the content and format of labeling for prescription drug products, including biological products. The labeling conveys information about the product's safety and effectiveness to healthcare providers, based on FDA's analysis of the new drug application or biologics license application. The FDA issued a final rule in 2006 on the content and format of labeling for prescription drug products and biological products. The FDA-approved labeling contains information necessary for safe and effective use, written for healthcare practitioners. The FDA-approved labeling for prescription drug products and biological products, submitted through NDA or BLA, is essential for safe and effective use by healthcare practitioners. It includes warnings, indications, dosage, contraindications, precautions, adverse reactions, drug interactions, use in specific populations, drug abuse, dependence, and overdosage. FDA requires labeling to start with a highlights section containing warnings about the drug, including indications, dosage, contraindications, warnings, adverse reactions, drug interactions, and other essential information. FDA also issued guidance on biosimilar labeling, recommending a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in the highlights section. FDA recommends including a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in the highlights section of biosimilar product labeling to describe its relationship to the reference product. The biosimilar product may not have the same labeling as the reference product, and comparative data demonstrating biosimilarity should not be included to avoid confusion. The biosimilar product is not required by FDA to have the same labeling as the reference product, including the number of approved indications for use. FDA recommends not including comparative data in biosimilar product labeling to prevent confusion, but this data is available on the FDA website. Comments on FDA labeling guidance show differing views between the generic and brand-name industries. The FDA recommends avoiding comparative data in biosimilar labeling to prevent confusion, but this information is available on their website. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association believes the Biosimilarity Statement is unnecessary and confusing, while BIO advocates for more information in labeling. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA, now called the Association for Accessible Medicines) believes the Biosimilarity Statement is unnecessary and confusing, while BIO advocates for more information in labeling to provide transparency for prescribers. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA, now called the Association for Accessible Medicines) believes the Biosimilarity Statement is unnecessary and confusing, while BIO advocates for more information in labeling to provide transparency for prescribers. BIO, among other companies, stated that more information is preferable to less with regard to labeling, emphasizing the need for transparency in labeling to allow prescribers to identify study details for biosimilar products transitioning to biological licenses under the BPCIA in March 2020. Under the BPCIA, biological products like hormone insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, infertility treatments, menopause and osteoporosis hormones, and certain enzymes will transition to biological licenses in March 2020. FDA released draft guidance on this provision in March 2016, requiring identification of studies conducted with biosimilar or reference products. The FDA released draft guidance in March 2016 regarding the transition of biological products like hormone insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, infertility treatments, menopause and osteoporosis hormones, and certain enzymes to biological licenses by March 2020. The guidance outlines that a marketing application for a biological product must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, with an exception allowing submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act until March 23, 2020. The BPCI Act states that a marketing application for a biological product must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, with an exception allowing submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act until March 23, 2020, if certain conditions are met. The BPCI Act requires biological products to be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, with an exception for submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act until March 23, 2020, if specific conditions are met. An approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act is considered a license for a biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act as of March 23, 2020. The FDA will no longer approve applications for biological products under the FD&C Act after March 23, 2020. Existing applications should be withdrawn. The FDA will no longer approve applications for biological products under the FD&C Act after March 23, 2020. Existing applications should be withdrawn and resubmitted under the PHSA to avoid delays in approval and availability of competing biologics. The FDA will no longer approve applications for biological products under the FD&C Act after March 23, 2020. Industry representatives are concerned that the FDA's proposed policy will delay the approval of competing biologics. Any unexpired period of exclusivity associated with an approved NDA for a biological product subject to the BPCI Act would cease to have any effect. Under the FDA's interpretation, exclusivity for biologics under the BPCI Act will no longer have effect after March 23, 2020. Orphan drug exclusivity will still apply for protected use. The FDA's interpretation states that exclusivity for biologics under the BPCI Act will end after March 23, 2020. Orphan drug exclusivity will continue for the protected use, and industry groups have raised concerns about the FDA's policy on exclusivity. Transitional biological products will not be eligible for the 12-year biologics exclusivity period. The FDA's policy on exclusivity for biologics under the BPCI Act will end after March 23, 2020. Industry groups, such as the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, have raised concerns about this policy. Transitional biological products will not be eligible for the 12-year biologics exclusivity period as they were not first licensed under the PHSA. FDA clarifies that biological products approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act will not be granted exclusivity that would impede biosimilar or interchangeable product competition until 2032. The BPCI Act does not grant exclusivity to biological products approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, which would impede biosimilar or interchangeable product competition until 2032. An interchangeable product is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any patient. An interchangeable product in the year 2032 is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any patient. It can be substituted by a pharmacist without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider. After the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act, pharmacists were able to substitute generic drugs for brand-name drugs without the need for a healthcare provider's intervention. However, assessing interchangeability for biosimilars, which are not structurally identical to their brand-name counterparts, is a separate process. In January 2017, the FDA addressed this issue. The FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability for biosimilars in January 2017, with the comment period extended to May 19, 2017. FDA has not yet approved an interchangeable product, while in Europe, the EMA evaluates biosimilar medicines for authorization but does not make a determination on interchangeability. In January 2017, FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability for biosimilars, with the comment period extended to May 19, 2017. FDA has not approved an interchangeable product yet. In Europe, the EMA evaluates biosimilar medicines for authorization but does not determine interchangeability. Individual member states decide their own policy on interchangeability. The Agency's evaluations do not include recommendations on interchangeability of biosimilars with reference medicines. Individual member states decide their own policies on interchangeability, with varying approaches such as Denmark considering all originators and biosimilars interchangeable unless proven otherwise, while Ireland allows a single switch only. In the United States, FDA regulates drug products, while states regulate pharmacies. Patients should consult their doctor and pharmacist for questions related to switching between biological medicines. In Denmark, all originators and biosimilars are considered interchangeable unless proven otherwise; Ireland allows a single switch but not multiple switches. In the United States, FDA regulates drug products while states regulate pharmacies. 37 states have considered legislation for biosimilar substitution, with 27 states and Puerto Rico enacting laws with varying provisions. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), as of March 31, 2017, 37 states have considered legislation for biosimilar substitution, with 27 states and Puerto Rico enacting laws with varying provisions. FDA gained authority to collect user fees from manufacturers of brand-name drugs and biological products in 1992 through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). The FDA gained authority to collect user fees from manufacturers of brand-name drugs and biological products in 1992 through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). This agreement included performance goals and the use of fees to support the review of new product applications. The additional resources from user fees allowed the FDA to increase staff for review processes. The FDA gained authority to collect user fees from manufacturers of brand-name drugs and biological products in 1992 through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). This agreement included performance goals and the use of fees to support the review of new product applications. User fees made up 43% of the FY2016 FDA budget and allowed FDA to increase staff available for review processes. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) further amended the FFDCA to authorize FDA to collect fees for biosimilar products. The FDA has increased staff to review applications and reduce review time for standard applications. Congress has granted similar authority for medical devices, animal drugs, and generic human drugs. User fees accounted for 43% of the FY2016 FDA budget. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) allows FDA to collect fees for biosimilar product reviews. Under the Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I), FDA collected fees for biosimilar product reviews from 2012 to 2017. The program included fees for products in the development phase to generate revenue and assist industry sponsors in early development. The BsUFA I program, which started in 2012, included fees for products in the development phase to generate revenue and assist industry sponsors in early development of biosimilar biological products. The Biosimilar Product Development (BPD) program provides assistance to industry sponsors in the early stages of developing a new biosimilar product. As of February 2017, there were 64 BPD programs developing separate biosimilar products to 23 different reference products. Companies can choose to discontinue participation in the program but would have to pay a reactivation fee to resume further product development. The Biosimilar Product Development (BPD) program offers assistance to industry sponsors in developing new biosimilar products. There were 64 BPD programs for 23 reference products as of February 2017. Companies can opt out of the program but must pay a reactivation fee to resume development. The FDA provides information on BsUFA fees collected annually and how they are spent. The FDA offers assistance to industry sponsors in developing biosimilar products through the Biosimilar Product Development (BPD) program. Companies can opt out of the program but must pay a reactivation fee to resume development. The biosimilar biological product application fee could be waived for the first application from a small business. FDA held a public meeting on the reauthorization of the program\u2014BsUFA II\u2014in December 2015 and negotiation sessions with industry in March to May 2016. The FDA reauthorized the biosimilar user fee program, BsUFA II, after holding public meetings and negotiation sessions with industry from 2015 to 2016. The program was extended for FY2018 through FY2022. In 2016, the FDA posted the draft BsUFA II agreement on its website for FY2018 through FY2022. A final recommendation was submitted to Congress after a 30-day comment period, leading to the reauthorization of the biosimilar user fee program via the FDARA in 2017. Challenges were faced in achieving BsUFA I goals for advisory meetings due to a lack of additional staff. The FDA faced challenges in achieving BsUFA I goals for advisory meetings with industry due to a lack of additional staff. The new hiring authorities in the 21st Century Cures Act are expected to strengthen staff capacity and modernize the hiring system. The FDA plans to use new hiring authorities from the 21st Century Cures Act to strengthen staff capacity for biosimilar review, modernize the hiring system, and set clear goals for hiring to meet performance goals and lower healthcare costs. The FDA plans to establish a dedicated function for recruiting and retaining scientific staff, set clear hiring goals, and assess hiring practices continuously. These enhancements aim to meet performance goals, save time and resources for applicants, and promote price competition to lower healthcare costs. Under BsUFA II, certain fees have been dropped, while others have been retained with a limit of five BsUFA Program fees per application per fiscal year. Under BsUFA II, the supplement fee and establishment fee have been dropped, while the initial, annual, and reactivation BPD fees have been retained. The product fee is now called the BsUFA Program fee, with a limit of five fees per application per fiscal year. FDA and industry estimate a need of approximately $45 million in FY2018 to cover BsUFA program costs. This amount may be adjusted but not exceed a $9 increase. The application fee will no longer be reduced by the cumulative amount of BPD fees paid by the sponsor for that product. FDA and industry estimate that the agency will need approximately $45 million in FY2018 to cover the BsUFA program costs, with a possible adjustment not exceeding $9 million. The federal government focuses more on basic or preclinical research, while the pharmaceutical industry directs more research funding towards clinical trials. The federal government, like NIH, prioritizes basic and preclinical research, while the pharmaceutical industry focuses on clinical trials. Drawing a line between basic and applied research can be challenging when assigning credit for therapeutic advancements. Concerns over high pharmaceutical costs have prompted a closer look at the federal role in research. The development of new classes of drugs, like biologics, relies on major advances such as recombinant DNA. Concerns over high pharmaceutical costs have prompted a closer look at the federal role in research. Studies have quantified the contribution of publicly funded research to new drug discovery, with findings showing a small percentage originating from sources other than private industry. Studies have quantified the contribution of publicly funded research to new drug discovery. A study found that a small percentage of new drugs approved by the FDA originated from non-industry sources. Another study focused on truly innovative new drugs, known as new molecular entities (NMEs). A 1993 study found that 7.6% of new drugs approved from 1981 through 1990 originated from non-industry sources. Another study in 2010 showed that 24.1% of new molecular entities (NMEs) and new biologics approved by the FDA between 1998 and 2007 were publicly funded. Stevens et al.'s 2011 study claims to be more comprehensive in this regard. A 2011 study by Stevens et al. found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from work in publicly funded labs. Of the 1,541 drug applications, 19% that received priority review were from publicly funded research. The Stevens study found that 9.3% of FDA-approved drugs from 1990 to 2007 came from publicly funded labs. Of the 1,541 drug applications, 19% that received priority review were from publicly funded research. The authors found that 46.2% of new-drug applications from public-sector research institutions received priority reviews, compared to 20.0% from private-sector research, indicating a 2.3-fold increase. Priority review is for drugs that offer significant improvements in treating serious conditions. Data suggests that drugs discovered by public-sector research institutions have a disproportionately important clinical effect. The authors found that public-sector research institutions have a higher rate of priority reviews for new drug applications compared to private-sector research. This suggests that drugs discovered by public-sector institutions have a significant clinical impact. The 2011 Stevens study defined participation in drug discovery as creating intellectual property specific to a drug that is later transferred to a company through a commercial license. The 2011 Stevens study defined participation in drug discovery as creating intellectual property specific to a drug that is later transferred to a company through a commercial license, excluding the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies. The Stevens study excluded the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies that led to the creation of new classes of drugs, such as recombinant DNA technology, bacterial production methods, antibody production methods, glycosylated protein production methods, and gene silencing techniques using small interfering RNAs. The study excluded the PSRIs' role in developing platform technologies like recombinant DNA, bacterial production methods, antibody production methods, glycosylated protein production methods, and gene silencing techniques using small interfering RNAs, which enabled the development of many FDA-approved products. The study excluded PSRIs' role in developing platform technologies like recombinant DNA, bacterial production methods, and gene silencing techniques, which enabled the development of many FDA-approved products. According to Stevens et al., 36 biologic drugs were discovered by PSRIs in the past 40 years. The 36 biologic drugs listed in Table 6 were discovered at least in part by PSRIs during the past 40 years. Biological products are regulated under the Public Health Service Act, while chemical drugs are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The regulation of biologics and chemical drugs is done under different acts - biologics under the Public Health Service Act and chemical drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was the first national regulation for biologics. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was the first enduring national regulation for biologics, focusing on premarket approval and manufacturing processes in response to deaths from tetanus contamination of vaccines. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was groundbreaking, being the first premarket approval statute in history. It focused on shifting from post-market to pre-market government review, in response to deaths from tetanus contamination of vaccines. The act required facilities manufacturing biological products to be inspected before receiving a federal license to market them. It predates the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 required facilities manufacturing biological products to be inspected before receiving a federal license to market them. It predates the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906 and was replaced by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938. The Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906 did not have premarket control over new drugs for safety, unlike the Biologics Act and the later Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The FFDCA, enacted in 1938, required drug manufacturers to submit a new drug application (NDA) before marketing to prove safety. The Biologics Control Act was revised under the Public Health Service Act in 1944. The FFDCA replaced the Pure Food and Drugs Act in 1938, requiring drug manufacturers to submit a new drug application (NDA) for safety. The Public Health Service Act of 1944 revised the Biologics Control Act, subjecting biological products to regulation under the FFDCA. The 1944 Public Health Service Act specified that biological products licensed under the PHSA are subject to regulation under the FFDCA. Biological products include viruses, vaccines, blood products, and allergenic products for human disease prevention or treatment. The PHSA states that biological products subject to regulation under it are also regulated under the FFDCA, which applies to products for disease prevention, treatment, or cure in humans. The PHSA requires a single biological license application for products intended for disease prevention, treatment, or cure in humans or animals. This requirement was established by the FDA Modernization Act of 1997. The PHSA, amended by the FDA Modernization Act of 1997, requires a single biological license application for products affecting the body of humans or animals. The PHSA also allows for immediate license suspension in case of public health danger, and was further amended by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009 amended the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to create a licensure pathway for biosimilar products and authorized the FDA to collect associated fees. It also established periods of regulatory exclusivity for certain brand-name biologics and biosimilar products. The BPCIA of 2009 created a pathway for biosimilar products and authorized the FDA to collect fees. It also established regulatory exclusivity periods for certain brand-name biologics and biosimilar products. Regulatory responsibility for biologics was initially with the Hygienic Laboratory and later transferred to the Bureau of Biologics in 1972. Regulatory responsibility for biologics was initially with the Hygienic Laboratory and later transferred to the Bureau of Biologics in 1972. The FDA's Bureau of Drugs and Bureau of Biologics merged in 1982 to form the National Center for Drugs and Biologics, which later split into CDER and CBER in 1988. In 1988, the Center for Drugs and Biologics split into CDER and CBER. CBER moved to the new FDA headquarters in 2014. Determining jurisdictional status of biotechnology products has been challenging for the FDA and industry. In 1991, FDA published an Intercenter Agreement between CBER and CDER, stating that traditional biologics and most biotechnology products would be regulated by CBER. In 2002, the FDA announced its intention to reorganize review responsibilities, consolidating review of new pharmaceutical products under CDER, allowing CBER to focus on vaccines, blood safety, and gene products. The FDA reorganized review responsibilities in 2002, transferring most therapeutic biologics from CBER to CDER. CDER now regulates these products as licensed biologics under Section 351 of the PHSA. Examples include monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulators. On June 30, 2003, responsibility for most therapeutic biologics was transferred from CBER to CDER. Biological products transferred to CDER are regulated as licensed biologics under Section 351 of the PHSA. Examples of products transferred to CDER include monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulators, growth factors, and cytokines. Traditional biologics such as vaccines, allergenic products, and blood and blood products remain at CBER. Monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulators, growth factors, and cytokines are now regulated by CDER, while traditional biologics like vaccines and blood products remain under CBER."
