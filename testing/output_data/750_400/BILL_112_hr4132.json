The \"Faster Access to Specialized Treatments Act\" acknowledges the critical role of the FDA in ensuring the safety and efficacy of new medicines. Regulatory innovation is essential for addressing serious diseases and promoting investment in innovative treatments for unmet medical needs. Advances in medical sciences have provided a deeper understanding of diseases over the past two decades. Advances in medical sciences, including genomics and bioinformatics, have led to the development of innovative treatments for unmet medical needs, with a focus on targeted medicines for serious diseases. Advances in medical sciences have led to the development of targeted medicines for serious diseases, utilizing biomarkers, pharmacogenomics, and adaptive clinical trials for expedited development and review by the FDA. Advances in medical sciences have led to the development of targeted medicines for serious diseases, utilizing biomarkers, pharmacogenomics, and adaptive clinical trials for expedited development and review by the FDA. FDA should implement more effective processes for expedited development of innovative medicines for unmet medical needs, using a range of endpoints and modern scientific tools earlier in the drug development cycle. This could lead to fewer, smaller, or shorter clinical trials. Patients benefit from expedited access to safe and effective innovative therapies for serious or life-threatening diseases, including rare conditions, using a variety of endpoints and modern scientific tools earlier in drug development. This approach may lead to fewer, smaller, or shorter clinical trials without compromising FDA's high standards for drug approval. Patients benefit from expedited access to safe and effective innovative therapies for serious or life-threatening diseases, including rare conditions, by amending existing statutory authority to enhance FDA's ability to consider appropriate scientific data and expedite development and access to new treatments. The existing statutory authority governing expedited approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions should be amended to enhance FDA's authority to consider scientific data and expedite access to novel treatments. Congress believes FDA should apply accelerated approval and fast track provisions to improve access to innovative therapies. The FDA should apply accelerated approval and fast track provisions to expedite the development and availability of treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases, while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards. SEC. 3. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES OR CONDITIONS. Amends Section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to expedite approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases. The Secretary will facilitate the development and expedite the review of a new drug designated as a fast track product if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease and addresses unmet medical needs. The sponsor of a new drug may request the Secretary to designate the drug as a fast track product if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease and addresses unmet medical needs. The designation must be requested within 60 calendar days after the submission of an application for the investigation of the drug. The Secretary must determine if a drug meets criteria for fast track designation within 60 days of receiving a request from the sponsor. If the drug qualifies, it will be designated as a fast track product. The Secretary will determine if a drug meets criteria for fast track designation and expedite its development and review for approval. The Secretary may approve an application for a product for a serious or life-threatening disease under certain conditions, including fast track products, to expedite development and review for approval. The Secretary may approve a product for a serious or life-threatening disease under certain conditions, including fast track products, based on surrogate or clinical endpoints predicting clinical benefit or earlier measurable outcomes. The Secretary may approve a product for a serious or life-threatening disease based on surrogate or clinical endpoints predicting clinical benefit or earlier measurable outcomes, supported by various types of evidence. The Secretary may approve a product for a serious or life-threatening disease based on surrogate or clinical endpoints predicting clinical benefit or earlier measurable outcomes, supported by various types of evidence. Evidence supporting an endpoint's ability to predict clinical benefit may include epidemiological, pathophysiologic, pharmacologic, or therapeutic evidence, using biomarkers or other scientific methods. Approval may be subject to post-approval studies to verify predicted outcomes. The Secretary may approve a product for a serious or life-threatening disease based on surrogate or clinical endpoints predicting clinical benefit or earlier measurable outcomes. Approval may be subject to post-approval studies to verify predicted outcomes and submission of promotional materials for review. The Secretary may withdraw approval of a product based on its effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, and requires submission of promotional materials for review before dissemination. During the preapproval review period and after approval, the Secretary can determine an appropriate period for monitoring. The Secretary has the authority to expedite the withdrawal of approval for a product if the sponsor fails to conduct required post-approval studies diligently. The Secretary can withdraw approval of a product using expedited procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct required post-approval studies diligently or if a study fails to verify predicted clinical benefits. The Secretary can withdraw approval of a product if post-approval studies fail to verify predicted clinical benefits or if the product is deemed unsafe or ineffective. The Secretary can withdraw approval of a product if post-approval studies fail to verify predicted clinical benefits or if the product is deemed unsafe or ineffective. Additionally, if the sponsor disseminates false or misleading promotional materials, the approval may be revoked. The Secretary may review incomplete applications for fast track products if preliminary evaluation suggests potential effectiveness. The Secretary may evaluate and commence review of an application for fast track product approval based on preliminary clinical data submitted by the sponsor. The review will only begin if the applicant provides a submission schedule and pays any required fees. The Secretary will start reviewing a fast track product approval application based on preliminary clinical data if the applicant provides a submission schedule and pays any required fees. Any agreed time period for review set forth in goals related to fee collection will not apply to the application. The Secretary will not apply agreed time periods for review to a fast track product approval application until it is complete. Awareness efforts will be made to inform relevant parties about the provisions. The Secretary will delay applying review time periods to a fast track product approval application until it is complete. Awareness efforts will inform relevant parties about the provisions. Establish a program to encourage the development of surrogate and clinical endpoints, biomarkers, and scientific tools for determining clinical benefit in serious or life-threatening conditions with unmet medical needs. SEC. 4. GUIDANCE; AMENDED REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must issue draft guidance within one year of the enactment of the Act, followed by final guidance after public comment, to implement the amendments and update regulations for accelerated approval. The Secretary will issue final guidance to implement amendments and amend regulations for accelerated approval in parts 314 and 601 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations. Considerations include issues related to accelerated approval and fast track processes for designated drugs. The Secretary will consider issues related to accelerated approval and fast track processes for drugs designated for rare diseases, and how to incorporate novel approaches for reviewing surrogate endpoints based on evidence in the guidance. The guidance will address novel approaches for reviewing surrogate endpoints based on evidence for rare diseases under section 526 of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The issuance of guidance or regulations will not delay the review or approval process for designation or application submissions. The issuance of guidance or regulations under section 3 will not delay the review or approval process for designation or application submissions under section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. SEC. 5. INDEPENDENT REVIEW. The Secretary will contract with an independent entity to evaluate the FDA's application of processes for drug review and their impact on innovative treatments for serious conditions. The evaluation under section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by section 3, will assess the impact on innovative treatments for serious conditions and involve consultation with various stakeholders. The amendments to section 506(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act encourage innovative approaches for product assessment under accelerated approval while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards."
