    "content": "The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the discovery of Al Qaeda cells in Europe spurred the EU to enhance cooperation in combating terrorism and improving police, judicial, and intelligence collaboration. The EU, a unique partnership among 28 member states, aims to promote peace and economic prosperity through European integration. As part of this integration, the EU has worked to harmonize policies in the \"justice and home affairs\" field. The EU, consisting of 28 member states, aims to promote peace and economic prosperity through European integration. Efforts in the \"justice and home affairs\" field focus on common internal security measures, protecting citizens' rights, and promoting free movement within the EU, including countering terrorism, police cooperation, migration, and border control policies. Efforts in the JHA field aim to foster common internal security measures, protect EU citizens' rights, and promote free movement within the EU. This includes countering terrorism, police and judicial cooperation, migration and asylum issues, and border control policies for the Schengen area. EU attempts to create common JHA policies were initially hindered by member state concerns about national legal systems and sovereignty. The Schengen area allows free movement without passport checks among participating countries. EU's efforts to create common JHA policies were initially hindered by member state concerns about national legal systems and sovereignty. The 2001 terrorist attacks prompted EU leaders and member states to enhance law enforcement cooperation and counterterrorism efforts. The 2001 terrorist attacks prompted EU leaders and member states to enhance law enforcement cooperation and counterterrorism efforts, leading to numerous arrests in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Germany and Spain were identified as key bases for the attacks on the United States. European leaders recognized the need for enhanced law enforcement cooperation and counterterrorism efforts following the 2001 attacks. Suspects were arrested in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, with Germany and Spain identified as key bases for the attacks on the United States. The EU's open borders and different legal systems allowed terrorists to move around easily and evade arrest due to the lack of anti-terrorist legislation in most member states. The EU's open borders and different legal systems enabled terrorists to move around easily and evade arrest. Most EU member states lacked anti-terrorist legislation at the time of the 2001 attacks, making it difficult to apprehend suspects who could flee to countries with different laws. Extradition requests often faced delays, hindering efforts to combat terrorism. The EU's open borders and different legal systems allowed terrorists to evade arrest by moving between countries with varying laws. Extradition requests often took months or years to process, hindering counterterrorism efforts. EU leaders recognized the need for harmonizing national laws and enhancing cooperation among member states' law enforcement agencies to address cross-border terrorist threats. The EU recognized the need for harmonizing national laws and enhancing cooperation among member states' law enforcement agencies to address cross-border terrorist threats. They established common definitions of terrorism, a list of terrorist groups, an EU arrest warrant, tools to stem terrorist financing, and measures to strengthen external border controls. The EU took steps to enhance counterterrorism capabilities by establishing common definitions of terrorism, a list of terrorist groups, an EU arrest warrant, tools to stem terrorist financing, and measures to strengthen external border controls and aviation security. They also worked to bolster Europol and Eurojust for improved coordination in cross-border crimes. Subsequent incidents in Europe further emphasized the need for enhancing EU counterterrorism efforts. The EU strengthened counterterrorism capabilities by improving border controls, aviation security, and enhancing Europol and Eurojust. The March 2004 bombings in Madrid prompted further initiatives to enhance travel document security and impede terrorist travel, leading to the establishment of a Counterterrorism Coordinator. The March 2004 bombings in Madrid led to the establishment of a Counterterrorism Coordinator in the EU to enhance intelligence sharing and implement agreed policies. The July 2005 bombings in London highlighted the issue of \"homegrown\" Islamist extremism. The Counterterrorism Coordinator in the EU was responsible for enhancing intelligence sharing among member states and promoting the implementation of agreed policies. The 2005 London bombings by homegrown Islamist extremists raised concerns about the integration of Muslims into European society and the need to counter violent extremism. The 2005 London bombings brought the issue of \"homegrown\" Islamist extremism to the forefront of European political debate. The EU adopted its first plan in December 2005 to combat radicalization and terrorist recruitment, focusing on disrupting terrorist networks, promoting mainstream voices, and enhancing security and justice. Since then, the EU has continued efforts to improve its counterterrorism strategies. In December 2005, the EU adopted its first plan to combat radicalization and terrorist recruitment, with goals to disrupt terrorist activities, promote mainstream voices, and enhance security. The EU expanded its definition of terrorism in 2008 to include new criminal offenses related to terrorist recruitment and training. The EU expanded its definition of terrorism in 2008 to include new criminal offenses such as terrorist recruitment, training, and public provocation. This decision aimed to facilitate prosecution, counter terrorist propaganda, and improve cooperation with Internet providers. In 2011, the EU established the Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) to connect key groups. EU officials hoped that the expanded definition of terrorism in 2008 would aid in prosecuting individuals involved in terrorist activities and countering propaganda. The Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) was established in 2011 to connect key groups in countering radicalization and violent extremism. The Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) was established in 2011 to connect key groups involved in countering radicalization and violent extremism, serving as an EU-wide forum for exchanging ideas and best practices. However, forging common EU policies in the field of justice and home affairs remains a challenge due to national sovereignty concerns and differing views among member states and EU institutions on sensitive issues like data privacy and intelligence sharing. EU member states still retain control over their law enforcement. Despite efforts to address cross-border crimes, harmonizing EU policies in the field of justice and home affairs remains challenging due to national sovereignty concerns and differing views among member states and EU institutions. National police and intelligence services are often hesitant to share information with each other or with EU bodies like Europol, complicating efforts to combat threats such as the Islamic State terrorist organization. EU policymakers are concerned about European citizens joining terrorist groups in the Middle East and North Africa, but face challenges in sharing information among national police and intelligence services and EU bodies like Europol. EU policymakers are increasingly alarmed by the growing number of European citizens joining terrorist groups in the Middle East and North Africa, such as ISIL or ISIS. Security services are worried about the potential threat these trained militants may pose upon their return to Europe, as well as individuals inspired by extremist propaganda to carry out \"lone wolf\" attacks. Up to 5,000 EU citizens are estimated to have traveled to fight in conflict zones since 2011. EU authorities estimate that up to 5,000 EU citizens have traveled to fight in conflict zones since 2011. Security services are concerned about the potential danger posed by trained militants returning to Europe, as well as individuals inspired by extremist propaganda to carry out \"lone wolf\" attacks at home. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe have heightened these fears, with perpetrators having links to or being influenced by groups like the Islamic State. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe have raised concerns about individuals being influenced by extremist propaganda to carry out \"lone wolf\" attacks at home. These attacks include incidents in Brussels and Paris, where perpetrators had links to or were influenced by groups like the Islamic State. In 2014, a French Muslim with ties to Islamist fighters in Syria carried out a shooting at the Jewish Museum in Brussels, Belgium. In 2015, attacks in Paris targeted Charlie Hebdo, police officers, and a kosher supermarket, carried out by French-born Muslims possibly linked to Al Qaeda or the Islamic State. In the same year, a self-radicalized Danish-born citizen of Palestinian descent committed shootings in Copenhagen, killing two people and wounding five. The 2015 attacks in Copenhagen, Denmark, included shootings at a cafe hosting a free speech debate and a synagogue, carried out by a self-radicalized Danish-born citizen of Palestinian descent. Another attack was attempted on a train from Amsterdam to Paris in August 2015, thwarted by passengers, including three Americans. The November 2015 coordinated attacks at multiple locations are also mentioned. The 2015 attacks in Europe included shootings at a cafe and a synagogue in Copenhagen, Denmark, as well as an attempted attack on a train from Amsterdam to Paris in August 2015. The November 2015 coordinated attacks in Paris left 130 dead and more than 350 injured, with assailants linked to known Islamist extremists in Europe. In November 2015, coordinated attacks in Paris left 130 dead and over 350 injured. Authorities confirmed the identities of seven assailants, all French or Belgian citizens, with at least six having ties to the Islamic State in Syria-Iraq. European governments struggle with monitoring potential attackers and face challenges with domestic security and border controls. The EU has taken a leading role in combating the foreign fighter threat in the Syria-Iraq region. Recent attacks have exposed weaknesses in European domestic security and border controls, with difficulties in monitoring potential assailants and insufficient information sharing among EU countries' law enforcement and intelligence services. Some attackers have exploited the Schengen system and chaos from migrant influxes. Recent attacks in Europe have highlighted weaknesses in domestic security and border controls, with difficulties in monitoring potential assailants and insufficient information sharing among EU countries' law enforcement and intelligence services. Perpetrators have exploited the Schengen system and chaos from migrant influxes, traveling between European countries prior to attacks. The thwarted train assailant and alleged Brussels gunman traveled between European countries before attacks. The suspected ringleader of the Paris attacks traveled between Europe and Syria. Perpetrators of the November attacks entered Europe through Greece with fake Syrian passports. Another suspect entered Belgium from France after the attacks. Perpetrators who died during the November attacks entered Europe through Greece with fake Syrian passports. Another suspect involved in the Paris attacks entered Belgium from France the morning after the attacks but remains at large. The EU faces challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism and the foreign fighter threat. The EU has faced challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism and the foreign fighter threat, largely due to issues related to sovereignty and balancing security with human rights. Despite some progress on EU initiatives, agreement and implementation remain difficult. The EU has faced challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism and the foreign fighter threat, largely due to issues related to sovereignty and balancing security with human rights. Key EU steps include enhancing information sharing among national authorities to address the evolving foreign fighter threat. EU officials have been encouraging national authorities to share information on suspected foreign fighters and make greater use of existing common EU databases, such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) and Europol's Focal Point Travellers database. In January 2016, Europol launched a European Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC) to address the evolving foreign fighter threat. Europol launched the European Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC) in January 2016 for information sharing and operational cooperation among member states to monitor and investigate foreign terrorist fighters, illegal firearms trafficking, and terrorist financing. Success of these initiatives depends on receiving information from national authorities. The European Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC) was established for information sharing and operational cooperation among member states to monitor and investigate foreign terrorist fighters, illegal firearms trafficking, and terrorist financing. The success of these initiatives relies on receiving information from national authorities. EU officials report an increase in alerts entered into SIS and information contributed to Europol databases, but some experts believe EU-wide information sharing related to terrorism still falls short. Finalizing the EU-wide System for the Collection of Airline Passenger Name Record (PNR) Data is a key priority. Establishing an EU-wide System for the Collection of Airline Passenger Name Record (PNR) Data has been a long-discussed topic, with a proposal stalled in the European Parliament since 2013 due to data privacy concerns. Pressure to adopt an EU PNR system increased after the 2015 attacks in Paris. EU officials note an increase in alerts entered into SIS and information shared with Europol, but some experts believe there are still shortcomings in EU-wide information sharing related to terrorism. Establishing an EU-wide PNR system has been discussed for years, with a proposal stalled in the European Parliament since 2013 due to data privacy concerns. Pressure to adopt the system increased after the 2015 Paris attacks, with EU governments emphasizing the need for better information sharing on foreign fighters and terrorist suspects. Some member states have already set up their own national PNR systems. EU governments pushed for an EU-wide PNR system post-2015 Paris attacks to enhance information sharing on foreign fighters and identify terrorist suspects. Member states had their own PNR systems, necessitating harmonization. A provisional agreement was reached in December 2015, expected to be finalized in early 2016. Airlines will be required to provide national PNR data. The EU governments pushed for an EU-wide PNR system post-2015 Paris attacks to enhance information sharing on foreign fighters and identify terrorist suspects. A provisional agreement was reached in December 2015, expected to be finalized in early 2016, obliging airlines to provide national PNR data for flights into and out of EU territory. The EU governments reached a provisional agreement in December 2015 for an EU-wide PNR system post-2015 Paris attacks. Airlines will provide PNR data for flights in and out of EU territory, with member states allowed to collect data from intra-EU flights and non-carrier operators. Critics argue the system infringes on data privacy rights, while others believe it doesn't ensure meaningful data sharing. The EU governments reached a provisional agreement in December 2015 for an EU-wide PNR system post-2015 Paris attacks. Critics argue the system infringes on data privacy rights, while others believe it doesn't ensure meaningful data sharing. The envisioned PNR system does not establish a centralized EU PNR database, and EU governments will have two years to implement the agreement's provisions. The EU governments reached a provisional agreement in December 2015 for an EU-wide PNR system post-2015 Paris attacks. While the system does not establish a centralized EU PNR database, EU governments will have two years to implement the agreement's provisions, focusing on strengthening external EU border controls. The EU is utilizing security tools to increase electronic checks at external borders in accordance with the Schengen Borders Code. There is resistance to amending the code for more extensive checks, as the surge of migrants and refugees in 2015 and the Paris attacks have strained the Schengen system. The European Commission proposed a \"targeted modification\" of the Schengen Borders Code to introduce mandatory checks of EU citizens against law enforcement databases at external borders, in response to the surge of migrants and refugees in 2015 and the Paris attacks. In mid-December 2015, the European Commission proposed changes to the Schengen Borders Code for mandatory checks of EU citizens against law enforcement databases at external borders. They also suggested creating a new European Border and Coast Guard to strengthen border security. Some member states are cautious due to concerns about national sovereignty. The EU proposed establishing a new European Border and Coast Guard to reinforce member states' capacities at the EU's external borders through joint operations and rapid interventions. Efforts to establish an \"EU border guard corps\" have faced challenges regarding national sovereignty. The EU is also working on detecting and removing online content promoting terrorism and developing communication strategies to counter terrorist ideologies. In July 2015, the EU set up an Internet Referral Unit to monitor terrorist content on the Internet and social media platforms. The EU has established measures to detect and remove online content promoting terrorism. This includes the creation of an Internet Referral Unit in 2015 and an Internet Forum in 2015 to collaborate with technology companies in countering terrorist propaganda online. The EU has launched initiatives to combat online terrorist propaganda, including the creation of an Internet Referral Unit and an Internet Forum in 2015. They are also revising their Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to address factors contributing to radicalization and ensure a strong criminal justice response throughout the EU. The EU is revising its Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to criminalize traveling for terrorist purposes and receiving terrorist training across the EU, aiming to address societal factors in prisons that contribute to radicalization. EU-wide harmonization of criminal laws faces challenges due to varying national policies and concerns about infringing on national legal systems. The EU is updating its Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to criminalize traveling for terrorist purposes and receiving terrorist training across the EU. Harmonizing criminal laws in the EU has faced challenges due to differing national policies and concerns about infringing on national legal systems. EU officials argue that updating the common terrorism definition is necessary to comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178. EU governments initially hesitated to amend the common terrorism definition, but EU officials argue it must be updated to comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178. In December 2015, the European Commission proposed revising the definition to address the foreign fighter threat. The EU is revising its common terrorism definition to align with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178, focusing on prosecuting foreign fighter-related offenses. The European Commission's proposal will be reviewed by EU member states and the European Parliament. The EU has prioritized enhancing law enforcement and intelligence cooperation with the United States since 9/11, a move supported by the previous U.S. administration and Congress. The EU's proposal to revise its terrorism definition aligns with U.N. Resolution 2178, focusing on prosecuting foreign fighter-related offenses. This initiative, supported by the previous U.S. administration and Congress, aims to enhance law enforcement and intelligence cooperation with the United States in combating terrorism. The EU initiative aims to root out terrorist cells in Europe and beyond, enhancing cooperation with the United States in combating terrorism. This partnership has led to a new dynamic in U.S.-EU relations, focusing on law enforcement and homeland security issues. Despite some frictions, most U.S. policymakers view the evolving partnership positively, with support from the Obama Administration in areas like counterterrorism and transport security. The Obama Administration has supported U.S. cooperation with the EU in counterterrorism, border controls, and transport security. The partnership with the EU is viewed positively by most U.S. policymakers despite some frictions. In 2011, President Obama's National Strategy for Counterterrorism emphasized partnering with the European Parliament and European Union to enhance counterterrorism efforts. The EU is a key U.S. partner in the Global Counterterrorism Forum, focusing on combating violent extremism and enhancing international cooperation against terrorism. The EU is a key U.S. partner in the Global Counterterrorism Forum, focusing on combating violent extremism and enhancing international cooperation against terrorism, with a focus on combating the foreign fighter phenomenon. Over the past two years, U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation has focused on combating the foreign fighter phenomenon, with concerns about European and American Muslims joining Islamist groups in Syria and Iraq. U.S. policymakers worry about European foreign fighters due to visa-free travel arrangements. Attorney General Eric Holder emphasized the need for shared strategies to address the influx of U.S. and European-born extremists in Syria. In July 2014, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder highlighted the mutual interest in developing strategies to address the issue of U.S. and European-born extremists in Syria, emphasizing the impact of visa-free travel between the United States and EU countries. In September 2014, the White House mentioned close collaboration between U.S. and EU officials on various measures regarding foreign fighters.

EU countries supported U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178 to combat the global foreign fighter phenomenon. EU countries collaborate with U.S. on counter-radicalization, border security, and information sharing to combat foreign fighter threat. Most EU states support U.N. Resolution 2178 and provide support to U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State. U.S. Attorney General attends emergency meeting with European and North American ministers post-Paris attacks to discuss terrorist threats and foreign fighters. EU member states are supporting the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State, with high-ranking officials participating in conferences on countering violent extremism. U.S. officials are urging European governments and the EU to enhance information exchanges within Europe. High-ranking European and EU officials participated in a 2015 conference on countering violent extremism hosted by the United States. U.S. officials are encouraging European governments and the EU to strengthen intra-European information exchanges and utilize existing EU-wide databases. President Obama called on the EU to implement an EU PNR system after the 2015 Paris attacks. President Obama urged the EU to implement an EU PNR system and make greater use of existing EU-wide databases like the SIS and Europol. U.S. officials support efforts to enhance information-sharing to prevent foreign terrorist fighters from entering countries undetected. Close law enforcement ties with European allies and existing U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements are deemed crucial in addressing the foreign fighter phenomenon. The U.S. urges the EU to implement an EU PNR system and enhance information-sharing to prevent foreign terrorist fighters from entering countries undetected. Close law enforcement ties with European allies and existing U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements are crucial in addressing the foreign fighter phenomenon. Challenges remain in the U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship, including data privacy concerns complicating negotiations on information-sharing agreements.

Other issues include detainee policies, differences in terrorist designation lists, and measures to improve border controls. The U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship faces challenges, including data privacy concerns affecting information-sharing agreements. Other issues include detainee policies, differences in terrorist designation lists, and measures to enhance border controls. Renewed attention was brought to these issues after unauthorized disclosures of U.S. NSA surveillance activities in 2013. Legislation passed in 2015 to strengthen the U.S. Visa Waiver Program has also raised concerns in the EU. measures to improve border controls and security in response to concerns about Europeans fighting with or inspired by the Islamic State have raised some concerns in the EU. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on police, judicial, and border control policy matters have increased since 2001, playing a crucial role in developing closer ties. U.S. Departments of State, Justice, Homeland Security, and Treasury have been actively engaged in this process. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on police, judicial, and border control policy matters have increased substantially since 2001, playing a crucial role in developing closer ties. The U.S. Departments of State, Justice, Homeland Security, and Treasury are actively engaged in this process, with high-level meetings between officials occurring regularly. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on police, judicial, and border control policy matters have increased since 2001. High-level meetings occur regularly to discuss cooperation against terrorism, terrorist financing, and border security. Expert-level dialogues on critical issues have also taken place in recent years. The United States and the EU have established dialogues on terrorist financing, border and transport security, critical infrastructure protection, and preventing violent extremism. U.S. and EU agencies have reciprocal liaison relationships, with Europol having liaison officers in Washington, DC, and the United States stationing officers at Europol headquarters in The Hague for counterterrorism efforts. Europol and U.S. agencies have established reciprocal liaison relationships for counterterrorism and international crime. Europol has two liaison officers in Washington, DC, and the U.S. has stationed 14 officers at Europol headquarters in The Hague. These officers represent 11 different U.S. federal law enforcement agencies and work on cases involving counterfeiting, cybercrime, and other international crimes. The U.S. has stationed 14 officers at Europol headquarters in The Hague to work on cases involving counterterrorism, counterfeiting, and cybercrime. These officers represent 11 different U.S. federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and the Secret Service. Europol supports approximately 500 cases a year involving U.S. authorities, leading to operational successes in countering transnational crimes. Since 2006, a U.S. liaison has worked at Eurojust headquarters in The Hague to facilitate cooperation between European and U.S. prosecutors on terrorism and other cross-border criminal cases. U.S.-EU efforts against terrorism have resulted in agreements to improve police and judicial cooperation. In 2001 and 2002, U.S.-Europol agreements were made to share strategic information. Cooperation between European and U.S. prosecutors on terrorism and cross-border criminal cases has led to agreements to improve police and judicial cooperation. Two U.S.-Europol agreements in 2001 and 2002 allowed sharing of strategic and personal information. Negotiations on personal information were challenging due to concerns about U.S. data protection standards. EU prioritizes privacy of personal data. The U.S. and EU negotiated on sharing strategic and personal information, facing challenges over data protection standards. EU prioritizes privacy of personal data, which slowed down negotiations on cooperation agreements. The EU prioritizes the privacy of personal data, which has slowed down negotiations on cooperation agreements with the US. In 2007, the US and EU signed an agreement on common standards for the security of classified information. In 2010, new US-EU treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance entered into force. In 2010, two new U.S.-EU-wide treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance entered into force, harmonizing existing bilateral accords and promoting better information-sharing and prosecutorial cooperation to combat terrorism. The U.S. and EU signed treaties in 2003 to harmonize existing bilateral accords, simplify extradition processes, and enhance information-sharing to combat terrorism and transnational crimes. Challenges included the U.S. death penalty and extradition of EU nationals. The U.S. and EU signed treaties in 2003 to combat terrorism and transnational crimes. Challenges included the U.S. death penalty and extradition of EU nationals. Washington agreed to EU demands regarding extradition and the death penalty. The extradition accord modernizes existing agreements, streamlines information exchange, and sets rules. The extradition treaty between the U.S. and EU ensures that individuals extradited from the EU will not face the death penalty, in compliance with EU law. The treaty modernizes existing agreements, streamlines information exchange, and sets rules for determining priority in extradition requests. Additionally, the treaty allows U.S. authorities access to European bank account and financial information, speeds up request processing, and permits the acquisition of evidence through video conferencing. The MLA treaty between the U.S. and EU allows access to European bank account information, speeds up request processing, and permits evidence acquisition through video conferencing. Critics question the need for collaboration with EU bodies given existing bilateral relations between U.S. agencies and national police. Despite growing U.S.-EU ties in law enforcement, critics question the utility of collaborating with EU-wide bodies like Europol, citing existing bilateral relations between U.S. agencies and national police. Europol's lack of enforcement capabilities and dependence on national services for information are key concerns for both sides. Europol relies on national services for information, hindering its effectiveness in analyzing terrorist threats. European officials criticize the US for not sharing intelligence, while European opposition to the US death penalty may slow legal assistance and extradition of terrorist suspects. The United States expects intelligence from others but does not readily share its own. European opposition to the US death penalty may hinder legal assistance and extradition of terrorist suspects. However, US and European officials are committed to enhancing cooperation with EU law enforcement entities like Europol, signing agreements in 2015 to improve collaboration against foreign fighters and illegal immigration. U.S. and European officials are dedicated to enhancing cooperation with EU law enforcement entities like Europol. In 2015, new agreements were signed to improve collaboration against foreign fighters and illegal immigration, particularly by organized crime groups. The United States and the EU work together to track and combat terrorist financing globally through various forums such as the United Nations and the Financial Action Task Force. The United States and the EU collaborate to track and suppress terrorist financing through global forums like the United Nations and the Financial Action Task Force. They benefit from an agreement allowing U.S. access to financial data from SWIFT, aiding the U.S. Treasury Department's Terrorist Finance Tracking Program. The U.S. and EU collaborate to track terrorist financing through global forums. They benefit from an agreement allowing U.S. access to financial data from SWIFT for the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, generating investigative leads for EU governments. However, the sharing of SWIFT data remains controversial in Europe due to data privacy concerns. The U.S. and EU collaborate on tracking terrorist financing through the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, which has generated over 7,000 investigative leads for EU governments. The sharing of SWIFT data remains controversial in Europe due to data privacy concerns. The U.S. and EU have collaborated since 2001 to bridge gaps in their lists of terrorist individuals and groups, symbolically presenting a united front and curbing terrorist financing. The EU maintains two lists focusing on Al Qaeda and Taliban affiliates, enacting post-9/11 U.N. Security Council sanctions. The EU maintains two lists of terrorist organizations and individuals, one focusing on Al Qaeda and Taliban affiliates and the other on non-affiliated entities. The lists enact post-9/11 U.N. Security Council sanctions and include groups like Jabhat al Nusra, Boko Haram, and the Islamic State. The EU maintains two lists of terrorist organizations and individuals, one focusing on Al Qaeda and Taliban affiliates and the other on non-affiliated entities. The second list, known as the EU's \"common terrorist list\" or \"blacklist,\" includes over 80 individuals or entities worldwide and has been a subject of controversy in U.S.-EU debates. The EU's \"common terrorist list\" or \"blacklist\" contains over 80 individuals or entities globally. Law enforcement measures vary based on whether they are considered \"external\" (outside the EU) or \"internal\" (within the EU). The EU's \"common terrorist list\" includes over 80 individuals or entities globally. Law enforcement measures differ for those considered \"external\" (outside the EU) or \"internal\" (within the EU). For \"external\" persons and groups, all EU member states must freeze assets, restrict financial resources, and provide law enforcement assistance. For \"internal\" persons and groups, inclusion on the list subjects them to certain measures. EU member states are required to freeze assets, restrict financial resources, and provide law enforcement assistance for individuals or entities on the EU's common terrorist list. Unanimous agreement among all member states is needed to add or remove someone from the list. National governments often impose their own sanctions to prevent financing for listed individuals and entities. The EU's common terrorist list requires unanimous agreement among member states to add or remove individuals or entities. National governments often impose additional sanctions to cut off financing for listed organizations, such as PKK, FARC, Hamas, and Hezbollah's military wing. The EU and the United States have added several organizations to their terrorist lists, including PKK, FARC, Hamas, and Hezbollah's military wing. Harmonizing these lists has caused occasional frictions between the two entities. The EU and the United States have added organizations like PKK, FARC, Hamas, and Hezbollah's military wing to their terrorist lists. Harmonizing these lists has caused occasional frictions between the two entities. The EU hesitates to add suspected Hamas-related charities to its list, viewing them as separate entities engaged in political or social work. The US has designated charities like Interpal as Hamas fronts, leading to investigations in Europe. The EU hesitates to blacklist suspected Hamas-related charities, like UK-based Interpal, as some member states view them as separate entities engaged in political or social work. Despite investigations by European national authorities, these charities have been cleared of funding Hamas terrorist activities, making it unlikely for EU governments to agree on blacklisting them at the EU level. EU member states have also been divided on whether to include the Lebanese-based Hezbollah organization on their terrorist list. Interpal, investigated by European authorities, cleared of funding Hamas. Unlikely EU will blacklist. EU divided on Hezbollah inclusion. US considers Hezbollah a terrorist group. EU countries like UK and Netherlands support adding Hezbollah to terrorist list. The EU is divided on whether to include Hezbollah on the common terrorist list, with some countries supporting it while others oppose. The US already considers Hezbollah a foreign terrorist organization and imposes sanctions on the group. The EU is divided on adding Hezbollah to the common terrorist list, with some countries supporting it while others oppose due to concerns about managing relations with Lebanon and Hezbollah's social services in poor communities. In 2012-2013, events sparked a renewed debate within the EU on Hezbollah's inclusion. In 2012-2013, events like the Burgas airport bombing and a Hezbollah operative's conviction in Cyprus reignited the debate within the EU on adding Hezbollah to the common terrorist list. In 2012-2013, events like the Burgas airport bombing and a Hezbollah operative's conviction in Cyprus reignited the debate within the EU on adding Hezbollah to the common terrorist list, prompting calls for action due to Hezbollah's involvement in Syria's civil war and support of the Syrian government. In late July 2013, the EU announced that its 28 member states had agreed to add Hezbollah's military wing to its common terrorist list, but not the entire Hezbollah organization, seen as a compromise to avoid destabilizing Lebanon and reducing the EU's influence in the region. The EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, not the entire organization, in a compromise decision to avoid destabilizing Lebanon and maintain influence in the region. This move allows for continued dialogue with political parties in Lebanon and the delivery of assistance from the EU and its Member States. The EU's decision to include Hezbollah's military wing on its terrorist list was largely symbolic, sending a message that terrorist activities would endanger the organization's legitimacy as a political and social actor. This move allows for continued dialogue with political parties in Lebanon and the delivery of assistance from the EU and its Member States. The EU's decision to designate Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist organization was seen as symbolic, sending a message against terrorist activities. Analysts hoped this would lead to increased intelligence investigations in Europe, making it less attractive for Hezbollah. Critics argued that only listing the military wing was insufficient. Some experts hoped the EU designation would prompt intelligence investigations into Hezbollah's activities in Europe. Critics argued that listing only the military wing was inadequate as fundraising would still be allowed. The US had long urged the EU to include Hezbollah on its terrorist list, especially after Bulgaria implicated Hezbollah in a bombing. The US had long urged the EU to include Hezbollah on its terrorist list, especially after Bulgaria implicated Hezbollah in a bombing. Following the Burgas bombing, the Obama Administration called on Europe to take proactive action to disrupt Hezbollah's financing schemes and prevent future attacks. Individual Members and groups of Members in the House and Senate sent letters to EU officials urging the addition of Hezbollah to its terrorist list. In the aftermath of the Burgas bombing, US officials urged Europe to uncover Hezbollah's infrastructure and disrupt their financing schemes to prevent future attacks. Members of Congress sent letters to EU officials calling for Hezbollah to be designated as a terrorist organization. The Senate passed S.Res. 613 and the House passed H.Res. 834, both urging Europe to impose sanctions on Hezbollah. The US urged Europe to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization and impose sanctions. The EU decision to list Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist group was welcomed by the Obama Administration and Congress. Data privacy remains a key issue between the US and EU in sharing information to combat terrorism. The EU's decision to list Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist group was welcomed by the US Congress. Data privacy is a key issue in US-EU information sharing to combat terrorism. EU data privacy regulations emphasize the protection of personal data as a human right. The EU considers privacy of communications and protection of personal data as human rights. EU data privacy regulations set common rules for entities in the EU holding personal data and prohibit transfer to countries without adequate legal protections. Concerns have been raised in U.S.-EU information-sharing accords about the level of protection for European citizens' data. Members of European Parliament and civil liberty groups argue for stronger data protection measures. Some EU officials are concerned about the level of protection for European citizens' personal data in U.S.-EU information-sharing accords. Members of the European Parliament and civil liberty groups argue that these agreements violate privacy rights due to U.S. surveillance programs and collection activities in Europe. The unauthorized disclosures of U.S. surveillance programs in Europe have raised concerns about privacy rights of EU citizens and strained transatlantic trust. Analysts worry about the future of U.S.-EU information-sharing agreements, especially with the deep dismay of many MEPs. The unauthorized disclosures of U.S. surveillance programs in Europe have strained transatlantic trust and raised concerns about privacy rights of EU citizens. Analysts are increasingly worried about the future of U.S.-EU information-sharing agreements, especially with the European Parliament's history of opposing or demanding changes to such accords. The European Parliament has expressed serious concerns about U.S. surveillance programs and has established a special working group to investigate alleged collection activities. This has raised worries about the future of U.S.-EU information-sharing agreements. In July 2013, the European Parliament passed a resolution expressing concerns about U.S. surveillance programs and set up a special working group to investigate alleged collection activities. Chaired by Claude Moraes, the group criticized NSA's mass surveillance programs in the \"Moraes report\" adopted by the Parliament in March 2014. The European Parliament's working group, led by Claude Moraes, criticized NSA's mass surveillance programs in the \"Moraes report\" adopted in March 2014. The report raised concerns about U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements, including the PNR accord and calls to suspend the SWIFT agreement. It also urged timely conclusion of negotiations on the U.S.-EU Data Privacy agreement. The \"Moraes report\" criticized NSA's surveillance programs and raised concerns about U.S.-EU information-sharing agreements. It urged the conclusion of negotiations on the U.S.-EU Data Privacy Agreement and called for the recognition of privacy rights for EU citizens by the United States. The European Parliament urged the United States to revise its legislation to recognize the privacy rights of EU citizens and provide judicial remedies for violations. The Parliament's resolution on the \"Moraes report\" is not binding but carries political weight. The NSA programs prompted demands for EU data protection reforms to include privacy rights for EU citizens. The European Parliament demanded stronger data protection rules, including privacy rights for EU citizens, in response to reported NSA programs and U.S. spying activities. The Parliament reached a political agreement with EU member states on new data protection rules in December 2015, expected to be finalized in early 2016. The EU is working on new data protection rules with stronger safeguards for data transferred outside the EU, including to the United States. Some U.S. officials and business leaders are concerned about potential impacts on U.S.-European law enforcement cooperation and U.S. companies. U.S. officials have reassured EU leaders that U.S. surveillance activities comply with U.S. law and oversight. Some U.S. officials and business leaders are concerned about new data protection rules in the EU that could hinder U.S.-European law enforcement cooperation and burden U.S. companies. U.S. officials have tried to reassure EU leaders that U.S. surveillance activities are lawful and overseen by all branches of government. The U.S. is making efforts to address EU concerns and improve transparency to maintain European support for agreements like SWIFT and PNR. The United States has been working to address EU concerns about surveillance activities, including the establishment of a high-level U.S.-EU working group to discuss NSA surveillance operations. The European Commission issued a report on the findings of this working group in November 2013. The European Commission issued a report in November 2013 on the findings of a working group discussing NSA surveillance operations, including the PRISM program. U.S. and EU policymakers are considering implementing recommendations to address European concerns about data flows and restore transatlantic trust. In June 2014, then-U.S. Attorney General Holder announced efforts to conclude the DPPA. In June 2014, the U.S. Attorney General announced plans to work with Congress to provide EU citizens with the right to pursue redress in U.S. courts for law enforcement data privacy violations. The Judicial Redress Act was introduced in the 114th Congress for this purpose. In efforts to conclude the DPPA, the Obama Administration aimed to enact legislation allowing EU citizens to seek redress in U.S. courts for law enforcement data privacy violations. The Judicial Redress Act (H.R. 1428 and S. 1600) was passed in the 114th Congress and signed into law in February 2016. Controversy over Europe's involvement in the U.S. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program emerged in 2006. H.R. 1428 passed in February 2016, addressing EU citizens' redress in U.S. courts for data privacy violations. Controversy arose in 2006 over Europe's role in the U.S. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program. In 2006, U.S. authorities were granted secret access to SWIFT financial data for counterterrorism purposes. Despite assurances from U.S. officials, concerns remained in the EU about data protection standards. In 2007, a deal was reached to allow continued U.S. access to SWIFT data. In 2007, the United States and the EU reached a deal to allow continued U.S. access to SWIFT data for counterterrorism purposes. Changes to SWIFT's systems architecture in 2009 required a new U.S.-EU agreement for sharing data. In 2009, changes to SWIFT's systems architecture required a new U.S.-EU agreement for sharing data, with a large portion of data transferred to a storage location in Europe. The European Parliament rejected the new version of the U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement in February 2010. Under the EU's Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament rejected the new U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement in February 2010 due to concerns about data protection for EU citizens. This decision asserted the Parliament's new powers and halted U.S. access to much of the SWIFT data. In February 2010, the European Parliament rejected the new U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement due to concerns about data protection for EU citizens. Some MEPs opposed the accord, citing insufficient protections for personal data and privacy rights. Negotiations for a revised agreement began in May 2010 to address these concerns and gain Parliament support. In May 2010, negotiations started for a revised U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement to address concerns about data protection and privacy rights for EU citizens. Key concerns included guaranteeing judicial remedy for possible data abuse and the use of \"bulk data\" transfers, with some MEPs advocating for more targeted transfers. U.S. and EU officials argued that \"bulk\" transfers were necessary for technical reasons. In June 2010, U.S. and EU officials concluded a new draft SWIFT agreement addressing concerns about data protection and privacy rights for EU citizens. The draft allowed for administrative and legal redress for EU citizens in the United States and granted Europol authority over the SWIFT data. In June 2010, a new draft SWIFT agreement was concluded by U.S. and EU officials, addressing data protection and privacy rights for EU citizens. The draft included provisions for administrative and legal redress for EU citizens in the United States and granted Europol authority over SWIFT data. Some MEPs called for greater supervision by an \"appropriate EU-appointed authority\" over U.S. access to SWIFT data. Despite initial dissatisfaction with the draft's provisions, EU and U.S. officials agreed to two additional changes to avoid a \"no\" vote by the Parliament. In June 2010, a new draft SWIFT agreement was concluded by U.S. and EU officials, addressing data protection and privacy rights for EU citizens. The draft granted Europol authority over SWIFT data and included provisions for administrative and legal redress for EU citizens in the United States. Some MEPs were still unhappy with certain provisions, leading to two additional changes being made to the draft to avoid a \"no\" vote by the Parliament. These changes included the appointment of an independent observer in Washington, DC, to oversee the extraction of SWIFT data and the requirement for the European Commission to present plans for a European equivalent to the U.S. TFTP within a year. The final iteration of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord was approved by the European Parliament on July 8, 2010, with key changes including the appointment of an independent observer in Washington, DC, and the requirement for the European Commission to present plans for a European equivalent to the U.S. TFTP within a year. The European Parliament approved the final U.S.-EU SWIFT accord on July 8, 2010, allowing for a \"European TFTP\" to extract SWIFT data on European soil and send targeted results to the U.S. The agreement entered into force on August 1, 2010, for a five-year period, with automatic extensions unless notified otherwise. The U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement was approved by the European Parliament by 484 votes to 109, entering into force on August 1, 2010 for a five-year period. Concerns were raised about the EU's role in the U.S. TFTP and the implementation of the SWIFT accord, with criticism towards Europol for approving vague U.S. requests for SWIFT data. The European Commission recommended certain measures in a review of the agreement released in March 2011. Despite the EU's approval of the U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement in 2010, MEPs expressed concerns about the implementation and transparency of the agreement. Criticisms were directed at Europol for approving vague U.S. requests for SWIFT data. The European Commission recommended measures to improve transparency, including providing more information to Europol in writing. A second review in December 2012 found that the TFTP had been beneficial in combating terrorism. The European Commission recommended measures to enhance transparency in the TFTP, including providing more information to Europol in writing. A second review in December 2012 confirmed the TFTP's effectiveness in combating terrorism, despite renewed concerns in the European Parliament due to unauthorized disclosures of U.S. surveillance activities in Europe since June 2013. The European Parliament expressed renewed concerns about U.S. surveillance activities in Europe, especially regarding the handling of personal data of EU citizens, following unauthorized disclosures since June 2013. This was prompted by reports of NSA monitoring of German Chancellor Merkel's phone and alleged collection operations in other EU countries. The European Parliament passed resolutions in 2013 and 2014 calling for the suspension of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord due to concerns about U.S. surveillance activities in Europe. The European Parliament passed resolutions in 2013 and 2014 calling for the immediate suspension of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord due to concerns about U.S. surveillance activities in Europe. However, actually suspending the SWIFT accord would require action from the European Commission and member states, which they are not inclined to do. Reviews of the SWIFT data in late 2013 and mid-2014 showed that it has been valuable in generating leads for European intelligence services and investigating terrorist threats. The European Parliament called for the suspension of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord due to surveillance concerns, but action would require the Commission and member states. Reviews show SWIFT data has been valuable in generating leads for European intelligence services in investigating terrorist threats. The United States and EU reached an agreement in May 2004 allowing airlines to provide passenger data to U.S. authorities within 15 minutes of a flight's departure. This agreement raised privacy concerns in Europe and led to a case lodged by the European Parliament. In May 2004, the United States and EU agreed on airlines sharing passenger data for flights departing to comply with U.S. laws. This raised privacy concerns in Europe, leading to a case against the agreement. In May 2006, the EU Court of Justice annulled the PNR accord due to legal basis issues. In July 2007, a new seven-year agreement was reached between the United States and the EU. In May 2006, the EU Court of Justice annulled the PNR agreement due to legal basis issues. In July 2007, a new seven-year agreement was reached between the United States and the EU, allowing for the continued transfer of PNR data with additional provisions. Negotiations for a new seven-year agreement on the transfer of PNR data between the United States and the EU included provisions for sharing data with other U.S. agencies, extending data storage time to 15 years, accessing sensitive passenger information, and requiring airlines to send data 72 hours before a flight. The new U.S.-EU PNR agreement allowed states to store data for up to 15 years and permitted access to sensitive passenger information. Airlines were required to send data to U.S. authorities 72 hours before a flight, with a reduction in the number of data fields collected. The European Parliament needed to approve the agreement for it to remain in force, but many MEPs objected to key elements. The 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement was provisionally in force but required approval from the European Parliament. Many MEPs objected to key elements such as the amount of data transferred, data retention period, and lack of redress for European citizens. Concerns were raised about potential data mining and profiling by U.S. authorities. In 2010, the European Parliament postponed its vote on the 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement due to concerns about data transfer, retention period, and lack of redress for citizens. Some MEPs feared potential data mining and profiling by U.S. authorities. The Parliament called for a \"global external PNR strategy\" from the European Commission instead. In May 2010, the European Parliament postponed its vote on the 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement, citing legal uncertainties and practical difficulties for travelers and air carriers. The Parliament called for a \"global external PNR strategy\" from the European Commission, which was issued in September 2010, urging the renegotiation of PNR agreements with the United States, Australia, and Canada. The European Commission issued a \"global external PNR strategy\" in September 2010, calling for the renegotiation of EU PNR agreements with the United States, Australia, and Canada. The strategy emphasized using PNR data for combating terrorism and serious crimes, providing clear information to passengers, and ensuring their right to redress. The European Commission's PNR strategy emphasized using passenger data for combating terrorism and serious crimes, providing clear information to passengers, ensuring their right to redress, limiting data exchange categories, and retaining data for the shortest time necessary. The European Parliament endorsed the strategy and supported new PNR negotiations with the United States. The European Commission's PNR strategy emphasized limited and necessary exchange of PNR data, with retention only for essential purposes. The European Parliament endorsed the strategy and supported new PNR negotiations with the United States, emphasizing the need for data exchange to be necessary and proportional, and not used for data mining or profiling. The European Parliament supported new PNR negotiations with the United States, emphasizing the need for data exchange to be necessary and proportional. The Obama Administration agreed to discuss adjustments to the PNR accord in recognition of the EP's concerns. U.S.-EU negotiations on a revised PNR accord began in December 2010. The Obama Administration agreed to reopen negotiations on the PNR accord with the EU in recognition of concerns raised by the European Parliament. U.S. officials maintained that the 2007 accord protected data and privacy rights, with two joint reviews confirming no misuse of PNR data. Discussions on a revised PNR accord began in December 2010, emphasizing the need to maintain operational effectiveness. The U.S. officials emphasized the importance of protecting data and privacy rights in the 2007 PNR accord with the EU. They insisted that any new agreement should not compromise operational effectiveness or invalidate existing bilateral deals with EU member states. Resolutions in the House and Senate in mid-May 2011 supported the existing PNR program. In mid-May 2011, resolutions were introduced in the House and Senate supporting the existing 2007 U.S.-EU PNR accord and urging DHS to reject any EU efforts to modify the agreement. In late May 2011, the U.S. and European Commission concluded negotiations on a revised PNR agreement. In late May 2011, the United States and the European Commission concluded negotiations on a revised PNR agreement, introducing new provisions to enhance passenger data protection. The May 2011 agreement between the United States and the European Commission introduced new provisions to enhance passenger data protection, including depersonalizing and masking portions of a passenger's record after six months, decreasing the storage time of PNR data, and restricting access to authorized personnel. The draft accord aimed to provide legal certainty and clarity on passenger rights to redress, ensuring that the United States would not deny boarding based solely on automated processing of PNR data. The draft accord between the United States and the European Commission aimed to enhance passenger data protection by restricting access to authorized personnel and providing legal certainty on passenger rights to redress. Despite revisions to the U.S.-EU PNR agreement, some MEPs remained unsatisfied. The U.S.-EU PNR agreement was revised to address concerns about passenger data retention and transfer. Some MEPs were still unsatisfied with the accord, citing issues such as the retention of passenger data for up to 15 years and increased data transmission requirements for airlines. Some MEPs remained unsatisfied with the revised U.S.-EU PNR agreement in May 2011, as it still allowed the United States to retain passenger data for up to 15 years, increased data transmission requirements for airlines, and broadened the use of PNR data for more criminal offenses. The U.S.-EU PNR agreement was revised in May 2011, extending the advance data transmission period to 96 hours before a flight. Some MEPs expressed concerns about the expanded use of PNR data for criminal offenses. In October 2011, a hearing highlighted the negotiations on the agreement, with U.S. officials stating that the new draft was stronger and addressed EU concerns. In May 2011, the U.S.-EU PNR agreement was revised, extending data transmission to 96 hours before a flight. U.S. officials testified that the new draft addressed EU concerns on data security, offenses covered, and passenger rights. Negotiations continued to further revise the agreement, leading to a new draft in November 2011. In November 2011, a new draft PNR agreement was concluded between the United States and the EU, addressing concerns raised by the EU regarding data security, offenses covered, and passenger rights. The European Commission stated that the new draft contained \"real improvements\" compared to the previous version leaked in May. The agreement limited the use of PNR data to terrorist or serious transnational crimes with a minimum prison sentence of three years.

The European Commission asserted that the agreement contained \"real improvements\" over the leaked May version. Changes included limiting PNR data use to terrorist or serious transnational crimes with a minimum three-year prison sentence and varying retention time based on the type of crime. EU member states approved the new agreement in December 2011, with Germany and Austria abstaining. In December 2011, EU member states approved the new U.S.-EU PNR agreement, with Germany and Austria abstaining due to concerns about data retention and redress provisions. Some MEPs criticized the changes as cosmetic and argued for rejection, while others supported the agreement based on European Commission arguments. Some MEPs criticized the new U.S.-EU PNR agreement, viewing data retention and redress provisions as insufficient. Others supported the accord, citing stronger data protection guarantees compared to the 2007 version. Despite concerns, some MEPs favored the agreement for providing legal certainty to airlines. The 2011 U.S.-EU PNR agreement was approved by the full Parliament on April 19, 2012, with 409 votes in favor, 226 against, and 33 abstentions. The Commission argued that the accord offered stronger data protection guarantees than the 2007 version, and some MEPs supported it despite concerns about data privacy safeguards, as they believed it was better to have an agreement providing legal certainty to airlines.

The European Commission proposed a draft mandate for negotiating an overarching data protection accord to bridge U.S.-EU differences in privacy rights for data-sharing agreements in the fight against terrorism and crime. The European Commission proposed a draft mandate for negotiating an overarching data protection accord to bridge U.S.-EU differences in privacy rights for data-sharing agreements in the fight against terrorism and crime. EU member states approved the Commission's mandate in early December 2010, leading to negotiations on a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) between the United States and the EU in March 2011. This agreement aimed to ensure high standards of data protection for personal information exchanged in a law enforcement context. EU member states approved the Commission's mandate in early December 2010 for negotiations on an \"umbrella\" Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) between the United States and the EU in March 2011. U.S. officials aimed for mutual recognition of data protection systems to protect citizens' privacy and civil liberties effectively. The U.S.-EU accord on data protection systems aims for mutual recognition to protect citizens' privacy and civil liberties effectively. Negotiations are progressing towards an EU finding of \"adequacy\" for U.S. data protection standards. Negotiations for a Data Protection and Privacy Agreement (DPPA) between the U.S. and EU have made progress on key provisions like data security and transparency. However, unresolved issues include purpose limitation, retention times, and redress for European citizens in the U.S. Negotiations for a Data Protection and Privacy Agreement (DPPA) between the U.S. and EU have advanced on key provisions such as data security and transparency. However, unresolved issues include purpose limitation, retention times, and redress for European citizens in the U.S., particularly regarding judicial redress. The U.S. Privacy Act of 1974 was proposed to be amended to extend judicial redress to EU citizens, but successive U.S. Administrations argued that EU citizens could seek redress through other means. The DPPA negotiations were stalled due to the issue of judicial redress, exacerbated by revelations of U.S. surveillance activities since June 2013. The DPPA negotiations were stalled due to the issue of judicial redress, but revelations of U.S. surveillance activities since June 2013 injected renewed momentum into the discussions. The European Parliament called for the negotiations to resume without delay. In June 2013, U.S. surveillance activities reignited DPPA discussions. The European Parliament urged negotiations to resume promptly, emphasizing the need for judicial redress for EU citizens. Attorney General Holder expressed support for concluding the DPPA negotiations in June 2014. The European Parliament emphasized the need for judicial redress for EU citizens in DPPA negotiations. U.S. Attorney General Holder announced the Obama Administration's commitment to seeking legislation for EU citizens to seek judicial redress for privacy rights violations. The Obama Administration is committed to seeking legislation to ensure EU citizens have the same rights as U.S. citizens regarding personal information in the DPPA negotiations. This decision aims to restore EU trust in U.S. data privacy commitments. Observers suggested that the Obama Administration's decision to grant access or rectify errors in personal information aimed to restore EU trust in US data privacy commitments. U.S. and EU negotiators finalized the text of the DPPA on September 8, 2015, but the EU required U.S. judicial redress legislation before signing. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner and Representative John Conyers introduced H.R. 1428 to meet EU demands and facilitate the DPPA's conclusion. In 2015, U.S. and EU negotiators finalized the text of the DPPA, but the EU required U.S. judicial redress legislation before signing. To meet EU demands, Representatives introduced H.R. 1428 and S. 1600 to extend judicial redress provisions to citizens of covered countries. The Judicial Redress Act, introduced by Representative John Conyers and Senators Chris Murphy and Orrin Hatch, aims to extend privacy protections to citizens of covered countries or regional organizations like the EU. This legislation is crucial for the U.S. to sign the DPPA with the EU. The Judicial Redress Act aims to extend privacy protections to citizens of covered countries or regional organizations like the EU, in response to the invalidation of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement by the CJEU. The Judicial Redress Act was significant following the CJEU ruling invalidating the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement due to inadequate data protection and lack of judicial remedies for EU citizens in the U.S. The CJEU decision found Safe Harbor lacking in data protection for personal data, especially due to U.S. surveillance programs. The lack of judicial remedies for EU citizens in the U.S. was also highlighted. The Judicial Redress Act aimed to address European concerns about data transfers and strengthen confidence in the new Privacy Shield. The Judicial Redress Act aimed to address European concerns about data transfers and strengthen confidence in the new Privacy Shield, but its scope may not fully align with EU standards or ease worries about U.S. government access to personal data. The Judicial Redress Act, H.R. 1428, passed the House on October 20, 2015, and was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 28, 2016, with an amendment introduced by Senator John Cornyn.

The Judicial Redress Act, H.R. 1428, passed the House on October 20, 2015, and was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 28, 2016, with an amendment introduced by Senator John Cornyn. The Cornyn amendment added provisions restricting the Act's scope to citizens of countries that allow data transfer to the U.S. without hindering national security interests. The Judicial Redress Act, H.R. 1428, was signed into law on February 24, 2016, after passing the Senate and House. It includes provisions that only apply to citizens of countries allowing data transfer to the U.S. without impeding national security interests. This provision may have influenced the U.S.-EU provisional agreement on Privacy Shield. The U.S.-EU provisional agreement on Privacy Shield may have been influenced by the passage of the Judicial Redress Act, H.R. 1428, which was signed into law on February 24, 2016. The European Commission welcomed the act's enactment, stating that it will pave the way for the signature of the U.S.-EU Data Protection and Privacy Agreement (DPPA). The EU warmly welcomed the enactment of the Judicial Redress Act by President Obama, stating it will pave the way for the U.S.-EU Data Protection and Privacy Agreement (DPPA) signature. Approval from EU member states and the European Parliament is required for the DPPA to enter into force, a process that could take several months. The U.S. and EU have emphasized cooperation in border control and security, with agreements on information exchanges and biometric identifiers to enhance travel document security. EU member states and the European Parliament must approve the Data Protection and Privacy Agreement (DPPA) signed by President Obama, a process that could take several months. In the past decade, the United States and the EU have focused on cooperation in border control, aviation, and maritime security. They have signed agreements on information exchanges and biometric identifiers to improve travel document security. In 2010, they pledged to strengthen aviation security measures globally and played a key role in an ICAO declaration on aviation security. In January 2010, the United States and the EU intensified efforts to strengthen aviation security measures worldwide. In October 2010, U.S.-EU collaboration was crucial in forging an ICAO declaration on aviation security. They also worked together to enhance cargo and global supply chain security, reaffirming their commitment in June 2011. The United States and the EU have collaborated on aviation security, including improving cargo security and global supply chain security. They aim to find a balance between border security and facilitating transatlantic travel and commerce since the 2001 terrorist attacks. Measures have been implemented to enhance aviation security. Since the 2001 terrorist attacks, the United States and the EU have worked together to enhance aviation security. Recent incidents have reignited discussions on improving aviation and air cargo security, such as the 2009 airliner bombing attempt and the 2010 Yemen bomb plot. The U.S. and EU have been collaborating to enhance aviation security since 2001. Recent incidents, like the 2009 airliner bombing attempt and the 2010 Yemen bomb plot, have prompted discussions on improving security measures. In July 2014, U.S. authorities implemented stricter rules for carrying electronic devices onboard flights. The October 2010 \"Yemen bomb plot\" involved two printer cartridge packages with explosives shipped from Yemen to Chicago via cargo and passenger flights. In July 2014, U.S. authorities tightened rules for carrying electronic devices on international U.S.-bound flights due to concerns about terrorist threats. The collaboration between the U.S. and EU on aviation security has been ongoing since 2001. The recent ban on electronic devices on some international U.S.-bound flights, due to terrorism concerns, highlights the ongoing threat to aviation security. Collaboration between the U.S. and EU on aviation security has been in place since 2001, with efforts to align policies for transatlantic flights. In 2003, EU countries objected to new U.S. rules requiring armed air marshals on certain flights to and from the United States. U.S. officials pledged to consider alternative measures for European countries opposed to armed air marshals. In 2008, the United States and the EU reached an agreement on coordinating air cargo security measures. In 2008, the United States and the EU agreed to coordinate air cargo security measures, including ensuring 100% screening of cargo on passenger flights to comply with the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. The United States and the EU reached an agreement in June 2012 on an air cargo security partnership to recognize each other's air cargo security regimes, eliminating duplication of security controls and the need for different regimes based on cargo destination. This mutual recognition is aimed at enhancing cargo security. The United States and the EU have agreed on an air cargo security partnership to recognize each other's security regimes, eliminating duplication of controls and reducing costs for cargo operators. This mutual recognition aims to enhance cargo security and improve transatlantic shipments. Cargo security regimes will enhance security and save time and money for U.S. and European operators, improving transatlantic shipments. The agreement includes exchanging information on security regime evolution and implementation. EU operators can meet U.S. cargo screening requirements for passenger planes, promoting U.S.-EU cooperation. According to press reports, EU officials assert that a mutual recognition agreement will enable European operators to meet the U.S. requirement for 100% screening of cargo on passenger planes bound for the United States from abroad. Despite a shared commitment to promote U.S.-EU cooperation in aviation and air cargo security, some differences in perspective remain. The United States accelerated installation of body scanners at airports after the 2009 attack, encouraging the EU to do the same. Some EU countries and leaders supported installing body scanners at European airports, while others did not. In the aftermath of the 2009 attack, the United States pushed for body scanners at airports, urging the EU to do the same. Some EU countries and leaders supported the idea, while others had concerns about privacy and health risks. Despite differences, the European Parliament eventually backed the use of body scanners at EU airports with privacy safeguards. In July 2011, the European Parliament approved the use of body scanners at EU airports with privacy safeguards, including producing stick figure images only, banning x-ray scans, and making the use of scanners voluntary for passengers. The European Parliament recommended privacy safeguards for body scanners at EU airports, including producing stick figure images only, banning x-ray scans, and making their use voluntary for passengers. In November 2011, the European Commission adopted these conditions as common standards, but member states are not obligated to deploy such scanners. In November 2011, the European Commission adopted the EP's conditions for body scanners at EU airports, but member states are not required to use them. Some European officials have concerns about body scanners at U.S. airports due to privacy and health worries. However, in January 2013, the TSA announced the removal of full-body scanners that produce revealing images by June 2013. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) announced in January 2013 that full-body scanners producing revealing images would be removed from U.S. airports by June 2013. Scanners using millimeter wave technology, which produce more generic body images, will remain in use. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) announced in January 2013 that revealing body scanners would be removed from U.S. airports by June 2013. Concerns about privacy rights were raised by Members of Congress and EU officials, while U.S. officials were worried about changes to EU regulations on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage following a 2006 plot to use liquid explosives on transatlantic flights. The European Parliament and U.S. officials had concerns about revealing body scanners violating privacy rights and changes to EU regulations on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage after a 2006 plot using liquid explosives on transatlantic flights. The U.S. worked with the EU to harmonize permitted travel-sized liquids and gels to minimize inconvenience to travelers. The United States and the EU implemented restrictions on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage after a 2006 plot to blow up transatlantic flights. Efforts were made to harmonize permitted travel-sized liquids and gels to minimize inconvenience to travelers. The EU planned to eliminate liquid restrictions by April 2013, but U.S. policymakers raised concerns about the effectiveness of current screening technology. The EU planned to eliminate restrictions on liquids in cabin baggage by April 2013, but concerns were raised by U.S. policymakers and segments of the airline industry about the effectiveness of current liquid-screening technology and potential flight delays. As a result, the EU postponed the deadline for introducing liquid screening equipment and removing all restrictions on liquids and gels in carry-on. The EU postponed the 2013 deadline to ease liquid and gel restrictions in cabin baggage due to concerns about airline security and potential flight delays. In January 2014, duty-free liquids and gels were allowed in cabin baggage as a first phase, with the goal of lifting all restrictions by January 2016. The EU lifted restrictions on duty-free liquids and gels in cabin baggage in January 2014 as a first phase towards ending all restrictions by January 2016. In April 2004, the US and EU signed a customs cooperation accord, including extending the US Container Security Initiative throughout the EU to screen maritime cargo for dangerous substances. The United States and the European Union signed a customs cooperation accord to extend the U.S. Container Security Initiative (CSI) throughout the EU. This initiative involves U.S. customs officers stationed in foreign ports to pre-screen U.S.-bound maritime cargo containers for dangerous substances. The agreement also includes mutual recognition of trusted shipper programs to enhance supply chain security and trade opportunities. The United States and the European Union signed a customs cooperation accord to extend the U.S. Container Security Initiative (CSI) throughout the EU. Ten EU member states currently participate in CSI, involving pre-screening U.S.-bound maritime cargo containers for dangerous substances. In May 2012, the U.S. and EU agreed to recognize each other's trusted shipper programs to speed up customs procedures for trusted traders. This mutual recognition accord aims to lower costs, simplify procedures, and allow customs authorities to concentrate on security. The U.S. and EU signed a customs cooperation accord to extend the U.S. Container Security Initiative throughout the EU, aiming to simplify procedures for trusted traders and enhance security measures. This agreement benefits around 15,000 U.S. and European companies designated as \"trusted traders\" by C-TPAT or AEO programs, allowing customs authorities to focus on risky consignments and facilitate legitimate transatlantic trade. The U.S. and EU signed a customs cooperation accord to extend the U.S. Container Security Initiative throughout the EU, benefiting trusted traders by simplifying procedures and enhancing security measures. Recent tensions over the 100% container scanning provision in the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 have receded, as EU officials and U.S. policymakers shared concerns about the cost and effectiveness of the scanning requirement. EU and US officials shared concerns about the cost and effectiveness of 100% container scanning for nuclear devices bound for the United States. Both sides argued that it could disrupt trade, place a heavy financial burden on ports and businesses, and result in lower profits and higher transportation costs for importers. The US already had programs in place to identify high-risk cargo shipments for further inspection. In May 2012, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security extended the 100% scanning deadline by two years, citing concerns about lower profits and higher transportation costs for importers. Proponents argue that current manifest data is not sufficient for determining risk. In June 2014, DHS announced a two-year extension to the 100% scanning deadline. Proponents argue that manifest data is not adequate for determining risk. The U.S. Visa Waiver Program and EU tensions over its application to all member states have periodically arisen. The U.S. Visa Waiver Program (VWP) has caused tensions between the U.S. and EU over equal application to all member states. The VWP allows visa-free travel to the U.S. for citizens of 38 countries, mostly in Europe. New EU members wanted to join but faced exclusion due to not meeting requirements. The EU pushed for full visa reciprocity between the U.S. and EU. After the EU enlargement in 2004, new members were eager to join the VWP, but faced exclusion for years due to not meeting requirements. The EU argued for full visa reciprocity with the U.S., citing visa-free privileges enjoyed by U.S. citizens in all EU member states. Some Members of Congress supported extending the VWP to new EU members, especially those in central and eastern Europe, while others were skeptical post-9/11 due to security concerns. Some Members of Congress supported extending the VWP to new EU members, especially those in central and eastern Europe, due to their roles as U.S. allies in NATO and the fight against terrorism. However, others were skeptical post-9/11 because of security concerns. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 made changes to the VWP to strengthen security components and allow more EU members to participate. In 2007, changes were made to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) under the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53) to strengthen security measures and expand eligibility to more EU members. Participants were required to meet security and passport standards, sign information-sharing agreements, and submit biographical information to U.S. authorities. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) was modified in 2007 under P.L. 110-53 to enhance security measures and allow more EU members to qualify. Participants had to meet security standards, sign information-sharing agreements, and submit biographical information through ESTA. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security could waive admission requirements, enabling new EU member states to join. Currently, 23 out of the EU's 28 member states are part of the VWP. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) was modified in 2007 under P.L. 110-53 to enhance security measures and allow more EU members to qualify. Currently, 23 out of the EU's 28 member states belong to the VWP, with the EU urging the U.S. to admit the remaining five members as soon as possible. In January 2014, a revised EU reciprocity mechanism aimed to achieve full visa reciprocity with the United States. The EU continues to push for the admission of the remaining five EU members (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Poland, and Romania) to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). In January 2014, a new EU reciprocity mechanism was implemented to achieve full visa reciprocity with the United States and other countries. The European Commission now has the authority to suspend visa-free travel for a third country's citizens if full visa reciprocity is not met. The EU implemented a new reciprocity mechanism in January 2014 to achieve visa reciprocity with the United States and other countries. The European Commission can suspend visa-free travel for a third country's citizens if full reciprocity is not met. The Commission is actively assessing the situation with the US and other countries every six months. The European Commission has not yet suspended visa-free travel under the new reciprocity mechanism with the US and other countries. The VWP allows Europeans to easily return home and enter the US without a visa, causing concern about Europeans fighting in Syria and Iraq. The Obama Administration supports the VWP for transatlantic commerce and tourism. Many are alarmed by reports of Europeans fighting in Syria and Iraq, as they can easily return to their home countries and enter the United States without a visa. The Obama Administration supports the VWP for transatlantic commerce and tourism, but has implemented enhanced security measures for VWP travelers, including additional biographic information submission and new screening requirements. In November 2015, the Obama Administration announced additional changes to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) in response to heightened security concerns following the Paris attacks. The changes included enhanced security measures for VWP travelers, such as submitting additional biographic information through ESTA and new screening requirements. The Obama Administration announced changes to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) in response to security concerns after the Paris attacks. The changes included enhanced screening measures for VWP visitors, such as capturing past travel to terrorist safe havens in ESTA and reporting deficient cooperation from VWP countries to the President within 60 days. The Obama Administration announced changes to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to strengthen security controls, including capturing past travel to terrorist safe havens in ESTA and reporting deficient cooperation from VWP countries to the President within 60 days. Congress passed legislation in December 2015 to improve the VWP. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) was enhanced by legislation in December 2015 to improve security measures. The new legislation prohibits certain individuals from entering the United States under the VWP if they have traveled to specific countries after March 1, 2011. The 2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act further enhanced the security of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) by prohibiting individuals who have traveled to Syria, Iraq, Iran, or Sudan after March 1, 2011, from entering the United States under the VWP. These individuals must now obtain a visitor visa at a U.S. consulate abroad. Additionally, all VWP participant countries must issue electronic passports and implement screening protocols and information-sharing arrangements. The 2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act tightened security for the Visa Waiver Program by banning travel to Syria, Iraq, Iran, or Sudan after March 1, 2011. Travelers from these countries must now obtain a visitor visa at a U.S. consulate. The legislation also requires VWP countries to issue electronic passports and implement screening protocols. Additionally, DHS expanded travel restrictions to individuals who visited Libya, Somalia, and Yemen since March 1, 2011, but dual nationals are exempt for now. The 2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act tightened security for the Visa Waiver Program by banning travel to Syria, Iraq, Iran, or Sudan after March 1, 2011. DHS expanded travel restrictions to individuals who visited Libya, Somalia, and Yemen since March 1, 2011, but dual nationals are exempt for now. EU officials are concerned about the new VWP requirements, arguing they could create a de facto visa regime and discriminate against dual nationals. EU officials are troubled by the new Visa Waiver Program requirements, arguing they could create a de facto visa regime and discriminate against dual nationals. European policymakers question the effectiveness of the legislation, stating it may impact legitimate travelers but not detect those joining terrorist groups. U.S. officials note exemptions for government and military personnel and grant authority to the Secretary of DHS. The new Visa Waiver Program requirements may affect European citizens traveling for legitimate reasons but may not detect those joining terrorist groups. Exemptions are provided for government and military personnel, with the Secretary of DHS having authority to waive exclusion on a case-by-case basis. EU leaders have warned of possible reciprocal measures. The new Visa Waiver Program legislation allows the Secretary of DHS to waive exclusion for certain individuals, such as journalists and humanitarian workers. EU leaders have raised concerns about potential reciprocal measures, while some Members of Congress worry about discrimination based on ethnicity. Representative Justin Amash introduced the \"Equal Protection in Travel Act\" on January 13, 2016. Several Members of Congress have expressed concerns about potential discrimination based on ethnicity in the new Visa Waiver Program legislation. Representative Justin Amash introduced the \"Equal Protection in Travel Act 2016\" to eliminate VWP restrictions on dual nationals, with a companion measure introduced by Senator Jeff Flake. These changes could potentially prevent the EU from imposing reciprocal visa requirements on U.S. citizens traveling to Europe. The \"Equal Protection in Travel Act 2016\" aims to remove VWP restrictions on dual nationals, potentially preventing the EU from imposing reciprocal visa requirements on U.S. citizens traveling to Europe. U.S. and European officials emphasize the importance of balancing freedom and security without compromising civil liberties and human rights standards. The treatment of suspected terrorist detainees remains a contentious issue. The status and treatment of suspected terrorist detainees has been a point of tension between the U.S. and Europe, with criticism directed at U.S. policies such as the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, military commissions for enemy combatants, and the use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques.\" The U.S.-European tension over terrorist detainees, particularly during the George W. Bush Administration, involved criticism of U.S. policies like Guant\u00e1namo Bay, military commissions, and \"enhanced interrogation techniques.\" European media also focused on \"extraordinary rendition\" and possible CIA detention facilities in Europe, leading to investigations by European institutions. The U.S. practice of \"extraordinary rendition\" and CIA detention facilities in Europe sparked investigations by European institutions. European leaders criticized U.S. terrorist detainee policies as breaching international and European law. Many European leaders and analysts criticized the U.S. detainee and interrogation policies at Guant\u00e1namo and through extraordinary rendition as violating international and European law, degrading human rights values, and hindering efforts to counter terrorism by winning Muslim \"hearts and minds.\" The Bush Administration defended these policies as crucial tools. Many European leaders and analysts criticized U.S. detainee and interrogation policies at Guant\u00e1namo and through extraordinary rendition for violating international law and degrading human rights values. The Bush Administration defended these policies as important tools in the fight against terrorism, denying allegations of human rights violations. They acknowledged European concerns about Guant\u00e1namo and sought agreements to transfer some detainees, but maintained that certain prisoners were too dangerous to release. The Bush Administration defended detainee and interrogation policies as crucial in fighting terrorism, denying human rights violations. They acknowledged European concerns about Guant\u00e1namo but maintained some prisoners were too dangerous to release. U.S.-EU tensions over detainee policies eased under the Obama Administration, with European officials welcoming plans to close Guant\u00e1namo. The Obama Administration's efforts to address U.S.-EU tensions over detainee policies included plans to close the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo, appointing a special envoy to persuade countries to accept cleared detainees. EU officials welcomed Obama's executive order banning torture and his review of Bush Administration legal opinions on detention and interrogation methods. In March 2009, the U.S. State Department appointed a special envoy to work on closing the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo, focusing on persuading countries to accept detainees cleared for release. Some EU members accepted released detainees, while others declined. The Obama Administration faced challenges in closing Guant\u00e1namo despite efforts. The Obama Administration has faced challenges in closing Guant\u00e1namo, with some EU members accepting released detainees while others declined. Congressional opposition and restrictions have hindered the Administration's efforts to transfer detainees to other countries. Some U.S. officials are frustrated by other countries, including some in Europe, not taking in more Guant\u00e1namo detainees. Congressional opposition and restrictions have prevented the Obama Administration from fulfilling its promise to close Guant\u00e1namo. In March 2011, President Obama signed an executive order allowing indefinite detention for detainees not charged. The Obama Administration has faced obstacles in closing Guant\u00e1namo due to concerns about released detainees engaging in terrorist activity. In March 2011, an executive order was signed allowing indefinite detention for detainees deemed too dangerous to release. The Administration also lifted a freeze on new military commission trials for Guant\u00e1namo detainees, causing worry among European policymakers about the facility serving as a recruiting tool for terrorist groups. The Obama Administration faced obstacles in closing Guant\u00e1namo due to concerns about released detainees engaging in terrorist activity. In March 2011, an executive order allowed indefinite detention for those deemed too dangerous to release. European policymakers worry that Guant\u00e1namo serves as a recruiting tool for terrorist groups. The European Parliament expressed concern for hunger-striking detainees and called for the facility's closure in May 2013. European officials have expressed concern about the well-being of detainees at Guant\u00e1namo, with the European Parliament adopting a resolution in May 2013 urging the United States to close the facility. The Obama Administration remains committed to shutting down Guant\u00e1namo, with Congress passing a measure in December 2013 easing restrictions on transferring low-risk detainees to other countries. President Obama renewed his pledge to work towards closing the facility in May 2013. In December 2013, Congress passed a measure easing restrictions on transferring low-risk detainees from Guant\u00e1namo to other countries. President Obama welcomed this step but urged Congress to lift other restrictions preventing transfers to U.S. prisons for trial. President Obama signed a bill into law as a step towards closing the Guant\u00e1namo detention facility, but urged Congress to lift remaining restrictions on transferring detainees to U.S. prisons for trial. Congress maintained restrictions in the FY2016 defense authorization bill but required the Administration to submit a plan for closure. Obama sent a proposal to Congress in February 2016, seeking their help in closing the facility before the end of his term in January 2017. In 2015, Congress maintained restrictions on bringing Guant\u00e1namo detainees to the US but required a plan for closing the facility. President Obama sent a proposal to Congress in February 2016 to shutter Guant\u00e1namo before the end of his term. As of February 2016, 91 detainees remain at Guant\u00e1namo, with 35 cleared for transfer. During Obama's term, 147 Guant\u00e1namo detainees were resettled overseas, while 91 remain as of February 2016. European concerns persist over the role of EU member states in U.S. detainee policies. The European Parliament has investigated hosting CIA detention facilities and aiding CIA flights for terrorism rendition. The European Parliament has raised concerns about the past involvement of EU member states in U.S. detainee policies, particularly regarding hosting CIA detention facilities and aiding CIA flights for terrorism rendition. In 2006, a special committee was established to investigate these issues, and the Parliament has repeatedly called for full disclosure of relevant information. The European Parliament has urged EU member states to investigate CIA flights for terrorism rendition and disclose relevant information. In 2015, a resolution directed committees to resume investigations into alleged CIA transportation and illegal detention of terrorist suspects in EU countries. The European Parliament has urged EU member states to investigate CIA flights for terrorism rendition and disclose relevant information. A resolution directed committees to resume investigations into alleged CIA transportation and illegal detention of terrorist suspects in EU countries following the release of a U.S. Senate report on CIA programs. The resolution also called for the U.S. to investigate and prosecute human rights violations related to the CIA programs and cooperate with EU countries on requests for information, extradition, or remedies for victims. U.S. and European officials are concerned about allegations of U.S. wrongdoing and rendition-related issues. The European Parliament resolution urges EU member states to investigate CIA flights for terrorism rendition and disclose relevant information. It also calls on the United States to investigate and prosecute human rights violations related to CIA programs and cooperate with EU countries on requests for information, extradition, or remedies for victims. Concerns exist about allegations of U.S. wrongdoing and rendition-related issues potentially impacting U.S.-European intelligence cooperation against terrorism. The European Parliament resolution urges EU member states to investigate CIA flights for terrorism rendition and disclose relevant information. Concerns about allegations of U.S. wrongdoing and rendition-related criminal proceedings against CIA officers in some EU states continue to cast a long shadow and could jeopardize U.S.-European intelligence cooperation against terrorism. Successive U.S. Administrations have supported efforts to enhance U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism since the 2001 attacks on the United States. The George W. Bush Administration prioritized U.S.-EU cooperation on police and judicial matters to enhance border controls and prevent suspected terrorists from entering the United States or finding sanctuary in Europe. The George W. Bush Administration prioritized U.S.-EU cooperation on police and judicial matters to enhance border controls and prevent suspected terrorists from entering the United States or finding sanctuary in Europe. Improved cooperation on border controls and transport security was seen as crucial for tracking suspected terrorists and preventing their entry into the U.S. or Europe, despite challenges posed by differing competencies and policy preferences between the EU and the U.S. The U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation is complicated by differing competencies and policy preferences. Some policy areas relevant to counterterrorism fall under the EU's competence, leading to occasional tensions with the United States. Despite this, both parties prioritize cooperation on border controls and transport security to prevent suspected terrorists from entering the U.S. or Europe. The EU and the United States prioritize cooperation on counterterrorism, law enforcement, border controls, and transport security. Despite occasional tensions, both parties are committed to fostering closer cooperation in these areas. The U.S. prefers bilateral negotiations on some issues, which can lead to frictions in the U.S.-EU relationship. The United States and the EU prioritize cooperation in counterterrorism, law enforcement, border controls, and transport security. Both parties are committed to fostering closer cooperation in these areas, with a focus on combating potential threats posed by European and American citizens fighting with Islamist groups. Aviation and cargo security, U.S. border control measures, and visa policy are key issues for Congress that could impact future U.S.-EU cooperation. The 113th and 114th Congresses have held hearings on the threats posed by Western foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq. Congress passed the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 to enhance security controls in response to these growing threats. In response to concerns about Western foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq, Congress passed the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 to strengthen security controls. Congressional decisions on intelligence reforms and data privacy could impact U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation. The U.S. has implemented security controls in response to concerns about European citizens joining terrorist groups. Congressional decisions on intelligence reforms and data privacy could affect U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation. EU officials view the U.S. Judicial Redress Act positively for enhancing trust. Possible changes to U.S. surveillance laws are closely monitored in Europe. EU officials welcome the U.S. Judicial Redress Act as a positive step towards the U.S.-EU Data Privacy Agreement. The Act is seen as a goodwill gesture to rebuild trust in transatlantic data sharing. The European Parliament's influence in counterterrorism and international agreements may impact future U.S.-EU relations. The European Parliament's influence in counterterrorism and international agreements may impact future U.S.-EU relations. Members of Congress can help shape Parliament's views on U.S. surveillance operations and data privacy rights. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner testified in November 2013 on these issues. Members of Congress may influence Parliament's views on U.S. surveillance operations and data privacy rights. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner testified before the European Parliament in November 2013 on potential changes to U.S. surveillance legislation. Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Mike Rogers also engaged in dialogue on balanced efforts to protect nations. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner testified before the European Parliament in late 2013, urging cooperation with the United States on surveillance practices. Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Mike Rogers led congressional delegations to Europe to discuss U.S. intelligence activities and reinforce U.S.-European relations. Some Members of Congress maintain contacts with European counterparts. Several Members of Congress, including Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Senator Chris Murphy, and Representative Mike Rogers, have visited Europe to discuss alleged U.S. intelligence activities and strengthen U.S.-European relations. The Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) facilitates discussions between members of the European Parliament and the U.S. House of Representatives on foreign policy and economic issues. There is a growing interest among lawmakers on both sides in enhancing ties. The Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) fosters discussions between members of the European Parliament and the U.S. House of Representatives twice a year to address foreign policy and economic issues. There is a growing interest among lawmakers on both sides to strengthen ties and cooperation further, providing opportunities to enhance transatlantic dialogue on counterterrorism issues."
