    "content": "The United States has historically had abundant natural resources, but increasing industrialization and population growth led to a growing dependence on foreign sources of energy in the 20th century. This dependence prompted federal efforts to increase energy independence and reduce domestic consumption. The United States relied on foreign sources of energy in the 20th century, prompting federal efforts to increase energy independence and reduce domestic consumption. This led to the establishment of programs focused on energy efficiency, conservation of resources, and research into renewable energy sources. Many of these programs have been in place for almost 40 years and have been redesigned multiple times. Since the 20th century, the United States has focused on reducing foreign energy dependence and domestic consumption through various energy efficiency and conservation programs. These programs have been continuously redesigned over almost 40 years to adapt to changing economic conditions and national interests, covering sectors from industry to academia and state/local governments to rural communities. Congress has periodically reauthorized and redesigned these programs since 2005 to address current needs and future challenges. Many energy programs have been periodically reauthorized and redesigned to meet changing economic conditions and national interests. They apply broadly to various sectors and have been designed to address current needs and future challenges. Congress has enacted several major energy laws since 2005. Since 2005, Congress has enacted major energy laws like EPACT 2005, EISA, EIEA, and ARRA, which established energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. DOE operates the most incentive programs in this area. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5) and other energy laws have established various federal programs for energy efficiency and renewable energy research and development. The Department of Energy (DOE) operates the majority of these programs, with other departments such as Treasury, Agriculture, Interior, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Veterans Affairs, and Small Business Administration also offering some programs. These programs provide grants, loans, and loan guarantees. The Department of the Treasury, Agriculture, Interior, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Veterans Affairs, and Small Business Administration operate federal programs providing grants, loans, and incentives for energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy RDD&D. Programs are grouped by administering agency with references to federal agency websites. Incentives are summarized and indexed in the appendixes. The federal programs provide grants, loans, loan guarantees, and incentives for energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy RDD&D. Programs are categorized by administering agency with references to federal agency websites. Incentives are summarized and indexed in the appendixes, compiled from various sources including authorizing statutes, U.S. Code, Administration budget request documents, DSIRE, Assistance Listings, and Energy Star website. The curr_chunk provides additional information on agriculture-related grant programs, budgetary figures, and sources for program descriptions and funding information. It references various sources such as authorizing statutes, the U.S. Code, Administration budget request documents, DSIRE, Assistance Listings, and the Energy Star website. For more details on energy provisions in the 2014 Farm Bill, readers are directed to CRS Report R43416 by [author name scrubbed]. The curr_chunk provides budgetary figures and sources for program descriptions and funding information related to agriculture grant programs and alternative fuels in transportation. It references various sources such as executive agency budget justifications, congressional committee reports, and CRS reports. For more details on specific programs, readers are directed to CRS Report R43416 and CRS Report R42566. For more information on programs supporting alternatives to conventional fuels and engines in transportation, refer to CRS Report R42566, Alternative Fuel and Advanced Vehicle Technology Incentives. Tax credits for biofuels and vehicles are covered in detail in the same report. Appendices provide additional details on federal renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives. The curr_chunk discusses various federal energy efficiency and renewable energy incentive programs, including Assisted Housing Stability and Energy Program, Clean Renewable Energy Bonds, Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants Program, and Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Technology Deployment. Expired Federal Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Incentive Programs include Assisted Housing Stability and Energy Program, Clean Renewable Energy Bonds, Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants Program, and more. The curr_chunk lists various expired federal energy efficiency and renewable energy incentive programs, including grants, rebates, tax credits, and competitive grants for worker training and placement in high growth industries."
