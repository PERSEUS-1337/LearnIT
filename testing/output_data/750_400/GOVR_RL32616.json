The report emphasized the need to exploit al Qaeda's travel vulnerabilities and watchlist known operatives among the 9/11 hijackers. The 9/11 Commission report identified missed opportunities to intercept the September 11 terrorists due to failures in exploiting al Qaeda's travel vulnerabilities. Key recommendations were issued to address these shortcomings. The 9/11 Commission report highlighted missed opportunities to intercept terrorists due to travel vulnerabilities, including fraudulent passports and false statements on visa applications. Recommendations were made to target terrorist travel as a powerful weapon and to combine intelligence, operations, and law enforcement to intercept terrorists and their facilitators. The 9/11 Commission issued recommendations related to immigration law and policy, emphasizing the importance of targeting terrorist travel and integrating border security into a larger screening network. The Department of Homeland Security was urged to quickly implement a biometric entry-exit system. The 9/11 Commission recommended targeting terrorist travel, integrating border security into a larger screening network, and implementing a biometric entry-exit system. Collaboration with other governments is essential to prevent terrorist entry. These recommendations have broad implications for immigration law and policy.
