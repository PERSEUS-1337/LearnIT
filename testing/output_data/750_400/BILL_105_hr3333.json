    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Policy Act of 1998\". The Congress finds that the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a major threat to national security since the end of the Cold War. The United Nations also recognizes the danger of weapons of mass destruction. The United Nations Security Council declared in 1992 that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is a threat to international peace and security. The establishment of the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq set a precedent in preventing proliferation. Aside from the 5 declared nuclear weapon states, other nations have or are pursuing nuclear weapons. The United Nations Security Council declared in 1992 that proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is a threat to international peace and security. The United Nations Special Commission on Iraq was established to prevent proliferation. Besides the 5 declared nuclear weapon states, other nations have or are pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities. Regional nuclear arms races could lead to the future use of nuclear weapons. Concerns have been raised about Russia's ability to track its nuclear materials and account for deteriorating conditions at nuclear weapons complex sites and bases. Belarus signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but concerns about Russia's nuclear weapons complex sites and bases raise the threat of nuclear proliferation. Russia's lack of ability to track its nuclear materials and weapons increases the risk of nuclear proliferation. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the 1990s. Iraq had a secret nuclear weapons program that went undetected by the IAEA. Iraq had a clandestine nuclear weapons program aided by dual-use exports from western countries. North Korea and the United States signed an agreement in October 1994 for the exchange of nuclear reactors and reprocessing equipment. In October 1994, North Korea and the United States signed an agreement to exchange North Korea's existing nuclear reactors and reprocessing equipment for modern light water reactor technology. North Korea's history of pursuing nuclear weapons capability raises concerns about nuclear proliferation. Brazil and Argentina also had substantial programs to build nuclear weapons. North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons raises concerns about proliferation, despite the agreement with the US for light water reactor technology. Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa renounced nuclear weapons programs and accepted IAEA safeguards. South Africa admitted developing 6 nuclear weapons but renounced them along with Brazil and Argentina, accepting IAEA safeguards and joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The United States supports the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. The United States supports various nuclear weapons free zones, including the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and the African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty, to prevent regional conflicts and arms races. The IAEA is seen as a valuable tool in countering proliferation efforts. The United States supports nuclear weapons free zones in Africa and the South Pacific to prevent regional conflicts and arms races. The IAEA's safeguard system may face challenges due to institutional and financial constraints. The United States supports immobilizing plutonium for energy and mixing it with low-enriched uranium for commercial nuclear reactors. Plutonium from dismantled warheads poses storage and disposal challenges and could be used for nuclear weapons if obtained by unauthorized parties. Plutonium from dismantled nuclear warheads poses challenges for storage and disposal, as it could be converted into fuel for nuclear weapons if in the wrong hands. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has been extended indefinitely, and further steps are needed to strengthen the international nonproliferation regime. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has been extended indefinitely, and steps should be taken to strengthen the international nonproliferation regime, as declared by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978. United States policy aims to establish more effective controls over the transfer of nuclear equipment, materials, and technology. The United States is committed to strong support for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and a strengthened IAEA. The goal is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons capability and adopt a comprehensive nonproliferation policy. The United States is committed to a comprehensive nuclear nonproliferation policy, supporting the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and a strengthened IAEA. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by reaching agreements with Russia on fissile materials control, ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and ending the production of new nuclear warheads. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty by the end of 1998, reaching agreements with Russia to end new nuclear warhead production, and negotiating to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals with Russia to 2,000-2,500 warheads each. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by negotiating multilateral agreements to significantly reduce nuclear arsenals of all countries through a stage-by-stage process. To reduce nuclear proliferation, the United States aims to negotiate enforceable multilateral agreements to continuously reduce nuclear arsenals worldwide. Additionally, an immediate agreement with Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty member states is sought to permanently halt the production of weapons-usable fissile materials and place existing stockpiles under international controls by January 1, 2008. The United States aims to negotiate agreements to reduce nuclear arsenals globally and halt the production of weapons-usable fissile materials by January 1, 2008. This includes placing existing stockpiles under international controls and requiring all countries to safeguard their nuclear facilities for peaceful purposes under IAEA oversight. Strengthening IAEA safeguards is also crucial for verifying compliance with nonproliferation commitments.

Strengthening IAEA safeguards is crucial for verifying compliance with nonproliferation commitments and enhancing nuclear export controls. The United States aims to negotiate agreements to reduce global nuclear arsenals and halt the production of weapons-usable fissile materials by January 1, 2008. This includes placing existing stockpiles under international controls and requiring all countries to safeguard their nuclear facilities for peaceful purposes under IAEA oversight. To implement necessary safeguard reforms, strengthen nuclear and dual-use export controls, impose sanctions on entities contributing to nuclear proliferation, provide public information on nuclear export licenses, ratify the IAEA's Strengthened Safeguards System program, and reduce incentives for countries to acquire nuclear weapons by reducing regional tensions and strengthening security agreements.
