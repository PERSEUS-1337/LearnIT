    "content": "The quality of instruction is crucial for student learning in elementary and secondary schools. Federal policy emphasizes the importance of good pre-service preparation for teachers to improve educational outcomes. Title II, Part A of the Higher Education Act of 1965 provides financial support and accountability measures to enhance teacher preparation programs. The Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) Title II-A includes financial support and accountability measures to improve teacher preparation programs. It consists of a competitive grant program for reforms in teacher preparation and reporting requirements for states to track program quality. The 115th Congress is considering reauthorization of the HEA. The 115th Congress is considering reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA) Title II-A, which includes a competitive grant program for teacher preparation reforms and reporting requirements for program quality. Bills have been introduced to either repeal or amend and extend Title II. The 115th Congress is considering reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA) Title II-A. One bill would repeal all provisions in Title II, while another bill would amend and extend Title II. The authorization of appropriations for Title II-A expired in FY2011 but has been funded through various appropriations legislation and continuing resolutions. The authorization of appropriations for Title II-A expired in FY2011 but has been funded through various legislation, including P.L. 115-245. Congressional action to reauthorize the HEA may continue going forward. This report describes current programs and provisions in Title II-A and highlights key issues. The report provides a description of current programs and provisions in Title II-A under P.L. 115-245, which funds the Department of Education. It discusses key issues for the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA) and the historical context of teacher preparation at institutions of higher education in the United States. The report discusses key issues for the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA) and the challenges posed by alternative teacher preparation programs to traditional approaches. Historically, teacher preparation in the US has mainly been at institutions of higher education, with federal support focused on programs in schools of education. The rise of alternative teacher preparation programs challenges traditional approaches supported by federal policy. Historically, teacher preparation in the US has been mainly at institutions of higher education, with a focus on programs in schools of education. Since the early 20th century, most U.S. teachers have been trained at programs operated by institutions of higher education (IHEs). Before that, normal schools prepared high school graduates to become teachers. The growth of teacher preparation programs at IHEs coincided with the professionalization of teacher educators and the formal split between pedagogy and subject-matter disciplines. The growth of teacher preparation programs at institutions of higher education coincided with the professionalization of teacher educators and the formal split between pedagogy and subject-matter disciplines. Recently, there has been a widening gap between training in teaching practices and acquiring subject-matter expertise. The importance of subject-area knowledge for teachers has been emphasized by English, science, and history departments. However, new leaders in teacher education stress the significance of pedagogy courses and passing related tests. The divide between teaching practice training and subject-matter expertise has widened due to alternative routes to teacher certification. These alternative approaches focus on candidates' prior knowledge of the subject they will teach and training for classroom instruction and management. The rise of alternative routes to teacher certification has expanded subject-matter expertise. These approaches focus on candidates' prior knowledge of the subject they will teach and training for classroom instruction. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 require annual reports on teacher preparation, with the most recent data from the 2012-2013 academic year. The Secretary's Tenth Annual Report, based on HEA Section 205(d), provides data for the 2012-2013 academic year. Subsequent years show that 2,106 teacher preparation providers offered 26,459 programs in 2015-2016, enrolling 441,439 teaching candidates across the U.S. and its territories. Data for the 2015-2016 academic year shows 2,106 teacher preparation providers offering 26,459 programs, enrolling 441,439 teaching candidates and producing 159,598 program completers. The Secretary's Tenth Annual Report provides detailed national statistics on teacher preparation. In the 2012-2013 academic year, 2,171 teacher preparation providers offered 26,589 programs, enrolling 499,800 teaching candidates and producing 192,459 program completers. Among these providers, 69% were traditional, 22% were alternative route providers based at IHEs, and 9% were alternative route providers not based at IHEs. In the 2012-2013 academic year, there were 2,171 teacher preparation providers offering 26,589 programs. These programs enrolled 499,800 teaching candidates and produced 192,459 completers. Among the providers, 69% were traditional, 22% were alternative route providers at IHEs, and 9% were alternative route providers not based at IHEs. In the 2012-2013 academic year, out of 26,589 teacher preparation programs, 70% were traditional, 20% were alternative route programs at IHEs, and 10% were alternative route programs not based at IHEs. Among the 499,800 teacher candidates, over 89% were in traditional programs, over 5% were in alternative route programs at IHEs, and nearly 6% were in alternative route programs not based at IHEs. Five states prepared 35% of the 192,849 completers. In the 2012-2013 academic year, 499,800 teacher candidates were enrolled in teacher preparation programs. 89% were in traditional programs, 5% in alternative route programs at IHEs, and 6% in alternative route programs not based at IHEs. Five states prepared 35% of the 192,849 completers, with Texas leading at 11%. In the 2012-2013 academic year, Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois were the top states for teacher preparation program completers. New York led in traditional program completions, while Texas led in alternative route completions. The Secretary's Tenth Annual report highlights key aspects of teacher preparation in the United States. New York led in traditional program completions, while Texas led in alternative route completions. Traditional programs require 100 hours of supervised clinical experience and 600 hours of student teaching, unlike alternative route programs. The Secretary's Tenth Annual report reveals key aspects of teacher preparation in the United States. Traditional programs require 100 hours of supervised clinical experience and 600 hours of student teaching, while alternative route programs do not have such requirements. The two largest traditional teacher preparation programs, Grand Canyon University and the University of Phoenix, enroll over 30,000 prospective teachers each, which is significantly more than the next 10 largest programs combined. The majority of enrollees in teacher preparation programs are white, non-Hispanic.

Title II-A of the HEA includes a competitive grant program and reporting/accountability provisions to improve teacher quality through the Teacher Quality Partnership program. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program under Title II-A of the HEA funds grants for teacher preparation to improve the quality of prospective and new teachers through enhanced training and professional development activities. It supports traditional teacher preparation programs and teacher residency programs, as well as provides additional funding for school leadership activities. The TQP program aims to enhance teacher preparation for prospective and new teachers through improved training and professional development activities. It supports traditional pre-baccalaureate or fifth-year programs, teacher residency programs, and provides extra funding for school leadership activities. Annual appropriations for the TQP program are around $42 million, supporting grants to about two dozen partnerships. The TQP program receives annual appropriations of about $42 million to support grants for partnerships. Among awarded projects, 30% are pre-baccalaureate/fifth year programs, 48% are residency programs, and 23% are a combination of both. In FY2016, four teacher preparation programs received TQP grants, while 24 grants were awarded in FY2014, 12 in FY2010, and 28 in FY2009. No awards were given between FY2011 and FY2013. Eligibility for a TQP award requires a partnership with a high-need local educational agency. In FY2016, four teacher preparation programs received TQP grants, with 24 grants awarded in FY2014, 12 in FY2010, and 28 in FY2009. Eligibility for a TQP award requires a partnership with a high-need local educational agency and specific institutions. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program requires a partnership between a high-need local educational agency, a higher education institution, and a school of education within the institution. Grantees must match 100% of the award amount with non-federal funds and coordinate activities with other federally funded programs. Grants support reforms in teacher preparation programs. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program requires grantees to match 100% of their award amount with non-federal funds and coordinate activities with other federally funded programs. Grants support a wide range of reforms in teacher preparation programs, including implementing curriculum changes and using research-based instructional practices. The reforms in teacher preparation programs may include implementing curriculum changes, using research-based instructional practices, providing high-quality clinical education with mentoring, creating induction programs for new teachers, and increasing compensation for qualified early childhood educators. The curr_chunk focuses on improving classroom instruction through research-based practices, developing high-quality pre-service clinical education with mentoring, creating induction programs for new teachers, increasing compensation for early childhood educators with degrees, providing professional development for teachers in high-need areas, recruiting qualified individuals into teaching through alternative routes, and strengthening literacy instruction skills for elementary teachers. The curr_chunk focuses on grants for teacher residency programs based on successful models to prepare teachers for high-need schools and subjects. Grant funds support rigorous programs for childhood educators with degrees, professional development for teachers in high-need areas, recruitment of qualified individuals into teaching, and strengthening literacy instruction skills for new teachers. Grants support teacher residency programs for new teachers in high-need schools. Programs offer rigorous coursework for a master's degree and teaching apprenticeships with mentor teachers. Graduates are placed in targeted schools as a cohort. Grants support teacher residency programs for new teachers in high-need schools, offering rigorous coursework for a master's degree, teaching apprenticeships with mentor teachers, and placement in targeted schools as a cohort. Programs must provide a living stipend or salary and require recipients to teach full time for at least three years in a high-need school and subject. Grants also aim to develop effective school leadership programs. Grants support teacher residency programs in high-need schools, providing living stipends and requiring recipients to teach full time for at least three years. Programs aim to develop effective school leadership programs for superintendents, principals, and other school leaders. Effective school leadership programs are essential for preparing individuals for careers as superintendents, principals, and other school leaders. These programs focus on promoting strong leadership skills, understanding teaching and assessment techniques, using data to evaluate instruction, managing resources effectively, engaging parents and community stakeholders, and enhancing student academic achievement. The curr_chunk discusses the skills needed for successful classroom instruction, using data to evaluate teaching, managing resources effectively, engaging parents and community stakeholders, and understanding student learning to improve academic achievement. Grant funds must be used for developing education programs, mentoring, induction, and recruiting school leaders. Title II of the HEA also includes provisions for holding teacher preparation programs accountable. The curr_chunk discusses the use of grant funds to develop education programs, mentoring, induction, and recruiting school leaders. Title II of the HEA includes provisions for holding teacher preparation programs accountable by requiring states and IHEs to report program performance data. States must report to receive HEA funds, and IHEs must report for students receiving federal assistance. The curr_chunk discusses accountability measures for teacher preparation programs, requiring states and IHEs to report program performance data to receive HEA funds. IHEs must issue report cards to the state and public, while states must issue report cards to ED and the public. ED uses state-reported information to issue an annual report on teacher qualifications and preparation in the United States. States must establish criteria to evaluate teacher preparation programs, report results for traditional and alternative route programs, and identify low-performing programs. In 2014, the most common criteria were derived from the Title II reporting system authorized in Section 205 of the HEA. Section 207 further requires states to identify programs at risk of being classified as low-performing. In 2014, states used indicators of teaching skill and pass rates on state credentialing assessments as common criteria to evaluate teacher preparation programs. Other less common criteria included improving student academic achievement and raising standards for entry into the teaching profession. In 2014, 12 states and Puerto Rico reported low-performing or at-risk teacher preparation programs, with criteria including teaching skill indicators and pass rates on state credentialing assessments. Other criteria used by states were improving student academic achievement, raising entry standards into the teaching profession, and increasing professional development opportunities. In 2014, 12 states and Puerto Rico identified low-performing or at-risk teacher preparation programs based on teaching skill indicators and pass rates on state credentialing assessments. This represented less than 3% of total programs reported. In 2014, 45 teacher preparation programs were classified as low-performing or at-risk, representing less than 3% of total programs. H.R. 4508, a bill to amend the HEA, including the repeal of Title II provisions, was ordered reported by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce on February 8, 2018. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce ordered reported the H.R. 4508 bill in 2018, which would amend the Higher Education Act (HEA) by repealing Title II provisions. Additionally, the Aim Higher Act (H.R. 6543) was introduced in July 2018 as a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill, retaining and amending current Title II provisions, including changes to the TQP program. The Aim Higher Act (H.R. 6543) introduced in July 2018 is a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill that includes amendments to current Title II provisions. These amendments involve changes to the TQP program, expansion of accountability provisions for institutions, and changes to accountability for states. The Aim Higher Act (H.R. 6543) introduced amendments to current Title II provisions, including changes to the TQP program, expansion of accountability provisions for institutions, and changes to accountability for states. This includes criteria for designation of low-performing and at-risk programs developed with stakeholders, and the requirement for states to submit report cards to receive funds under HEA and ESEA Title II. During the 115th Congress, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions held hearings on HEA reauthorization but has not introduced a bill amending Title II. President signed a resolution nullifying regulations issued in October 2016. During the 115th Congress, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions held hearings on HEA reauthorization. The President signed a resolution nullifying regulations issued in October 2016, which would have added clearer guidance on provider versus program, new post-program completion measures, and additional penalties for poor performance. Congress may consider legislation to reauthorize the HEA. The new regulations proposed in October 2016 for HEA reauthorization included clearer guidance on provider versus program, new post-program completion measures, and additional penalties for poor performance. Congress may consider legislation to reauthorize the HEA, addressing issues such as the federal government's role in supporting teacher preparation programs and the mix of authorized activities for TQP. The HEA reauthorization may include provisions in Title II, focusing on the federal government's role in supporting teacher preparation programs and the mix of authorized activities for TQP. Some argue for a broader federal role to enhance program quality beyond just supporting demonstration projects. Some argue for a broader federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs to enhance program quality beyond just demonstration projects. Some argue for a broader federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs to enhance program quality beyond just demonstration projects. There is debate over the optimal mix of activities currently supported under the TQP program, with differing views on the federal government's involvement in setting standards for teacher preparation. The debate over the optimal mix of activities supported under the TQP program includes differing views on the government's role in setting standards for teacher preparation. Supporters of traditional routes emphasize enhancements like supervised clinical practice and assessments, while advocates for alternative routes seek fewer restrictions on TQP partners and more emphasis on in-service supports like induction and mentoring for teachers. Some argue for expanding federal policy on teacher preparation program quality, citing low identification of low-performing programs and lack of accountability. They advocate for more in-service supports like induction and mentoring for teachers. Some argue for expanding federal policy on teacher preparation program quality, advocating for more accountability measures tied to student performance outcomes. Some states have not identified programs in this way. Advocates for greater accountability want program evaluations based on outcome measures linked to student performance, while others believe federal accountability requirements are unnecessary and burdensome."
