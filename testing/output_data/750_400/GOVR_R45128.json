The Agriculture appropriations bill, facilitated by new budget caps in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, passed through the House and Senate Committees. The final enacted Agriculture appropriation is $23.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than FY2017. The enacted Agriculture appropriation of $23.3 billion is $2.1 billion more than FY2017, including discretionary and mandatory spending. The Administration proposed $15.8 billion, the House-passed bill $20 billion, and the Senate-reported bill $20.53 billion. The enacted FY2018 Agriculture appropriation totals $146 billion, including discretionary and mandatory spending. The Trump Administration proposed $15.8 billion, the House-passed bill allocated $20 billion, and the Senate-reported bill allocated $20.53 billion.

The Agriculture appropriations bill funds USDA, excluding the U.S. Forest Service, and the FDA in the Department of Health and Human Services, totaling $146 billion. CFTC funding is included in even-numbered fiscal years. The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act funds USDA, excluding the U.S. Forest Service, and the FDA in the Department of Health and Human Services. CFTC funding is included in even-numbered fiscal years. Jurisdiction is with the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The bill includes mandatory and discretionary spending, with a focus on discretionary amounts. The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act focuses on discretionary spending controlled by annual appropriations acts. The bill's scope is overseen by the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The federal budget process distinguishes between discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts and receives more attention during the appropriations process. Mandatory spending, on the other hand, is controlled by budget rules during the authorization process. Entitlement programs' spending is set in laws such as the 2014 farm bill. In FY2018 Agriculture appropriations, discretionary appropriations were 16% ($23.3 billion) of the total, while mandatory spending comprised $123 billion, about 84% of the $146 billion total. Mandatory spending for entitlement programs is set in laws such as the 2014 farm bill. In FY2018 Agriculture appropriations, discretionary appropriations were 16% ($23.3 billion) of the total. Mandatory spending in the act comprised $123 billion, about 84% of the total. The largest discretionary spending items are for programs such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), rural development, agricultural research, FDA, foreign food aid, and trade. The 2014 farm bill allocated a significant amount to various programs, with the largest discretionary spending items including WIC, rural development, agricultural research, FDA, foreign food aid, farm assistance program salaries and loans, food safety inspection, conservation, and animal and plant health programs. Mandatory spending items consist of SNAP, child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and farm programs. The main mandatory spending items in the 2014 farm bill include SNAP, child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and farm commodity and conservation programs. SNAP is an \"appropriated entitlement\" that requires an annual appropriation, while the CCC operates on a line of credit. The Agriculture appropriations bill funds SNAP, crop insurance, and farm programs through the Commodity Credit Corporation. SNAP requires annual appropriation, while the CCC operates on a line of credit. Changes in the bill's discretionary limit have generally mirrored changes in appropriations, with some activities seeing relative increases or decreases. Agriculture appropriations peaked in FY2010 and declined through FY2013. The annual appropriation funds SNAP, crop insurance, and farm programs through the Commodity Credit Corporation. Changes in Agriculture appropriations have generally mirrored changes in the bill's discretionary limit. Agriculture appropriations peaked in FY2010, declined through FY2013, and have since increased. Comparisons to historical benchmarks may require adjustments for inflation and other factors. Since FY2010, Agriculture appropriations have fluctuated, with a peak in FY2010, a decline through FY2013, and subsequent increases. Comparisons to historical benchmarks may require adjustments for inflation and other factors. The discretionary spending authorized for each appropriations title since FY2008 is represented in Figure 3, with the total budget authority contained in Titles I-VI exceeding the official discretionary spending allocation due to budgetary offsets from negative amounts in Title VII general provisions and other adjustments. The Trump Administration released its FY2018 budget request in 2017 later than usual, proposing a 21% cut for USDA. The total budget authority in Titles I-VI exceeded the official discretionary spending allocation due to negative amounts in Title VII general provisions and other adjustments. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request proposed a 21% cut for USDA, including eliminating funding for some programs. The budget outline overlapped with Congress finishing FY2017 appropriations, with the explanatory statement reminding the Administration of Congress's role. The Trump Administration proposed a 21% cut for USDA in its FY2018 budget, including eliminating funding for some programs. Congress reminded the Administration of its authority to determine final funding levels for FY2018.
