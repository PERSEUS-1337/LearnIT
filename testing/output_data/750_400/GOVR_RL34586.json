    "content": "This report focuses on USAID's global health programs for child survival and maternal health from FY2001 to FY2008. It discusses how advancements in addressing malaria can improve maternal and child survival. UNICEF's report in 2008 celebrated the decline in annual deaths among children under five. In the UNICEF report The State of the World's Children 2008, Executive Director Ann Veneman highlighted the significant drop in annual deaths among children under five, with 9.7 million deaths in 2006, a 60% decrease since 1960. Despite this progress, Veneman emphasized that the daily number of child deaths under five, at 26,000, remains high. In 2006, an estimated 9.7 million children under five died, showing a 60% decrease since 1960. Despite this improvement, 26,000 children still die daily. Most child deaths occur before age five, with 90% happening during this time, and 37% in the neonatal period. Developing countries, especially in Africa, bear the brunt of child mortality, with neonatal infections and five infectious diseases causing 90% of deaths. Childhood deaths are most common before age five, with 90% occurring during this time and 37% in the neonatal period. Developing countries, particularly in Africa, experience the majority of child deaths, with about 4 million newborn deaths annually. Neonatal infections and five infectious diseases, including pneumonia and HIV/AIDS, are responsible for 90% of child deaths. Undernutrition is a significant factor in up to half of these deaths, highlighting the importance of monitoring maternal and child health for overall well-being. According to UNICEF, undernutrition is a major factor in child deaths, with acute respiratory infections, diarrhea, malaria, measles, and HIV/AIDS also contributing. Monitoring maternal and child health is crucial as their mortality rates reflect overall health conditions. The Millennium Development Goals aim to reduce child and maternal mortality by two-thirds. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) serve as a barometer for overall health conditions, with MDGs 4 and 5 calling for a two-thirds reduction in child and maternal mortality. Progress in achieving these goals is affected by other MDGs, such as undernourishment and lack of access to clean water, which contribute to higher mortality rates. Countries with undernourished populations and limited access to clean water tend to have higher maternal and child mortality rates. UNICEF reports that 62 countries are not progressing towards the Millennium Development Goal on child survival, with a majority in Africa. Child survival and maternal health are closely linked, with over 500,000 women dying annually due to various infectious diseases. UNICEF found that 62 countries were not progressing towards the Millennium Development Goal on child survival, with a majority in Africa. Over 500,000 women die annually due to pregnancy-related causes, with higher maternal mortality rates in developing countries compared to industrialized nations. More than 500,000 women die each year due to pregnancy-related causes, with the majority in developing countries where maternal mortality rates are significantly higher. The United Nations emphasizes the importance of access to adequate diets, safe water, literacy, and health services during pregnancy and childbirth to prevent these deaths. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) states that most maternal deaths in developing countries could be prevented with access to adequate diets, safe water, literacy, and health services during pregnancy and childbirth. UNICEF estimates that 20% of maternal deaths are linked to undernutrition and 75% are due to obstetric complications. Maternal mortality rates are higher for mothers under 20 years old. Maternal deaths are linked to undernutrition and obstetric complications, with 75% caused by issues like hemorrhage and sepsis. Young mothers under 20 face higher risks, including toxemia and delivering low birth weight babies. Pregnancy-related complications are the leading cause of death among 15- to-19-year-olds worldwide. Young mothers under 20 face higher risks during pregnancy, such as toxemia, anemia, premature delivery, and cervical trauma, leading to complications like prolonged labor and delivering low birth weight babies. Adolescents aged 15-19 are at a higher risk of maternal mortality, with girls under 15 facing even greater risks. The United Nations estimates that adolescents give birth to 15 million infants annually. The United Nations estimates that adolescents give birth to 15 million infants each year. Girls aged 15-19 are at higher risk of maternal mortality, with those under 15 facing even greater risks. Maternal mortality rates vary by age group, with younger girls more likely to die from childbirth. Hemorrhage is a significant cause of maternal deaths in Africa and Asia. The maternal mortality rate for girls aged 15-19 is 178 per 100,000 live births, while for women aged 20-34, it is 32 per 100,000. Hemorrhage is a leading cause of maternal deaths in Africa and Asia, accounting for 34% and 31% of deaths, respectively. Regions with fewer skilled health attendants at birth have higher maternal mortality rates. In sub-Saharan Africa, 43% of women give birth with skilled attendants. In Latin America and the Caribbean, hemorrhage causes 13% and 21% of maternal deaths, respectively. Regions with fewer skilled health attendants at birth have higher maternal mortality rates. In sub-Saharan Africa, 43% of women give birth with skilled attendants, compared to 65% in south Asia and 99% in industrialized nations. The probability of dying from pregnancy-related causes is higher in Africa and Asia compared to industrialized nations. In sub-Saharan Africa, 43% of women give birth with skilled attendants, compared to 65% in south Asia and 99% in industrialized nations. The probability of dying from pregnancy-related causes is higher in Africa and Asia compared to industrialized nations. UNICEF found that many countries lack the capacity to reduce maternal mortality, with 80% of priority countries having low health workforce densities. In many countries, health systems lack capacity to reduce mortality nationwide. 80% of priority countries have low health workforce densities, hindering progress towards health-related MDGs. South Africa and Swaziland are among the few sub-Saharan African countries meeting minimum standards for health workers. Areas with sufficient health workers have higher child and maternal survival rates. South Africa and Swaziland are the only two sub-Saharan African countries among the 68 priority countries that have reached the minimum standard for health workers. Sub-Saharan Africa suffers from the greatest proportional shortage of health care workers in the world. WHO estimates that there are 57 countries with critical shortages of health care workers. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are 57 countries with critical shortages of health care workers, with 36 in Africa and none in industrialized nations. An additional 4.3 million health workers are needed globally, and countries in Africa would need to increase their health workers by about 140% to meet the minimum threshold of 2.5 health care professionals per 1,000 people. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is the lead agency responsible for improving child survival globally. Research supported by USAID in the 1970s and 1980s has led to interventions and technologies that now save millions of children. USAID has committed over $6 million in the past 20 years. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has committed over $6 billion in the past 20 years to support global child survival efforts, with $3.4 billion allocated from FY2001-FY2008. Research supported by USAID in the 1970s and 1980s has led to interventions and technologies that now save millions of children. USAID has committed over $6 billion in the past 20 years to support global child survival efforts, with $3.4 billion allocated from FY2001-FY2008. The agency focuses on addressing six major health problems that cause 90% of child deaths in developing countries. USAID allocates a significant proportion of its child survival funds to address neonatal complications and undernutrition, which contribute to 90% of child deaths in developing countries. The United Nations FAO states that hunger and malnutrition weaken immune systems, leading to the deaths of nearly 10 million children annually. WHO-supported studies from 1991 to 2001 found that mildly underweight children are at risk. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) emphasizes that hunger and malnutrition weaken immune systems, leading to the deaths of nearly 10 million children annually. WHO-supported studies from 1991 to 2001 found that underweight children are at a higher risk of death from infectious diseases. Children who are underweight face a higher risk of death from infectious diseases, with moderately to severely underweight children being at a five to eight times higher risk. Malnourished children have a higher likelihood of dying from diseases like measles and severe diarrhea. Good nutrition improves child survival, health, and cognitive development, while undernutrition weakens the immune system, leading to increased susceptibility to common childhood illnesses. Children who are underweight face a higher risk of death from infectious diseases, with severely underweight children at a significantly higher risk. Malnourished children are more likely to die from diseases like measles and severe diarrhea. Good nutrition improves child survival, health, and cognitive development, while undernutrition weakens the immune system, leading to increased susceptibility to common childhood illnesses. USAID's nutrition programs focus on micronutrient supplementation, fortification, and infant and young child feeding to provide vital immune-building nutrients like zinc, vitamin A, and iron. USAID's nutrition programs focus on micronutrient supplementation and fortification to improve child survival and health. Micronutrient programs add vital immune-building nutrients like zinc, vitamin A, iron, and iodine to processed foods. USAID also funds research on biofortified crops to enhance the micronutrient content of basic foods. USAID funds research on biofortified crops to enhance the micronutrient content of basic foods, such as maize with vitamin A, iron, and zinc; beans with iron and zinc; and sweet potatoes with vitamin A. Micronutrient supplementation and other nutrition programs are integrated with interventions like safe water and sanitation to address malnutrition-related infant and child deaths. Less than one third of infants in most countries receive adequate nutrition during the first two years of life. Micronutrient supplementation and USAID nutrition programs are integrated with interventions like safe water and sanitation to address malnutrition-related infant and child deaths. USAID estimates that poor feeding practices in the first two years of life contribute to two-thirds of malnutrition-related deaths. Less than one third of infants are exclusively breastfed during the first six months, leading to nutritional inadequacies and unsafe food introduction. Less than one third of infants in most countries are exclusively breastfed during the first six months of life, leading to nutritional inadequacies and unsafe food introduction. USAID-supported study shows that exclusively breastfed infants have fewer childhood diseases, lower risk of death from respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases, and are protected from energy and protein loss during illness. The study showed that exclusively breastfed infants have significantly lower rates of childhood diseases and are less likely to die from respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases. USAID integrates safe infant feeding practices with HIV/AIDS programs and invests $30 million annually in nutrition programs. UNICEF emphasizes the importance of breastfeeding for protecting infants from pneumonia. USAID integrates safe infant feeding practices with HIV/AIDS programs, investing $30 million annually in nutrition programs that include Vitamin A, iodine, food fortification, anemia packages, and zinc. UNICEF emphasizes the importance of minimizing indoor pollution, adequate nourishment, exclusive breastfeeding, and Vitamin A and zinc supplements to prevent pneumonia in children. UNICEF emphasizes preventing pneumonia in children by minimizing indoor pollution, ensuring adequate nourishment, exclusive breastfeeding, and providing Vitamin A and zinc supplements. Immunizations against infections like Hib and pertussis, as well as vaccines for Streptococcus pneumoniae, are also crucial. USAID supports immunization programs to combat pneumonia since 2002. Since 2002, USAID has supported immunization programs to combat pneumonia, including vaccines for Hib, pertussis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. UNICEF and WHO developed the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy in the mid-1990s with USAID support, integrating interventions for various childhood illnesses. In the mid-1990s, UNICEF and WHO developed the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) with USAID support, integrating interventions for diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, malnutrition, and malaria. USAID has expanded the IMCI strategy, focusing on the world's poorest countries where 40% of the population is at risk of malaria. USAID has been engaged in malaria eradication efforts since the 1950s, with a focus on the world's poorest countries where approximately 40% of the population is at risk of malaria. More than 500 million people worldwide become severely ill with malaria each year, with most cases and deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is particularly deadly for children, with approximately 1 million infants and children under age five in sub-Saharan Africa dying from malaria annually. In 2005, the President proposed the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) to further combat the disease. In 2005, the President proposed the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) to increase support for U.S. international malaria programs by over $1.2 billion from FY2006 through FY2010 in 15 targeted countries and reduce malaria deaths by 50% in those countries by 2010. USAID coordinates all PMI activities in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) aims to increase support for U.S. international malaria programs by over $1.2 billion from FY2006 through FY2010 in 15 targeted countries and reduce malaria deaths by 50% in those countries by 2010. USAID coordinates all PMI activities in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In its first year, PMI reached more than 6 million people. In January 2008, USAID reported that in its first year, PMI reached more than 6 million people and within two years, reached more than 25 million. Activities included indoor residual spraying in 10 PMI countries, benefitting more than 17 million people; procuring and distributing more than 4.7 million long lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLITNs) and retreating more than 1.1 million insecticide-treated nets (ITNs); procuring 12.6 million malarial. In its first year, PMI reached more than 6 million people and within two years, reached more than 25 million. Activities included indoor residual spraying in 10 PMI countries, distributing more than 4.7 million LLITNs and retreating more than 1.1 million ITNs; procuring 12.6 million malarial treatments, training over 28,000 health workers, and purchasing 4 million anti-malarial tablets to reduce the impact of malaria in pregnancy. The PMI activities included distributing LLITNs and ITNs, training health workers, and purchasing anti-malarial tablets to reduce malaria impact. HIV/AIDS is preventable and treatable, with successful interventions reducing mother-to-child transmission risk to 2%. In 2007, 420,000 children acquired HIV from their infected mothers during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Successful interventions can reduce mother-to-child transmission risk to 2%. In resource-limited countries, about 33% of HIV-positive pregnant women receive drugs for prevention. Nevirapine, costing $0.29 to $0.40 per dose, is commonly used. Early diagnosis for children is crucial. Nevirapine is a drug used to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission, costing $0.29 to $0.40 per dose. It is crucial for children to be diagnosed early and receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) promptly, as HIV progresses faster in children. The cost of ART for children is higher than for adults, with an annual supply estimated at $260 per child compared to $183 for adults. The cost of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for children is significantly higher than for adults, with a one-year supply estimated at $260 per child compared to $183 for adults. Fixed-dosed treatments combining multiple drugs in a single pill are most effective but more expensive for children. In low-income countries, a standard three-drug regimen costs $148 for adults but $2,000 per child and $800 for a child in 2005. The cost of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for children is significantly higher than for adults, with a one-year supply estimated at $260 per child compared to $183 for adults. Fixed-dosed treatments combining multiple drugs in a single pill are most effective but more expensive for children. The Clinton Foundation negotiated lower prices for pediatric ARTs, charging about $0.16 per day or $60 per year. The Clinton Foundation negotiated lower prices for pediatric antiretroviral therapy (ART), costing about $0.16 per day or $60 per year. Additionally, Cotrimoxazole, a drug used to treat pneumonia, reduces mortality in HIV-positive children by 30% and costs $0.03 per day or $10 per year. Only 10% of the 4 million children in need of the drug receive it. Treatment of opportunistic infections, such as pneumonia, can improve child survival among HIV-positive children. Cotrimoxazole, a drug used to treat pneumonia, reduces mortality in children with HIV/AIDS by about 30% and costs $0.03 per day or $10 per year. Only 10% of the 4 million children who need the drug are receiving it. USAID has spent $6 billion on HIV/AIDS interventions in over 100 countries since 1986. Since the inception of PEPFAR, USAID stopped reporting its projects' outcomes, and all participating agency and department outcomes are reported as PEPFAR advancements. Since 1986, USAID has spent $6 billion on HIV/AIDS interventions in over 100 countries. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has provided over $289.2 million to initiatives supporting 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. PEPFAR's food and nutrition programs have reached 332,000 OVC, 50,000 pregnant or lactating women, and 20,000 severely affected individuals. PEPFAR has provided $289.2 million to support 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. Their food and nutrition programs have reached 332,000 OVC, 50,000 pregnant or lactating women, and 20,000 severely malnourished individuals on ART. Child-focus programs include training for caregivers, promoting technology use, income-generating activities, and connecting families to essential services. PEPFAR's child-focus programs support training for caregivers of orphans and vulnerable children, promote technology use, income-generating activities, and connect families to essential services. Support for people living with HIV/AIDS receiving treatment should also be considered as it helps create a nurturing environment for children. PEPFAR has committed $1.5 billion for care programs. PEPFAR has committed $1.5 billion for care programs supporting people living with HIV/AIDS. Nearly $191.5 million was dedicated to pediatric treatment, benefiting 85,900 children. PMTCT services were provided to over 10 million pregnancies from FY2004 to FY2007. In FY2006 and FY2007, PEPFAR partnerships allocated $191.5 million for pediatric HIV/AIDS treatment, benefiting 85,900 children. PMTCT services supported over 10 million pregnancies from FY2004 to FY2007, preventing an estimated 157,000 infant HIV infections. Research by UNICEF, WHO, and USAID found that diarrhea can be prevented and treated with Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS), fluids, breastfeeding, continued feeding, and selective use of antibiotics and zinc supplementation for 10-14 days. Since 2002, USAID has provided over $1.5 billion for treating child diarrhea with ORS, preventing an estimated 157,000 infant HIV infections through ART for HIV-positive women in over 827,000 pregnancies. USAID also controls diarrheal disease by training health workers, promoting breastfeeding, and expanding community capacity to administer ORS. USAID's anti-diarrhea programs focus on treating child diarrhea with ORS for 10-14 days, training health workers, promoting breastfeeding, and improving hygiene practices like handwashing with soap to reduce diarrhea prevalence among children by 42% to 46%. USAID's anti-diarrhea programs emphasize hygiene, particularly handwashing with soap, to reduce diarrhea transmission. Despite soap being common in households, its use for handwashing is limited in poorer communities. Studies show low rates of soap use for handwashing after toilet use or cleaning a child in Burkina Faso and Lucknow, India. In poorer communities, soap is often reserved for bathing or washing clothes and dishes. Studies in Burkina Faso and Lucknow, India show low rates of soap use for handwashing. USAID supports partnerships promoting handwashing with soap to reduce diarrhea prevalence. WHO emphasizes measles immunization as a cost-effective intervention for preventing childhood deaths. USAID supports public-private partnerships promoting handwashing with soap to reduce diarrhea prevalence by 30% to 40%. WHO highlights measles immunization as a cost-effective intervention for preventing childhood deaths, costing less than $1 per dose. The measles vaccine is a cost-effective intervention for preventing childhood deaths, costing less than $1 per dose when bought through UNICEF. It can be combined with rubella and/or mumps vaccines as a live-attenuated vaccine. The measles vaccine, when bought through UNICEF, costs about $0.65 per bundled dose for MR vaccine and $1.04 to $1.50 per bundled dose for MMR vaccine. Immunization coverage rates for measles vaccination varied by region, with an estimated 80% of children vaccinated in 2006, up from 72% in 2000. In 2006, WHO and UNICEF estimated that 80% of children worldwide were vaccinated against measles, up from 72% in 2000. Between 2000 and 2006, 478 million children aged nine months to 14 years received measles vaccinations in 46 out of 47 priority countries, resulting in a 68% decrease in global measles mortality. Between 2000 and 2006, an estimated 478 million children aged nine months to 14 years received measles vaccinations in 46 out of 47 priority countries, leading to a 68% decrease in global measles mortality. The largest improvements were seen in Africa, with a 91% reduction in measles cases and deaths. USAID supports immunization programs that train health workers, enhance planning capacity, and improve quality. Between 2000 and 2006, measles cases and deaths decreased by 68%, with the largest gains in Africa at 91%. USAID supports immunization programs in over 100 countries, partnering with organizations like GAVI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to strengthen vaccine administration capacity. USAID partners with organizations like GAVI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to strengthen vaccine administration capacity in over 100 countries. Their maternal health programs aim to ensure healthy pregnancy outcomes through various interventions. Maternal health programs in low-resource environments include interventions like nutritional supplementation, treatment for parasitic worms, tetanus toxoid immunizations, prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, malaria treatment, and syphilis detection. USAID advocates for skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care for home deliveries to reduce infant deaths. USAID promotes skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care for home deliveries to reduce infant mortality. Training includes infant resuscitation, hygienic care, and breastfeeding encouragement. Community-based interventions educate on recognizing birth complications and accessing emergency care. USAID addresses key causes of maternal mortality by providing interventions such as facilitating infant breathing, resuscitation, hygienic care, and breastfeeding. Community-based initiatives educate on recognizing birth complications, accessing emergency care, and creating savings plans for healthcare costs. USAID estimates that 32% of maternal deaths are due to postpartum hemorrhage, which can be prevented and treated with low-cost interventions. USAID addresses key causes of maternal mortality by providing interventions such as facilitating infant breathing, resuscitation, hygienic care, and breastfeeding. They estimate that 32% of maternal deaths are due to postpartum hemorrhage, which can be prevented and treated with low-cost interventions. USAID urges communities to ensure mothers give birth in the presence of a trained health care practitioner to prevent and treat postpartum hemorrhage. USAID emphasizes the importance of preventing and treating postpartum hemorrhage by ensuring mothers give birth with a trained health care practitioner present. This includes administering drugs to stop bleeding and using life-saving techniques. Training programs for birth attendants focus on managing the third stage of labor to prevent hemorrhages, with interventions that can reduce incidents by 60%. In addition to hemorrhages, sepsis and infections contribute to nearly 10% of maternal deaths in various regions. Training programs for birth attendants focus on actively managing the third stage of labor to prevent hemorrhages, using techniques like controlled cord traction, uterine massage, and oxytocin. USAID reports that this intervention can prevent 60% of hemorrhages. Sepsis and infections, which contribute to nearly 10% of maternal deaths in various regions, are often caused by unhygienic delivery practices such as introducing unclean substances into the vagina during or after delivery. USAID-supported study identified unhygienic delivery practices as a key cause of maternal deaths in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Practices like introducing unclean substances during delivery contribute to sepsis. USAID distributes delivery kits and trains birth attendants to prevent infections. USAID supports efforts to prevent sepsis by distributing delivery kits and training birth attendants to identify and treat infections. They also train health care providers to recognize and manage hypertensive disorders, which are a significant cause of maternal deaths in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. USAID supports efforts to prevent sepsis by distributing delivery kits and training birth attendants to identify signs of infection and use antibiotics. Hypertensive disorders are a significant cause of maternal deaths in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. USAID also trains health care providers to recognize and treat pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Prolonged or obstructed labor can occur due to various reasons, leading to complications during childbirth. Prolonged or obstructed labor can lead to complications during childbirth, such as obstetric fistula, in low-resource settings. This can result in life-long debilities for the mother and/or baby if not resolved. Prolonged or obstructed labor can lead to complications like obstetric fistula in low-resource settings, resulting in life-long debilities for the mother and/or baby if not resolved. Obstetric fistula is more common in young girls and women who were stunted due to undernourishment and lack access to obstetric care, with 45% of cases in Kenya being among adolescents. Delaying pregnancy until the girl's pelvic region is fully developed and ensuring access to emergency care can help prevent obstetric fistula. In low-resource settings, obstetric fistula is more common in young girls and women who were stunted due to undernourishment and lack access to obstetric care. Delaying pregnancy until the girl's pelvic region is fully developed, ensuring access to emergency care, and performing caesarean surgery when needed can prevent obstetric fistula. USAID has supported fistula prevention and repair programs since 1989 and 2005, respectively, integrating them with other maternal death prevention programs. USAID has been supporting fistula prevention programs since 1989 and repair programs since 2005, integrating them with other maternal death prevention initiatives. Key activities include increasing access to emergency obstetrical care, training families and community health practitioners to identify signs of prolonged labor, and reducing stigma around obstetric fistula. Key activities to address maternal death and disability include increasing access to emergency obstetrical care, postponing child marriage, training health practitioners to identify labor complications, and reducing stigma around obstetric fistula. Complications from unsafe abortions contribute to 13% of maternal deaths globally, with regional variations. In Latin America and the Caribbean, it accounts for 12% of maternal deaths, while in Africa, it is about 4%. USAID reports that its international family planning programs have helped to avert an estimated 4 million maternal deaths over the last 20 years by reducing complications from unsafe abortions, which account for 13% of maternal deaths worldwide. Regional variations show that in Latin America and the Caribbean, unsafe abortions contribute to 12% of maternal deaths, while in Africa, it is about 4%. Appropriations to USAID's CS/MH programs grew by about 8% from FY2001 to FY2003. USAID's international family planning programs have helped prevent an estimated 4 million maternal deaths in the last 20 years by reducing complications from unsafe abortions. Appropriations to USAID's CS/MH programs increased by about 8% from FY2001 to FY2003, with significant growth in support for HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. Overall, support for USAID's global health programs increased by 28%, with significant growth in appropriations for HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. HIV/AIDS funding grew by 65% and OID funding by 24%, with a focus on tuberculosis and malaria programs. Congress also showed strong support for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria with increased appropriations for U.S. contributions. During FY2004 through FY2008, U.S. support for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs increased significantly, with a focus on tuberculosis and malaria programs. Congress also demonstrated strong support for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. During FY2004 through FY2008, U.S. support for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs increased significantly, with a focus on tuberculosis and malaria programs. Congress also demonstrated strong support for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Some Members questioned the Administration's focus on HIV/AIDS funding over other global health interventions, raising concerns about recipient countries' ability to absorb the funds due to strained health infrastructures. The Administration was questioned about requesting less funding for global health interventions like child survival, maternal health, family planning, and reproductive health. Congress urged better integration of HIV/AIDS with other health programs such as TB and nutrition, as appropriations for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria exceeded support for other health programs. Congress provided $19.7 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs from FY2004 to FY2008. Congress provided $19.7 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs from FY2004 to FY2008, far outpacing support for other health programs. Appropriations to USAID's child survival, maternal health, and family planning initiatives were significantly lower at $4.6 billion during the same period. Congress appropriated $4.6 billion to USAID's global health programs, including child survival, maternal health, and family planning initiatives, during the Administration of President George W. Bush. This funding was mainly allocated for specific diseases through initiatives such as the President's International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative, PEPFAR, and the President's Malaria Initiative. Congress supported higher spending on disease-specific U.S. programs under President Bush, including initiatives like the International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative, PEPFAR, and the President's Malaria Initiative. While appropriations for other health issues remained stable, experts praised the increased U.S. commitment to combating global diseases like HIV/AIDS. The U.S. has increased funding for disease-specific programs like the President's Malaria Initiative and PEPFAR, but concerns remain about underfunding of life-saving interventions for women and children, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Experts emphasize the preventability of child deaths through low-cost interventions. Many are concerned that health programs for women and children in sub-Saharan Africa are underfunded, despite the preventability of two-thirds of child deaths through low-cost interventions. Calls for increased funding for various health issues, not just HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, are being made to Congress. Some suggest considering voluntary family planning to improve maternal and child health. Some argue for increased funding for various health issues beyond HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, including voluntary family planning to improve maternal and child health. Family planning activities can protect women's health by reducing high-risk pregnancies and children's health by spacing pregnancies, prevent HIV/AIDS, reduce abortions, and protect the environment. Voluntary family planning can improve maternal and child health by reducing high-risk pregnancies, preventing HIV/AIDS, and reducing abortions. Concerns about coercive practices in some countries exist, but family planning can help decrease morbidity and mortality rates among adolescent girls in rural areas of developing countries. Family planning can reduce abortions and improve maternal and child health by decreasing high-risk pregnancies. It can also help lower morbidity and mortality rates among adolescent girls in rural areas of developing countries. In many rural areas of developing countries, girls are married and have children in their teen years, increasing the risk of complications such as low-birthweight babies, toxemia, anemia, premature delivery, and obstetric fistula. Girls aged 15-19 are twice as likely to die from childbirth as women in their twenties, while those under 15 are five times as likely to die. Delaying pregnancy can prevent obstetric fistula. In Kenya, 45% of all obstetric fistula cases are among adolescents. Delaying pregnancy until pelvic development is complete and performing necessary caesarean surgery can prevent obstetric fistula. Repairing the condition costs around $300, which is unaffordable for many young girls and women in affected countries. Increasing spending on health systems is advocated to reduce maternal mortality. To prevent fistula, delaying pregnancy until pelvic development is complete and performing necessary caesarean surgery is recommended. Repairing the condition costs around $300, which is unaffordable for many affected individuals. Advocates suggest increasing spending on health systems to reduce maternal and child mortality by implementing various health strategies. To significantly reduce maternal and child mortality, governments must effectively undertake health strategies including ensuring income, food levels, maternal health status, access to immunizations, and safe drinking water. UNICEF found that without donor support, health systems struggle to deliver essential interventions like vaccinations to reduce mortality nationwide. Strengthening health systems and availability of health workers are crucial for improvements in these areas. Improvements in health systems and availability of health workers are crucial for providing essential interventions like vaccinations to reduce mortality nationwide. UNICEF emphasizes the need for donor support to strengthen health systems and ensure efficient coordination of health assistance with other donors and health ministries. Proponents suggest following WHO's International Health Partnership and related Initiatives (IHP+) for better overall health outcomes. Supporters urge Congress to direct USAID to better coordinate health assistance with other donors and health ministries to improve efficiency and overall health outcomes. They point to WHO's International Health Partnership and related Initiatives (IHP+) as a model for donors to commit to supporting national health plans in a harmonized way. The IHP+ is a coalition of international health agencies, governments, and donors committed to improving health outcomes in developing countries by encouraging donors to create compacts with countries to support one results-oriented national health plan in a harmonized way.
