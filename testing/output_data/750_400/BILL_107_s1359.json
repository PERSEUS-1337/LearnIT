The Act recognized the unique circumstances of local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines. The Telecommunications Act of 1966 acknowledged the unique position of local exchange carriers with less than two percent of the nation's subscriber lines, allowing them to accelerate the deployment of advanced services in less populated regions. Two percent carriers are uniquely positioned to accelerate the deployment of advanced services and competitive initiatives for consumers in less densely populated regions. Existing regulations often impose disproportionate burdens on these carriers, hindering their ability to provide advanced telecommunications services in less populated areas. Reducing regulatory burdens on two percent carriers will allow them to allocate more resources to deploying advanced services and competitive initiatives for consumers in less densely populated regions, overcoming obstacles imposed by existing regulations tailored for larger carriers. Reducing regulatory burdens on two percent carriers will enable them to allocate more resources to deploying advanced services and competitive initiatives for consumers in less densely populated regions of the Nation. This will increase their ability to respond to marketplace conditions and accelerate the deployment of services to benefit consumers. Reducing regulatory burdens on two percent carriers will accelerate the deployment of advanced services and competition in the telecommunications industry, benefiting consumers in less densely populated regions of the Nation. The Act aims to reduce regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers to promote competition and benefit consumers nationwide.
