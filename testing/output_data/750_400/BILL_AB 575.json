The state board must adopt basic instructional materials for language arts, mathematics, science, social science, and bilingual or bicultural subjects for kindergarten and grades 1 to 8. The adoption of materials for each subject area is staggered to prevent consecutive years of adoption for the same grade level. The state board adopts basic instructional materials for various subjects including mathematics, science, social science, and bilingual or bicultural subjects. Procedures are in place for the submission of instructional materials for all subject areas. Instructional materials can be submitted for adoption in different subject areas every eight years, with restrictions on resubmission if there are no substantive changes. The state board ensures curriculum frameworks are reviewed and adopted, with consistent criteria for evaluating instructional materials. If revisions to instructional material are submitted for review after the specified timeframe, a fee will be assessed on the publisher or manufacturer. The fee should not exceed the reasonable costs for the department to conduct the review. Instructional materials must be adopted or rejected within six months of submission, with a possible extension of up to three months if needed. The review process for instructional materials involves committees with volunteer experts and teachers from various grade levels and subjects. Rules for adoption must be transparent and consistent for all formats of materials.

They should not include unnecessary exposure to commercial brands unless approved by the state board based on specific findings. In instructional materials, the use of commercial brand names, products, or logos is allowed if necessary for educational purposes or incidental to illustrations. In instructional materials, commercial brand names, products, or logos can appear in illustrations if incidental to the general nature of the illustration and meet criteria established by the state board. If basic instructional materials are rejected, the state board must provide a written explanation based on established criteria. The board may adopt fewer than five materials if less are submitted. If fewer than five basic instructional materials are submitted, the state board may adopt less than five materials based on specific criteria. If the adopted materials do not meet the criteria or the state board's curriculum framework, a review will be conducted to ensure consistency. The state board has the authority to adopt materials that are not basic instructional materials. The state board shall prescribe procedures for an open and flexible materials submission system to ensure that adopted materials meet the educational needs of diverse pupil populations, represent cultural pluralism, and provide a broad spectrum of knowledge and technology-based materials. Upon adoption, the state board will provide a list of instructional materials with unit costs to publishers, manufacturers, and schools. These materials will be available for procurement until a new curriculum framework is adopted. The state board will provide a list of adopted instructional materials by subject and grade level, available for procurement until a new curriculum framework is adopted. The list will include information from review committees and allow publishers to include necessary corporate information on the materials.

Participating publishers will be assessed a fee based on the number of programs and grade levels submitted for review. The notice for follow-up adoption specifies fees based on the number of programs and grade levels submitted for review. The fee covers the cost of the process and is kept modest to avoid duplication of work from the primary adoption. The department requires publishers or manufacturers to declare intent to submit specific programs for follow-up adoption and specify grade levels, with a fee assessed for each submission. The fee is payable even if a program is withdrawn or grade levels reduced. When a publisher or manufacturer declares intent to submit programs for adoption, a fee is assessed. The fee must be paid before the submission can be reviewed for adoption. The Legislature intends for the fee for participation in a follow-up adoption not to be prohibitive for small publishers or manufacturers. Small publishers or manufacturers can request a fee reduction, defined as independently owned or operated with 100 or fewer employees and average annual gross receipts of $10 million or less over the previous three years.

Revenue from fees charged can be used for reimbursement and review of instructional materials. (g) Revenue from fees in subdivision (e) will be budgeted as reimbursements and can cover adoption and instructional materials review costs. (h) If little interest from publishers and manufacturers, a follow-up adoption may be recommended against by the department to the state board.
