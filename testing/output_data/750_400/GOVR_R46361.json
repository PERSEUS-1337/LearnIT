The President's FY2020 budget request for DOD reflects a shift in strategic emphasis towards countering threats from China and Russia. This marks a change in U.S. national security policy towards competition between nuclear-armed powers. The budget request for DOD reflects a strategic shift based on the 2018 National Defense Strategy, emphasizing increased investment to counter threats from China and Russia. This marks a departure from the focus of U.S. national security policy over the past three decades, with renewed emphasis on competition between nuclear-armed powers. The U.S. national security policy shifted towards countering threats from China and Russia, moving away from the focus on regional aggressors like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea after the Cold War. This change followed the strategic competition with the Soviet Union during the Cold War era. After the Cold War, U.S. national security policy shifted to focus on countering terrorism and insurgencies in the Middle East, while also addressing North Korean and Iranian nuclear weapons programs. The U.S. and allied military forces maintained overwhelming military superiority over adversaries. The 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea and subsequent conflict in Ukraine raised concerns about Moscow's aggressive behavior, while China's militarization of islands also drew attention. The 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea and proxy war in Ukraine raised concerns about Moscow's aggressive behavior, while China's militarization of islands in the South China Sea highlighted the importance of competing with other great powers in the U.S. national security agenda. The U.S. national security agenda emphasizes competing with other great powers like China, who are militarizing islands in the South China Sea to assert sovereignty and control key shipping lanes. Adversaries may collaborate to achieve shared objectives, posing serious threats to U.S. interests. In a complex security environment, adversaries collaborate to achieve shared objectives, using social and economic tools to advance their agendas. Some states work with non-state proxies, blurring the lines between conventional and irregular conflict.

The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy reorient U.S. national security strategy. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy prioritize great power competition with China and Russia, focusing on countering their military capabilities and bolstering the competitive advantage of U.S. forces. The National Defense Strategy reorients U.S. national security strategy towards great power competition with China and Russia, emphasizing countering their military capabilities and bolstering the competitive advantage of U.S. forces. It highlights the erosion of U.S. forces' advantage vis-\u00e0-vis Chinese and Russian threats and the need for U.S. forces to expect vigorous contestation of their military objectives. The National Defense Strategy emphasizes countering China and Russia, highlighting the erosion of U.S. forces' advantage and the need to expect vigorous contestation of military objectives. The strategy identifies five significant threats to U.S. interests: China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and global terrorist groups. The Trump Administration's strategic orientation, outlined in the National Security Strategy (NSS) and National Defense Strategy (NDS), identifies China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and global terrorist groups as significant threats to U.S. interests. The NDS prioritizes maintaining a strategic edge over China and Russia, leading to a \"2+3\" strategy focusing on countering these two primary challenges along with three additional challenges. The NDS prioritizes retaining the U.S. strategic competitive edge over China and Russia, known as the \"2+3\" strategy, which includes countering North Korea, Iran, and terrorist groups.

The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act provided 30% more funding than requested to enhance the firepower of the Stryker wheeled troop-carrier by replacing its .50 caliber machine gun with a 30 mm cannon effective against lightly armored vehicles. This decision reflects mixed congressional support for the Army's strategy, leading to truncation of older upgrade programs to allocate funds for new combat capabilities. The Army's strategy for developing new combat capabilities has received mixed congressional support. To fund these new programs, older upgrade programs for existing systems will be truncated, including upgrades to Bradley fighting vehicles and CH-47 Chinook helicopters. The enacted bill provides one-third less funding than requested. The Army plans to reallocate funds from upgrades to legacy systems like Bradley fighting vehicles and CH-47 Chinook helicopters to invest in new systems sooner. The enacted bill provides less funding than requested for Bradley upgrades but nearly triple the amount for the Chinook upgrade. The enacted appropriations bill provides $223.0 million less than requested for Bradley upgrades, labeled as \"excess to need.\" However, it allocates $46.2 million for the Chinook upgrade, nearly triple the requested amount of $18.2 million.
