    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 34171 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define terms related to administrative budget and administrative cost allowance for successor agencies. The administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is set at 5% of property tax for the period January 1, 2012, through June 30, 2012, and up to 3% for each fiscal year ending on June 30, 2016. The allowance cannot be less than $250,000 unless reduced by the oversight board or by agreement with the successor agency. Starting July 1, 2016, the administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is up to 3% of the property tax distributed by the county auditor-controller in the previous fiscal year. The allowance cannot be less than $250,000 unless reduced by the oversight board. The administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is up to 3% of property tax distributed by the county auditor-controller in the previous fiscal year, with a minimum of $250,000 unless reduced by the oversight board or by agreement with the department. Starting July 1, 2016, a successor agency's annual administrative costs cannot exceed 50% of the total Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund distributed to pay enforceable obligations in the previous fiscal year. This limit applies regardless of whether the costs are paid within the administrative cost allowance or not, but excludes costs paid from bond proceeds or grant funds. The annual administrative costs of a successor agency cannot exceed 50% of the total Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund distributed for enforceable obligations in the previous fiscal year. This limit applies to repayments made to the creating city, county, or city and county, regardless of payment source. The oversight board approves the administrative cost allowance as the sole funding source for legal expenses related to civil actions. Employee costs for project implementation activities are not considered administrative costs. The \"designated local authority\" is a public entity formed under Section 34173. An \"enforceable obligation\" includes specific criteria outlined in the legislation. An \"enforceable obligation\" refers to bonds issued by a former redevelopment agency, including debt service, reserve set-asides, and other required payments under the bond indenture. A reserve may be held if property tax allocation is insufficient for upcoming bond payments. Loans borrowed by the redevelopment agency for lawful purposes must be repaid according to a set schedule. Payments required by the federal government, state obligations, and federal base reuse obligations for the former Norton Air Force Base are included. Costs incurred for fulfilling collective bargaining agreements for layoffs or terminations of city employees who worked directly for the former redevelopment agency are considered enforceable obligations payable from property tax funds. These obligations to employees will remain enforceable and payable from property tax funds. Costs incurred for fulfilling collective bargaining agreements for layoffs or terminations of city employees who worked directly for the former redevelopment agency are enforceable obligations payable from property tax funds. These obligations remain enforceable for employees transferred to the entity assuming housing functions, with reimbursement agreements in place. The successor agency or designated local authority must reimburse the housing entity for any employee obligations when transferring employees to assume housing functions from the former redevelopment agency. The oversight board, along with the successor agency, has the authority to appeal judgments or set aside settlements against the former redevelopment agency. Any legally binding agreement or contract not void due to debt limit or public policy can be terminated by the oversight board or successor agency with compensation. Titles or headings in documents do not determine enforceable obligations. Contracts or agreements necessary for the administration or operation of the successor agency, including litigation expenses, settlements, office space, equipment, supplies, and insurance costs, must comply with specified sections. Legal expenses related to civil actions contesting the validity of certain parts shall only be incurred after January 1, 2016. Beginning January 1, 2016, legal expenses for civil actions challenging the validity of certain parts must be paid from the administrative cost allowance. A sponsoring entity may provide funds to a successor agency for legal expenses related to civil actions challenging the validity of certain parts. If the successor agency wins the case, the funds provided by the sponsoring entity for successful causes of action shall be repaid under specified terms. If the successor agency wins a legal case, funds provided by the sponsoring entity for legal expenses will be repaid as an enforceable obligation. If the successor agency does not win the case, the funds will be considered a grant and not eligible for repayment. Repayments owed to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund of a redevelopment agency must be approved by the oversight board and transferred to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund for affordable housing purposes. The \"enforceable obligation\" for redevelopment agencies does not include agreements between the city and the former agency, except for written agreements related to indebtedness obligations issued by December 31, 2010, or for refunding or refinancing of other debts by June 27, 2011. Written agreements related to indebtedness obligations issued by December 31, 2010, solely for the purpose of securing or repaying those obligations, may be deemed enforceable. Additionally, agreements for refunding or refinancing of prior debts by June 27, 2011, solely for the purpose of securing or repaying the refunded or refinanced obligations, may also be considered enforceable. Loan agreements between the redevelopment agency and the city, county, or city are excluded from enforceable obligations. Loan agreements entered into by the redevelopment agency within two years of its creation, or agreements related to state highway infrastructure improvements made before June 28, 2011, may be considered enforceable obligations. Loan agreements and agreements related to state highway infrastructure improvements made within two years of the redevelopment agency's creation may be enforceable obligations. Additionally, agreements between the city and the former redevelopment agency may also be considered enforceable obligations. The former redevelopment agency's commitment to highway infrastructure improvements is considered an enforceable obligation if it involves repayment or fulfillment of outstanding loans or development obligations from federal agencies. Contracts or agreements between the former redevelopment agency and other public agencies outside of redevelopment project areas that do not benefit the project are void, except for housing-related contracts authorized under Part 1. (e) \u201cIndebtedness obligations\u201d refers to bonds, notes, or other debt issued by the redevelopment agency to finance redevelopment projects in compliance with the Community Redevelopment Law. (f) \u201cOversight board\u201d is defined as an entity established under Section 34179. (g) \u201cRecognized obligation\u201d is an obligation listed in the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule. The \"oversight board\" is defined as an entity established under Section 34179. A \"recognized obligation\" is an obligation listed in the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule, which outlines minimum payment amounts and due dates for enforceable obligations until June 30, 2016, and then for each fiscal year after July 1, 2016.

The curr_chunk defines terms related to property taxes, including \"sponsoring entity\" and \"final judicial determination.\" It also specifies the \"housing entity administrative cost allowance\" from July 1, 2014, to July 1, 2018.

If there are insufficient funds in the Redevelopment Obligations Retirement Fund, the unpaid amount can be carried over to future payment schedules without a time limit."
