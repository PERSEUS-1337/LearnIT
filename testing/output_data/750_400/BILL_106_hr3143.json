    "content": "The Act titled \"High Performance Schools Act of 1999\" is established for the purpose of improving school performance. The Congress finds that American K-12 schools spend over $6 billion annually on energy costs, more than on books and computers combined. Educators and students perform best in a comfortable, healthy, naturally lit environment. Over half of the nation's K-12 schools are over 40 years old and need renovation for efficiency and comfort, with 6,000 new schools needed. Studies show that student achievement and attendance improve when schools are in good repair. Over half of K-12 schools in the US are over 40 years old and need renovation for efficiency and comfort. Inadequate ventilation, poor lighting, and uncomfortable temperatures can hinder students' ability to excel. Over the next 10 years, 6,000 new schools will be needed to accommodate the increasing number of students. Poor ventilation, lighting, and temperature control in schools can impact students' ability to concentrate and excel. Older schools often have inefficient water usage. A holistic approach in designing and renovating schools is essential for optimal efficiency and comfort. (5) Inefficient water use is common in older schools. (6) A holistic approach in designing and renovating schools leads to high performance buildings. (7) Whole building concepts improve student and teacher performance. (8) Adopting a holistic approach usually yields positive results. Adopting a whole building approach in school construction leads to high performance buildings and lower life-cycle costs. Energy conservation in school projects can save a quarter of current energy costs, allowing more resources for teachers and educational materials. Using renewable energy sources like daylighting, passive solar heating, photovoltaics, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass power in low-energy designed buildings can meet energy needs without emissions, while using environmentally preferable products. Most school districts lack knowledge of cutting-edge design and technologies for efficient school construction or renovations, hindering the implementation of renewable energy sources and environmentally preferable products to improve indoor air quality in school buildings. Most school districts lack knowledge of cutting-edge design and technologies for efficient school construction or renovations. Congress is considering legislation to assist in building new schools and renovating existing ones to improve indoor air quality and create healthful, productive, energy-efficient school buildings. Congress is considering legislation to assist school districts in building new schools and renovating existing ones to create high performance, healthful, energy-efficient, and environmentally sound school buildings. SEC. 3. PROGRAM ESTABLISHMENT AND ADMINISTRATION. Established in the Department of Education is the High Performance Schools Program, which allows the Secretary of Education to make grants to school districts for implementing the purpose of the Act, administering assistance programs, and promoting district participation. Grants aim to achieve energy efficiency performance. Grants under the High Performance Schools Program aim to achieve energy efficiency performance not less than 30 percent beyond the levels prescribed in the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code. They are provided to school districts demonstrating a need for assistance. Grants under the High Performance Schools Program aim to achieve energy efficiency performance 30 percent beyond the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code levels. They are awarded to school districts in need of assistance due to increasing enrollments or renovation needs. The High Performance Schools Program provides grants to school districts facing growing enrollments or renovation needs. Districts must show they lack funds to address these issues independently and commit to using the grant funds for developing high-performance school buildings. Grants under the program are also used to evaluate school district compliance. The grant funds are used to develop high-performance school buildings according to an approved plan. Grants can also be used for evaluating compliance and promoting the development of such buildings. The grant funds are used to evaluate compliance with requirements and promote the development of high-performance school buildings through distributing information, organizing programs, and obtaining technical services. The grant funds are used for evaluating compliance, promoting high-performance school buildings, organizing programs, obtaining technical services, and collecting data. Grants are also provided to promote participation in these initiatives. Grants can be used for planning, designing, and monitoring high performance school buildings. They also support promotional activities to encourage participation in energy-efficient initiatives. Grants under subsection (b)(3) can be used for promotional and marketing activities, including working with school administrations, students, and communities, and coordinating public benefit programs. School districts must develop feasible plans in consultation with State offices of energy and education to receive these grants. The State agency, in consultation with State offices of energy and education, will provide grants to school districts with feasible plans to achieve grant purposes. School districts are encouraged to supplement grant funds with other sources for plan implementation. SEC. 4. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS. The State agency will provide grants to school districts with feasible plans to achieve grant purposes. Funds appropriated for this Act will be provided to Governors of States, who will determine the State agency to administer assistance to school districts. Funds allocated under section 5 will be divided: 70% for grants under section 3(b)(1), 15% for grants under section 3(b)(2), and 15% for grants under section 3(b)(3). Seventy percent of funds allocated under section 5 will be used for grants under section 3(b)(1), while fifteen percent each will be used for grants under sections 3(b)(2) and 3(b)(3). The Secretary of Education may retain up to $300,000 per year to assist State agencies in coordinating and implementing the Program, including developing reference materials for high performance school buildings. \"Authorization of appropriations for grants under section 3(b) includes $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, increasing annually to $230,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, with additional funding as needed for the following 6 years. Definitions are provided in section 6.\" The Act defines \"elementary school\" and \"secondary school\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. It also defines a \"high performance school building\" as one that maximizes renewable energy use, is cost-effective, and promotes energy conservation practices. The term \"high performance school building\" refers to a school building that maximizes renewable energy use, is cost-effective, uses environmentally preferable materials, and enhances indoor environmental quality. Renewable energy includes solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass power."
