    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Business Supply Chain Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2015\". It includes findings and the sense of Congress. Congress finds that in 2014, the Department of Labor identified 136 goods from 74 countries made by forced labor and child labor. The United States, as the world's largest importer, faces increasing demands for information on human rights impact of products. Consumers lack standing to enforce provisions of the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 in US courts. The United States market faces increasing demands for information on the human rights impact of products. Courts have ruled that consumers lack standing to enforce provisions of the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 in US courts, leading to minimal enforcement actions in the past 80 years. The Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 lacks enforcement due to limited scope and exceptions for goods not produced in the US, resulting in minimal actions in the past 80 years to prevent forced labor and human trafficking in the stream of commerce. The Federal mechanisms to prevent forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in commerce are limited and lack information on tainted supply chains. The Trafficking Victims Protection Acts allow for the termination of Federal contracts with contractors involved in these crimes. The Trafficking Victims Protection Acts of 2003 and 2005 allow for the termination of Federal contracts with contractors engaged in trafficking, forced labor, or commercial sex acts. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 allows for criminal jurisdiction over Federal employees, contractors, or subcontractors engaged in trafficking or forced labor. Executive Order 13126 prohibits the acquisition of products produced by forced or indentured child labor. The Victims Protection Act of 2005 grants US courts criminal jurisdiction over Federal employees, contractors, or subcontractors involved in severe trafficking or forced labor. Executive Orders and legislation have also prohibited Federal contractors and their employees from participating in such activities. Executive Order 13627 and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 have banned Federal contractors and their employees from engaging in trafficking-related activities such as charging recruitment fees, confiscating passports, and using fraudulent recruitment practices. The Executive Order and Acts prohibit Federal contractors from engaging in trafficking activities like charging recruitment fees, confiscating passports, and using fraudulent practices. They also mandate the implementation of anti-trafficking compliance plans. Federal contractors and subcontractors must have an anti-trafficking compliance plan with a complaint mechanism and procedures to prevent trafficking in persons. Congress recognizes forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor as severe forms of abuse for profit. It is the sense of Congress that forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor are severe forms of abuse for profit, and legislation is needed to ensure products are free of these practices. Legislation is necessary to provide consumers with information on products free of child labor, forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking to prevent these crimes in supply chains. SEC. 3.
