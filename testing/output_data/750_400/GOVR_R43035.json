President Thein Sein's recent ministerial changes in February 2013 included the appointment of two new ministers.

The Tatmadaw's support for political reform may be limited, as evidenced by the high number of military officers in key positions. Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hliang has not publicly confirmed ordering his troops to cease military operations against the KIO/KIA despite presidential instructions. Reassignments of top military personnel and replacements in the Union Parliament have raised questions about General Min Aung Hlaing's political intentions. Relations between the military and the Union Parliament in Burma are a critical issue for political reform. General Min Aung Hlaing's reassignments of top military personnel and replacements in the Parliament have raised questions about his political intentions. The replacement of military-appointed members in the Parliament following the NLD's by-election victories was seen as an effort to tighten discipline among military representatives. In April 2012, after the NLD's success in the by-elections, there were efforts to tighten discipline among military representatives in the Union Parliament. Tensions between the military and Parliament have been evident, with disputes over the military budget and strained relations at times. Relations between the military and the Union Parliament have been strained, with recent incidents highlighting tensions. In February 2013, Parliament questioned the size of the military budget, while in March 2012, a commission reported land seizures by the military. The commission recommended returning confiscated land and providing compensation for displaced persons. In early March 2012, a parliamentary commission investigating land seizures by the military reported that between July 2012 and January 2013, the Tatmadaw had confiscated over 247,000 acres of land. The commission recommended returning most of the confiscated land to the owners or the state, and providing compensation for persons displaced by the land seizures. The military's pervasive presence in Burma's economy is an unresolved aspect of its role in a reformed Burma, with regional commanders benefiting economically from their political power. The military in Burma confiscated over 247,000 acres of land between July 2012 and January 2013, leading to displacement of individuals who are yet to receive compensation. The military's involvement in the economy, with regional commanders benefiting economically from their political power, remains a key issue in a reformed Burma. Major corporations in lucrative sectors like mining, oil, and gas are allegedly owned by the military or senior officers, with Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited being a prominent entity. The military in Burma is involved in the economy, with regional commanders benefiting economically from their political power. Major corporations in lucrative sectors like mining, oil, and gas are allegedly owned by the military or senior officers, with Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited being a prominent entity. The military in Burma, also known as Myanma Economic Holding, is reportedly owned by Ministry of Defense and the Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC). These conglomerates own companies in various economic sectors, including two of Burma's larger banks. The revenues from these corporate assets provide the military with independent revenue and some control over the nation's economy. Burma has been in a low-level civil war since 1948. The Tatmadaw's corporate assets, including ownership of Myawaddy Bank and Innwa Bank, provide the military with independent revenue and control over the economy. Burma has been in a low-level civil war since 1948 due to the government's failure to grant ethnic minorities autonomy as per the Panglong Agreement, leading to a military coup in 1962. The Burmese military, known as the Tatmadaw, has been seen as the main entity responsible for preserving Burma's national integrity since the 1962 military coup. The 2008 Constitution designates the military to safeguard the Union and national solidarity. The Burmese military, or Tatmadaw, has been credited with preserving Burma's national integrity since the 1962 coup. The 2008 Constitution designates the military to safeguard the Union and national solidarity, with a proposed three-step peace process to end the civil war and reconcile with ethnic groups. The Union Government has proposed a three-step peace process to negotiate an end to the civil war and achieve reconciliation with ethnic organizations. The first step is a preliminary ceasefire agreement, followed by broader agreements on political and economic development in ethnic States. The final step involves a national agreement on governance. The Union Government has proposed a three-step peace process to negotiate an end to the civil war and achieve reconciliation with ethnic organizations. The first step is a preliminary ceasefire agreement with all ethnic organizations maintaining militias. The second step involves negotiating broader agreements on political and economic development in States where ethnic militias operate. The third step calls for a national agreement on amending the 2008 Constitution in line with the second stage agreements. The proposal assumes preserving the 2008 Constitution with amendments and disbanding or merging ethnic militias into the Tatmadaw. The Union Government has proposed a three-step peace process to negotiate an end to the civil war and achieve reconciliation with ethnic organizations. The third step involves the negotiation of a national agreement on amending the 2008 Constitution in line with the second stage agreements. Former Railway Minister Aung Min is widely seen as the lead negotiator in talks with ethnic organizations. The Union Government has established a \"peace committee\" with a 12-member central committee led by President Thein Sein and a 52-member working committee led by Vice-President Sai Mauk Kham. Former Railway Minister Aung Min is the lead negotiator in talks with ethnic organizations. The Union Government's three-step peace process has been rejected by some ethnic organizations, with the United Nationalities Federal Council proposing an alternative path to national reconciliation. The United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) has proposed an alternative peace process involving direct negotiations with the Union Government, a national conference of ethnic organizations, and a national convention to establish a federal union of Burma. The UNFC's proposal does not assume the preservation of the 2008 Constitution or the integration of militias into the Tatmadaw. The UNFC proposed a peace process involving direct negotiations with the Union Government, a national conference of ethnic organizations, and a national convention to establish a federal union of Burma. Talks with ethnic organizations have had mixed results, with preliminary ceasefire agreements reached with 13 out of 21 groups, excluding the KIO/KIA. The Union Government has had talks with various ethnic organizations, including the UNFC, resulting in preliminary ceasefire agreements with 13 out of 21 groups. However, negotiations have not completed the second step of the peace process. Several unresolved issues hinder national reconciliation in Burma. Several talks between the Union Government and ethnic organizations in Ruili, China in February 2013 aimed at achieving national reconciliation in Burma. However, negotiations have not progressed to the second step of the peace process due to unresolved issues regarding the powers of the central government and ethnic States. Ethnic groups seek autonomy while the government prefers a stronger central authority. The central government and ethnic States in Burma are at odds over the distribution of power, with ethnic groups seeking autonomy while the government and military favor a stronger central authority. National reconciliation efforts require the support of the military, but their participation in negotiations is limited, raising doubts about their commitment to peace. The central government in Burma is seeking national reconciliation with ethnic States, but the support of the military, Tatmadaw, is crucial. However, the military's limited participation in negotiations and attacks on ethnic militias raise doubts about their commitment to the peace process. The parties also need to agree on the process for negotiating terms of national reconciliation within the structure of the 2008 Constitution. The Union Government in Burma is pushing for national reconciliation with ethnic States, but there are challenges regarding the Tatmadaw's support and the negotiation process. The government wants to incorporate ethnic organizations into the current governance system through parliamentary elections, but major ethnic groups prefer equal talks without accepting the legitimacy of the 2008 Constitution. The future of the 2008 Constitution is a critical element in national reconciliation efforts in Burma, as major ethnic groups prefer equal talks without accepting the constitution's legitimacy. Opposition parties and ethnic organizations were not involved in the drafting process, making the constitution politically problematic. The drafting and adoption of the 2008 Constitution in Burma is politically problematic as it was not inclusive of opposition parties and ethnic organizations. The constitution is seen as serving the interests of the military and the national referendum results are widely considered fraudulent. The 2008 Constitution in Burma, drafted by the SPDC, aimed to protect the military's power. Limited public access to the Constitution before the 2008 referendum raised concerns about its legitimacy. The 2010 parliamentary elections under this Constitution were deemed unfair, casting doubt on the Union Government's legitimacy. The Burmese military and Union Government consider the 2008 Constitution as the legitimate governing document. The plebiscite and parliamentary elections in Burma are widely seen as fraudulent, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the Union Government and Parliament. President Thein Sein is open to limited amendments to the 2008 Constitution, including potential changes to the Tatmadaw's privileged status in the Union Parliament. President Thein Sein is willing to consider limited amendments to the constitution, including modifications to the privileged status of the Tatmadaw in the Union Parliament. The opposition parties, led by Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD, also seek amendments to the 2008 Constitution. The Tatmadaw is open to limited changes to the constitution, but not ones that would fundamentally alter their special status. Opposition parties, led by Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD, want amendments to the 2008 Constitution, such as allowing Aung San Suu Kyi to serve as President. Ethnic organizations do not accept the 2008 Constitution and are unlikely to comply with it. The NLD aims to amend provisions in the 2008 Constitution to allow Aung San Suu Kyi to become President after the 2015 elections. While opposition parties are willing to follow the amendment process, ethnic organizations are unlikely to comply with the constitution and prefer direct negotiations for a new constitution. The opposition groups prefer direct negotiations with the Union Government and the Tatmadaw for changes in the national government and a new constitution, rather than following the arduous process outlined in the 2008 Constitution for amending it. The 2008 Constitution outlines a challenging process for amending it, requiring support from 20% of Union Parliament members and 75% for adoption, with certain sections needing approval in a nationwide referendum. Opposition groups prefer direct negotiations for changes in the government and constitution. The 2008 Constitution requires support from 20% of Union Parliament members and 75% for adoption, with certain sections needing approval in a nationwide referendum. This includes provisions on the government structure and military's role in Parliament.

Approval from at least 50% of eligible voters is needed for the national referendum. The 2008 Constitution requires approval from 20% of Union Parliament members and 75% for adoption, with specific sections needing approval in a national referendum. This includes conditions for a state of emergency, eligibility for the President, and amending the Constitution.

The 2008 Constitution requires approval from 20% of Union Parliament members and 75% for adoption, with specific sections needing approval in a national referendum. Any amendment must obtain support from a portion of military appointees, indirectly gaining the Tatmadaw's support. It is uncertain if an acceptable amendment will satisfy ethnic organizations. The amendment must still be approved by more than 50% of eligible voters, which could be a challenge due to low voter turnout in past elections. The 113th Congress may play a more active role in shaping U.S. policy towards Burma.
