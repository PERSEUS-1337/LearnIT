    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was intended to establish a clear prohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability and provide broad coverage and effective remedies. However, Supreme Court decisions have narrowed the scope of protection, leaving out individuals Congress intended to protect. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 aimed to prevent discrimination based on disability and provide effective remedies. However, Supreme Court decisions have limited the protection intended by Congress, excluding many individuals from the Act's coverage. Congress recognized that disabilities should not hinder participation in society. Congress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to protect individuals with physical and mental impairments from discrimination and ensure their full participation in society. The Act acknowledges that disabilities should not prevent individuals from contributing to society due to prejudice or societal barriers. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 aims to protect individuals with physical and mental impairments from discrimination and ensure their full participation in society by removing societal and institutional barriers. Congress based the Act's definition of disability on the broad interpretation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 aligns its definition of disability with the broad interpretation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which includes actual and perceived limitations imposed by society. This broad conception was emphasized by the Supreme Court in the School Board of Nassau County v. Arline case. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 aligns its definition of disability with the broad interpretation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which includes actual and perceived limitations imposed by society. This broad conception was underscored by the Supreme Court in the School Board of Nassau County v. Arline case. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 aligns its definition of disability with the broad interpretation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Congress recognized that society's myths and fears about disability can be as limiting as physical impairments. However, the Supreme Court has not interpreted the term \"disability\" broadly as expected. The Supreme Court has ruled in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams that the definition of \"disability\" in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 needs to be interpreted strictly, creating a demanding standard for qualification as disabled. This goes against congressional expectations for a broad interpretation of the term. The Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), interpreted the definition of \"disability\" strictly, narrowing its application. This contradicts congressional intent for a broad interpretation under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The Supreme Court's interpretation of \"disability\" in Toyota Motor Manufacturing v. Williams contradicted the broad interpretation intended by Congress in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. This has led to individuals who have mitigated their impairments being excluded from the Act's coverage. The purpose of this Act is to eliminate discrimination and establish enforceable standards. The Act aims to restore the broad scope of protection under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and respond to Supreme Court decisions like Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc. and Murphy v. United Parcel Service, Inc. The Act aims to restore the broad scope of protection under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and respond to Supreme Court decisions that have narrowed the class of people who can invoke the protection from discrimination. The Act aims to reinstate the original congressional intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 by clarifying that protection is available for individuals subjected to adverse treatment based on an actual or perceived impairment. The Protection and Clarification Act of 1990 ensures that individuals facing adverse treatment due to actual or perceived impairments are protected. It also covers those affected by prejudiced attitudes and societal barriers related to disabilities. The Protection and Clarification Act of 1990 protects individuals from adverse treatment due to actual or perceived impairments, prejudiced attitudes, and societal barriers related to disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 includes findings to protect individuals from adverse treatment related to disabilities. Section 2(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to emphasize that physical and mental disabilities are natural parts of human experience and should not hinder a person's right to fully participate in society. Discrimination often prevents individuals with disabilities from participating, despite their talents, skills, abilities, and desire to do so. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 emphasizes that individuals with disabilities should not be hindered from fully participating in society due to discrimination. People with disabilities often face barriers despite their talents, skills, abilities, and desire to participate, leading to unequal treatment in history. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 aims to prevent discrimination against individuals with disabilities. It highlights the history of unequal treatment, restrictions, and limitations imposed on them, leading to their political powerlessness in society. Classifications and criteria that exclude individuals with disabilities are strongly discouraged.
