Congress finds that over 1 billion people in the developing world live in severe poverty, with high child mortality rates and preventable deaths from malnutrition and disease. Women in poverty face greater workloads and fewer opportunities compared to men. Nearly 33,000 children die each day from malnutrition and disease in developing countries, with women in poverty facing larger workloads and fewer opportunities than men. Directly aiding the poorest, especially women, has a positive impact on family incomes, child nutrition, health, and education. Directly aiding the poorest women in the developing world has a positive effect on family incomes, child nutrition, health, and education. Women often lack stable employment and turn to self-employment to support their families, but struggle to access credit at reasonable rates to improve their livelihood. Many poor women in the developing world lack stable employment and social safety nets, leading them to turn to self-employment. However, they struggle to access credit at reasonable rates to expand their businesses, often resorting to high-interest loans. Many poor women in the developing world lack stable employment and social safety nets, leading them to turn to self-employment. They struggle to access credit at reasonable rates to expand their businesses, often resorting to high-interest loans. An international Microcredit Summit aimed to expand access to credit for self-employment and other financial services to 100 million of the world's poorest families by 2005. The Summit in Washington, D.C., aimed to expand access to credit for self-employment and financial services to 100 million of the world's poorest families, particularly women, by 2005. This initiative would benefit nearly half of the world's 1 billion absolute poor by providing loans at reasonable interest rates, enabling them to grow their incomes and businesses significantly. The goal is to expand access to microcredit for the world's absolute poor, allowing them to increase their incomes and businesses significantly. NGOs like the Grameen Bank have been successful in lending directly to the very poor. NGOs like the Grameen Bank, Accion International, and FINCA have successfully provided microcredit to the very poor, with repayment rates of 95% or higher. Microcredit institutions not only reduce poverty but also decrease dependency on foreign aid by using interest income to cover institutional costs. Microcredit institutions with high repayment rates reduce poverty and foreign aid dependency. Interest income covers institutional costs, ensuring long-term sustainability. Loans are recycled, leveraging foreign assistance resources for new benefits to participants. Sustainable microcredit institutions provide credit, training, and mobilize development. The development of sustainable microcredit institutions is crucial for poverty reduction and economic development. In 1994, AID launched a Microenterprise Initiative to expand funding for microenterprise programs. In 1994, AID launched a Microenterprise Initiative with a funding goal of $137,000,000 for fiscal year 1994. The initiative aimed to support programs providing credit to the poorest with loans under $300 by the end of fiscal year 1996. Total funding for microenterprise increased in fiscal year 1996. In fiscal year 1996, AID's microenterprise funding decreased to $111,000,000, with only 39 percent allocated to programs benefiting the poorest with loans under $300. Increased investment in microcredit institutions serving the poorest is crucial for achieving the Microcredit Summit's goal. In fiscal year 1996, total funding for microenterprise activities decreased to $111,000,000, with only 39 percent used for programs benefiting the poorest with loans under $300. Increased investment in microcredit institutions serving the poorest is crucial for achieving the Microcredit Summit's goal. AID's funding for microenterprise activities in the developing world should be expanded to $160,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 to parallel the growing capacity of microcredit institutions in the developing world. The Microcredit Summit's goal is to expand AID's funding for microenterprise activities in the developing world to $160,000,000 for fiscal year 1999. This increase in funding will help reach tens of millions of the poorest with microcredit, focusing on institutions serving the poorest. The Microcredit Summit aims to increase US funding for international microcredit programs to reach millions of the poorest by expanding successful microcredit institutions and assisting them in developing their capacity. To expand successful microcredit institutions, assistance is needed in developing institutional capacity and tapping commercial capital sources. PVOs and NGOs have shown competence in creating networks of local microcredit institutions to reach the very poor and promote financial sustainability. AID should leverage partnerships with these organizations for effective outcomes. AID should prioritize investing in PVOs and NGOs to expand successful microcredit institutions and create a global infrastructure for providing financial services to the world's poorest families.
