The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002, also known as the Act, offers incentives for biodiesel use as a fuel through a new section in the Internal Revenue Code. The biodiesel fuels credit is determined based on the biodiesel mixture credit, which calculates the sum of the products of the biodiesel mixture rate for each qualified biodiesel mixture and the number of gallons of the mixture for the taxable year. The biodiesel fuels credit is calculated by multiplying the biodiesel mixture rate for each qualified mixture by the number of gallons of the mixture for the taxable year. The biodiesel mixture rate is 1 cent for each whole percentage point of biodiesel in the mixture, up to 20 percentage points. The biodiesel mixture rate for each qualified biodiesel mixture is 1 cent for each whole percentage point of biodiesel, not exceeding 20 percentage points. A qualified biodiesel mixture is a blend of diesel and biodiesel sold or used as fuel by the taxpayer. The term 'qualified biodiesel mixture' refers to a blend of diesel and biodiesel sold or used as fuel by the taxpayer. Biodiesel used in the production of a qualified biodiesel mixture is taken into account only if sold or used in a trade or business.
