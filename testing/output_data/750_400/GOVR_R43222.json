Harbor maintenance plays a critical role in facilitating U.S. foreign trade and reducing trade costs between different regions. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintaining federal waterways and harbor channels. Harbor maintenance is crucial for minimizing trade costs between the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. island territories. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintaining federal navigation channels, with the Water Resources Development Act being the main legislative tool for altering the Corps' Civil Works Program. Congress established harbor maintenance policy in 1986 when merchandise trade accounted for 14% of GDP. The Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) is key for changing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Civil Works Program, impacting harbor maintenance policy. In 1986, when current policy was set, merchandise trade was 14% of GDP, now it's 25%. Harbor maintenance is funded by a tax on waterborne cargo and cruise passengers. Trade now accounts for 25% of GDP, up from 14% in 1986, making decisions on harbor maintenance more crucial for the U.S. economy. The harbor maintenance tax (HMT) is 0.125% of cargo or cruise ticket value, primarily collected from imported waterborne cargo. Revenue from the tax goes into the harbor maintenance trust fund (HMTF) to cover the cost of dredging channels at coastal and Great Lakes ports. The harbor maintenance tax (HMT) is 0.125% of cargo or cruise ticket value, primarily collected from imported waterborne cargo. Revenue from the tax goes into the harbor maintenance trust fund (HMTF) to cover the cost of dredging channels at coastal and Great Lakes ports. The HMTF can only be accessed with an appropriation by Congress and is scored as federal receipts for budget purposes. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) funds the Corps' dredging, jetty maintenance, and lock operations along coasts and Great Lakes. HMTF requires congressional appropriation and surplus reduces federal deficit. About half of HMT collected annually is spent on harbor maintenance, with unspent funds accruing interest in the trust fund. The Harbor Maintenance Tax funds dredging, jetty maintenance, and lock operations. Surplus HMT receipts reduce the federal deficit. About half of HMT collected annually is spent on harbor maintenance, with unspent funds accruing interest in the trust fund, which had a balance of $8.5 billion in July 2013. In FY2014, the HMTF is expected to receive $2.05 billion in total income. The Administration's budget requests $923 million for harbor maintenance. The Harbor Maintenance Tax funds dredging, jetty maintenance, and lock operations. The trust fund balance was $8.5 billion in July 2013. In FY2014, the HMTF expects $2.05 billion in total income. Legislation in Congress aims to increase spending on harbor maintenance. The 113th Congress is considering bills to double spending on harbor maintenance using Harbor Maintenance Tax revenues, ensuring funds are used for maintenance rather than accumulating in the trust fund. H.R. 3080 would increase expenditures from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, with 80% of collected funds allocated to harbor maintenance by FY2020. This increased spending may impact funding for other Corps activities like harbor construction or flood control. Increasing spending from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) has the potential to reduce funding for other Corps activities like harbor construction or flood control. Congress may need to allocate more funds to the energy and water development appropriation to compensate for the increased HMTF funding, which could result in less funding for activities outside this appropriation to stay within total federal budget caps. Congress established the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) in 1986 to pay for eligible operations and maintenance costs of commercial navigation in harbors within the United States. Increasing HMTF funding may require reallocating funds from other activities funded under the Energy and Water Development Appropriations acts, potentially impacting total federal budget caps. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) was established by Congress in 1986 to cover eligible operations and maintenance costs for commercial navigation in U.S. harbors. This may involve reallocating funds from other activities funded under the Energy and Water Development Appropriations acts to stay within federal budget caps. Congress defined \"harbors\" as capable of transporting commercial cargo by commercial vessels, while \"inland harbors\" are used for accommodating commercial vessels and handling waterborne cargoes. Inland harbors must currently handle cargo, while coastal or Great Lakes harbors only need to be capable of handling cargo. The definition of \"commercial cargo\" includes passengers transported for compensation but excludes fresh-caught fish. Ferries are excluded from the definition of \"commercial vessel.\" The distinction between \"inland harbors\" and coastal or Great Lakes harbors lies in the requirement for inland harbors to currently handle cargo, while the latter only need to be capable of handling cargo. The definition of \"commercial cargo\" includes passengers transported for compensation but excludes fresh-caught fish. Ferries are not considered commercial vessels. The Corps has not made substantive changes to these definitions since 1986 and did not conduct a rulemaking to implement the harbor maintenance provisions in WRDA 1986. The Corps has not made substantive changes to the definitions of \"inland harbors\" and coastal or Great Lakes harbors since 1986. There is no Federal Register record of its interpretation of the act regarding harbor maintenance provisions. The Corps interprets \"commercial navigation\" as any project authorized by Congress with commercial navigation as an authorized purpose, with most harbor projects being authorized as \"single-purpose\" commercial navigation projects. Operations and maintenance costs at these harbors are payable from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. The Corps interprets \"commercial navigation\" as any project authorized by Congress with commercial navigation as an authorized purpose. Harbor projects are typically authorized as \"single-purpose\" commercial navigation projects, with operations and maintenance costs payable from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. For \"multi-purpose\" projects, only expenditures related to commercial navigation are eligible for recovery from the HMTF. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) only covers expenditures related to commercial navigation for multi-purpose projects. High-use ports, handling over 10 million tons of freight per year, received two-thirds of HMTF spending in FY2013. Almost all high-use ports had scheduled operations and maintenance activities. In FY2013, high-use ports handling over 10 million tons of freight accounted for 90% of maritime commerce and received two-thirds of HMTF spending. Moderate-use ports, handling between 1 million and 10 million tons, accounted for 9% of commerce and received 19% of HMTF spending. Low-use ports, handling 1% of commerce, received 5% of HMTF spending with 7% having federally funded O&M projects planned. In FY2013, \"moderate use\" ports handling 1-10 million tons of cargo received 19% of HMTF spending, with about half having O&M projects planned. Similarly, 7% of \"low use\" ports had federally funded O&M projects planned, receiving 5% of HMTF spending. This allocation of funds is a key point of debate in the HMTF discussion. The allocation of funds from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) in FY2013 showed that \"moderate use\" ports handling 1-10 million tons of cargo received 19% of spending, while \"low use\" ports received 5%. This distribution of funds is a key point of debate in the HMTF discussion, reflecting differences between S. 601 and H.R. 3080 on how funds should be allocated. Harbors classified as \"low use\" or \"moderate use\" receive limited federal funding, impacting their ability to support cargo, fishing, and recreational vessels, and affecting local economies. There is a debate on the allocation of Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) funds, with H.R. 3080 directing the Corps to consider factors beyond tonnage, while S. 601 seems to prioritize funding for large commercial ports. The allocation of Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) funds is debated, with H.R. 3080 directing the Corps to consider factors beyond tonnage, while S. 601 prioritizes funding for large commercial ports. Data shows that a significant portion of waterways eligible for HMTF spending have little to no cargo traffic. A total of 1,228 waterways eligible for HMTF funds, with 61% carrying no cargo and 75% handling little to no cargo. Administration's budget directs spending to high-use harbors based on volume. Almost 75% of the 50 waterways eligible for HMTF spending handle minimal cargo, with less than one Panamax shipload per year. The Administration's budget prioritizes high-use harbors based on cargo volume, favoring ports that handle oil, chemicals, grains, ores, and coal. The Administration's budget prioritizes high-use harbors based on cargo volume, favoring ports that handle tankers carrying oil, chemicals, bulk ships carrying grains, ores, and coal. A value-based metric could direct more funds to ports handling container ships, concentrating harbor maintenance funding on the five largest container ports in the US. The Administration's budget prioritizes high-use harbors based on cargo volume, favoring ports that handle tankers carrying oil, chemicals, bulk ships carrying grains, ores, and coal. A value-based metric could concentrate harbor maintenance funding on the five largest container ports in the US, which collectively handled about 56% of U.S. maritime container shipments in 2012. Ports defined as \"high use\" received only about half of the O&M funds requested by their Corps district engineers in FY2011. Moderate-use ports received about 30% of the funds requested, and low-use harbors received even less. In 2012, container shipments were significant. High-use ports received only half of the requested O&M funds in FY2011. Moderate-use ports got 30% of the funds, while low-use harbors received 10%. The total amount requested for low-use harbors was $766 million, close to the $922 million requested for the busiest harbors. Small harbors received only one-tenth of the funds needed according to local Corps officials. The total amount requested for low-use harbors was $766 million, nearly approaching the amount requested for the busiest harbors, $922 million. Small harbors received only one-tenth of the funds their local Corps officials thought they needed, while the most economically significant ports received only half of the funds requested. This shortfall is problematic as the busiest commercial shipping channels operated at their authorized widths and depths only 30% of the time in 2008. The most economically significant ports received only half of the funds requested, leading to a shortfall in funding. The 59 busiest commercial shipping channels operated at their authorized widths and depths only 30% of the time in 2008. The Corps allocates funding based on financial stresses, resulting in partial investments across many facilities rather than larger investments in critical facilities. The National Academy of Sciences study highlighted that the Corps allocates funding based on financial stresses, leading to partial investments across many facilities instead of focusing on critical ones. Harbor traffic is more concentrated in terms of ship capacity, with 90% of ship traffic occurring at the top 35 ports. If national economic benefit were the main criterion for spending, the Corps could justify concentrating O&M funds on high-use harbors. Harbor traffic is more concentrated in terms of ship capacity, with 90% of ship traffic occurring at the top 35 ports. The Corps might be justified in concentrating O&M funds on high-use harbors, but this could hinder the development of moderate-use ports and impact ports with significant fishing and recreational vessel traffic. The Corps focuses on high-use harbors for funding, potentially hindering the development of moderate-use ports and impacting ports with fishing and recreational vessel traffic. Maintenance work is done on 400 to 500 harbors and channels annually out of over 900 maintained by the Corps. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with maintenance work done on 400 to 500 of them annually. A 2012 study shows that the Corps actively maintains only 360 out of the authorized 1,400 coastal navigation projects. It is unclear if the Corps is maintaining fewer projects due to policy, funding, or maintenance needs. The Corps maintains 400 to 500 harbors and channels annually, but only actively maintains 360 out of 1,400 authorized coastal navigation projects. It is unclear if the decrease in maintenance is due to policy, funding, or maintenance needs. The Corps maintains 400 to 500 harbors and channels annually, but only actively maintains 360 out of 1,400 authorized coastal navigation projects. A 2001 letter from two Members of Congress prompted a Corps study in 2003, which highlighted the lack of systematic reevaluation of economic justification for harbor maintenance funding. Corps managers assume project authorizations mandate perpetual operation without considering changed circumstances, leading to passive stewardship of resources. The Corps lacks systematic reevaluation of economic justification for harbor projects, leading to passive stewardship of resources. Current policies are insufficient for identifying inefficient projects and need explicit requirements for confirming economic viability. The Corps' current policies and management tools are inadequate for identifying inefficient harbor projects and confirming economic viability. A 2003 study highlighted the need for explicit requirements to reevaluate projects that were authorized many decades ago. The 2003 Corps study emphasized the need for economic reevaluation of harbor projects authorized many decades ago, highlighting the outdated infrastructure and dispersion of maritime commerce in small harbors. The Corps retains responsibility for maintaining small harbors and protected channels, funded mainly by a cargo tax. Congress has allowed the Corps to divest some inland waterways projects no longer needed for commercial cargo transportation. The Corps maintains small harbors and channels primarily for pleasure boats using funds from a cargo tax. Congress has allowed the Corps to divest some inland waterways projects not needed for commercial cargo. The Corps focuses on directing funds to harbor maintenance projects of high commercial importance, using a \"Channel Portfolio Tool\" for prioritizing allocation based on data. The Corps has developed a \"Channel Portfolio Tool\" to prioritize funds for harbor maintenance projects based on commercial tonnage, value, and ship transits data. Budget guidance indicates the use of metrics to group projects and allocate funds objectively. The Corps uses data on commercial tonnage, value, and ship transits to assess dredging needs and prioritize funds for harbor maintenance projects. Budget guidance indicates the use of metrics to group projects and allocate funds objectively based on criteria such as tonnage, cost per ton, support for commercial fishing, public transportation, public safety, and national security. The Corps uses various criteria to allocate O&M funds to projects, including tonnage, cost per ton, support for commercial fishing, public transportation, public safety, national security, infrastructure condition, reliability, and legal requirements. The large number of criteria raises concerns about how many harbor navigation projects may not qualify for priority funding. The Corps uses various criteria to allocate O&M funds to projects, including tonnage, cost per ton, support for commercial fishing, public transportation, public safety, national security, infrastructure condition, reliability, and legal requirements. Concerns arise about how many harbor navigation projects may not qualify for priority funding. In 2008, the GAO recommended creating an advisory committee for input on national harbor maintenance projects, but no such committee has been established. Congress is concerned about the Corps' criteria for prioritizing projects. In 2008, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended creating an advisory committee for input on national harbor maintenance projects, but no such committee has been established. A 2010 GAO report raised concerns about the transparency of the Corps' project prioritization criteria and the return on investment. The Corps' budget process was found to focus more on anticipated rather than demonstrated project performance. Congress is concerned about the lack of transparency in the Corps' project prioritization criteria and the potential inefficiency in achieving the highest return on investment. The 2010 GAO audit highlighted that the Corps' budget process prioritized anticipated project performance over demonstrated results, but the Corps clarified that actual performance does influence budget priority for completed projects. The O&M budget reflects actual performance, with actual commercial use of projects determining budget priority. Opportunity cost is a significant metric for distributing funds efficiently to harbors, although not explicitly mentioned in the Corps' budget guidance. The commercial use of projects establishes budget priority. Opportunity cost is crucial for distributing O&M funds efficiently to harbors, even though not mentioned in the Corps' budget guidance. It involves determining if maintaining one harbor may result in losing greater economic benefits from another. The commercial use of projects establishes budget priority, with opportunity cost crucial for distributing O&M funds efficiently to harbors. \"X\" results in a loss of potentially greater economic benefits from failing to fully maintain harbor \"Y.\" Costs of operations and maintenance activities funded from the HMTF vary among ports, with higher costs at smaller ports compared to major cargo ports. The costs of operations and maintenance activities funded from the HMTF vary among ports, with higher costs at smaller ports compared to major cargo ports. O&M expenses at a particular harbor can fluctuate yearly, making an average over several years a better indicator. However, the Corps has not jointly analyzed the datasets on O&M expenses and waterway usage, making multi-year data unavailable to Congress. The Corps has not jointly analyzed datasets on O&M expenses and waterway usage, making multi-year data unavailable to Congress. HMTF pays 100% of federal costs for maintaining harbors up to 45 feet, with non-federal sponsors responsible for 50% of costs for harbors deeper than 45 feet. S. 601 would change the non-federal cost-sharing. S. 601 proposes changing the non-federal cost share requirement for harbor maintenance, so that local cost-sharing would only be required for channels deeper than 50 feet. New construction projects are not funded through the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) but are paid for from general government revenues. S. 601 would alter the non-federal cost share for harbor maintenance, requiring local cost-sharing only for channels deeper than 50 feet. Construction projects are not funded by the HMTF but from general government revenues, with federal shares ranging from 40% to 80% based on harbor depth. General fund expenditures for construction at coastal harbors in FY2013 totaled $175 million, offsetting HMT collections accumulated in the HMTF. The federal share of construction costs for coastal harbors ranges from 40% to 80% based on harbor depth. General fund expenditures for construction in FY2013 totaled $175 million, partially offsetting HMT collections. Berths and private side channels are not funded by HMTF money, limiting some ports' ability to draw on the fund. S. 601 would allow ports with excess HMT revenue to use funds for dredging berths or removing contaminated sediments, addressing limitations on HMTF usage. S. 601 and H.R. 3080 propose allowing ports with excess Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) revenue to use funds for dredging berths and removing contaminated sediments, potentially impacting distribution of funds among ports. H.R. 3080 expands the use of the Harbor Maintenance Tax Fund (HMTF) for dredging berths and contaminated sediments under certain conditions. There is wide variation in the amount of HMT generated at harbors, with top ports like Los Angeles and Long Beach generating a significant portion of total HMT revenue. In 2011, New York harbor generated $132 million, about 15% of total HMT collections. Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors generated a quarter of total HMT collections. The top 15 harbors collect over 75% of total HMT revenue, raising concerns about equity and efficiency. The Corps maintains harbors for public safety, including \"harbors of refuge\" for small craft. The Corps maintains harbors or channels for public safety reasons, including \"harbors of refuge\" for small craft. These harbors were authorized by Congress between 1850 and 1950 and are allocated O&M funds based on their critical importance, such as supporting Coast Guard search and rescue stations and providing supplies to isolated communities. The Corps prioritizes funding for critical harbors of refuge, subsistence harbors, and channels used by passenger ferries. In FY2011-FY2014 budget justifications, 30 harbors were identified for O&M funding based on their importance. The Corps prioritizes funding for critical harbors of refuge, subsistence harbors, and channels used by passenger ferries. In FY2011-FY2014 budget justifications, 30 harbors were identified for O&M funding based on their importance, with additional funding provided by House and Senate Appropriations Committees for maintenance of \"small, remote, or subsistence\" harbors. In FY2012-FY2014, House and Senate Appropriations Committees allocated an extra $30 million for maintenance of small, remote, or subsistence harbors. They criticized the administration's criteria for not allowing these harbors to compete for navigation maintenance funds and urged the Corps to revise the criteria. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees allocated an additional $30 million for maintenance of small, remote, or subsistence harbors in FY2012-FY2014. They criticized the administration's criteria for navigation maintenance, urging the Corps to revise the criteria to allow these harbors to compete for funds based on economic impact and importance to national defense or public health and safety. Maintenance projects are funded based on criteria that consider economic impact, national defense, and public health and safety importance. President Clinton proposed phasing out federal funding for harbors not contributing to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, totaling $63 million annually. This proposal was contentious between Congresses and Administrations. President Clinton proposed a two-year phase-out of federal funding for harbors that did not contribute to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, totaling about $63 million in annual expenditures. This proposal aimed to shift responsibility to state and local governments for maintaining non-contributing harbors, allowing the Corps to focus on national significance water projects. President Reagan had previously suggested terminating funding for non-contributing harbors as well. The Clinton Administration proposed shifting responsibility for maintaining harbors not contributing to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund to state and local governments, focusing the Corps on national water projects. President Reagan had also suggested cutting funding for non-contributing harbors to save federal expenditures. The Reagan Administration proposed terminating funding for harbors with federal maintenance costs exceeding $1 per ton of cargo, estimated to save about $150 million annually. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund was enacted as a user fee after Congress rejected the original proposal to allow local port authorities to assess fees on ships for maintenance. Debate over maintaining harbors with little commercial cargo dates back to the 1950s. The Administration proposed allowing local port authorities to assess fees on ships for harbor maintenance and construction. Debate over maintaining harbors with little commercial cargo dates back to the 1950s, with the Corps' policy not to maintain harbors not extensively used by commercial navigation. Minimum appropriations in recent years have prevented the use of federal funds for these harbors. In 1954, the House Committee on Appropriations endorsed a policy stating that the federal government is not obligated to maintain waterways that are no longer economically viable for commercial navigation. A 1956 audit found that the Corps did not adhere to this policy, highlighting the need for a reassessment of the maintenance of specific waterways and harbors. The 1956 audit by the General Accounting Office found that the Corps was maintaining waterways predominantly used by recreational boaters or a single shipper, contrary to their stated policy. The GAO recommended that Congress establish specific policies and criteria for determining which navigation projects should be federally funded. The 1956 GAO audit found that the Corps was maintaining waterways used mainly by recreational boaters or a single shipper, contrary to policy. GAO recommended Congress establish specific criteria for federally funded navigation projects. In 2011, 11 coastal projects received $12 million in O&M spending and generated $1.5 million in HMT revenues, with only two projects still carrying cargo. One highlighted project was the Okeechobee Waterway in Florida. In 2011, GAO identified 11 coastal navigation projects of questionable value, receiving $12 million in O&M spending and generating $1.5 million in HMT revenues. Only two projects still carry cargo. The Okeechobee Waterway in Florida was recommended to be reclassified as a flood-control project due to negligible navigation benefit, but it continued to receive HMTF expenditures. In 2012, it handled 21 barges and a total of 2,000 tons. The cross-Florida waterway was recommended for reclassification as a flood-control project due to minimal navigation benefits, but it still received $30 million from the HMTF between FY1999 to FY2008. In 2012, it handled 21 barges and 2,000 tons of cargo, along with 3,997 recreational vessels. Another criticized project, the Anahuac Channel and Trinity River project in Texas, received $17 million from FY1999 to FY2008 but has seen no recent cargo movement. The Anahuac Channel and Trinity River project in Texas received $17 million from FY1999 to FY2008 but has seen no recent cargo movement. Recent budget requests have allocated O&M expenses to flood risk mitigation instead of navigation. A 2008 Corps study found that recreational boaters on the Great Lakes spent $2.4 billion per year on boating trips and $1.4 billion per year on vessels, equipment, and supplies, creating 60,000 jobs. Recreational boaters on the Great Lakes spend billions annually on trips and equipment, creating thousands of jobs. They do not contribute to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund but pay federal fuel taxes for various boating-related purposes. Recreational boaters support job creation through spending on trips and equipment. They pay federal fuel taxes for boating-related purposes, such as fish habitat restoration and boating safety programs. Some in the industry have proposed using motorboat fuel taxes for dredging recreational harbors. The use of boat fuel taxes for harbor dredging has historical roots in funding practices. A pilot program is being conducted to explore local financing for waterways on the Atlantic Coast. However, crucial information needed to assess the need for increased spending on harbor maintenance is not publicly available. The Corps has started a pilot program on low-commercial-use waterways on the Atlantic Coast to explore local financing feasibility. However, crucial information needed to assess increased spending on harbor maintenance is not publicly available, including current HMTF expenditure reports. The Corps collects data on harbor usage and O&M expenses, including cargo tonnage and vessel information since 1922. Congress requested annual reports on HMTF expenditures, with the most recent report covering FY2005 and FY2006. The Corps continues to seek funds for these reports in its budget justifications. The Corps has been collecting data on harbor usage and O&M expenses since 1922. They track cargo tonnage, vessel information, and O&M expenditures on each facility. However, there is a discrepancy in the facility nomenclature between the tonnage and expenditure databases. Additionally, the Corps documents do not compare the depth and width of shipping channels to their authorized levels. The Corps has been tracking O&M expenditures on facilities since 1977, but there is a discrepancy in the nomenclature between databases. They do not compare channel dimensions to authorized levels or estimate economic losses from deficiencies. The Navigation Economic Technologies Program aims to address these issues. The Corps aims to maintain shipping channels to authorized dimensions or as needed for modern vessels. They do not estimate economic losses from deficiencies or the benefits of correcting them. The Navigation Economic Technologies Program (NETS) develops economic tools for navigation improvement evaluation. The program ensures wise investment of tax dollars in navigation projects for long-term value. The Navigation Economic Technologies Program (NETS) aims to develop economic tools for evaluating navigation improvement projects to ensure wise investment of tax dollars in long-term value. The program focuses on economic analysis of construction dredging projects rather than on the economics of operating and maintaining existing harbors and channels at authorized dimensions. The NETS program focuses on economic analysis of construction dredging projects rather than on maintaining existing harbors and channels at authorized dimensions. Congress requested the Corps to estimate the nationwide average availability of authorized depth and width of maintained channels from the annual budget request starting in FY2014. In July 2012, Congress requested the Corps to estimate the nationwide average availability of authorized depth and width of maintained channels from the annual budget request starting in FY2014. The Federal Maritime Commission estimated the average HMT payment for a 40-foot shipping container is $109, with a small HMT rate of 0.125% compared to cargo value. The Federal Maritime Commission estimated the average HMT payment for a 40-foot shipping container is $109, with a small HMT rate of 0.125% compared to cargo value. The cost of shipping a 40-foot container from an Asian port to the U.S. Midwest is around $4,000, with an average container value of $117,606. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) rate of 0.125% is small compared to cargo value but significant when compared to typical freight charges. Shipping a 40-foot container from Asia to the U.S. Midwest costs around $4,000, with an average container value of $117,606. The HMT of $147 raises shipping costs by about 4%, leading to diversion of cargo to Canadian and Mexican ports without a similar tax. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) of $147, based on a container value of $117,606, raises shipping costs by about 4%, leading to cargo diversion to Canadian and Mexican ports without a similar tax. Factors like risk mitigation and rail rate disparities also influence shippers' decisions. A 2012 FMC study found that factors like risk mitigation and rail rate disparities, not just the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT), lead shippers to use ports in Canada or Mexico. The study estimated that removing the HMT or imposing an equivalent fee on cargo through Canadian ports could divert 59,000 to 72,500 containers per year to U.S. ports. The FMC study found that removing the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) or imposing an equivalent fee on cargo through Canadian ports could divert 59,000 to 72,500 containers per year to U.S. ports. Senators Murray and Cantwell plan to introduce legislation to replace the HMT with a maritime goods movement user fee paid by shippers using ports in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. The FMC study found that replacing the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) with a maritime goods movement user fee could divert containers from Canadian ports to U.S. ports. Senators Murray and Cantwell plan to introduce legislation for this change. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) may hinder transshipment of cargo by sea within U.S. ports, especially for coastal feeder services. The tax is levied twice if cargo is unloaded at one U.S. port and reloaded onto another ship, discouraging this type of service. This could impact the competition with road and rail for container transshipment at U.S. ports. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) is levied twice on cargo unloaded at one U.S. port and reloaded on another ship, discouraging coastal feeder services. This tax affects the price competitiveness of some U.S. exports and leads to uncollected revenue of up to $500 million per year from domestic waterborne shippers. Unlike import duties, the HMT is not refundable under CBP's \"duty drawback\" program. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) leads to uncollected revenue of up to $500 million per year from domestic waterborne shippers. Unlike import duties, the HMT is not refundable under CBP's \"duty drawback\" program, affecting the price competitiveness of some U.S. exports. The duty drawback program refunds import duties on parts used in U.S. exports to maintain price competitiveness. Exporters don't pay HMT for port use when exporting, but do pay on materials transported through ports. WRDA debate is amid concerns over supply chain cost-effectiveness. House and Senate Appropriations Committees are worried about the President's budget requests. The debate over WRDA is happening in the context of concerns about supply chain cost-effectiveness. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees are worried about the President's budget requests for Corps O&M not being sufficient for global competitiveness. The U.S. Departments of Transportation and Commerce are working on promoting international competitiveness through additional funds for harbors. The President's budget requests for Corps O&M have raised concerns about global competitiveness. The U.S. Departments of Transportation and Commerce are focusing on promoting international competitiveness through additional funds for harbors as part of the Competitive Supply Chain Initiative. The Department of Transportation and Commerce have launched the Competitive Supply Chain Initiative to strategically improve the nation's marine transportation system and infrastructure to enhance America's national competitiveness. Supply chain competitiveness impacts product costs, global prices, and investment decisions. Supply chain competitiveness is crucial as it affects product costs, global prices, and investment decisions. Policymakers, management, and academics need to ensure that supply chains and transportation infrastructure are aligned for efficiency. The battleground for corporate competitiveness is now focused on the speed and efficiency of supply chain management. Policymakers, management leadership, and academics must ensure that supply chains and transportation infrastructure are aligned with strategic priorities. In March 2012, the Corps and the U.S. Department of Transportation signed a memorandum of understanding to improve transportation infrastructure investments. The Corps and the U.S. Department of Transportation signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2012 to align transportation infrastructure investments with national priorities. President Obama announced an initiative in 2012 to expedite federal permitting for construction projects at five harbors in anticipation of the Panama Canal expansion in 2015. President Obama announced an initiative in 2012 to expedite federal permitting for construction projects at five harbors in anticipation of the Panama Canal expansion in 2015. In his FY2013 Budget, the President established a Task Force on Ports to strategically allocate federal investments in response to calls from state and local governments, ports, and maritime stakeholders."
