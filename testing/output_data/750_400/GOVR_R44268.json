The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 allocated funds for dioxin remediation and health/disability programs in Vietnam, with a minimum of $10,000,000 for health programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. The act permits assistance to the Government of Vietnam for the first time since the United States funded dioxin environmental remediation in Vietnam. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 allocated not less than $20 million for dioxin remediation in Vietnam, including assistance to the Government of Vietnam, for areas contaminated with Agent Orange or dioxin. In March 2018, the 115th Congress allocated at least $20 million for dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam, with funds available for assistance to the Government of Vietnam. An additional $10 million was allocated for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange and dioxin. In February 2019, the 116th Congress appropriated not less than $20 million for activities related to the remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam. Additionally, not less than $12.5 million was allocated for health and disability programs in affected areas. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 allocated funds for remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and health programs in affected areas, with USAID responsible for fund obligation. The State Department has designated USAID as the responsible agency for the obligation of funds appropriated for health and disability programs in areas contaminated with Agent Orange and dioxin in Vietnam. USAID has obligated a significant portion of the allocated funds for environmental remediation projects and other related activities. USAID has obligated a significant portion of the allocated funds for environmental remediation projects and health- and disability-related services in Vietnam. As of May 2018, USAID has obligated 81% of the $127 million appropriated for environmental remediation projects and 63.5% of the $44.3 million for health- and disability-related services over FY2011 to FY2017. USAID has obligated a significant portion of funds for environmental remediation and health- and disability-related services in Vietnam. Concerns have been raised by Congress regarding the pace of utilization of funds for health and disability activities. Concerns have been raised by Congress about the pace of utilization of funds for health and disability activities, particularly in comparison to environmental remediation funds. Congress has designated that health and disability services funded for Agent Orange/dioxin-related activities in Vietnam should be provided near contaminated areas. Since FY2007, Congress has appropriated funds for Agent Orange/dioxin-related activities in Vietnam, with a focus on providing health programs near contaminated areas. In FY2007, $3 million was allocated for health programs in communities near contaminated sites. In FY2007, $3 million was allocated for health programs in communities near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated areas in Vietnam. Subsequent appropriations in following years continued to support environmental remediation and health activities in affected communities. The conferees recommended allocating at least $5,000,000 for health/disability activities in areas in Vietnam contaminated with Agent Orange or dioxin. It is unclear if the State Department and USAID have consistently used these funds as directed. Funds for health and disability services were allocated to programs in Danang from FY2007 to FY2009, but for FY2010 to FY2013, the use of appropriated funds was largely unspecified. The State Department and USAID may not have consistently obligated funds for health and disability services in areas contaminated with dioxin. Funds were allocated to programs in Danang from FY2007 to FY2009, but from FY2010 to FY2013, funds were largely obligated to Development Alternatives, Inc. for a disability support program not specifically targeting Agent Orange/dioxin \"hot spots.\" This program ended in January 2016. The State Department and USAID shifted funding for health and disability services away from programs in areas contaminated with dioxin. Funds were allocated to Development Alternatives, Inc. for a disability support program that ended in January 2016. USAID then began directly obligating smaller amounts of funds for health- and disability-related services and increased outreach to Vietnamese nongovernmental organizations. As of FY2014, USAID shifted to directly obligating smaller funds for health- and disability-related services in Vietnam, increasing outreach to Vietnamese nongovernmental organizations. This change is reflected in Table 1. One significant activity funded by congressional appropriations is the environmental remediation project at Danang Airport related to Agent Orange/dioxin. One of the main activities funded by congressional appropriations in Vietnam is the environmental remediation project at Danang Airport, related to Agent Orange/dioxin. The project has faced delays, increased material for decontamination, and rising costs since its inception in 2008. USAID aimed to complete the project by October 2013, but a November 2014 audit showed estimated delays. The environmental remediation project at Danang airport, funded by the U.S. and Vietnamese governments, experienced delays, increased material for decontamination, and rising costs. The estimated completion date was March 31, 2017, with decontamination finished in August 2017. Material to be decontaminated rose from 61,700 m3 to 90,000 m3, plus an additional 60,000 m3 of \"lower risk material.\" The U.S. government audit revealed that the decontamination project at Danang airport, a former U.S. military hub, was completed in August 2017, surpassing the estimated completion date of March 31, 2017. The project saw an increase in the amount of material to be decontaminated, with costs escalating from $33.7 million to over $110 million. Soil at the airport had high levels of \"TCDD toxic equivalents\" (TEQ), exceeding international standards by 365 times. The cost of the decontamination project at Danang airport increased from $33.7 million to over $110 million. The airport was a major hub for the U.S. military's Operation Ranch Hand, with soil concentrations exceeding international standards by 365 times. Work on the project began in December 2009 with a memorandum of understanding between the State Department and Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment. The decontamination project at Danang airbase exceeded the international maximum standard of 1.0 ppb in 17 out of 23 soil samples. The project began in December 2009 with a memorandum of understanding between the State Department and Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment, designating USAID and Office 33 as implementing agencies. The MOU covered $6.0 million in funds for environmental health and remediation programs. The MOU between the State Department and Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources designated USAID and Office 33 to implement environmental health and remediation programs in Danang, with $6.0 million in funds. Activities included a grant to CDM International, Inc., for an environmentally sound engineering approach to dioxin containment at Danang airport. USAID's Environmental Assessment recommended thermal desorption to decontaminate 61,700 m3 of material in six \"hotspots\" at the airport. In June 2010, USAID completed an Environmental Assessment of Danang airport recommending thermal desorption to decontaminate 61,700 m3 of material in six \"hotspots\" at a cost of $33.7 million. A Memorandum of Intent was signed with Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence in December 2010 to start the remediation project. The Environmental Assessment recommended thermal desorption to decontaminate \"hotspots\" at Danang airport, costing $33.7 million. USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a Memorandum of Intent in December 2010 to start the project, with the goal of completion by October 2013. USAID posted a Request for Proposals in May 2011, and awarded the project in July 2012. The remediation project at Danang airport was approved in early 2011, with USAID awarding contracts in July 2012 to CDM Smith and Tetra Tech, Inc. for project oversight and construction management. In July 2012, USAID awarded contracts to CDM Smith and Tetra Tech, Inc. for the environmental remediation of Danang airport. CDM Smith received $8.37 million for project oversight, while Tetra Tech, Inc. was granted $17 million for excavation and construction. The project was launched on August 9, 2012, with onsite work starting on August 20, 2012. An internal USAID audit in November 2014 revealed six contracts awarded for the environmental assessment and remediation project at Danang airport. The Danang airport environmental remediation project was launched in August 2012 with onsite work starting on August 20, 2012. An internal USAID audit in November 2014 revealed six contracts awarded for the project, including thermal desorption of contaminated soil done in two phases. The Danang airport remediation project involved thermal desorption of contaminated soil in two phases. Phase 1 treated 45,000 m3 of soil, removing over 95% of dioxin by April 2015. Phase 2 excavation followed. The gradual heating of Phase 1 for soil treatment began in April 2014, removing over 95% of dioxin by April 2015. Phase 2 excavation started in January 2015, with soil treatment completed in August 2017. Progress on Danang airport decontamination was delayed by various factors, including weather. The excavation for Phase 2 at Danang airport began in January 2015, involving draining lakes and removing exposed lake beds. Soil treatment for Phase 2 started in November 2016 and was finished in August 2017. Progress was delayed due to weather and increased soil testing requirements. The secondary treatment facility was closed in July 2014 for system changes. Weather during Vietnam's rainy season hindered progress on soil excavation and thermal treatment area construction. More soil and sediment than estimated needed decontamination after small lakes were drained. The secondary treatment facility was shut down in July 2014 for a filtering system change. Raising the soil temperature to 335\u00b0C took longer than expected. An internal audit by USAID's Office of Inspector General in November 2014 identified potential risks that could delay the environmental remediation project and increase its overall cost. The internal audit by USAID's Office of Inspector General in November 2014 highlighted risks that could delay the environmental remediation project, including issues with inclement weather and soil cooling. It recommended implementing a formal risk management plan to address these concerns.

The U.S. government has provided over $60 million in assistance to disabled Vietnamese, including funds for health services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated sites. State Department and USAID utilized funds for grants to improve the quality of life for persons with disabilities in Danang. USAID assessment noted accomplishments of these programs but mentioned the short three-year time period. Between FY2007 and FY2010, the State Department and USAID used funds for grants to improve the quality of life for persons with disabilities in Danang. A USAID assessment in December 2010 recognized the accomplishments of these programs but noted the short three-year time frame. In 2012, USAID approved a nationwide Persons with Disability Support Program (PDSP) to be implemented with Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) and Vietnam Assistance for the Handicapped (VNAH). The three-year time period for the nationwide Persons with Disability Support Program (PDSP) approved by USAID in 2012 was considered very short for meeting program objectives. The project was to be jointly implemented with Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) and Vietnam Assistance for the Handicapped (VNAH), with a geographic focus primarily in Danang and other areas with a high disability burden. The PDSP program, approved by USAID in 2012, aimed to build on previous assistance to people with disabilities in Danang and other high-need areas. The project's focus was primarily in Danang, with potential expansion to regions with dioxin hot spots. Funding was initially set at $9 million, with grants awarded to local partners for assistance programs. The RFA for the PDSP program called for a needs assessment in Bien Hoa and Phu Cat, with initial funding set at $9 million. DAI awarded grants for health services, rehabilitation therapy, vocational training, and community awareness to assist persons with disabilities. USAID also supported VNAH in addressing disability policy and legal framework needs in Vietnam. The program was headquartered in Danang and operated in Binh Dinh and Danang provinces. The USAID PDSP program provided assistance to persons with disabilities in Vietnam, including health services, rehabilitation therapy, vocational training, and community awareness. It also worked on disability policy and legal framework needs with VNAH. The program initially operated in Binh Dinh, Danang, and Dong Nai provinces, focusing on dioxin \"hot spots\" like Phu Cat, Danang, and Bien Hoa. It was later extended to Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, and Thua Thien-Hue provinces heavily affected by Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. The USAID PDSP program extended to provinces heavily affected by Agent Orange during the Vietnam War, providing nearly US$900,000 in grants to local partners and organizations. USAID adopted a new approach to assisting persons with disabilities in Vietnam in June 2014. USAID provided grants to local partners and organizations in provinces affected by Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. The program aimed to assist persons with disabilities by improving health, independence, and participation in economic and social life. USAID aims to provide assistance to vulnerable populations in Vietnam, including persons with disabilities, by addressing key challenges and improving health, independence, and participation in economic and social life. This includes financing therapies and training for practitioners in delivering services to persons with disabilities. Target areas for these programs are to be determined. USAID will finance physical, occupational, and speech therapies for persons with disabilities in Vietnam, targeting high poverty areas like Binh Dinh, Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, Thai Binh, and Thua Thien-Hue. The USAID program will target high poverty areas in Vietnam for physical, occupational, and speech therapies for persons with disabilities. The provinces of Binh Dinh, Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, Thai Binh, and Thua Thien-Hue have been identified for the program. USAID will directly administer the new approach in consultation with Vietnamese agencies. Joint efforts are underway to clean up the dioxin \"hot spot\" at the Bien Hoa airbase, heavily sprayed during the war. The Vietnamese government, in consultation with various agencies, will directly administer the new approach for environmental cleanup at Bien Hoa airbase, a dioxin \"hot spot\" heavily sprayed during the war. Soil samples from the airbase showed TEQ concentrations over 1,000 ppb, much higher than the international limit. Mitigation efforts have already been conducted. The Bien Hoa airbase, heavily sprayed with Agent Orange during the war, has high dioxin contamination levels. Mitigation measures have been taken, including a passive landfill for contaminated soil. However, other dioxin \"hot spots\" at the airbase remain unaddressed. The government has conducted mitigation measures at Bien Hoa airbase to contain dioxin contamination, including a passive landfill for contaminated soil. However, other dioxin \"hot spots\" at the airbase have not been addressed, leading to the spread of contaminated soil into nearby water bodies. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is involved in the remediation efforts. A study by Hatfield Consultants hired by Office 33 found contaminated soil spreading from dioxin \"hot spots\" at Bien Hoa airbase into nearby water bodies, increasing the need for treatment. The UNDP has been working with Office 33 and MONRE for five years to map out the contamination and develop a remediation plan, estimating 250,000 m3 of soil requiring decontamination at a cost of $250 million. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been collaborating with Office 33 and MONRE for five years to map dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa airbase and develop a remediation plan. An estimated 250,000 m3 of soil needs decontamination with a cost of $250 million. USAID contracted CDM International Inc. in September 2013 to assess dioxin remediation alternatives at the airbase, with the final report released in May 2016. In September 2013, USAID contracted CDM International Inc. to conduct an environmental assessment of the Bien Hoa airbase, partnering with Hatfield Consulting. The final report in May 2016 revealed 408,500 to 495,300 m3 of contaminated soils and sediments on or near the airbase. Five treatment methods were considered, with costs ranging from $250 million. The report estimated that 408,500 to 495,300 m3 of contaminated soils and sediments are present at or near the airbase. Five treatment methods were evaluated, with costs ranging from $137 million to $794 million. The estimated costs could vary by 40% less to 75% more, expanding the possible range to between $82 million and $1.4 billion. Over $3.7 million has been obligated by USAID for the project. The estimated costs for environmental remediation at Bien Hoa Airbase range from $137 million to $794 million, with potential variations of 40% less to 75% more. USAID has allocated over $3.7 million for the project, and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence has announced infrastructure construction for dioxin decontamination at the airbase with a budget of $11.8 million.

USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum of intent to begin the decontamination process. On January 23, 2018, USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum of intent to decontaminate Bien Hoa airport. The MOI commits the two nations to work together on a $183 million nonrefundable aid agreement for a five-year remediation program. U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Daniel J. Kritenbrink expressed optimism about the partnership for a prosperous future. The Ministry of National Defence and USAID signed a $183 million aid agreement for the decontamination of Bien Hoa airport, projected to take 10 years at an estimated cost of $390 million. Approximately 500,000 cubic meters of soil are to be decontaminated. The Ministry of National Defence signed a $183 million aid agreement with Shimizu Corporation to construct a decontamination factory at Bien Hoa airport. The factory will use a filtered sponge technique to decontaminate 40 tons of soil per hour. The Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum of understanding with Shimizu Corporation to build a decontamination factory at Bien Hoa airport. The factory will use a filtered sponge technique to decontaminate soil at a lower cost than the thermal desorption method used at Danang airport. U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited Bien Hoa airport and emphasized America's commitment to remediate past issues. The new technique at Bien Hoa airport is expected to cost half as much as in-pile thermal desorption. U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited the former Agent Orange storage site, emphasizing America's commitment to remediate past issues. Congressional interest in Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam focuses on determining appropriate remediation measures. Congressional interest in Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam has focused on providing assistance to address environmental damage and health effects, as well as overseeing the utilization of such assistance by the State Department and USAID. The Obama Administration and Congress share a common interest in remediation efforts. The State Department and USAID are determining the appropriate assistance for environmental damage and health effects of dioxin contamination in Vietnam. Congress and administrations have shown interest in providing aid for Agent Orange projects in Vietnam. Funding has been requested for decontamination of dioxin \"hot spots\" in Vietnam.
