The agreement cuts funding for the MEADS system from $44 million to $24 million and requires the Defense Department to include MEADS in future budget plans. Only $10 million is provided in the appropriations conference agreement. Funding for the Airborne Laser program was reduced, while funding for Space-Based Laser R&D was increased. The authorization conference agreement aligns with the Senate's decisions, including reducing funding for new aircraft carrier development. The authorization and appropriations conference agreements reduced funding for new aircraft carrier development following the Navy's decision not to pursue a \"clean sheet\" design for a new carrier. The Navy wanted to use some of the money for progressive changes in the current design. The authorization conference agreement provides $110 million and the appropriations conference agreement provides $105 million out of the $190 million requested. The Navy decided not to pursue a new \"clean sheet\" design for a carrier, opting instead for progressive changes in the current design.

The authorization conference includes pilot projects to test FEHBP for military retirees, supplementing TRICARE with Medicare, and providing access to TRICARE pharmacy benefits. Budget constraints, QDR results, and ongoing debates on social issues contribute to a broad agenda in the defense debate. Key discussions involve military base closures, Bosnia funding, and controls on technology exports to China. Key matters of discussion in this year's defense debate included military base closures, Bosnia funding, technology export controls, efficiency measures, military readiness, defense modernization funding, personnel levels, National Guard and Reserve funding, and major weapons programs. The defense debate for FY1999 included discussions on funding, technology exports, efficiency measures, military readiness, defense modernization, personnel levels, National Guard and Reserve funding, major weapons programs, social issues, and other matters such as military health care policy and Year 2000 computer problems. The FY1999 defense debate included discussions on funding, technology exports, efficiency measures, military readiness, defense modernization, personnel levels, National Guard and Reserve funding, major weapons programs, social issues like sexual harassment and gender-integrated training, military health care policy, and Year 2000 computer problems. Budget constraints affected the defense debate, with Congress facing a \"zero-sum game\" due to the agreed level of defense spending. The FY1999 defense budget debate in Congress was constrained by budget agreements, leading to a \"zero-sum game\" where any additions to favored programs had to be offset by reductions in others. This marked a departure from previous years where Congress added substantial amounts to defense budget requests. In FY1999, Congress had to offset any additional funding for favored defense programs with reductions in other areas, a departure from previous years. Congress eventually added $8.3 billion for defense programs in the omnibus appropriations bill, leading to potential confrontation with the Administration over defense priorities. Congress added $8.3 billion for defense programs in the omnibus appropriations bill, potentially leading to a confrontation with the Administration over defense priorities. Administration officials tried to avoid conflicts by meeting Congress halfway on programs of ongoing interest. Congress added $8.3 billion for defense programs in the omnibus appropriations bill, potentially leading to a confrontation with the Administration over defense priorities. Senior Administration officials tried to avoid conflicts by meeting Congress halfway on programs of ongoing interest, fully funding national missile defense development, requesting more money for National Guard and Reserve equipment, identifying and funding all defense health program costs, and moving funding for the next Nimitz-class aircraft carrier forward one year to avoid production gaps. In FY1999, Congress added $8.3 billion for defense programs in the omnibus appropriations bill, avoiding a contentious debate over priorities. They fully funded national missile defense development, requested more money for National Guard and Reserve equipment, identified and funded all defense health program costs, and moved funding for the next Nimitz-class aircraft carrier forward one year to avoid production gaps. Some money was provided for unrequested weapons programs and other priorities, but in relatively small amounts. The FY1999 defense authorization and appropriations bills did not spark a contentious debate over priorities. Congress added $8.3 billion for defense programs in the omnibus appropriations bill, with only $1 billion going towards ballistic missile defense. The Quadrennial Defense Review from the previous year also influenced the congressional defense debate. The FY1999 defense appropriations bill added $8.3 billion for defense programs, with $1 billion allocated for ballistic missile defense. The congressional defense debate was influenced by the Quadrennial Defense Review, Defense Reform Initiative report, and National Defense Panel report from the previous year. The QDR, Defense Reform Initiative report, and National Defense Panel report in 1997 reassessed U.S. defense policy and identified efficiency measures. The QDR proposed a revised U.S. defense strategy and emphasized the need for U.S. forces to prevail in two theaters. These reports will continue to be important topics of discussion in Congress. The QDR released in December 1997 proposed a broad U.S. defense strategy, emphasized the need for U.S. forces to win in two major theater wars, and addressed the challenges posed by smaller contingency operations in the post-Cold War era. It also identified key elements of the \"revolution in military affairs\" (RMA). The QDR and Defense Reform Initiative focused on increasing efficiency to save money for weapons modernization and endorsed military base closures. The National Defense Panel report supported these measures but also called for a greater emphasis on homeland defense. The National Defense Panel report endorsed the QDR's focus on efficiency measures and shaping the international security environment. However, it also called for a greater emphasis on homeland defense and preparing for future threats. The Panel recommended shifting focus from preparing for two major theater wars to investing more in experimental force exercises and new technology. The National Defense Panel report called for a shift in focus towards homeland defense and preparing for future threats. It recommended investing $5 to $10 billion more each year in experimental force exercises and new technology. Additionally, the Panel supported two more rounds of military base closures to save money for defense modernization programs. The Defense Department proposed two rounds of military base closures to save money for defense modernization programs. Secretary Cohen made congressional approval of the closure rounds a top priority. The Defense Department proposed two rounds of military base closures to save money for defense modernization programs. Secretary Cohen prioritized congressional approval for the closure rounds in 2001 and 2005. The Defense Department's report reaffirmed earlier estimates of annual savings from previous closure rounds. The Defense Department's report on base closures reaffirmed earlier estimates of annual savings from previous closure rounds, projecting $2.8 billion in savings from two future closure rounds. This savings is crucial for funding upcoming weapons programs, despite resistance in Congress. Future base closure rounds, each as large as the earlier average, will lead to annual savings of $2.8 billion when fully phased in. Resistance to more base closures in Congress has been hardened by objections to Administration action following the 1995 base closure round. The 1995 Base Closure Commission recommended closing two Air Force aircraft depot maintenance facilities, leading to concerns about privatization. The 1995 Base Closure Commission recommended closing two Air Force aircraft depot maintenance facilities in Sacramento, California, and San Antonio, Texas. The White House developed a plan to \"privatize in place\" at these sites, allowing private contractors to bid for contracts. The Administration argues that competition for contracts has led to better prices, but many Members of Congress have objections to this plan. The Administration implemented a plan to \"privatize in place\" at two Air Force maintenance facilities, allowing private contractors to bid for contracts. This led to competition for contracts and better prices, but many Members of Congress criticized the politicization of the base closure process. Last year, a dispute over ensuring adequate work for remaining public facilities delayed the defense authorization bill, and lawmakers raised concerns about a White House request for the Defense Department to encourage privatization. The Administration's plan to \"privatize in place\" at Air Force maintenance facilities sparked criticism from Congress for politicizing the base closure process. Lawmakers raised concerns about a White House request for privatization and erosion of support for further base closures. Secretary Cohen responded by suggesting Congress could prohibit privatization in future base decisions. The Defense Department is considering privatizing work at the Sacramento facility, despite concerns raised in congressional hearings about the impact of privatization on future base closures. Secretary Cohen suggested that Congress could prohibit privatization in future base closure legislation and advocated for more base closures to be approved in the FY2000-2005 defense plan. Cohen suggested prohibiting privatization in future base closure legislation and advocated for more base closures in the FY2000-2005 defense plan. Congress did not approve additional military base closures in the FY1999 defense authorization, with the Senate rejecting a proposal for one more closure round in 2001. Congress did not approve additional military base closures in the FY1999 defense authorization. The Senate rejected a proposal for one more closure round in 2001, with SASC voting down a measure to approve it. Senator Inhofe's amendment to make it harder for DOD to realign facilities without a base closure process was approved by the Senate, but ultimately dropped. Senator Inhofe predicted that Congress will approve another base closure round for 2001. The Senate approved Senator Inhofe's amendment to make it harder for DOD to realign facilities without a base closure process, but it was ultimately dropped. Senator Inhofe predicted that Congress will approve another base closure round for 2001. Additionally, the Administration requested about $1.8 billion in supplemental appropriations for military contingency operations overseas. The Inhofe amendment was dropped by the authorization conference. The Administration requested $1.8 billion in supplemental appropriations for military operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf. Another $1.9 billion was requested for extending the mission in Bosnia through FY1999. Congress agreed to provide the FY1998 supplemental funding in H.R. 3579. The U.S. requested $1.9 billion for extending the mission in Bosnia through FY1999. Congress provided the FY1998 supplemental funding in H.R. 3579. Funding for Bosnia was ultimately included in the omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328) as \"emergency\" funding. The FY1999 request for Bosnia was initially considered during congressional action on the regular FY1999 funding bills and was ultimately provided in the omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328). The Administration requested additional funding for Bosnia to be designated as \"emergency\" appropriations, which was contentious due to budget enforcement act caps. The Administration requested additional funding for Bosnia to be designated as \"emergency\" appropriations under the budget enforcement act, raising caps on defense discretionary spending. This proposal was contentious as it broke precedent of including Bosnia costs in regular defense appropriations measures. The Administration requested additional funding for Bosnia to be designated as \"emergency\" appropriations under the budget enforcement act, breaking precedent. The FY1998 and FY1999 supplemental funding for ongoing military operations in Bosnia, the Persian Gulf, and elsewhere has raised concerns about exceeding defense spending caps. Congressional action included approving $1.9 billion for Bosnia in the defense authorization bill. Bosnia costs were not assumed in defense plans at the time the 1997 budget agreement was reached. Congress needed to designate Bosnia funding as emergency appropriations to avoid cuts in other defense programs. The Senate approved $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency appropriations, while the House did not address emergency funding specifically but set a cap of $1.9 billion. The SASC approved $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency appropriations, in addition to the regular $270.5 billion funding for national defense.

The conference agreement allows expenditure if the President certifies it is needed for national security. The appropriations conference agreement does not include emergency funding for Bosnia. The Skaggs amendment was dropped. The conference agreement allows expenditure if the President certifies it is needed for national security. Emergency funding for Bosnia was not included in the appropriations conference agreement. The Skaggs amendment was dropped. $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia was provided in the FY1999 Omnibus appropriations bill. Congressional focus on policy toward China and technology exports. The FY1999 Omnibus appropriations bill provided $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia. Congressional attention shifted to policy towards China and technology exports, particularly in light of allegations regarding Loral Space Corporation's assistance to China in missile technology.

Amendments concerning technology exports to China, relations with China, and trade sanctions were proposed in Senate action on the defense authorization bill. On June 23, the Senate rejected a motion to table four China-related amendments by Senator Hutchinson, leading to a delay in the debate on China policy. Senator Hutchinson planned to offer his amendments when the Senate resumed discussion. Amendments regarding technology exports to China, relations with China, and trade sanctions were proposed in Senate action on the defense authorization bill. Senator Hutchinson's China-related amendments were not tabled, leading to a delay in the debate on China policy. Senator Hutchinson planned to offer his amendments when the Senate took up the defense appropriations bill, but Senator Stevens delayed floor action on the bill due to concerns about contentious amendments potentially derailing it.

The conference agreement includes provisions to prohibit the export of missile equipment or technology to China unless certified by the President. It also includes a ban on transferring port facilities to COSCO. Other efficiency measures recommended include a reduction in the staff of the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The Defense Reform Initiative report recommended efficiency measures such as reducing staff in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and military service headquarters, cutting civilian and military support personnel, and promoting public-private competitions for activities currently done by civilian DOD employees. Congress has pressured the Defense Department to reduce staff numbers in the past. The Defense Reform Initiative report recommended efficiency measures, including cuts in OSD and military service headquarters staff, reductions in civilian and military support personnel, and promoting public-private competitions for activities currently done by civilian DOD employees. Congress has pressured the Defense Department to reduce staff numbers in the past, raising questions about the effectiveness of the proposed cuts and potential further reductions in overhead personnel. The Defense Department is facing challenges in reducing overhead personnel, with Congress debating the effectiveness of cuts in OSD and headquarters staff. There are concerns about potential deeper cuts in civilian personnel and reactions to privatization measures at local facilities. The House has pushed for significant reductions in acquisition personnel, while the Senate and Administration have tried to mitigate these measures. The House has pushed for significant reductions in acquisition personnel, while the Senate and Administration have tried to soften these measures. Congressional action includes urging the Defense Department not to waive cuts in acquisition personnel mandated in last year's defense authorization act. The House has resisted proposals to open weapons maintenance and other activities to private competition. HNSC imposed an across-the-board cut of $500 million in funding for consultants and criticized DOD for not complying with a reporting requirement on management headquarters personnel. The White House objected to the cut in consulting funds and several measures in the House-passed authorization bill. The House resisted opening weapons maintenance to private competition.

The authorization conference agreement includes withholding funds for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, cutting 25,000 acquisition personnel, reducing consultant funding by $240 million, and decreasing the number of Assistant Secretary of Defense positions from 10 to 9. Congressional hearings have highlighted readiness-related problems such as shortages in Air Force fighter jets, Army recruit standards, personnel in key skill areas, and declining pilot retention rates in the Air Force and Navy, indicating a potential readiness crisis due to inadequate defense funding. Some believe there is an imminent readiness crisis in the military due to shortages in fighter aircraft spare engines, drop in Army recruit standards, personnel shortfalls in key skill areas, and declining pilot retention rates. The Clinton Administration's commitment to missions abroad is seen as a contributing factor. Administration officials acknowledge some issues but deny an overall readiness crisis. Deploying units are said to remain fully ready. The Clinton Administration's commitment to missions abroad is seen as a factor in the military's readiness crisis, exacerbated by inadequate funding for defense. Administration officials acknowledge some issues but deny an overall crisis, stating that deploying units remain fully ready. Problems are being addressed, with a focus on fixing issues in the Air Force. The military's readiness crisis is being addressed, with a focus on fixing issues in the Air Force such as pilot retention and supply chain problems. Overall readiness reports show a highly qualified and capable force, despite some challenges. Congress approved higher funding to resolve these issues. The military is addressing readiness issues, including fixing Air Force supply chain problems and pilot retention. Concerns have been raised about personnel recruitment and retention, with efforts underway to resolve these issues. Officials in the military are expressing concerns about recruitment and retention, with calls for higher defense spending to address readiness problems. The President and Joint Chiefs have highlighted the need for additional defense funding.

The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes $1.3 billion for enhanced military readiness, but did not make changes to military retirement benefits for personnel retention. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes $1.3 billion for enhanced military readiness, but did not make changes to military retirement benefits. The bill emphasizes quality of life measures and funding for defense modernization. The FY1999 budget prioritizes military readiness funding over weapons modernization, leading to reallocation of funds from procurement to operation and maintenance accounts. The requested procurement funding remains close to last year's level, causing concerns about long-term weapons modernization programs. The FY1999 budget reallocates funds from weapons procurement to operation and maintenance accounts for readiness. The requested procurement funding remains close to last year's level due to adjustments in weapons programs following the Quadrennial Defense Review. The Administration requested emergency appropriations for FY1999 Bosnia costs, avoiding the cap on overall defense spending. The Administration requested emergency appropriations for FY1999 Bosnia costs, avoiding the cap on overall defense spending. They aim to increase procurement funding to $60 billion per year by FY2001, which may lead to a decline in procurement spending if Bosnia costs were included in the budget. This goal contradicts historical trends in defense budgeting, as acknowledged by senior defense officials. The Administration aims to increase procurement funding to $60 billion per year by FY2001, which may require efficiency savings from base closure and other measures. Failure to achieve planned savings or continued growth in maintenance costs could delay reaching the target. The Administration aims to reach a $60 billion procurement funding target by applying efficiency savings. Failure to achieve planned savings or continued growth in maintenance costs could delay reaching the target. Under Secretary of Defense Jacques Gansler mentioned the challenge in reaching the target. Congressional bills do not include substantial increases in modernization funding. Under Secretary of Defense Jacques Gansler expressed challenges in reaching the $60 billion procurement target. Congressional bills do not include significant increases in modernization funding, with only $1 billion allocated for BMD programs in the omnibus appropriations bill. The QDR mandates reductions in military personnel end-strength levels by 37,000 active duty personnel and 55,000 reserve positions by 2003, mainly from support activities for efficiency savings. The omnibus appropriations bill provides $1 billion for BMD programs, but no other funds for weapons modernization. The QDR mandates a cut of 37,000 active duty personnel and 55,000 reserve positions by 2003, mainly from support activities for efficiency savings. There is resistance in Congress to proposed personnel cuts, particularly in the Army, due to concerns about strain on active duty forces from contingency operations and forward presence abroad. Resistance in Congress to proposed personnel cuts, especially in the Army, due to concerns about strain on active duty forces from contingency operations and forward presence abroad. Army has long had shortages of personnel in certain skills, relying on reservists to fill units during major conflicts. This exacerbates burdens on the force during smaller-scale operations. The Army has faced shortages of personnel in certain skills, relying on reservists during major conflicts. This strains active duty forces during smaller-scale operations, as units are fully manned by drawing personnel from other units. Congress must agree to reduce statutory floors to carry out QDR reductions. Some Members of Congress resist this action. The Army faces personnel shortages, relying on reservists during conflicts and drawing personnel from other units. Congress needs to agree to reduce statutory floors for QDR reductions. The Administration requested a reduction in active duty end-strength by 35,000 from FY1998 levels, but HNSC rejected repealing statutory floors and agreed to reduce authorized end-strength by 11,000 positions. The Administration requested a reduction in active duty end-strength by more than 35,000 from FY1998 levels, but HNSC rejected repealing statutory floors and agreed to reduce authorized end-strength by 11,000 positions. SASC approved the end-strength reductions and repeal of statutory floors. House and Senate versions of the defense appropriations bill assumed the cuts in end-strength in FY1999. The authorization conference report agrees to the Administration request. The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) approved a reduction in active duty end-strength by 11,000 positions, rejecting the Administration's request for more cuts. There is a dispute between the active Army and the Army National Guard over the role of Guard combat units in war plans. The Army National Guard and reserve issues have escalated following the QDR. A dispute has arisen between the active Army and the ARNG over the role of ARNG combat units in war plans. Congress approved the appointment of special advisors to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs from the Guard and Reserve. The Defense Department has requested increased funding for Guard and reserve. The dispute between the active Army and the Army National Guard (ARNG) over the role of ARNG combat units in war plans has led to Congress approving special advisors from the Guard and Reserve to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. The Defense Department has requested more funding for Guard and reserve weapons procurement, while the Army Chief of Staff is working to ease the ongoing dispute with ARNG leaders. Congress has consistently added money for Guard and reserve weapons programs to the budget. Congress has consistently added substantial amounts for equipment earmarked for National Guard and Reserve forces, with disputes over major weapons programs arising almost every year. This year's issues include missile defense. Congress has consistently added substantial amounts for equipment earmarked for National Guard and Reserve forces, with disputes over major weapons programs arising almost every year. This year's issues include missile defense programs for National Missile Defense (NMD) and Theater Missile Defense (TMD) to protect against long-range and short- or intermediate-range missile attacks. This year's issues include missile defense programs for National Missile Defense (NMD) and Theater Missile Defense (TMD) to protect against long-range and short- or intermediate-range missile attacks. The Administration increased funding for NMD programs, with major policy disputes remaining unresolved. The plan is to develop NMD technology while deferring a decision on deployment. The Administration increased funding for NMD programs following the QDR. Major policy disputes remain unresolved, with advocates in Congress pushing for early deployment of a nationwide defense system. Disputes over TMD systems also continue. Key issues this year involve the Theater Missile Defense. The Administration hopes for a missile defense system that can preserve the 1972 ABM Treaty with potential amendments. Congress advocates for early deployment of a nationwide defense due to perceived threats, viewing the ABM Treaty as outdated. Disputes over TMD systems persist, with key issues involving THAAD, Navy Theater-Wide, and MEADS. The Administration has delayed THAAD development due to test failures and aims to postpone Navy procurement for affordability reasons. The key issues this year involve the THAAD system, Navy Theater-Wide program, and MEADS. THAAD and Navy Theater-Wide are long-range interceptor systems. The Administration has delayed THAAD development due to test failures and wants to delay Navy procurement for affordability reasons. MEADS is a cooperative program with European allies for improved air/missile defense for troops. Congressional action has sometimes delayed defense authorization and appropriations. MEADS is a cooperative program with European allies to provide an improved air/missile defense system for forward deployed troops. Congressional Action: In the past, provisions to require deployment of a nationwide defense have sometimes held up completion of defense authorization and appropriations bills. This year, the Senate Armed Services Committee reported S. 1873 ( S.Rept. 105-175 ), \"The American Missile Protection Act of 1998,\" calling for deployment of a missile defense system. Congress has considered separate legislation establishing missile defense policy for the past two years, but has not passed it. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported S. 1873, \"The American Missile Protection Act of 1998,\" calling for deployment of a nationwide defense. The House approved H.R. 2786, \"The Theater Missile Defense Improvement Act of 1998,\" authorizing $147 million in additional funding for TMD programs. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on the bill for nationwide defense deployment in 1998. Congress approved additional funding for TMD programs in FY1998 and FY1999, including Navy Area Defense and other TMD systems. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on the bill for nationwide defense deployment in 1998. Congress approved additional funding for TMD programs in FY1998 and FY1999, including Navy Area Defense and other TMD systems. The FY1998 supplemental funding bill, H.R. 3579, authorizes $147 million in additional funding for selected TMD programs, while the House-passed version of the FY1999 authorization included more money for the Navy Area Defense program and other TMD systems. The SASC version of the bill provided added funding for the Navy Theater Wide program but reduced THAAD slightly. However, the THAAD program faced its fifth successive test failure on May 12, leading the Senate to approve an amendment to trim another $253.9 million from the program due to delays in engineering development. On May 14, the Senate approved a $253.9 million cut to the THAAD program due to test failures and engineering delays. The House also restructured the program, requiring a second contractor to compete with Lockheed-Martin and shifting $142.7 million from engineering to technology development. The House approved a committee amendment to restructure the THAAD program, requiring a second contractor to compete with Lockheed-Martin and shifting $142.7 million from engineering development to technology development. SASC also cut MEADS funding and required DOD to study alternatives, while not adding money for NMD. SASC was critical of the Air Force Advanced Airborne Laser program and cut funding by $97 million. The Senate appropriations bill further reduced funding for MEADS and the Air Force Advanced Airborne Laser program, while increasing funding for Space-Based Laser R&D. Additionally, they added funds for boost phase intercept technology in the TMD budget as an alternative to THAAD. The Senate appropriations bill increased funding for Space-Based Laser R&D by $94 million and added $10 million to the TMD budget for boost phase intercept technology. Additionally, budget additions were made for the Navy Theater Wide TMD system as an alternative to THAAD, ranging from $70 million to $150 million. The authorization conference cut funding for THAAD by $294 million and reduced MEADS funding to $24 million, prohibiting further expenditures until long-term funding is included. The Navy Theater Wide TMD system has received budget additions ranging from $70 million to $150 million. The authorization conference cut THAAD by $294 million and reduced MEADS funding to $24 million, with further expenditures prohibited until long-term funding is included. The Space Based Laser program saw increases, while the Airborne Laser funding was cut by $57 million in the authorization bill and $25 million in the appropriations bill. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes additional funding of $1 billion for missile defense, with no specific allocation of the funds indicated. Some Members of Congress have proposed procurement of 9 more B-2 bombers in addition to the 21 already financed. The House generally supports more bombers, while the Senate is opposed. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes $1 billion for missile defense, with no specific allocation. Some Members of Congress proposed 9 more B-2 bombers, but no additional funding was added for procurement in this year's defense bills. An independent commission study recommended against producing more bombers due to cost concerns. The annual compromise in Congress regarding B-2 bomber production has resulted in no additional funding for procurement this year. An independent commission study recommended against producing more bombers due to cost concerns. Three new fighter aircraft programs are in development and production. The B-2 bomber procurement funding remains unchanged this year, with limited funds allocated for upgrades. Three new fighter aircraft programs are in development and production, including the Navy F/A-18E/F, Air Force F-22, and Joint Strike Fighter. Funding has been requested for FY1999 to purchase F/A-18E/F aircraft, continue F-22 development, and carry on JSF research and development. The QDR reviewed these programs and decided to continue all of them with reduced funding. The DOD requested FY1999 funding for F/A-18E/F aircraft, F-22 development, and JSF R&D. The QDR decided to continue all programs with reduced funding. Congressional members debate affordability and potential cancellation of one program, with concerns over the cost of the F-22 in the Senate. HNSC and HAC reduced F/A-18E/F procurement from 30 to 27 aircraft. The Senate has concerns about the cost of the F-22 program and has reduced F/A-18E/F procurement. SASC included a requirement for the F-22 to complete 10% of planned flight tests before further funding is released. The Senate made no changes in major tactical aircraft programs. SASC required the F-22 to complete 10% of planned flight tests before funding for the next round of procurement is released. The Senate rejected a proposal for 601 hours of flight testing before procurement. The authorization conference approved funds for 30 F-18s and allowed a waiver for the F-22 flight test requirement. Congress has added substantial amounts to shipbuilding programs in recent years. The Administration objected to the Senate requirement for 601 hours of flight testing before the next round of procurement. The authorization conference approved funds for 30 F-18s and allowed a waiver for the F-22 flight test requirement. Congress has added substantial amounts to shipbuilding programs in recent years to avoid gaps in production and ensure major shipyards have enough work. One major issue concerns the procurement of the CVN-77, the last of the planned Nimitz-class ships. Congress has added substantial amounts to shipbuilding programs to avoid production gaps and ensure major shipyards have enough work. An issue concerns the procurement of the CVN-77, the last planned Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, with funding moved up to FY2001. This is an alternative to Newport News Shipbuilding's proposal for accelerated funding. The procurement of the CVN-77, the last Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, has been moved up to FY2001 by DOD, avoiding a big bill in FY1999 and FY2000. Newport News Shipbuilding's \"Smart Buy\" proposal aimed to save the Navy $600 million but the new DOD plan will not save as much. Another issue is the development of the next generation DD-21 destroyer. The Navy's procurement plan for the CVN-77 has been accelerated to avoid a large bill in FY1999 and FY2000. The new DOD plan, while not saving as much as NNS's \"Smart Buy\" proposal, still provides savings. Concerns remain about the development of the next generation DD-21 destroyer, with the Navy reaching an agreement with shipbuilders. The Navy has reached an agreement with shipbuilders and combat system integrators to form teams for the next generation DD-21 destroyer. Plans for a new-design aircraft carrier, the \"CVX,\" have been abandoned. The Navy has reached an agreement with shipbuilders and combat system integrators to form teams for the next generation DD-21 destroyer. Plans for a new-design aircraft carrier, the \"CVX,\" have been abandoned. Additionally, the Navy will pursue incremental improvements in the next three Nimitz-class carriers, eventually leading to a new design. Congressional approval has been granted for the Administration's shipbuilding program, including funding for one New Attack Submarine (NSSN). The Navy will pursue incremental improvements in the next three Nimitz-class carriers, leading to a new design. Congressional approval was granted for the Administration's shipbuilding program, including funding for one New Attack Submarine (NSSN). The ongoing debate about mandating a competition between shipbuilders for different submarine versions has ended. The ongoing debate about mandating a competition between shipbuilders for different submarine versions has ended with support from HNSC, SASC, and SAC. An additional $50 million was allocated for advance procurement of a new LHD-7 class amphibious ship, drawing attention due to being built by Ingalls Shipbuilding Company in Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's home state of Mississippi. The Navy has decided not to pursue a new design for the CVX carrier, leading to a debate on how to allocate funding for carrier R&D. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $130 million reduction in CVX R&D funding and a $50 million increase for CVN upgrades. The Navy has decided not to pursue a new design for the CVX carrier. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $130 million reduction in CVX R&D funding and a $50 million increase for CVN upgrades. The House Appropriations bill also cut funding for the CVX by $100 million. The committee recommended a $50 million increase for CVN-77 under program element (PE) 0603512N and a $5 million increase for a red team study on a futuristic aircraft carrier concept. The House Appropriations bill cut funding for CVX by $100 million, while the authorization conference agreement provides $110 million for CVX R&D. The bill reduced funding for CVX by $100 million, with the authorization conference agreement providing $110 million for CVX R&D and the appropriations conference agreement providing $105 million. Other weapons issues include no funding in the FY1999 budget for additional F-16 aircraft, ongoing support for low-level procurement to maintain production lines and meet Air Force requirements, and potential funding issues for the Joint Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) aircraft. The QDR recommended reducing planned JSTARS aircraft procurement from 19 to 13, assuming NATO would purchase 6 aircraft. The QDR recommended reducing the total planned procurement of JSTARS aircraft from 19 to 13, assuming NATO would purchase 6 aircraft with alliance common funds. Congressional action added $66 million for 2 F-16s and advance procurement funds for 2 additional JSTARS aircraft. The House authorization added $66 million for 2 F-16s and advance procurement funds for 2 additional JSTARS aircraft. Additionally, funds were provided for National Guard and Reserve equipment, including $300 million in a defense-wide account and additional amounts for specific weapons programs. The House also allocated funds for 8 C-130 cargo aircraft of various types, exceeding the DOD's request for just one. The House appropriations bill included $60 million for two F-16s, advance procurement money for JSTARS, and $120 million for other purposes.

They specifically criticized various Army, Navy, and Air Force programs. Some Members of Congress have echoed these concerns. The National Defense Panel recommends reducing or terminating legacy programs in favor of advanced technologies for land forces, fighter aircraft, and ships with lower radar visibility. They criticized various Army, Navy, and Air Force programs, with some Members of Congress echoing these concerns. Congressional action includes approving a measure for a Quadrennial Defense Review at the beginning of each new administration. Members of Congress have echoed questions raised by the National Defense Panel about legacy systems and proposed specific program changes. SASC approved a measure for a Quadrennial Defense Review at the start of each new administration, preceded by strategy recommendations from the Panel. SASC also criticized the Army's Crusader artillery program and ordered a review in line with the Panel's argument. The authorization conference agreement requires a report on Crusader and addresses social issues like sexual harassment and gender-integrated training, which are often debated in annual defense funding bills. The Army's Crusader artillery program was criticized and a review was ordered in light of the National Defense Panel's argument. The authorization conference agreement requires a report on Crusader, as well as addressing social issues like sexual harassment and gender-integrated training. Last year, commissions were established to review gender-integrated training, with the Administration appointing one headed by former Senator Nancy Kassebaum. The focus this year has been on sexual harassment cases in the Army and gender-integrated training. A commission appointed by the Administration, led by former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker, made recommendations to improve recruitment and training, including separate units and barracks for men and women during basic training. The Marine Corps has implemented this policy, while other services have not. The Kassebaum Baker committee, led by former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker, made recommendations to improve recruitment and training, including separate units and barracks for men and women during basic training. The Marine Corps has implemented this policy, while other services have not. The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS) disagreed with the recommendation for greater gender separation in training. Secretary of Defense Cohen left it to each service to decide on making changes. The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS) disagreed with the Kassebaum Baker committee's recommendation for greater gender separation in training. Secretary of Defense Cohen left it to each service to decide on making changes, and none of the services have altered its policy.

The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS) disagreed with the Kassebaum Baker committee's recommendation for greater gender separation in training. Secretary of Defense Cohen left it to each service to decide on making changes, and none of the services has altered its policy. Congressional action included a provision for separate units and barracks for men and women in basic training. The congressionally-mandated commission has not yet completed its investigations. Congressional action: The HNSC version of authorization bill included a provision requiring the services to phase in separate units and separate barracks for men and women in basic training -- the rule in the House did not make inorder any floor amendments to reverse the HNSC requirements, so there was no floor action on the issue. In stark contrast, SASC prohibited any steps to change current service practices until the congressionally-mandated commission reports. Senator Brownback proposed an amendment to the authorization bill to insert the House language, but on June 24, the. The House did not allow floor amendments to reverse HNSC requirements, leading to no floor action. SASC prohibited changes until the commission reports. Senator Brownback's amendment was rejected in favor of a Snowe substitute. House and Senate were in disagreement on gender-integrated training. HNSC also required exemplary conduct from the Secretary of Defense and the President. The Senate approved a Snowe substitute on June 24, allowing current unit training practices to continue but requiring separation of sleeping quarters for men and women in basic training. The House and Senate were at odds on gender-integrated training, with the HNSC also mandating exemplary conduct from the Secretary of Defense and the President. The authorization conference agreement allows current unit training practices to continue but requires separation of sleeping quarters for men and women in basic training. It also addresses defense health care issues, including the effectiveness of the Tricare program and health care benefits for military retirees. Congress is evaluating Tricare. Senior officials should be held to exemplary standards in defense health care. Issues such as the effectiveness of the Tricare program and health care benefits for military retirees are under discussion. Congress is evaluating Tricare and established a demonstration program for Medicare subvention. HNSC and SASC are taking steps to ensure military retirees have continued access to health care. Congress is evaluating Tricare and established a demonstration program for Medicare subvention. HNSC and SASC are taking steps to ensure military retirees have continued access to health care, including testing alternative means of providing healthcare and allowing access to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan. The House approved a demonstration program to test alternative healthcare options for military retirees, including access to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP). The authorization conference agreement includes three major demonstrations: allowing retirees to enroll in FEHBP, providing Tricare benefits as a supplement to Medicare, and offering Tricare pharmacy benefits. Defense appropriations bills have also earmarked funds for medical research and development. Three major demonstrations for continued healthcare for retirees include enrolling in FEHBP, Tricare benefits as a supplement to Medicare, and Tricare pharmacy benefits. Defense appropriations bills have earmarked funds for medical research and development, including bone marrow transplants and cancer research. The Senate allocated $250 million for medical R&D earmarks in the defense appropriations bill. The Senate version of the defense appropriations bill allocated $250 million for medical R&D earmarks, with the Defense Department determining priorities among programs. The House bill included separate amounts for various medical earmarks, while the appropriations conference agreement specified that funding should not be reduced below the FY1998 level for breast cancer and prostate cancer research. The Defense Department must prioritize programs, limiting funding for various medical programs. The appropriations conference agreement ensures funding for breast cancer and prostate cancer research at FY1998 levels. Additionally, separate earmarked funds are provided for medical programs, including cancer research. The Defense Department also faces potential Year 2000 computer issues. The appropriations conference agreement includes earmarked funds for medical programs like breast cancer and prostate cancer research. The Defense Department, like other agencies, is dealing with potential Year 2000 computer problems. The House Appropriations Committee added $1.6 billion in emergency appropriations to help the Defense Department and the Treasury Department fix their computers. The House Appropriations Committee added $1.6 billion in emergency appropriations to help the Defense Department and the Treasury Department fix their computers in response to potential Year 2000 computer problems. Rep. Obey criticized the emergency funding as an increase in the defense budget, but a Neumann amendment to remove the money was rejected. The House Republican caucus later decided not to provide emergency appropriations for the \"Y2K\" problem. The House Republican caucus decided not to provide $1.6 billion in emergency funding for the \"Y2K\" problem, which was initially added by the House Appropriations Committee. The issue of emergency funding for Bosnia and Y2K was left to be addressed in a separate supplemental appropriations bill, not in the defense appropriations measure. The defense appropriations bill, approved on June 24, removed $1.6 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia and Y2K. The issue of emergency funding and offsetting rescissions was deferred to a separate supplemental appropriations bill. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill allocates $1.1 billion for Y2K conversion in the Defense Department and $2.4 billion for other agencies. The defense authorization bill includes funding for Department of Energy and Department of Defense activities, but the defense appropriations bill does not provide funds for DOE. The defense appropriations bill provides $1.1 billion for the Defense Department for Y2K conversion and $2.4 billion for other agencies. Tritium production funding is included in the defense authorization bill for Department of Energy and Department of Defense activities. The House-passed authorization bill includes a measure to prohibit DOE from purchasing. The House-passed defense authorization bill includes a measure to prohibit the Department of Energy from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial sources, leading to the need for new facilities in South Carolina at an estimated cost of $3 billion over forty years. The House-passed defense authorization bill prohibits the Department of Energy from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial sources, requiring new facilities in South Carolina at a cost of $3 billion over forty years. The Senate-passed bill allows DOE to choose between commercial sources and new facilities, with a one-year delay for Congress to review the decision.
