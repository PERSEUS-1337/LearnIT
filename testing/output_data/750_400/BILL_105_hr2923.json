    "content": "The Act titled \"Early Hearing Loss Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Act of 1997\" is aimed at addressing the purposes outlined in Section 2. The Act aims to establish early detection networks for hearing loss in babies, requiring screening before leaving hospitals or within the first 3 months of life for those not born in hospitals. All babies born in hospitals in the US and its territories should be screened for hearing loss before discharge, while those born outside hospitals should be screened within the first 3 months of life. Diagnostic testing should be done promptly for appropriate referral before 6 months of age. Universal newborn hearing screening programs must ensure linkage to diagnosis. Diagnostic audiologic testing should be done promptly for appropriate referral before 6 months of age, ensuring linkage to diagnosis and early intervention services. Public policy should be based on research recognizing the unique needs of infants, toddlers, and children with hearing loss. Public policy in early hearing detection, diagnosis, and intervention for infants, toddlers, and children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing should be informed by applied research and consultation with relevant sectors. STATEWIDE EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND INTERVENTION NETWORKS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants to develop statewide networks for early detection, diagnosis, and intervention for newborn hearing loss. This includes supporting newborn hearing detection in hospitals and monitoring the extent of detection statewide. State capacity will be developed to support newborn hearing loss detection, diagnosis, and intervention. This includes monitoring hearing detection in birthing hospitals statewide and developing universal newborn hearing detection programs. Statewide models will ensure effective screening, referral, and linkage with appropriate services. Data will be collected on statewide early detection efforts. State capacity will be developed to support newborn hearing loss detection, diagnosis, and intervention, including monitoring hearing detection in birthing hospitals statewide and developing universal newborn hearing detection programs. Statewide models will ensure effective screening, referral, and linkage with appropriate services, while data will be collected on statewide early detection efforts for research and policy development. Technical assistance, data management, and applied research will be provided. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide grants for technical assistance to State agencies for infant hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment. This includes data collection, standardized procedures for data management, and quality monitoring of programs. The program funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide technical assistance on data collection, develop standardized procedures for quality monitoring of infant hearing programs, study costs and effectiveness of State-based programs, and identify causes and risk factors for congenital hearing loss. Study the costs and effectiveness of hearing detection in State-based programs to address national and State policymakers' concerns. Identify causes and risk factors for congenital hearing loss for preventive interventions. Evaluate early hearing detection programs by assessing children's health, development, cognition, and language at school age. Encourage data sharing on early hearing loss with State-based birth defects and developmental programs. The National Institutes of Health will study the effectiveness of early hearing detection programs and promote data sharing with State-based monitoring programs to identify causes of hearing loss. The National Institutes of Health will conduct research on new screening techniques and technology for hearing loss, including clinical trials and intervention efficacy studies. SEC. 5. COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION. In carrying out programs under this Act, the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health shall collaborate with other agencies, state and local agencies, consumer groups, individuals who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, their families, and qualified professionals proficient in deaf or hard-of-hearing. The curr_chunk focuses on various stakeholders involved in serving individuals who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, including consumer groups, qualified professionals, health and education professionals, third-party payers, and managed care organizations. These stakeholders play a role in policy development related to deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for professionals with specialized knowledge to serve deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals and their families. The Health Resources Administration, Centers for Disease Control, and National Institutes of Health are urged to collaborate on policy recommendations at federal, state, and private sector levels. The Health Resources Administration, Centers for Disease Control, and National Institutes of Health will collaborate on policy recommendations for early hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment at federal, state, and private sector levels. The Health Resources Administration and Centers for Disease Control will also work together on State Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Networks and data collection. The Health Resources Administration, Centers for Disease Control, and National Institutes of Health collaborate on policy recommendations for early hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment. State Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Networks are established with a data collection system to assist in early detection, diagnosis, and intervention efforts. Authorization of appropriations for early hearing detection, diagnosis, and intervention efforts. Authorization of appropriations for early hearing detection, diagnosis, and intervention efforts includes $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and additional funding for the years 2001 through 2003. Additionally, $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and further funding for the years 2001 through 2003 is allocated for technical assistance, data management, and applied research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1999, $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary funds for 2001 through 2003. The National Institutes of Health are authorized $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary funds for 2001 through 2003 for section 4(b)."
