    "content": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence focus on identifying analogies across domains without supervision. One key task is translating images between domains, but current techniques often lack visual fidelity for accurate matching. This paper introduces AN-GAN, a matching-by-synthesis approach that outperforms existing methods in finding exact analogies between datasets. The study also breaks down the cross-domain mapping task into domain alignment and learning the mapping function. In this paper, the AN-GAN approach is introduced for finding exact analogies between datasets by matching images from different domains. The cross-domain mapping task is divided into domain alignment and learning the mapping function, which can be iteratively solved to achieve quality comparable to full supervision. Humans have the ability to make analogies between unseen and seen domains without prior supervision. The ability to make analogies between different domains without prior supervision is crucial for Artificial Intelligence. This skill allows for the use of previous knowledge to establish strong priors in new situations, aiding in the identification of similarities across multiple domains. Identifying analogies between multiple domains is a key problem for Artificial Intelligence. Recent AI success has been in supervised problems with explicit correspondences, but analogy identification involves unsupervised mapping between unseen domains. Various approaches have been proposed for this task using sets of images from different domains A and B. Recently, approaches have been proposed for unsupervised mapping between different domains using sets of images without explicit correspondences. The methods aim to learn a mapping function that can map an image from one domain to its likely appearance in another domain. Unsupervised mapping between different domains involves learning a mapping function to transform images from one domain to another. This is achieved by ensuring that the distributions of mapped images and target domain images are similar, and by applying a cycle constraint to maintain image integrity. The task also involves identifying analogies between pairs of examples in the two domains. The task of analogy identification involves finding pairs of examples related by a non-linear transformation. Two constraints are used: distributional constraint ensures similar distributions between mapped and target domain images, and cycle constraint maintains image integrity. However, translated images may lack visual fidelity for exact matching. In this work, the problem of analogy identification is addressed by adding exemplar-based constraints to improve visual fidelity and performance in matching translated images.

The method proposed in the study improves visual fidelity and performance in matching translated images by finding correspondences between sets, even when exact analogies are not available. It yields better visual quality than mapping functions and allows for a more accurate two-step approach for training a domain mapping function. The method described in the latter case improves visual quality by finding analogies between domains and using a two-step approach for training a domain mapping function. This approach is more accurate than previous unsupervised mapping methods and aims to identify dataset analogies without supervision. The paper introduces a method for identifying analogies between datasets without supervision, using a two-step approach for domain mapping. This method is related to image matching and unsupervised style-transfer techniques. Analogy identification in this paper is closely related to image matching methods, specifically unsupervised style-transfer and image-to-image mapping. Various approaches have been proposed for image matching, including pixel and feature-point based matching and the use of deep neural networks for supervised matching between datasets. Our method focuses on matching across domains without supervision. Image matching is a long-standing computer vision task, with approaches like pixel and feature-point based matching and deep neural networks for supervised matching. In unsupervised scenarios, generic visual feature matching is relevant, but standard visual features struggle with different domains. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) technology is presented as a solution. In unsupervised scenarios, standard visual features struggle with different domains. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) technology presents a breakthrough in image synthesis, allowing for image to image translation work. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) technology, introduced by Goodfellow et al. in 2014, has revolutionized image synthesis. GAN methods train a generator network to produce realistic images by jointly training a discriminator network. This technology is widely used in image to image translation work, with a focus on creating high-quality images. The work below utilizes GANs to generate realistic images by training a generator network G and a discriminator network D. The generative architecture is based on BID12, focusing on image mapping from input images rather than random noise. Unsupervised mapping, which does not require supervision apart from sample images, has been recently applied for image to image translation and earlier for translating between natural languages.

The method described involves using GANs, specifically the discriminator D receiving pairs of images to strengthen the link between the source and target image. The U-net architecture of BID14 is employed to enhance the connection between the images. Despite the lack of supervision, successful completion of the algorithm generates correspondences between domains, allowing for the use of supervised mapping methods on the inferred matches. In this section, the method for analogy identification is detailed. Two sets of images in domains A and B are given, denoted as x i and y j respectively. The goal is to find matching indexes m i for i \u2208 I to identify analogous images between the two domains. In this section, the method for analogy identification is detailed. Two sets of images in domains A and B are given, denoted as x i and y j respectively. The goal is to find matching indexes m i for i \u2208 I to identify analogous images between the two domains using a GAN-based distribution approach. An iterative approach is used to find matches between images in two domains A and B. A mapping function T AB is trained to map images from domain A to domain B, ensuring distributional alignment between the two domains. GAN-based distribution approach involves mapping images across domains using a mapping function T AB to make images from domain A appear as if they belong to domain B. The distributional alignment is enforced by training a discriminator D to distinguish between samples from T AB (x) and y, optimizing T AB to make this task challenging for the discriminator. The alignment is enforced by training a discriminator D to discriminate between samples from p(T AB (x)) and p(y). T AB is optimized so that the discriminator will have a difficult task. The loss function for training T and D is binary cross-entropy. Additional constraints like circularity and distance have been effectively added in many datasets.

The complete two-sided cycle loss function includes L1 loss. The popular cycle approach in GAN training involves one-sided GANs in both A \u2192 B and B \u2192 A directions, ensuring image domain translation and recovery. The two-sided cycle loss function includes L1 loss, providing matching between samples and synthetic images in the target domain. However, it does not provide exact correspondences between A and B domain images. The two-sided approach in GAN training involves mapping functions from A to B and back, providing matching between samples and synthetic images in the target domain. However, it does not offer exact correspondences between A and B domain images. This section introduces a method for exact matches between domains by finding sets of indices for analogous images. In the previous section, a distributional approach was described for mapping A domain images to B domain images.

The proposed match matrix \u03b1 i,j assigns weights to training samples from A and B domains, aiming for a binary matrix with 1 for proposed matches and 0 for the rest. The goal is to minimize a perceptual loss L p based on predefined image representations. The optimization task involves finding a binary matrix with weights \u03b1 i,j for matching samples from domains A and B. To simplify the computation, a relaxed version of the binary constraint is used, along with an entropy constraint for sparsity.

We compare our method against other existing solutions for cross-domain matching. The method described in the curr_chunk focuses on finding the nearest neighbor of the source image in the target domain using VGG feature loss. This method is computationally heavy due to the size of each feature, so random subsampling is done to estimate performance. The CycleGAN model is used with different loss functions to compute the nearest neighbor in the target set. The method involves training CycleGAN with different loss functions to find the nearest neighbor in the target set. The VGG features are subsampled to reduce computational cost. The evaluation is done on 4 public datasets including Facades with building facades and segmentation maps. The method involves training AN-GAN with different iterations to improve performance. Evaluation is done on 4 public datasets including Facades, Maps, and images from the Zappos50K dataset. Edge images are automatically detected using HED. The Maps dataset was scraped from Google Maps and consists of aligned Maps and corresponding satellite images. The dataset contains around 1096 images in the training set. Additionally, edge images were automatically detected using HED for both the Zappos50K dataset and Amazon handbags dataset, which were down-sampled to 2k images each for memory complexity. This demonstrates the method's effectiveness with moderately sized datasets. The original dataset contains around 137k images of Amazon handbags. The edge images were automatically detected using HED. The datasets were down-sampled to 2k images each for memory complexity. The method was compared with five others on exact correspondence identification. The objective is to recover the full match function. In experiments comparing methods for exact correspondence identification, images are shuffled before training to recover the full match function. Results show that matching using pixels or deep features cannot solve the task due to differences in the domains. The results of the experiments show that matching using pixels or deep features cannot solve the task of exact correspondence identification due to differences in the domains. Simple mapping using CycleGAN and matching with pixel-losses can improve matching performance, but there is still room for improvement. Another method involved matching perceptual features between mapped source images and target images. The study explores improving matching performance between images using CycleGAN and perceptual features like VGG features. Exhaustive search was deemed too computationally expensive, leading to subsampling of features for better performance. The study uses VGG features as perceptual features for image retrieval tasks. Exhaustive search was found to be computationally expensive, leading to the need for subsampling features. Perceptual features outperformed pixel matching, and a method of matching linear combinations of mapped images was used for better performance. The study found that perceptual features outperformed pixel matching. By running iterations on mapped images, a method of matching linear combinations was used, which improved performance significantly. The optimization problem was challenging, leading to the use of a distributional auxiliary to aid in convergence. The study found that using perceptual features outperformed pixel matching in improving identification for both sides of the match. The optimization problem was challenging, but the use of distributional auxiliary loss helped in convergence. The full-method AN-GAN utilized exemplar-based loss to optimize the mapping function successfully. The study found that using distributional auxiliary loss aided optimization for successful analogy finding in the full-method AN-GAN, resulting in significantly better performance for all datasets and matching directions, even when a percentage of matches were unavailable. The study optimized the mapping function to improve performance for all datasets and matching directions, even when a percentage of matches were unavailable by randomly removing images from the datasets.

The task is identification of correct matches for samples that have matches in the other domain. The evaluation metric is the percentage of images with exact matches out of the total images with an exact match. The results for partial exact matching are shown in Table 2. The study optimized the mapping function to improve performance for all datasets and matching directions, even when a percentage of matches were unavailable by randomly removing images from the datasets. The evaluation metric is the percentage of images with exact matches out of the total images with an exact match. Results for partial exact matching are presented in Table 2, showing that the method can handle scenarios where not all examples have matches. When 10% of samples do not have matches, results are comparable to the clean case, and even with 25% of samples without exact matches, the results are not significantly lower. Our method can handle scenarios where not all examples have matches, with results comparable to the clean case even when 25% of samples do not have exact matches. AN-GAN achieved a 90% match rate with 75% of samples not having matches, notably in the Facades dataset. Although the main objective is identifying exact analogies, testing our approach on scenarios with no matches is also interesting. In the experiment, AN-GAN achieved a 90% match rate with 75% of samples not having matches in the Facades dataset. The method was tested on finding similar matches in scenarios where exact analogies are not available, using the DiscoGAN architecture for mapping. In the experiment, DiscoGAN was used to find similar matches in scenarios without exact analogies. The quality of DiscoGAN mapping varied, with some examples showing successful matching while others had lower quality mappings. The DiscoGAN architecture BID9 was used for mapping functions in the experiment, with varying quality of mappings observed. While some examples showed successful matching, others had lower quality mappings. AN-GAN was able to force more relevant matches, resulting in better analogies. The method demonstrated high accuracy in aligning datasets, suggesting a two-step approach for training a mapping. The DiscoGAN mapping quality is lower, with poor matches in both DiscoGAN and DiscoGAN + \u03b1 iterations. AN-GAN forces more relevant matches, leading to better analogies. A two-step approach is suggested for training a mapping function between unaligned datasets: (i) Find analogies using AN-GAN, and (ii) Train a standard mapping function using self-supervision from stage (i). Alignment accuracy of 97% was achieved for the Facades dataset, used to train a fully self-supervised mapping function. The two-step approach for training a mapping function between unaligned datasets involves finding analogies using AN-GAN and then training a standard mapping function using self-supervision from the analogies. This method achieved 97% alignment accuracy for the Facades dataset, allowing for the training of a fully self-supervised mapping function using Pix2Pix. The supervised mapping was found to be far more accurate than unsupervised methods. Our method utilizes a fully self-supervised mapping function using Pix2Pix for facade photo segmentation. Comparing with CycleGAN and supervised Pix2Pix, our approach produces higher quality images by effectively solving the unsupervised problem. Our method improves accuracy in mapping compared to unsupervised methods, effectively solving the problem by finding correspondences between domains. The images produced are of higher quality than CycleGAN and comparable to fully-supervised methods. Our self-supervised method performs similarly to fully supervised methods and outperforms CycleGAN on the task. Results for edges2shoes and edges2handbags datasets show improved performance using an appropriate loss and larger architecture enabled by ANGAN-supervision. The stage uses a Pix2Pix architecture with only L1 loss, which works better for the task. The test set L1 error is shown in Tab. 4, demonstrating improved performance over CycleGAN and competitive with full-supervision. The method was also evaluated on point cloud matching for low dimensional settings and non-exact correspondences between samples in two domains. Our method was evaluated on point cloud matching, testing alignment success rates for various rotation angles using the Bunny benchmark. The experiments used the same setting as in BID17, comparing our method with CycleGAN. The experiments were conducted on the Bunny benchmark, evaluating alignment success rates for different rotation angles. Both CycleGAN and our method used a similar architecture with fully connected networks and a linear affine matrix for transformation. A loss term was added to encourage rotation matrix transformations. Our method utilized a fully connected network with 2 hidden layers and BatchNorm, followed by a linear affine matrix for rotation transformation. A loss term was added to ensure orthonormality of the weights. Results showed significant improvement over the baseline in achieving alignment accuracy. Our method incorporated a loss term to promote orthonormality of the weights in the mapping function. Results in Table 5 demonstrate superior performance compared to the baseline, particularly for large transformation angles. The effectiveness of our method extends to low dimensional transformations as well. Our method significantly outperforms the baseline results reported in BID17 for large angles, as shown in graph form.

It outperformed baseline methods on various datasets for full and partial exact matching, even when exact matches are not available. The method presents an alternative view of domain translation by aligning domains and training a supervised mapping function between them. Future work includes exploring matching between different modalities like images, speech, and text. Instead of performing the full operation end-to-end, it is possible to align domains and train a fully supervised mapping function between them. Future work is needed to explore matching between different modalities such as images, speech, and text, as current distribution matching algorithms are insufficient for this challenging scenario. New algorithms would need to be developed to achieve this goal."
