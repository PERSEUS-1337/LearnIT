This method is justified by the Sinkhorn approximation of the permanent, addressing the intractability issue as the permutation size increases. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in the probabilistic identification of neurons in C.elegans. The Sinkhorn variational marginal inference method offers a scalable alternative for exponential family inference over permutation matrices. It is justified by the Sinkhorn approximation of the permanent, addressing intractability as permutation size increases. This approach is effective in probabilistic neuron identification in C.elegans. The Sinkhorn variational marginal inference method provides a scalable solution for computing matrix expectations \u03c1 efficiently by approximating it as S(L), the Sinkhorn operator applied to L. This approach overcomes the intractability of computing the permanent of L, making it a straightforward and efficient method to implement. The Sinkhorn variational marginal inference method approximates matrix expectations efficiently by applying the Sinkhorn operator to L, overcoming the computational complexity of computing the permanent of L. This approach is straightforward to implement and provides a scalable solution for probabilistic inference of neural identity in C.elegans. The Sinkhorn variational marginal inference method efficiently approximates matrix expectations by applying the Sinkhorn operator to L, resulting in a doubly stochastic matrix. This approach provides a scalable solution for probabilistic inference of neural identity in C.elegans, based on the relation between marginal inference and the normalizing constant in exponential families. The Sinkhorn variational method efficiently approximates matrix expectations by applying the Sinkhorn operator to L, resulting in a doubly stochastic matrix. This approach provides a scalable solution for probabilistic inference of neural identity in C.elegans, based on the relation between marginal inference and the normalizing constant in exponential families. The argument is supported by the well-known relation between marginal inference and the normalizing constant, valid for exponential families. Theorem 3.4 in Wainwright and Jordan (2008) relates the marginal polytope to the dual function log Z L. The matrix of marginals \u03c1 L is linked to the permanent Z L through an optimization problem. Variational inference approximates \u03c1 by replacing the variational representation of Z L with a more tractable solution. The dual function A * (\u00b5(L)) is related to the negative entropy of (1.1). Marginal inference of \u03c1 L and computation of the permanent Z L = perm(L) are connected through optimization. Variational inference approximates \u03c1 by replacing the variational representation of Z L with a more tractable solution based on component-wise entropy. The approximation of the normalizing constant Z L is based on replacing the intractable dual function with component-wise entropy, resulting in the Sinkhorn permanent perm S (L). Bounds for this approximation are provided, and it has been proposed independently recently. The Sinkhorn permanent perm S (L) is an approximation of the normalizing constant Z L, based on component-wise entropy. Bounds for this approximation have been provided, and it has been proposed independently recently. The Sinkhorn permanent perm S (L) is an approximation of the normalizing constant Z L, based on component-wise entropy. Bounds for this approximation have been provided, and it has been proposed independently recently by Powell and Smith (2019). The Bethe variational inference method is a general rationale for obtaining variational approximations in graphical models, approximating the dual function A * (\u00b5) as if the underlying Markov random field had a tree structure. This approximation has been successfully applied to permutations by Huang and Jebara (2007), Chertkov et al. (2010), Vontobel (2014), and Tang et al. (2015). The Bethe variational inference method approximates the dual function A*(\u00b5) as if the underlying Markov random field had a tree structure. This approximation has been successfully applied to permutations, with the corresponding approximate marginal B(L) computed through belief propagation. The Bethe approximation of the permanent has known bounds, offering better theoretical guarantees than the Sinkhorn approximation. The Bethe variational inference method approximates the dual function A*(\u00b5) as if the underlying Markov random field had a tree structure, with the approximate marginal B(L) computed through belief propagation. The Bethe approximation of the permanent has known bounds, offering better theoretical guarantees than the Sinkhorn approximation. Computational differences exist between the two methods, with Sinkhorn algorithms requiring row and column normalization, while the Bethe approximation involves more complex message computations. Explicit formulae for both iterations are available in Appendix C. Fig 1 (b) illustrates practical differences. The Sinkhorn and Bethe algorithms have computational differences, with Sinkhorn requiring normalization and Bethe involving complex message computations. Bethe produces better permanent approximations in practice, as shown in Fig 1 (b). Comparisons with ground truth are possible in simple cases, but in many cases, results vary (see Figs 1(a) and A.1(a) in the Appendix). In practice, the Sinkhorn approximation often produces better marginals compared to the Bethe approximation, regardless of possibly worse permanents. Additionally, the Sinkhorn approximation scaled better for moderate n values. For example, with n = 710, each Bethe iteration took on average 0.035 seconds. The Sinkhorn approximation generally produces better marginals than the Bethe approximation, even though the permanents may be worse. For moderate n values, the Sinkhorn approximation also scales better. For instance, with n = 710, each Bethe iteration took 0.035 seconds on average, while each Sinkhorn iteration only took 0.0027 seconds. The Sinkhorn approximation outperforms the Bethe approximation in producing better marginals, with each Sinkhorn iteration taking only 0.0027 seconds compared to 0.035 seconds for Bethe iterations. The comparison was based on 1,000 submatrices of size n = 8 randomly sampled from the C.elegans dataset. The study compared the Sinkhorn and Bethe approximations for producing better marginals, with Sinkhorn iterations being faster. Additional submatrices were sampled for analysis, and sampling-based methods were considered for marginal inference. Recent advances in neurotechnology have enabled whole brain imaging of the unique species C.elegans, known for its stereotypical nervous system with roughly 300 neurons and consistent connections. Sampling-based methods, including sophisticated samplers for polynomial approximability of the permanent, have been explored for marginal inference, but practical limitations exist. An elementary MCMC sampler failed to provide sensible marginal inferences efficiently. In a unique species like C.elegans with a stereotypical nervous system, whole brain imaging has become possible with recent neurotechnology advancements. The challenge now is to assign canonical labels to each neuron in volumetric images for studying the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Whole brain imaging in C.elegans is now possible, allowing for the study of how brain activity relates to behavior. A technical challenge remains in assigning canonical labels to neurons in volumetric images. This is being addressed using a probabilistic neural identification methodology within the context of NeuroPAL, a multicolor transgene designed for neural identification. In the context of NeuroPAL, a multicolor C.elegans transgene, a probabilistic neural identification methodology is applied to estimate probabilities for neuron identification based on observed neuron vectors in R6. This approach provides uncertainty estimates for model predictions, offering a more comprehensive view than point estimates. In NeuroPAL, a probabilistic neural identification method estimates probabilities for neuron identification based on observed neuron vectors in R6. The matrix of marginal \u03c1 is estimated to provide uncertainty estimates for model predictions, using a gaussian model for each canonical neuron with parameters inferred from previously annotated worms. The likelihood of observing data Y is determined by a flat prior assumption. In NeuroPAL, a gaussian model is used for each canonical neuron with parameters inferred from previously annotated worms. The likelihood of observing data Y is determined by a flat prior assumption, inducing a posterior over P. The deterministic coloring scheme in Figure 2 is identical across all NeuroPAL worms. In NeuroPAL, a flat prior assumption induces a posterior over P, leading to a downstream task involving the computation of approximate probabilistic neural identifies. A human manually labels neurons with uncertain model estimates, resolving uncertainty as neurons are annotated. In NeuroPAL, a downstream task involves computing approximate probabilistic neural identifies. Humans label uncertain neurons, resolving uncertainty and improving identification accuracy.Annotations lead to faster accuracy increases compared to simple baselines. The uncertainty in neurons is resolved by human annotations, leading to increased identification accuracy. Different approximation methods are compared for accuracy improvement, including Sinkhorn, Bethe, MCMC, and baseline approaches. The study compares different approximation methods for improving accuracy in resolving uncertainty in neurons, including Sinkhorn, Bethe, MCMC, and various baseline approaches. Results show that Sinkhorn approximation slightly outperforms Bethe approximation. The study compares different approximation methods for resolving uncertainty in neurons, including Sinkhorn, Bethe, and MCMC. Results show that Sinkhorn approximation slightly outperforms Bethe approximation, with both being substantially better than any baseline other than the oracle. MCMC does not provide better results than the naive baseline. The Sinkhorn approximation for marginal inference is a sensible alternative to sampling, providing faster and more accurate approximate marginals than the Bethe approximation. MCMC does not outperform the naive baseline due to lack of convergence for chain lengths, leading to comparable computational times with approximated methods. Further analysis of the relation is left for future work. The Sinkhorn approximation for marginal inference is a faster and more accurate alternative to sampling than the Bethe approximation. It may provide better approximate marginals despite potentially worse permanent approximations. Future work will analyze the relationship between permanent approximation quality and corresponding marginals. Additionally, the (log) Sinkhorn approximation of the permanent of L can be obtained by evaluating S(L). The relation between permanent approximation quality and corresponding marginals is analyzed. S(L) = diag(x)Ldiag(y), where x, y are positive vectors turned into diagonal matrices. The (log) Sinkhorn approximation of the permanent of L, perm S (L), is obtained by evaluating S(L).
