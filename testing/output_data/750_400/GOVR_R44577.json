The House and Senate passed their respective National Defense Authorization Acts for Fiscal Year 2017, containing provisions affecting military personnel. A conference committee was convened to resolve differences between the two versions of the bill. The final bill was signed into law on December 23, 2016 (P.L. 114-328), highlighting selected personnel-related issues of interest. The House and Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Acts for Fiscal Year 2017, with a conference committee resolving differences. The final bill (P.L. 114-328) was signed into law on December 23, 2016, focusing on personnel-related issues. Contact information for CRS analysts is provided for detailed background information. CRS products in each section offer detailed background information and analysis of issues, with contact information for CRS analysts provided. Some issues previously addressed in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (P.L. 114-92) are marked with an asterisk in this report. The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 are discussed. The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 were as follows: Army (480,000), Navy (372,642), Marine Corps (172,600), and Air Force (357,000). Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel strength in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but recent years saw reversals in these increases. In response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel strength. However, recent years have seen reversals in these increases due to the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as budgetary constraints. End-strengths for the Air Force and Navy have been declining since 2001. Authorized end-strengths for FY2016 and FY2017 are shown in Figure 1. In recent years, Congress has been reversing increases in military personnel strength due to the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as budget constraints. End-strengths for the Air Force and Navy have been declining since 2001. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed lowering end-strengths for all services, with the House bill approving higher end-strengths than the Administration's request, notably for the Army. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed lowering end-strengths for all services, with the House bill approving higher end-strengths than the Administration's request. The House-proposed increase was most noticeable for the Army, while the Marine Corps and Air Force also saw increases. The House provision reduced Navy end-strength, but it was still higher than the Administration's request. The House bill approved higher end-strengths for all services in FY2017 compared to the Administration's request. The Army saw the most significant increase, while the Marine Corps and Air Force also had increases. The Navy end-strength was reduced in the House provision but still higher than the Administration's request. The final bill set minimum end-strengths equal to the authorized levels for FY2017. The final bill sets the minimum end-strengths at a level equal to the authorized end-strengths for FY2017. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 6% over the past 15 years. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 6% over the past 15 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. The Administration requested a reduction in authorized Selected Reserves end-strength for four reserve components and increases for two for FY2017. For FY2017, the Administration requested a reduction in authorized Selected Reserves end-strength for four reserve components and increases for two. The House bill proposed increasing the Army National Guard's end-strength to 350,000 and the Army Reserve's end-strength to 205,000. The Senate bill proposed end-strengths identical to the Administration request, while the House bill would have increased the Army National Guard's end-strength to 350,000 and the Army Reserve's end-strength to 205,000. Reference(s): Previously discussed in CRS Report R44120, FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act: Selected Military Personnel Issues. The House bill proposed increasing the Army National Guard's end-strength to 350,000 and the Army Reserve's end-strength to 205,000. Congressional interest in military personnel costs and quality remains focused on the annual military pay raise formula. The annual military pay raise formula is of concern due to the overall cost of military personnel and congressional interest in recruiting and retaining high-quality personnel. The formula, outlined in Section 1009 of Title 37 United States Code, provides for a 2.1% increase in basic pay for 2017 unless Congress or the President specifies otherwise. The increase in basic pay for 2017 is set at 2.1% unless Congress or the President specifies otherwise. In the past three years, the President has used alternative pay adjustment authority to set the pay raise below the Employment Cost Index. The President has used alternative pay adjustment authority to set pay raises below the Employment Cost Index for the past three years. The FY2017 President's Budget requested a 1.6% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.1%. The House bill aimed for a 2.1% pay raise for all servicemembers effective January 1, 2017, while the Senate bill would have waived the automatic adjustment to basic pay. The FY2017 President's Budget requested a 1.6% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.1%. The House bill aimed for a 2.1% pay raise for all servicemembers effective January 1, 2017, while the Senate bill would have waived the automatic adjustment to basic pay. The enacted bill specified an increase of 2.1%, effective January 1, 2017. The enacted bill specified a 2.1% increase in military pay, effective January 1, 2017, waiving the automatic adjustment to basic pay. Under current law, servicemembers are entitled to government-provided housing or a housing allowance known as Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), based on paygrade, geographic location, and dependency status. Under current law, servicemembers are entitled to Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) based on paygrade, geographic location, and dependency status. BAH rates vary by location and determine the type of accommodation suitable for the servicemember. The Senate bill proposed changes to how Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is calculated, focusing on geographic location and paygrade for servicemembers with dependents. BAH rates vary by location to ensure comparable housing options regardless of duty location. The Senate bill proposed changes to how Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is calculated, focusing on geographic location and paygrade for servicemembers with dependents. BAH rates would be based on actual housing expenditures up to a maximum amount for a given location/paygrade, rather than a specified rate. The Senate bill proposed changes to Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) calculation, focusing on geographic location and paygrade, not considering dependents. BAH would be based on actual housing expenses up to a maximum amount, with adjustments for servicemembers sharing living quarters. The Senate bill proposed changes to Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) calculation, focusing on geographic location and paygrade, not considering dependents. BAH would be based on actual housing expenses up to a maximum amount, with adjustments for servicemembers sharing living quarters. The new formula for BAH would apply to certain members of the Armed Forces starting January 1, 2018, including those entitled to basic pay on or after that date, reserve and retired personnel on active duty, and servicemembers receiving BAH on December 31. The new formula for Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) would apply to certain members of the Armed Forces starting on January 1, 2018. This includes servicemembers entitled to basic pay on or after that date, reserve and retired personnel on active duty, and those receiving BAH on December 31, 2017. The Senate provision on BAH eligibility for servicemembers losing uninterrupted eligibility after December 31, 2017, required DOD to submit proposed regulations by March 31, 2017. The House bill did not include a similar provision. The enacted bill mandates a report on transitioning to a new pay structure by March 1, 2017. The enacted bill requires the Department of Defense to submit proposed regulations for a new pay structure by March 31, 2017. The report must outline a \"single-salary pay system\" to recruit and retain a high-quality All-Volunteer Force, eliminating Basic Allowance for Housing and Basic Allowance for Subsistence. The enacted bill mandates the Department of Defense to propose a new pay structure by March 31, 2017, aiming to recruit and retain a high-quality All-Volunteer Force through a \"single-salary pay system.\" This system would eliminate Basic Allowance for Housing and Basic Allowance for Subsistence, which have evolved over the past 20 years as housing benefits for servicemembers in high-cost areas without government-provided quarters. The Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) has evolved over the past 20 years to provide a housing benefit for servicemembers in high-cost areas where government-provided quarters are not available. It is intended as a tax-free housing benefit, differentiated based on dependency status, and is primarily for military members not required to reside in barracks or on a ship. The housing allowance, known as Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), is intended as a tax-free housing benefit for military members in high-cost areas. The conferees direct the Secretary of Defense to plan for a transition to a salary system aligning the payment of the allowance with its use as compensation rather than an allowance. The conferees direct the Secretary of Defense to transition to a salary system aligning the payment of the housing allowance with its use as compensation rather than an allowance. The military retirement system underwent changes in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016 to modernize and reduce retired pay, including reducing the retired pay multiplier, adding a 401k-type defined contribution element, allowing for a partial lump-sum payment of retired pay, and adding continuation pay as a retention incentive. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016 made changes to the military retirement system, including reducing the retired pay multiplier, adding a 401k-type defined contribution element, allowing for a partial lump-sum payment of retired pay, and adding continuation pay as a retention incentive. These changes will take effect on January 1, 2018, for servicemembers entering on or after that date or those with 12 years or less of service who choose to enroll in the new system. The military retirement system underwent changes in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016, including reducing the retired pay multiplier and adding new incentives for retention. These changes will be implemented on January 1, 2018, for eligible servicemembers. Concerns have been raised about the impact of the reduced retired pay multiplier on retaining certain occupational specialties at the mid-career point. Reductions in the retired pay multiplier from 2.5% to 2.0% for those joining on or after January 1, 2018, have raised concerns about retaining certain occupational specialties at the mid-career point. The FY2016 NDAA authorized DOD to provide continuation pay as a retention incentive at the completion of 12 years of service in return for an additional 4-year commitment. The House and Senate agreed on a provision to allow DOD the flexibility to pay continuation pay between 8 to 12 years of service. The FY2016 NDAA authorized DOD to provide continuation pay at 12 years of service for an additional 4-year commitment. A provision was agreed upon to allow flexibility in paying continuation pay between 8 to 12 years of service, with a minimum 3-year commitment. This change provides DOD with more flexibility in managing personnel based on retention trends for specific military specialties. The enacted bill allows for continuation pay between 8 to 12 years of service with a minimum 3-year commitment, providing flexibility for DOD in managing personnel based on retention trends for specific military specialties. Additionally, the bill amends procedures for calculating continuation pay minimums for active and reserve component members, ensuring equal pay for reserve component members on active duty. The enacted bill allows for continuation pay between 8 to 12 years of service with a minimum 3-year commitment, providing flexibility for DOD in managing personnel based on retention trends for specific military specialties. It also ensures equal pay for reserve component members on active duty when accepting continuation pay. Additionally, the bill includes a provision for default contributions to the TSP to be to a Roth plan, which allows tax-free earnings to accrue. The Senate bill did not adopt the provision for default contributions to the TSP to be to a Roth plan, which is typically better for young, low-income individuals. Section 631 of the Senate bill was adopted to allow cadets to receive continuation pay between 8 to 12 years of service with a minimum 3-year commitment. The Senate bill did not adopt the provision for default contributions to the TSP to be to a Roth plan, allowing earnings to accrue tax-free. Section 631 of the Senate bill was adopted to allow cadets, midshipmen, and reservists a 30-day election period for the new retirement system following commissioning or transfer to active duty. The Senate bill allows cadets, midshipmen, and reservists a 30-day election period for the new retirement system following commissioning or transfer to active duty. This amends 10 U.S.C. \u00a71409. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA) allows state courts to divide disposable military retired pay in divorce cases. Military servicemembers can receive retired pay after 20 years of service. Congress enacted the USFSPA in 1982. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA) allows state courts to divide disposable military retired pay in divorce cases. Military servicemembers can receive retired pay after 20 years of service. Congress enacted the USFSPA in 1982. The amount of retired pay due to a servicemember is calculated based on the member's pay grade and years of service at the time of retirement, with up to 50% being eligible for division. The USFSPA allows state courts to divide disposable military retired pay in divorce cases, with up to 50% eligible for division. Proposed changes would use the pay grade and years of service at the time of a divorce court order. The USFSPA allows state courts to divide up to 50% of a servicemember's disposable military retired pay in divorce cases. Proposed changes would redefine disposable retired pay using pay grade and years of service at the time of a divorce court order, rather than at the time of retirement. The enacted bill authorizes this change and includes cost-of-living adjustments in spousal payments. This provision does not affect prior divorce settlements. The enacted bill (\u00a7641) redefines disposable retired pay using pay grade and years of service at the time of a divorce court order, includes cost-of-living adjustments in spousal payments, and does not affect prior divorce settlements. Military retirees may have a portion of their monthly retired pay withheld to provide a survivor benefit to a surviving spouse or eligible recipients after their death, known as the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP). The survivor's payment through SBP is typically 55% of the retired basic pay. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) allows military retirees to provide a monthly survivor benefit to eligible recipients after their death. The survivor's payment is usually 55% of the retired basic pay. For servicemembers who die while on active duty, the base amount was previously calculated at 75% of their basic pay. Reservists who die during inactive-duty training (IADT) receive a SBP payment based on their years of service. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) typically provides 55% of the retired basic pay to eligible recipients. Previously, for servicemembers who died on active duty, the base amount was 75% of their basic pay. Reservists who died during inactive-duty training (IADT) receive a SBP payment based on their years of service, resulting in a lower payment compared to those who died on active duty. Surviving spouses receiving both SBP and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) have their SBP payments reduced by the amount of DIC. The FY2017 NDAA addressed the disparate treatment of SBP payments for surviving spouses receiving both DOD annuity and VA DIC. The SSIA offsets the reduction in SBP payments due to DIC. Sections 642, 643, 646, and 648 of the enacted bill incorporated provisions from H.R. 4909 and S. 2943. Section 642 of the bill amends Section. The SSIA offsets the reduction in SBP payments due to DIC for surviving spouses. Sections 642, 643, 646, and 648 of the enacted bill include provisions from H.R. 4909 and S. 2943, amending Title 10, United States Code to address differential treatment under the SBP for reserve and active component members who die from injuries during inactive-duty training. Section 642 of the bill eliminates differential treatment under the SBP for reserve and active component members who die from injuries during inactive-duty training. Section 643 allows DOD to withhold SBP payments from Combat Related Special Compensation when retired pay is insufficient. Section 646 extends certain provisions of Title 10, United States Code. Section 646 of the bill amends Title 10, United States Code to allow DOD to withhold SBP payments from Combat Related Special Compensation when retired pay is insufficient. It also extends authority to pay SSIA until May 31, 2018 and requires a report on affected individuals within 90 days of enactment. CBO estimates nearly 65,000 surviving spouses will receive SSIA in FY2018. Section 648 mandates the Defense Secretary to provide for an. Section 646 of the bill amends Title 10, United States Code to allow DOD to withhold SBP payments from Combat Related Special Compensation when retired pay is insufficient. It extends authority to pay SSIA until May 31, 2018 and requires a report on affected individuals within 90 days of enactment. CBO estimates nearly 65,000 surviving spouses will receive SSIA in FY2018. Section 648 mandates an independent assessment of the SBP by a federally funded research and development center, with a report on the results and recommendations to be submitted to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. The Defense Secretary must arrange an independent assessment of the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) by a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) and submit a report with recommendations to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. The report will evaluate the effectiveness of the SBP for survivors of servicemembers, compare benefits with other government and private sector employees, and explore the feasibility of providing survivor benefits through alternative insurance products. The Defense Secretary must arrange an independent assessment of the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) by a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) to evaluate its effectiveness for survivors of servicemembers, compare benefits with other sectors, and explore alternative insurance options. The TRICARE health benefits program covers active duty servicemembers, retirees, family members, and survivors. The Administration's FY2017 Budget proposed changes to enrollment fees and options. The Administration's FY2017 Budget proposed changes to the TRICARE health benefits program, including replacing current options with TRICARE Select and TRICARE Preferred, introducing new enrollment fees, deductibles, co-payments, and an annual catastrophic cap. The Administration's FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE health benefits, including new enrollment fees, deductibles, co-payments, and an annual catastrophic cap for TRICARE Select and TRICARE Preferred options. Additionally, there would be increased pharmacy co-pays for retirees and military family members, with exemptions for active duty members. The proposal aims to reduce TRICARE for Life expenditures. The proposal in the Administration's FY2017 Budget includes changes to TRICARE health benefits, such as new enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-pays. There would also be increased pharmacy co-pays for retirees and military family members, with exemptions for active duty members. The proposal aims to reduce TRICARE for Life expenditures by adjusting contributions to the Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund. The Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund (MERHCF) covers future medical treatment costs for Medicare eligible uniformed services retirees and dependents through the TRICARE for Life program. Each uniformed service will contribute $4,252 per active duty servicemember and $1,723 per reserve component member for FY2017. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that proposed TRICARE changes could save the Department of Defense $2.8 billion in pharmacy co-payment increases and $1.4 billion in new TRICARE for Life enrollment fees from 2016 to 2026. The MERHCF will receive contributions from each uniformed service member. The CBO analysis estimates savings for DOD from TRICARE proposals, including pharmacy co-payment increases and TRICARE for Life enrollment fees. Section 701 of the bill establishes a new TRICARE Select health plan option. The enacted bill will establish a new TRICARE Select health plan option, replacing current options, and modify the existing TRICARE Prime plan. It will also set enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-payments for retirees joining TRICARE after January 1, 2018. The proposals would save $1.4 billion in Life enrollment fees, cost DOD $0.2 billion for TRICARE plan consolidation, and increase Medicare spending by $0.4 billion. The bill will establish TRICARE Select and modify TRICARE Prime, setting enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-payments for retirees joining after January 1, 2018. It will also establish an open enrollment period and limit pre-authorization requirements for referrals under TRICARE Prime. The bill will establish TRICARE Select and modify TRICARE Prime by setting enrollment fees, establishing an open enrollment period, limiting pre-authorization requirements for referrals, and requiring a pilot program on incorporation. The bill will establish TRICARE Select and modify TRICARE Prime by setting enrollment fees, establishing an open enrollment period, limiting pre-authorization requirements for referrals, and requiring a pilot program on incorporation. It also includes provisions for hospitalization, skilled nursing facility care, rehabilitation facility care, and a pilot program on value-based health care methodology in the TRICARE program. In its FY2017 budget request, the Administration proposed changes to TRICARE health plan options, including replacing Prime, Standard, and Extra with a consolidated plan, increasing pharmaceutical co-pays, and introducing a new enrollment fee for TRICARE-for-Life. In its FY2017 budget request, the Administration proposed changes to TRICARE health plan options, including replacing Prime, Standard, and Extra with a consolidated plan, increasing pharmaceutical co-pays, and introducing a new enrollment fee for TRICARE-for-Life. The House-passed bill would have consolidated TRICARE Standard and Extra into a new TRICARE Preferred plan, while the Senate-passed bill would have consolidated them into a new TRICARE Choice plan. Section 701 of the enacted bill amends Chapter 55 of Title 10 of the United States Code to specify cost-sharing amounts for active-duty family. The enacted bill amends Chapter 55 of Title 10 to specify cost-sharing amounts for active-duty family members and retirees under the new TRICARE Select and existing TRICARE Prime options. Exceptions to cost-sharing amounts will be provided to disability retirees, their dependents, and survivors. Cost-sharing amounts for active-duty family members and retirees under the new TRICARE Select and existing TRICARE Prime options will be annually indexed to retirement pay increases. Disability retirees, dependents, and survivors will have exceptions to cost-sharing amounts. TRICARE for Life beneficiaries will not see changes in cost-sharing. A new \"reserve and young adult\" category will be created for TRICARE Reserve Select and TRICARE Young Adult Program beneficiaries. Premiums for these programs will remain the same, but new cost-sharing provisions will apply. Retired TRICARE beneficiaries may face a $150 individual or $300 family annual enrollment fee after a GAO report is submitted. A new \"reserve and young adult\" category will be established for TRICARE Reserve Select and TRICARE Young Adult Program beneficiaries, with premiums remaining unchanged but new cost-sharing provisions applying. Retired TRICARE beneficiaries may be subject to a $150 individual or $300 family annual enrollment fee after a GAO report is submitted by February 1, 2020. The report will assess changes in health care coverage, appointment availability, network provider acceptance, and beneficiary satisfaction. The report will review changes in health care coverage, appointment availability, network provider acceptance, and beneficiary satisfaction for TRICARE beneficiaries. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries may need a waiver or pay 50% of the allowed charge if they obtain care without a required referral. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries may need a waiver or pay 50% of the allowed charge if they obtain care without a required referral. TRICARE beneficiaries have access to a pharmacy program for outpatient prescriptions filled through military pharmacies, TRICARE mail-order pharmacy, or TRICARE retail network and non-network pharmacies. Active duty servicemembers have no pharmacy co-payments when using military pharmacies. TRICARE beneficiaries can access a pharmacy program through military pharmacies, TRICARE mail-order pharmacy, or TRICARE retail network and non-network pharmacies. Active duty servicemembers do not have pharmacy co-payments at military pharmacies. Military pharmacies provide a 90-day supply of formulary medications for free, but non-formulary medicines are generally not available. DOD policy favors generic medications over brand-name drugs. The 2016 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase to pharmacy co-pays and required maintenance drug prescriptions to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies. The 2016 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase to pharmacy co-pays and required maintenance drug prescriptions to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies, aiming to save $300 million in FY2017 and $2 billion over fiscal years 2017 to 2021. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed annual increases in pharmacy co-payments to save $300 million in FY2017 and $2 billion over fiscal years 2017 to 2021. The House-passed bill did not include a provision for co-payment increases, and existing law allows for automatic increases tied to retired pay. The House-passed bill did not include a provision for a pharmacy co-payment increase. Section 702 of the Senate-passed bill would have allowed beneficiaries to continue receiving drugs at no cost in military medical treatment facilities, with no changes to cost-sharing amounts. The Senate-passed bill included a $3 pharmacy co-payment increase that took effect on February 1, 2016. It also allowed beneficiaries to receive drugs at no cost in military medical treatment facilities, with no changes to cost-sharing amounts for certain groups. The Secretary of Defense could exclude certain drugs from coverage based on recommendations. The Senate-passed bill included a $3 pharmacy co-payment increase that took effect on February 1, 2016. It allowed beneficiaries to receive drugs at no cost in military medical treatment facilities, with no changes to cost-sharing amounts for certain groups. Section 702 authorized the Secretary of Defense to exclude drugs of little or no value to beneficiaries and DOD, and to give preferential status to non-generic drugs on the TRICARE formulary. The Senate bill included a pharmacy co-payment increase and allowed beneficiaries to receive drugs at no cost in military facilities. Section 702 authorized the Secretary of Defense to exclude low-value drugs and give preferential status to non-generic drugs on the TRICARE formulary, reducing costs for DOD and TRICARE for Life beneficiaries. Implementing Section 702 would have reduced DOD's net pharmacy costs by $640 million over 2017-2021 and decreased health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries by $2.7 billion over 2017-2026. It would also lower accrual payments into the MERHCF by $1.5 billion from 2018-2021. Implementing Section 702 would reduce DOD's net pharmacy costs by $640 million over 2017-2021 and decrease health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries by $2.7 billion over 2017-2026. It would also lower accrual payments into the MERHCF by about $1.5 billion from 2018-2021. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) was established on October 1, 2013, as a joint combat support agency to ensure Armed Forces medical services can provide a medically ready force. It manages shared services and supports combatant commands. Contact: Don Jansen, x[phone number scrubbed]. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) was formed in 2013 to support Armed Forces medical services. It manages TRICARE and oversees military treatment facilities. The service surgeons general supervise MTF management. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) currently manages shared services, the TRICARE program, and oversees military treatment facilities (MTFs). The service surgeons general supervise MTF management. The conference report suggests a single agency for all MTF administration to improve operational medical force readiness, access to care, health outcomes, and lower costs. The conference report recommends consolidating the administration of military treatment facilities (MTFs) under a single agency to enhance operational medical force readiness, improve access to care, health outcomes, and reduce costs. The conference report recommends consolidating the administration of military treatment facilities (MTFs) under a single agency to enhance operational medical force readiness, improve access to care, health outcomes, and reduce costs. The current organizational structure of the military health system is seen as hindering rapid decision-making and innovation, leading to a proposal for a streamlined management structure to eliminate redundancy, increase efficiency, and generate monetary savings. The enacted bill requires the Director of the Defense Health Agency to oversee the administration of military treatment facilities, including budget matters, starting October 1, 2018. The enacted bill combines provisions from different sections and tasks the Director of the Defense Health Agency with overseeing military treatment facilities, including budget matters, starting October 1, 2018. The bill tasks the Defense Health Agency Director with overseeing military treatment facilities, including budget, IT, healthcare administration, and policy. It establishes a professional staff for policy oversight and defines the roles of service Surgeons General as advisors to the Secretary on health matters. Section 702 codifies the roles and responsibilities of the services' Surgeons General as principal advisors to the Secretary on health matters. They are tasked with recruiting, organizing, training, and equipping medical personnel. The Secretary is required to develop an implementation plan and submit interim and final reports to the armed services committees by specified dates. Section 702 requires the services' Surgeons General to recruit, organize, train, and equip medical personnel. The Secretary must develop an implementation plan and submit reports to the armed services committees by specific dates. The Government Accountability Office will review the plan. Section 703 adds a new section on military medical treatment. Section 703 of the enacted bill adds a new Section 1073d \"Military medical treatment facilities\" to Chapter 55 of Title 10 of the United States Code. This section requires the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical centers, hospitals, ambulatory care centers, and satellite centers to support the medical readiness of the armed forces and medical personnel in areas where civilian health care facilities are unable to. The new Section 1073d in Chapter 55 of Title 10 of the United States Code requires the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical facilities to support the medical readiness of the armed forces and medical personnel in areas where civilian health care facilities are unable to meet the needs of the Armed Forces and covered beneficiaries. The provision requires the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical facilities to support the health care needs of the Armed Forces and covered beneficiaries when civilian facilities are unable to do so. An exception is provided when changes in facilities or services prevent covered beneficiaries from accessing care through non-DOD providers. Current law requires active component enlistees to be a US national, lawful permanent resident, or from the Compact of Free Association. Reserve component enlistees must be citizens, lawful permanent residents, or have prior military service. Citizenship requirements can be waived under certain circumstances. The Senate bill aimed to align reserve component enlistment requirements with those of the active component, but the conference bill did not include this provision. Citizenship requirements for reserve component enlistees can be waived under specific circumstances. The Senate bill aimed to align reserve component enlistment requirements with those of the active component, but the conference bill did not include this provision. Citizenship requirements for reserve component enlistees can be waived under specific circumstances under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7504. On January 28, 2016, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced new policies for maternity and parental leave under the \"Force of the Future\" initiative. The policy extended maternity leave from 6 to 12 weeks, as part of efforts to attract and retain talent in the Armed Forces. The Department of Defense extended maternity leave to 12 weeks and sought to increase parental leave to 14 days as part of the \"Force of the Future\" initiative. The Department of Defense extended parental leave to 12 weeks and proposed legislation to increase it to 14 days. Parental leave for a servicemember whose spouse gives birth was first authorized in 2009 and is currently for a maximum of 10 days. Adopting servicemembers are eligible for up to 21 days of leave since 2006. In dual-service married couples, only one servicemember can take leave for adoption. Parental leave is separate from regular annual leave. Section 521 of the bill allows for up to 12 weeks of total leave. Parental leave for adopting servicemembers allows up to 21 days of leave. In dual-service married couples, only one servicemember can take this leave. Section 521 of the bill authorizes up to 12 weeks of total leave for the primary caregiver in connection with the birth of a child, and 6 weeks for adoption. Secondary caregivers could receive up to 21 days of leave for a birth or adoption. The bill allows up to 12 weeks of leave for the primary caregiver for the birth of a child, and 6 weeks for adoption. Secondary caregivers could receive up to 21 days of leave. The Secretary of Defense will define \"primary\" and \"secondary\" caregivers. Leave must be taken within a year of the event and is for active component members.
