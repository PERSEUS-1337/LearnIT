The Congress finds that the absence of uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use causes confusion among employers and employees, leading to increased worker exposure to workplace injuries and illnesses. Additionally, the lack of Federal standards for these warnings leaves questions about their adequacy to be determined by inconsistent State requirements. The absence of Federal standards for warnings on personal protective equipment for occupational use leads to confusion among employers and employees, increasing the risk of workplace injuries and illnesses. This lack of uniform standards places an undue burden on interstate commerce in such equipment. The purpose of this Act is to enhance workplace safety by establishing uniform warnings for personal protective equipment and preempting any conflicting State standards. SEC. 5.

Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 655) is amended to include a new subsection requiring the Secretary, in consultation with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, to establish uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use within 12 months of enactment. Personal protective equipment refers to gear for worker protection in the workplace. The final regulation establishes uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use, defining personal protective equipment as gear for worker protection in the workplace and warnings as any statement related to safety.

The Secretary considers factors like manufacturer experience, worker opinions, and expert input when promulgating standards for personal protective equipment. SEC. 6. PREEMPTION. In amending Section 4 and Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, Congress clarifies its intent to regulate warnings for personal protective equipment and prohibits states from establishing conflicting standards after federal regulations are in place. After federal regulations are in place, no State or political subdivision may establish conflicting standards for personal protective equipment. The Secretary cannot approve a State plan that contradicts federal standards. The Secretary cannot approve a State plan that includes requirements different from federal occupational safety and health standards."
