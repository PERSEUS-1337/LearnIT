The FY2010 Defense Department requested $33 billion for additional troops in Afghanistan, $1 billion for training Iraq Security Forces, and $2 billion for fuel costs. Total war spending increased to $160 billion, with $99 billion for Afghanistan and $61 billion for Iraq. The total DOD appropriations for the Afghan War reached $314.1 billion after the FY2010 Supplemental. The total DOD appropriations for the Afghan War reached $314.1 billion after the FY2010 Supplemental, and if the FY2011 request is approved, it would rise to $427.7 billion. Comparatively, the enacted total for Iraq is now $705 billion, increasing to $706.2 billion with the FY2010 Supplemental, and to $752 billion if the FY2011 request is approved. These figures exclude war funding for State/USAID and VA Medical. One issue during the FY2010 supplemental debate was evaluating the effectiveness of President Obama's new strategy. President Obama's new strategy for Afghanistan included a timeline for beginning the transfer of forces out of the country in July 2011, following a review in December 2010. However, there were concerns that the timeline could be delayed, and the U.S. drawdown in July 2011 might be minimal. Both Secretary of Defense Gates and Admiral expressed uncertainty about the timeline. President Obama approved a new deployment in Afghanistan with a timeline for beginning the transfer of forces out of the country in July 2011. However, there were concerns that the timeline could be delayed, and the U.S. drawdown in July 2011 might be minimal. Secretary of Defense Gates and Admiral Mullen expressed uncertainty about the timeline, cautioning that the process could take several years. Secretary of Defense Gates and Admiral Mullen have cautioned that the July 2010 date for transitioning out of Afghanistan is not a definite withdrawal date, but rather based on conditions on the ground. They mentioned that the process could take several years, with General Petraeus calling it an 18-month campaign. Concerns were raised by Congress about the timing of the evaluation, the length of the campaign, and the long-term U.S. military involvement. General Petraeus, head of U.S. Central Command, described the initiative as an 18-month campaign to be assessed in September 2011. Congress raised concerns about the timing of the evaluation, the campaign's duration, and the future of U.S. military involvement. Three debated amendments in the House, including one to cut off all funding for Afghanistan, were rejected. During House consideration of H.R. 4899 on July 1, 2100, three amendments were debated and rejected regarding increasing congressional participation in decisions about U.S. military involvement. Amendment No. 3 proposed cutting off all funding for Afghanistan, Amendment No. 4 aimed to limit DOD funding to troop withdrawal, and Amendment No. 5 required a new National Intelligence Estimate and redeployment plan by April 4, 2010. Amendment No. 5, which required a new National Intelligence Estimate and a timetable for troop redeployment, was defeated 162 to 260. The plan for an orderly withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan after July 1, 2011, as announced by the President in 2009, would require Congress approval if not consistent. Concerns have risen since the operation to re-take Marjah in southern Afghanistan, with mixed reports on Taliban presence. The next test was the campaign for Kandahar, a Taliban stronghold. Since the operation to re-take Marjah in southern Afghanistan, concerns have risen about Taliban presence. The next test was the campaign for Kandahar, a Taliban stronghold. Of the $33 billion in DOD's supplemental request, $30 billion was allocated for Afghanistan, including $19 billion for military operations. The $33 billion DOD supplemental request included $30 billion for Afghanistan, with $19 billion for military operations, $3.3 billion for force protection, $2.6 billion for Afghan security forces training, and $2 billion for higher fuel costs. The $33 billion DOD supplemental request for Afghanistan included funds for military operations, force protection, Afghan security forces training, higher fuel costs, equipment reconstitution, military intelligence, national intelligence, military construction, and defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Some policymakers estimate the cost of deploying 30,000 more troops at $1 million per troop. The $33 billion DOD supplemental request for Afghanistan includes funds for equipment reconstitution, military and national intelligence, military construction, and defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Some policymakers estimate deploying 30,000 more troops would cost $1 million per troop. The $30 billion request for Afghanistan includes funds for various activities and programs categorized by the DOD. Different categories show varying increases in funding between FY2009 and FY2011 for the Afghan war. DOD developed functional categories for the $30 billion request for Afghanistan, with different categories showing varying funding increases between FY2009 and FY2011. DOD's estimates differ from CBO's, and the Operations category is expected to increase with troop levels. DOD's reported obligations suggest their estimates may be high unless spending increases substantially. The Operations category in DOD's estimates for the FY2010 cost of deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan differs substantially from CBO's estimates, with a per troop cost of $875,000 compared to $467,000. The DOD estimates for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan in FY2010 show a per troop cost of $875,000, which is almost double the CBO's estimate of $467,000. Both DOD and CBO assume the same average monthly troop strength, with DOD attributing the high operations costs in the supplemental request to the deployment of new troops primarily in southern Afghanistan. The DOD estimates for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan in FY2010 show a per troop cost of $875,000, almost double the CBO's estimate of $467,000. DOD attributes the high operations costs in the supplemental request to deploying new troops primarily in southern Afghanistan, requiring setting up and operating more facilities. The DOD is deploying troops to southern Afghanistan, necessitating the setup of more facilities. Concerns were raised in 2009 about accurately budgeting for military operations, leading to funds being transferred to the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act transferred $5 billion of Operation and Maintenance funding to the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund due to concerns about accurately budgeting for military operations. Obligations reported in the first five months of FY2010 for operational costs are only 22% of the total amount requested, indicating that DOD's estimates may be high. Concerns may be raised about DOD's FY2010 request as obligations reported in the first five months for operational costs are only 22% of the total amount requested. Monthly spending would need to more than double in the next seven months, suggesting DOD's estimates may be high. In the next seven months, monthly spending needs to more than double, indicating that DOD's estimates for FY2010 may be high. An additional $2.6 billion was requested and approved to accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces Fund, bringing total funding to $9.2 billion, a 63% increase. The DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion to accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces Fund, bringing total funding to $9.2 billion in FY2010. Concerns were raised about the need for all the additional funds, the achievability of the ramp-up plan, and oversight issues due to training problems and contracting disputes. The new plan aimed to increase Afghan Security forces to 243,000 by October 2010. The DOD requested $2.6 billion in additional funds in FY2010 to accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces Fund. Concerns were raised about the achievability of the ramp-up plan and oversight issues due to training problems and contracting disputes. The new plan aimed to increase Afghan Security forces to 243,000 by October 2010, with further growth to 305,600 by FY2011. The Afghan Army and Police were planned to grow significantly, with the Army increasing from 97,000 to 171,000 by October 2011 and the Police from 93,800 to 134,000 in the same timeframe. NATO partners endorsed these increases, but it is unclear if the additional $2.6 billion requested by DOD is necessary for this growth. The DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion to sustain the growth of the Afghan Army, pay soldiers more, and provide infrastructure and equipment. Congress has already appropriated $25.5 billion for Afghan Security Forces, with pending requests for FY2010 and FY2011 totaling $14.2 billion. The DOD requested $2.6 billion to support Afghan Army growth, increase soldier pay, and provide infrastructure and equipment. Congress has allocated $25.5 billion for Afghan Security Forces, with pending requests for FY2010 and FY2011 totaling $14.2 billion, bringing the total to $39.8 billion through FY2011. General McChrystal proposed doubling the Afghan Army and Police. The DOD has requested $14.2 billion to support Afghan Security forces, bringing the total funding to $39.8 billion through FY2011. General McChrystal's proposal to double the Afghan Army and Police to 400,000 has not been endorsed by the Obama Administration. Training of Afghan Security forces is jointly managed by DOD and the State Department. The DOD has requested $14.2 billion to support Afghan Security forces, bringing the total funding to $39.8 billion through FY2011. General McChrystal's proposal to double the Afghan Army and Police to 400,000 has not been endorsed by the Obama Administration. Training of Afghan Security forces is jointly managed by DOD and the State Department. The training of Afghan Security forces is carried out by U.S. military personnel, NATO coalition teams, and private contractors, but they have experienced numerous problems in the process. Problems include attrition rates of about 20%, leadership deficiencies, frequent absenteeism, and reduced unit strength. Training of Afghan Security forces is primarily conducted by U.S. military personnel, NATO coalition teams, and private contractors. However, there have been various challenges such as high attrition rates, leadership deficiencies, absenteeism, limited logistical capabilities, illiteracy, corruption, and attacks on police recruits and officers by insurgents. The training of Afghan security forces faces challenges such as reduced unit strength, logistical limitations, and questionable behavior. Issues include difficulties in coordinating training efforts among DOD, State Department, and NATO coalition, reliance on private contractors with performance and behavior problems, and shortages of contractor personnel. Difficulties in coordinating DOD, State Department, and NATO coalition training; Persistent problems with private contractors including poor performance, bad behavior, unauthorized firearm use, and inadequate vetting; Shortages of contractor personnel; Lack of personnel to manage contracts and insufficient contract oversight including invalid invoices and inadequate performance. Despite additional trainers from DOD and requests for more from NATO allies, reported shortages may increase reliance on contractors, raising concerns among Members. Senator Levin expressed concerns about a shortfall in trainers for the Afghan army and police, as noted in DOD's April 1, 2010, Afghan Section 1230 Metrics report. Currently, only 44% of the required 4,083 trainers are assigned, raising questions about the availability of sufficient trainers and the realism of the current ramp-up efforts. Senator Levin raised concerns about a shortfall in trainers for the Afghan army and police, as highlighted in DOD's April 1, 2010, Afghan Section 1230 Metrics report. Currently, only 44% of the required 4,083 trainers are assigned, prompting questions about the availability of sufficient trainers and the feasibility of the current ramp-up efforts. Members may want to know the number of trainers needed for initial and follow-on training to meet the higher targets funded in the FY2010 supplemental request for Afghanistan, and how this requirement will be met in terms of U.S. military personnel, coalition partner teams, and contractor personnel. Members may want to know the number of trainers needed for initial and follow-on training in Afghanistan, including the availability of U.S. military personnel, coalition partner teams, and contractor personnel. Shortfalls in trainers could hamper the ramp-up efforts, impacting the plan to speed up training of the Afghan police. The availability of trainers for Afghan police training in Afghanistan is a concern, as shortfalls could hamper ramp-up efforts. Delays in contract awards and personnel availability may impact DOD's funding and the overall training plan. The sustained bid-protest could have delayed contract award, but Congress allowed the Secretary of State to rely on a previous contract. DOD Assistant Secretary mentioned uncertainty in providing Afghan police training due to lack of a contract. DOD still has nearly $3.6 billion in funding from FY2009 and FY2010. Sedney stated that DOD still has almost $3.6 billion in funding from FY2009 and FY2010, with funds being obligated at a rate of about $540 million a month. This suggests that DOD had an additional six months available for FY2010 even without the requested $2.6 billion in the supplemental. Members have raised concerns about ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. DOD still has almost $3.6 billion in funding from FY2009 and FY2010, with funds being obligated at a rate of about $540 million a month. Some Members have raised concerns about whether emergency supplementals for war are still justified. Some Members have raised concerns about whether emergency supplementals for war are still justified, with DOD having almost $3.6 billion in funding from FY2009 and FY2010. The original request for FY2010 war funding was enacted as Title IX in the FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act. The debate revolves around whether war spending should be included in regular appropriations acts or designated as emergency. The debate over emergency war funding for the FY2010 supplemental request includes arguments for and against the emergency designation, with some questioning the necessity of certain DOD requests not directly related to new troop deployments. Some of DOD's requests in the FY2010 supplemental request, such as $1 billion for training in the Iraqi Security Forces Fund (ISFF) and $2 billion to offset fuel increases, may not be directly related to new troop deployments and could be considered part of DOD's regular FY2011 appropriation request. Congress has become less willing to fund Iraqi security forces due to the turnover of responsibility for security to the Iraqi government and the rise in oil prices in 2008. DOD argues that the $1 billion for the ISFF is necessary for modernization efforts and to sustain them. DOD argued that $1 billion for the ISFF is needed for modernization efforts and to ensure Iraq's security, especially with lower oil prices. Some may challenge its emergency designation and argue that $2 billion for fuel costs could be covered in the base budget. The DOD argues that $1 billion is needed for modernization efforts and Iraq's security due to lower oil prices. Some may challenge the emergency designation and suggest covering $2 billion for fuel costs in the base budget. The DOD argues for $1 billion for modernization and Iraq's security due to lower oil prices. Some suggest covering $2 billion for fuel costs in the base budget. An additional $1.7 billion is requested for equipment reset to replace war-worn equipment for the additional 30,000 troops. The DOD is requesting $1.7 billion for equipment reset to replace war-worn equipment for the additional 30,000 troops in Afghanistan. Some argue that predicting the need for equipment replacement is difficult due to the gradual phasing-in of troops, while others believe it can be estimated based on past experience. The DOD requested $1.7 billion for equipment reset to replace war-worn equipment for the additional troops in Afghanistan. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, $148 million less than the DOD request, including adjustments for excess requirements, fuel pricing changes, and combat losses. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, $148 million less than the DOD request, including adjustments for excess requirements, fuel pricing changes, and combat losses. This includes cuts to military personnel, operation and maintenance, and rejecting funding for contingency construction projects. The Senate version of H.R. 4899 included adjustments such as rejecting DOD's request for $350 million in the Overseas Contingency Operations Fund, cutting $400 million for Army force protection programs, and increasing procurement accounts by $512 million for combat losses. These adjustments were ultimately adopted by the House and enacted. The Senate version of H.R. 4899 included adjustments such as rejecting a DOD proposal to fund Army force protection programs and increasing procurement accounts by $512 million for combat losses. These adjustments were ultimately adopted by the House and enacted. Both the House and Senate versions approved funding for training Afghan and Iraq security forces. The final version also required assessments of threats from Guantanamo detainees to be provided to congressional intelligence committees. The final version of the bill approved funding for training Afghan and Iraq security forces. It included a requirement for assessments of threats from Guantanamo detainees to be provided to congressional intelligence committees. However, it dropped a provision for $300 million for base closure related transportation improvements. The Administration requested $529 million for military construction, including $521 million for military construction in Afghanistan. The Administration requested $529 million for military construction, including $521 million for military construction in Afghanistan. The FY2010 total for war-related construction would be $1.9 billion, double the FY2009 level, raising questions about DOD's intentions in Afghanistan. The FY2010 total for war-related construction would be $1.9 billion, double the FY2009 level, raising questions about DOD's intentions in Afghanistan regarding the construction of facilities for warfighting troops. Congress permitted spending for a \"long-term presence\" but prohibited spending for \"permanent stationing\" of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The FY2010 total for war-related construction in Afghanistan would be $1.9 billion, double the FY2009 level. Congress permitted spending for a \"long-term presence\" but prohibited spending for \"permanent stationing\" of U.S. troops. The $521 million request by DOD aims to create and expand infrastructure to support the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The DOD's $521 million request aims to create and expand infrastructure in Afghanistan to support the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops. The construction projects will focus on roads, runways, quarters, and other facilities to increase airfield and logistics capacity in key locations. Army projects will be concentrated in the southern provinces of Helmand, Nimruz, and Kandahar. The supplemental request for $521 million will expand airfield capacity and logistics infrastructure in key locations in Afghanistan. Army projects will focus on provinces in the south and north, while Air Force construction is planned for provinces in the south, north, and west of the country. The military operations in Afghanistan will focus on Balkh and Kunduz provinces in the north, near the borders of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. Construction plans include airfield expansion in Nimruz, Balkh, and Herand provinces to support airlift and special operations forces. Army projects involve waste management, fuel storage, utilities infrastructure, roads, and a command headquarters at FOB Tombstone in Helmand. Additionally, perimeter security facilities and a helicopter apron will be built in Kunduz. The military construction projects in Afghanistan include waste management systems, fuel storage facilities, utilities infrastructure, gravel roads, and command headquarters at Forward Operating Base (FOB) Tombstone in Helmand. Air Force projects involve a runway and apron at FOB Delaram, a helicopter apron at FOB Dwyer, and helicopter and airlift aprons at other locations in the country. The military construction projects in Afghanistan include facilities such as a runway and apron at FOB Delaram, a helicopter apron at FOB Dwyer, and helicopter and airlift aprons at various locations in the country. Congress is concerned about whether this construction indicates a long-term U.S. troop commitment to Afghanistan. The military construction projects in Afghanistan include facilities like runways and aprons at various locations, raising concerns in Congress about a potential long-term U.S. troop commitment. Congress has taken steps to prevent the establishment of permanent bases in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, Congress has taken steps to prevent the establishment of permanent military bases, similar to measures taken in Iraq. The FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act prohibits the use of defense funds for this purpose. In Afghanistan, Congress has banned the use of defense funds to establish permanent military bases for the stationing of US Armed Forces. The FY2009 Supplemental Appropriation prohibits the use of funds for establishing permanent military bases in Afghanistan. Congress allowed an exception for using Operation & Maintenance funds for long-term military construction projects. The FY2009 Supplemental Appropriation prohibits funds for permanent military bases in Afghanistan, with an exception for long-term military construction projects. Congress did not define projects signaling permanency, allowing the use of Operation & Maintenance funds for a \"long-term presence\" in Afghanistan. The FY2009 Supplemental Appropriation prohibits funds for permanent military bases in Afghanistan but allows for long-term military construction projects. Congress did not clearly define projects signaling permanency, leading to uncertainty over funding for facilities supporting a long-term presence of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The FY2009 Supplemental Appropriation prohibits funds for permanent military bases in Afghanistan but allows for long-term military construction projects. Congress has periodically denied funds for projects perceived as signaling a permanent presence without justification as part of a comprehensive plan for troop stationing. Some projects proposed in the FY2010 Supplemental could face similar scrutiny. The FY2010 Supplemental Appropriation includes projects requested by DOD for urgent military operational requirements. Congress has granted flexibility to use O&M funds for temporary facilities since FY2004, with annual renewals until FY2009. In FY2004, Congress granted DOD flexibility to use O&M funds for temporary facilities to meet urgent military operational requirements. This authority was renewed annually until FY2009, with a cap between $100 million and $200 million. Congress prohibited funds from being used for construction at military installations with long-term presence expectations. In 2009, the law was changed to allow DOD to continue some form of military presence in Afghanistan even after military operations end. In 2009, Congress changed the law to allow DOD to use $200 million in O&M funds for projects in U.S. Central Command and an additional $300 million for construction in Afghanistan to meet urgent military requirements. This exemption permits construction at military installations in Afghanistan deemed to support a long-term presence. In 2009, Congress changed the law to allow DOD to use $200 million in O&M funds for projects in U.S. Central Command and an additional $300 million for construction in Afghanistan to meet urgent military requirements. The FY2010 NDAA extended the authority to use O&M funding for military construction and continued the $500 million total limit on projects in Central Command. This increased the amount spent on military construction significantly. In FY2009, DOD used $409 million from O&M accounts for construction in Afghanistan, adding to the $900 million appropriated, totaling $1.4 billion. This amount nearly equaled the total spent on construction between FY2003 and FY2008. In FY2009, DOD allocated $409 million from O&M accounts for construction in Afghanistan, increasing the total to $1.4 billion. This amount almost matched the entire construction spending from FY2003 to FY2008. If DOD fully utilized the $500 million available for military construction in Afghanistan in FY2010, the total would reach $2.4 billion, nearly doubling the previous seven-year investment. DOD has proposed using O&M funds for unspecified minor projects. In FY2009, DOD allocated $409 million for construction in Afghanistan, increasing total to $1.4 billion. If DOD fully utilizes $500 million in FY2010, total would reach $2.4 billion, almost doubling previous seven-year investment. DOD has proposed using O&M funds for unspecified minor projects in support of contingency operations until October 1, 2012. If FY2011 proposal is approved, total funding for military construction in Afghanistan could rise further. DOD has invested significant amounts in key bases in Afghanistan, including $1.3 billion in Bagram Air Base and $767 million in Kandahar Air Base. Additional funding is requested for further construction projects, with a total of $1.6 billion and $948 million respectively if approved. The amount invested in key bases in Afghanistan includes $1.3 billion in Bagram Air Base, $767 million in Kandahar Air Base, and $595 million for Forward Operating Base Tombstone/Bastion. Additional funding requests total $1.6 billion, $948 million, and $894 million respectively if approved. DOD has also requested new language for FY2011 DOD authorization to use O&M funds for minor military construction projects. The DOD has requested $299 million for Forward Operating Base Tombstone/Bastion, bringing the total funding request to $894 million if approved. Additionally, there is a proposal to allow DOD to use O&M funds for unspecified military construction projects of up to $3 million each in support of contingency operations until September 30, 2012. This would create a temporary two-year authority for DOD to draw on O&M funds for such projects worldwide. The proposal allows DOD to use O&M funds for unspecified military construction projects of up to $3 million each in support of contingency operations until September 30, 2012. This would create a temporary two-year authority for DOD to draw on O&M funds for such projects worldwide, with no limit on the total amount that could be spent. The proposal increases the per project cap for unspecified minor construction projects from $750,000 to $3 million, citing rising construction costs in Afghanistan. DOD could spend \"amounts necessary\" with no limit on O&M funds for military construction in support of contingency operations worldwide. Quarterly reporting to congressional defense committees would be after-the-fact within 60 days. DOD proposed quarterly reporting to congressional defense committees within 60 days for O&M funds used for military construction in support of contingency operations worldwide. Concerns were raised about the urgency of the $521 million supplemental request given DOD's current spending rates and available budget authority. The $521 million supplemental request for military construction projects in Afghanistan raised questions about its urgency, as DOD had $2.1 billion in unobligated budget authority. DOD's spending on these projects decreased from $50 million to $26 million per month in FY2010, but reasons for the decline were not specified in the report. In FY2009, DOD obligated $607 million for military construction projects in Afghanistan, averaging $50 million per month. In FY2010, the average fell to $26 million per month. To obligate all $2.1 billion available by the end of the fiscal year, DOD would need to increase monthly obligations to $300 million. $700 million must be obligated by September 30, 2010, or the funds return to the Treasury. To spend all $2.1 billion available by the end of the fiscal year, DOD needs to increase monthly obligations to $300 million. $700 million must be obligated by September 30, 2010, or the funds return to the Treasury. Another $1.4 billion must be obligated by September 30, 2011. To spend all available funds by the end of the fiscal year, DOD needs to increase monthly obligations. For FY2009 monies, the obligation rate would need to quadruple to $100 million monthly. Similarly, for FY2010 projects, obligations would need to average $116 million monthly. With supplemental funds, obligations would have to triple from the FY2009 rate to $150 million monthly and increase six-fold from the current FY2010 rate. With the additional supplemental funds, monthly obligations for FY2010 projects would need to triple from the FY2009 rate to $150 million a month and increase six-fold from the current rate. Some argue that the FY2010 supplemental request could be considered as part of DOD's FY2011 war request for more evidence on spending rates and prospects for the Afghan war. Total funding for military construction/family housing in H.R. 4899 was $657 million, including $649 million for war-related construction. The FY2010 supplemental request could be part of DOD's FY2011 war request for more evidence on spending rates and prospects for the Afghan war. Total funding for military construction/family housing in H.R. 4899 was $657 million, including $649 million for war-related construction in Afghanistan. Additional $8 million was allocated for Air Force non war-related request to cover higher utility bills in Air Force family housing. The final military construction funding was $127.5 million above the request to accelerate projects planned for FY2011. The final military construction funding in the FY2010 supplemental request was $127.5 million above the initial request to accelerate projects planned for FY2011. This included $649 million for war-related construction in Afghanistan and an additional $8 million for Air Force non war-related requests. The Senate report emphasized the importance of including contingency construction requirements in the Military Construction budget request if known at the time. The Air Force proposed to fund contingency-related projects in FY2011 using O&M monies. The Senate report emphasized the need to include contingency construction requirements in the Military Construction budget request if known at the time. Military construction funds would be available for two years instead of four as requested by the Administration. The Department of Defense should notify the Committee when projects and funding sources are identified. Military construction funds would be available for two years, not four as requested by the Administration. The final bill did not include $16.5 million for a new Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood. The final bill did not include $16.5 million for a new Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood, TX, addressing specific foreign economic assistance and operational requirements in strategic frontline nations. The international affairs budget request for war-related programs in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan was $4.46 billion, with a focus on civilian operational requirements and demonstrating U.S. support to Pakistan. The international affairs budget request for war-related programs in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan was $4.46 billion. The request aimed to demonstrate U.S. support to Pakistan and strengthen the government's presence in insurgent areas. $1.8 billion was allocated for personnel and infrastructure under the State Department, while $2.6 billion was for foreign aid to support various objectives. The international affairs budget request for war-related programs in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan was $4.46 billion. $1.8 billion was allocated for personnel and infrastructure under the State Department, while $2.6 billion was for foreign aid to support various objectives in U.S. security, economic growth, social service, and democratization. Funding was requested in discrete sub-accounts for each country, excluding P.L.480 food aid and Global Health/Child Survival accounts. If approved, the specific accounts for the three countries would increase. The FY2010 international affairs budget request for war-related programs in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan was $4.46 billion, with $1.8 billion allocated for State Department personnel and infrastructure, and $2.6 billion for foreign aid to support security, economic growth, social service, and democratization objectives. The enacted FY2010 supplemental increased the total level to about $9.2 billion, a 55% increase over the FY2009 appropriation. The FY2010 international affairs budget for war-related programs in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan increased to $9.2 billion, a 55% rise from FY2009. The enacted version of the FY2010 supplemental provided $3.7 billion for international affairs war-related foreign aid and diplomatic operations, $714 million less than the Administration's request. The FY2010 international affairs budget for war-related programs in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan increased to $9.2 billion, a 55% rise from FY2009. The enacted FY2010 supplemental provided $3.7 billion for international affairs war-related foreign aid and diplomatic operations funding, $714 million less than the Administration's request. The Administration's request for Afghanistan emphasized civilian programs in governance, economic growth, and social services, in conjunction with U.S. military efforts. Strengthening the U.S. civilian presence, increasing aid to local government, and enhancing the role of the national government in providing local services have been ongoing strategies. The importance of civilian programs in governance, economic growth, and social services, provided in conjunction with U.S. military efforts in the country, has been emphasized. The December 2009 \"surge\" strategy accelerated the need for civilian assistance delivery, especially in insurgent areas contested by the U.S. military, focusing on rapidly increasing stability and reducing insurgency strength through job creation. The December 2009 \"surge\" strategy accelerated the need for civilian assistance delivery in insurgent areas contested by the U.S. military.

Spending for VA benefits and court settlements may not be subject to budget procedural constraints. The Administration proposed additional mandatory spending for VA benefits and court settlements, which may not be subject to budget procedural constraints like PAYGO rules. However, new legislative authority and funds are required for the court settlements, making them subject to budget enforcement rules. Members have suggested finding offsets or designating the funding as emergency. The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs has the authority to establish presumptions of service connection for conditions related to Agent Orange exposure, including Parkinson's disease and ischemic heart conditions. New legislative authority and funds are needed for court settlements, which may be subject to budget rules like PAYGO. Members have proposed offsets or emergency funding for these settlements. The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs has the authority to establish presumptions of service connection for conditions related to Agent Orange exposure, including Parkinson's disease, ischemic heart disease, and hairy cell/B cell leukemia for veterans who served in the Republic of Vietnam. The estimated cost for these new presumptions of service connection is $13.4 billion in FY2010. The VA issued proposed regulations on March 25, 2010, establishing presumptions of service connection for Parkinson's disease, ischemic heart disease, and hairy cell/B cell leukemia for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. The estimated cost for these new presumptions is $13.4 billion in FY2010, with approximately 86,000 veterans eligible for retroactive benefits. Additionally, some veterans may receive an increase in their disability rating or begin disability compensation based on the new presumptions. The VA estimates that $13.4 billion will be spent in FY2010 for new presumptions related to Agent Orange exposure, benefiting around 86,000 veterans. Disability compensation payments will start once final regulations are published, with potential increases in disability ratings for some veterans.

These funds are not emergency funding and will be available until September 2011 for the DOL, SSA, and IRS, and until September 30, 2012 for HHS. CBO estimated that this additional funding would increase the federal deficit by $538 million in 2010. The additional funding for the DOL, SSA, and IRS is not emergency funding and will be available until September 2011, while HHS funds will be available until September 30, 2012. CBO estimated that the extra funding would increase the federal deficit by $538 million in 2010, with no estimated savings. This would result in an increase in federal budget deficits by the same amount over the period 2010-2020. The Administration proposed to increase federal budget deficits by expanding funds for the Coast Guard's response activities from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund and creating a new unemployment assistance program for those not eligible for other benefits. The Trust Fund allows the Coast Guard to access up to $150 million annually for response efforts, funded by an excise tax on petroleum products. The Administration proposed to finance response activities for the Coast Guard and establish a new unemployment assistance program for those not eligible for other benefits.

The Administration proposed to increase the cap on total expenditure for responding to individual incidents from $1 billion to $1.5 billion, with $1.575 billion available in the trust fund by the end of FY2010. The proposed increase in the limitation on annual advances from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund would apply exclusively to responding to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Office of Management and Budget estimated $1.575 billion would be available for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill response. The proposed increase in annual advances from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund would enhance federal emergency response capabilities for this specific spill. The Coast Guard would need to notify Congress of any advanced funds within 7 days.

Thad Allen and Janet Napolitano informed that the Coast Guard would hit the $150 million cap by late June. Legislation P.L. 111-191 (S. 3473) raised the cap to $1 billion for the Deepwater Horizon spill, allowing $100 million withdrawals with 7-day notifications to Congress. CBO estimated $50 million needed in FY2010, offset by reimbursements in FY2012. The actual amount available to the Coast Guard under Section 2001 would depend on the number of $100 million advances drawn from the trust fund. The legislation P.L. 111-191 raised the cap to $1 billion for the Deepwater Horizon spill, allowing $100 million withdrawals with 7-day notifications to Congress.
