    "content": "Rising procurement costs for Navy ships are a concern for Navy officials and Members of Congress. The Congressional Budget Office estimates higher funding levels are needed for the Navy's shipbuilding plan. Constraints on funding have led to reduced ship procurement rates, causing concerns about the future size of the Navy and shipyards. The Navy has received 76% more than average in recent years, leading to constraints on ship-procurement funding and rising ship procurement costs. Congress is concerned about the impact on future Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. The Navy's ship procurement costs are rising, leading to constraints on funding and potential impacts on future capabilities. Congress is considering options such as increasing funding, changing budget allocation, utilizing multiyear procurement, adjusting acquisition strategies, and reducing shipyard fixed overhead costs. Options for addressing rising Navy ship procurement costs include increasing funding, changing budget allocation, utilizing multiyear procurement, adjusting acquisition strategies, reducing shipyard fixed overhead costs, improving operating efficiency, building ships without some planned equipment, and considering construction in foreign shipyards. The report focuses on reducing Navy ship procurement costs by shifting to designs with lower unit procurement costs. The report discusses options for reducing Navy ship procurement costs by shifting to designs with lower unit procurement costs, including lower-cost attack submarines, aircraft carriers, larger surface combatants, and smaller surface combatants. The report focuses on lower-cost designs for Navy ships, including attack submarines, aircraft carriers, and surface combatants. It discusses potential advantages and disadvantages of shifting to these designs and reviews recent legislative activity related to rising Navy ship procurement costs. The report reviews recent legislative activity on rising Navy ship procurement costs and proposes lower-cost designs for attack submarines, aircraft carriers, and surface combatants. Options for these designs are taken from reports by the CBO, DOD's OFT, and the CSBA. Lower-cost Navy ship designs can be created by reducing ship size, as seen in the example of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). This strategy is suggested in reports by the CBO, DOD's Office of Force Transformation (OFT), and the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (CSBA). The Navy can reduce procurement costs by implementing changes such as reducing ship size and shifting from nuclear to conventional propulsion for certain ship designs. Shifting from nuclear to conventional propulsion for Navy ships can significantly reduce procurement costs by several hundred million dollars. This strategy can be applied to submarines and aircraft carriers, leading to cost savings. Additionally, transitioning from military survivability standards to commercial-ship survivability standards can further decrease costs. Shifting from a nuclear to conventional propulsion plant and using a commercial-like hull design can significantly reduce Navy ship procurement costs by several hundred million dollars. This strategy can be applied to various ship classes, including the Maritime Prepositioning Force squadron. The Navy is considering using a common hull design for multiple ship classes to reduce costs and improve production economies of scale. This strategy can be applied to the planned Maritime Prepositioning Force squadron and the DDG-1000 destroyer. The Navy is exploring the use of a common hull design for multiple ship classes to cut costs and enhance production economies of scale. This approach could be applied to various ship classes, including the DDG-1000 destroyer and proposed large surface ships like an aircraft carrier and missile ship. The Navy is considering using a common hull design for multiple ship classes to reduce costs and improve production efficiency. This strategy could be applied to various ships, including an aircraft carrier, missile ship, amphibious assault ship, and small-craft \"mother\" ship. Lower-cost ship options using these approaches may be less capable individually than current plans. The Navy is exploring the use of a common hull design for different ship classes to cut costs and enhance production efficiency. Lower-cost ship options derived from this approach may be less capable individually than current designs. These options are discussed for various ship categories, with details on estimated procurement costs when available. The Navy is considering lower-cost ship options derived from a common hull design approach, which may be less capable individually than current designs. The report discusses potential lower-cost options for the Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered submarine, including AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines and reduced-cost \"Tango Bravo\" nuclear-powered submarines. The Navy is currently procuring one Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered attack submarine per year at a cost of $2.6 billion each. They are considering lower-cost options such as AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines and reduced-cost \"Tango Bravo\" nuclear-powered submarines to maintain a fleet of 313 ships, including 48 SSNs. The Navy is currently procuring one Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered attack submarine per year at a cost of $2.6 billion each. The FY2007-FY2011 Future Years Defense Plan maintains Virginia-class procurement at one per year through FY2011. The Navy is proposing to maintain a fleet of 313 ships, including 48 SSNs. To fully support the planned force of 48 boats, a total of 35 boats may need to be procured during the period FY2007-FY2022, averaging about 2.2 boats per year. Continuing the current procurement rate could reduce the SSN force to fewer than 30 boats by 2030. The Navy's plan to maintain a fleet of 48 SSNs may require procuring 35 boats during FY2007-FY2022, averaging 2.2 boats per year. Continuing at the current rate could decrease the SSN force to under 30 boats by 2030. Options for a lower-cost attack submarine include a non-nuclear-powered submarine with AIP system or a reduced-cost SSN with new \"Tango Bravo\" technologies. By 2030, the Navy plans to maintain a fleet of 48 SSNs, but the current procurement rate could decrease the force to under 30 boats. To address this, options for a lower-cost attack submarine include a non-nuclear-powered submarine with AIP system or a reduced-cost SSN with \"Tango Bravo\" technologies. Non-nuclear-powered submarines are cheaper due to smaller size and different propulsion systems. The Navy plans to maintain a fleet of 48 SSNs by 2030, but the current procurement rate may decrease the force to under 30 boats. To address this, options include non-nuclear-powered submarines with AIP systems or reduced-cost SSNs with \"Tango Bravo\" technologies. AIP-equipped submarines have extended submerged endurance. The OFT report suggests adding air-independent propulsion (AIP) submarines to the Navy's fleet, alongside Virginia-class boats. AIP submarines have extended submerged endurance and could be procured in place of Virginia-class submarines. The OFT report recommends adding air-independent propulsion (AIP) submarines to the Navy's fleet, potentially procuring them alongside Virginia-class boats. It suggests substituting four AIP submarines for one Virginia-class submarine in each carrier strike group, with an estimated unit procurement cost of $600 million to $750 million each. The OFT report recommends adding air-independent propulsion (AIP) submarines to the Navy's fleet, potentially procuring them alongside Virginia-class boats. It suggests substituting four AIP submarines for one Virginia-class submarine in each carrier strike group, with an estimated unit procurement cost of $600 million to $750 million each. The U.S. Navy AIP submarine might be built to higher capability standards, possibly reducing the equal-cost ratio of substitution to three to one or possibly something closer two to one. The U.S. Navy AIP submarine might cost more to procure due to higher capability standards, potentially reducing the equal-cost ratio of substitution to three to one or closer to two to one. New technologies may allow for the design of a new SSN equivalent in capability to the Virginia class. The Navy and DARPA are developing new technologies under the Tango Bravo program to design a less expensive SSN with capabilities similar to the Virginia class submarines. The Navy and DARPA are developing new technologies under the Tango Bravo program to design a reduced-size submarine with equivalent capability as the Virginia class design, aiming to reduce platform infrastructure and production costs. The collaborative effort between DARPA and the Navy aims to develop technology for a reduced-size submarine with capabilities similar to the VIRGINIA Class design. The focus is on reducing platform infrastructure and production costs, while also increasing payload volume. Key technology barriers to be addressed include shaftless propulsion, external weapons, and alternatives to the existing spherical array. The collaborative effort between DARPA and the Navy aims to develop technology for a reduced-size submarine with capabilities similar to the VIRGINIA Class design. The focus is on overcoming technology barriers such as shaftless propulsion, external weapons, conformal alternatives to the existing spherical array, and automation to reduce crew workload. If successful, these technologies could lead to the design of a new submarine equivalent in capability to the Virginia class. Some Navy and industry officials believed in 2004 that developing new technologies could lead to designing a submarine equivalent to the Virginia class but with a lower procurement cost. This new submarine, referred to as \"Tango Bravo\" SSN, could be procured at a rate of two per year, making it a viable alternative to AIP submarines. A new \"Tango Bravo\" SSN submarine with capabilities similar to the Virginia class, but at a lower procurement cost, is being considered as an alternative to AIP submarines. Design work on this submarine could start now, with Virginia-class procurement continuing at one per year until the Tango Bravo submarine is ready for procurement. Design work on a new \"Tango Bravo\" SSN submarine with capabilities similar to the Virginia class is being considered by Navy and industry officials. Virginia-class procurement could continue at one per year until the Tango Bravo submarine is ready for procurement, at which point Virginia-class procurement would end. If design work is pursued now, the first Tango Bravo submarine could be ready for procurement in a few years. The Navy is considering design work on a new \"Tango Bravo\" submarine with capabilities similar to the Virginia class. Potential lower-cost options include medium-sized conventionally powered carriers based on different designs. The Navy is currently building large nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. The Navy is exploring lower-cost options for carriers, including medium-sized carriers based on different hull designs. The current large nuclear-powered aircraft carriers have a full load displacement of about 100,000 tons and can carry an air wing of 75 CTOL airplanes and helicopters. The George H.W. Bush (CVN-77) was the last Nimitz class carrier procured in FY2001 at a total cost of $4.975 billion. The Navy is exploring lower-cost options for carriers, including medium-sized carriers based on different hull designs. The George H.W. Bush (CVN-77) was the last Nimitz class carrier procured in FY2001 at a total cost of $4.975 billion. The next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, is scheduled to enter service in 2008 as the lead ship of the new CVN-21 class. The estimated construction cost of the next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, is $10.5 billion, with procurement scheduled for FY2008 and entry into service in 2015. This carrier is part of the new CVN-21 class, with $2.4 billion in detailed design and nonrecurring engineering costs. Advance procurement funding has been provided since FY2001. The Navy estimates CVN-78's procurement cost at $10.5 billion, including $2.4 billion in detailed design and nonrecurring engineering costs. Advance procurement funding has been provided since FY2001, with the ship scheduled for procurement in FY2008 and entry into service in 2015. The next carrier, CVN-79, is planned for procurement in FY2012, entering service around 2019. CVN-80 is planned for procurement in FY2016. The Navy plans to procure CVN-79 in FY2012, entering service around 2019. CVN-80 is planned for procurement in FY2016. Options for a lower-cost aircraft carrier include a medium-sized, conventionally powered carrier based on the design for LHA-6 or a commercial-like hull design. Another option is a small, high-speed, conventionally powered carrier. The Navy is considering options for new aircraft carriers, including a medium-sized carrier based on the LHA-6 design, a small high-speed carrier, and procuring CVN-21-class carriers to maintain a force of 10 large carriers. The CSBA report recommended procuring CVN-21-class aircraft carriers to maintain a force of 10 large carriers and an additional four medium-sized carriers based on the LHA(R) design. The medium-sized carrier might displace about 40,000 tons, embark a VSTOL air wing of F-35 JSF, and cost roughly $3 billion. The OFT report recommended a medium-sized carrier based on a commercial-like hull design. The OFT report recommended procuring a medium-sized carrier based on a commercial-like hull design developed in 2004 for the Navy's Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future) analysis of alternatives. This carrier would have a full load displacement of about 57,000 tons and embark a notional air wing of 36 manned aircraft\u201430 Joint Strike Fighters (JSFs) and 6 MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft\u2014and 15 unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). The OFT report recommended a 57,000-ton carrier with a commercial-like hull design for the Navy's Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future) analysis of alternatives. It would carry 36 manned aircraft and 15 unmanned air vehicles, larger than the LHA(R)-based carrier and similar in size to the UK's new aircraft carrier design. The OFT report recommended a 57,000-ton carrier with a commercial-like hull design for the Navy's Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future) analysis of alternatives. It would carry 36 manned aircraft and 15 unmanned air vehicles, larger than the LHA(R)-based carrier and similar in size to the UK's new aircraft carrier design. The report suggested substituting two of these carriers for each of the Navy's current large carriers to maintain the same number of manned aircraft at sea. Additionally, it proposed a smaller, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons with a surface effect ship (SES)/catamaran hull design as an alternative. The OFT report recommended a smaller, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons with a surface effect ship (SES)/catamaran hull design as an alternative to the 57,000-ton carrier for the Navy's current large carriers. This smaller carrier would embark a notional air wing of 10 manned aircraft and 8 UAVs, with a maximum speed of 50 to 60 knots. The OFT report recommended a smaller, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons with a surface effect ship (SES)/catamaran hull design. It would embark a notional air wing of 10 manned aircraft\u20148 JSFs and 2 MV-22s\u2014and 8 UAVs, with a maximum speed of 50 to 60 knots. The ship would be slightly larger than Thailand's 11,500-ton aircraft carrier and smaller than Spain's 17,000-ton carrier or the UK's three existing 20,600-ton carriers. The OFT report recommended a smaller, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons with a surface effect ship (SES)/catamaran hull design. It would be much faster than existing carriers and could substitute eight of these carriers for each of the Navy's current large carriers. The OFT report recommended a smaller, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons with a surface effect ship (SES)/catamaran hull design. It would be faster than existing carriers and could substitute eight of these carriers for each of the Navy's current large carriers. Other potential designs discussed include a large, conventionally powered carrier similar to the Kitty Hawk and John F. Kennedy. A large conventionally powered aircraft carrier design similar to the Kitty Hawk and John F. Kennedy, with a potential cost savings compared to nuclear-powered carriers. Another option is a medium-sized nuclear-powered carrier based on the LHA(R) hull design. The curr_chunk discusses the possibility of a medium-sized nuclear-powered carrier based on the LHA(R) hull design, with a potential cost savings compared to a conventionally powered carrier. This ship might displace about 40,000 tons and embark two dozen VSTOL JSFs, costing more than $3 billion. A medium-sized nuclear-powered carrier based on the LHA(R) hull design could cost more than $3 billion and displace about 40,000 tons. It might embark two dozen VSTOL JSFs and be similar to France's Charles de Gaulle carrier. A conceptual design for a very small, high-speed VSTOL carrier with a displacement of about 4,000 tons, a maximum speed of 60 knots, and an embarked air wing of about seven VSTOL JSFs and two helicopters was developed by the Naval War College in 2000. The Naval War College in 2000 developed a conceptual design for a very small, high-speed VSTOL carrier with a displacement of about 4,000 tons and a maximum speed of 60 knots. The carrier would have an embarked air wing of about seven VSTOL JSFs and two helicopters. Different ship sizes, propulsion types, and hull types create a matrix of notional aircraft carrier options, including large nuclear-powered carriers and potential alternatives. Medium-sized carriers of 40,000 to 70,000 tons could operate VSTOL or CTOL aircraft, with larger ships potentially more efficient for CTOL operations. Small carriers, due to their shorter length, would have limitations. The Navy has explored various carrier options, including large nuclear-powered carriers and potential alternatives. Medium-sized carriers of 40,000 to 70,000 tons could operate VSTOL or CTOL aircraft, with larger ships potentially more efficient for CTOL operations. Small carriers would likely be limited to VSTOL aircraft. Small nuclear-powered carriers are also a possibility. The Navy has explored carrier options, including large nuclear-powered carriers. Small carriers would likely be limited to VSTOL aircraft. Small nuclear-powered carriers are possible, with examples of nuclear-powered cruisers procured between FY1957 and FY1975. The Navy procured nine nuclear-powered cruisers between FY1957 and FY1975, with displacements ranging from 9,000 to 17,500 tons. The current design includes the 14,500-ton DDG-1000 destroyer/CG(X), while potential lower-cost options include an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer (SCD). The Navy's current design includes the 14,500-ton DDG-1000 destroyer/CG(X) and potential lower-cost options like an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer (SCD) and a 6,000-ton frigate (FFG(X)). The Navy plans to procure DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers, with the CG(X) being based on the DDG-1000 design but larger and more expensive. The FY2007 budget requests procurement funding for the first two DDG-1000s. The Navy plans to procure an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer (SCD), a 6,000-ton frigate (FFG(X)), and the DDG-1000 destroyer/CG(X). The DDG-1000 would have a full-load displacement of about 14,500 tons, making it larger than any U.S. Navy destroyer or cruiser since. The Navy plans to procure the DDG-1000 destroyer, with a full-load displacement of 14,500 tons, costing $3.3 billion each for the first two ships and $2.5 billion each for the following three ships. Funding will be split across FY2007 and FY2008. The U.S. Navy plans to procure the DDG-1000 destroyer, with estimated costs of $3.3 billion for the first two ships and $2.5 billion for the next three. The total number of DDG-1000s to be procured has been reduced to 7 as part of the proposed 313-ship fleet, which also includes 19 CG(X)s. Concerns have been raised about potential higher procurement costs than initially estimated. The Analysis Improvement Group in the Office of the Secretary of Defense believes DDG-1000 procurement costs may be higher than Navy estimates. The Navy plans to procure a total of 7 DDG-1000s as part of the proposed 313-ship fleet, reducing the original plan of 16 to 24. The FY2006-FY2011 FYDP submitted to Congress reduced planned DDG-1000 procurement to one per year for FY2007-FY2011. Options for a reduced-cost surface combatant are being considered. The FY2006-FY2011 FYDP reduced planned DDG-1000 procurement to one per year for FY2007-FY2011, maintaining an average procurement rate of one DDG-1000 per year. Options for a reduced-cost surface combatant include an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer, a 6,000-ton frigate, and a gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship hull design. Another option is a new-design ship of about 11,000 tons, 25% smaller than the current DDG-1000 design. A lower-cost surface combatant option is a new-design ship of about 11,000 tons, roughly 25% smaller than the current DDG-1000 design. This ship could serve as a replacement for the CG(X) program or both the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs. The DDG-1000 design is roughly equal in size to two classes of nuclear-powered cruisers from the 1970s and larger than today's Arleigh Burke class destroyers. A smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD) could replace the CG(X) program, incorporate similar technologies, cost less to procure, have a reduced crew size, and lower operation costs compared to the DDG-51 design. A smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD) could replace the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs, incorporating similar technologies at a lower cost. It would have a reduced crew size and lower operation costs compared to the current DDG-51 design, while carrying a payload smaller than the DDG-1000 or CG(X) but greater than current Ticonderoga (CG-47) Aegis cruisers or DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers. A smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD) could replace the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs, incorporating similar technologies at a lower cost. It would have reduced crew size and operation costs compared to the current DDG-51 design, while carrying a payload smaller than the DDG-1000 or CG(X) but greater than current Ticonderoga (CG-47) Aegis cruisers or DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers. The SCD could have a land-attack oriented version with two Advanced Gun Systems (AGSs) or an air- and missile-defense version preserving CG(X) radar capabilities. Another option suggested by CBO is a smaller, less expensive frigate as a replacement. A smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD) could replace the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs, incorporating similar technologies at a lower cost. It could carry two Advanced Gun Systems (AGSs) like the DDG-1000, while reducing other payload elements. Another option suggested by CBO is a smaller, less expensive frigate as a replacement, estimated to displace about 6,000 tons with a unit procurement cost of about $800 million. CBO proposed a 6,000-ton frigate, FFG(X), as a replacement for DDG-1000 and LCS programs. The estimated unit procurement cost is around $800 million. The FFG(X) may not be equipped with the AGS but could perform non-gunfire missions like the DDG-1000 and LCS. A 6,000-ton FFG(X) could serve as a replacement for the Navy's FFG-7 and DD-963 class ships, offering a middle ground in size. It may not have the AGS capability of the DDG-1000 but could perform non-gunfire missions like both the DDG-1000 and LCS. A 6,000-ton FFG(X) is proposed as a replacement for the Navy's FFG-7 and DD-963 class ships, offering a middle ground in size for carrying modern mission equipment. Another option suggested is a smaller, less expensive gunfire support ship based on the San Antonio (LPD-17) amphibious ship. The CBO and CSBA have proposed a lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the San Antonio (LPD-17) amphibious ship, with one or two AGSs on the basic LPD-17 hull design. The estimated cost for an initial AGS-armed LPD-17 is around $1.9 billion, including design and engineering costs. Subsequent ships may cost about $1.5 billion. LPD-17s under construction for Marine operations may displace 25,000 tons. An AGS-armed LPD-17 could cost $1.9 billion initially and $1.5 billion for subsequent ships. Navy plans to procure 55 Littoral Combat Ships as part of its 313-ship fleet. The Navy plans to procure 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) as part of its 313-ship fleet. The current design is a 2,500- to 3,000-ton LCS with potential lower-cost options of a 1,000-ton or 100-ton surface combatant. Each LCS sea frame may cost about $1.5 billion. The Navy plans to procure 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) as part of its fleet. The procurement cost of each LCS sea frame is targeted to be no more than $220 million, with an average ship procurement cost of about $387 million when mission modules are included. The Office of Force Transformation (OFT) report recommended procuring a 1,000-ton surface combatant instead of the LCS, with a total acquisition cost of about $22.1 billion for a program of 55 ships. This new ship would have similar capabilities to the LCS, including modular mission packages and self-deployment to the theater of operations. The OFT report recommended procuring a 1,000-ton surface combatant with a total acquisition cost of $22.1 billion. The ship would have a maximum speed of 40 to 50 knots, standard interfaces for modular mission packages, and self-deployment capabilities. Additionally, the report suggested procuring larger ships to support the 1,000-ton surface combatant. Alternatively, a 100-ton surface combatant with a maximum speed of 60 knots and standard interfaces for mission packages was also recommended. The OFT report recommended procuring a 100-ton surface combatant with a maximum speed of 60 knots and standard interfaces for mission packages. These ships would be transported to the theater by a \"mother ship\" based on a 57,000-ton hull used for OFT's proposed medium-sized aircraft carrier. The 100-ton surface combatants would be supported in theater by the mother ship and possibly another larger ship recommended by OFT. The OFT report recommended procuring a 100-ton surface combatant with a maximum speed of 60 knots and standard interfaces for mission packages. These ships would be transported to the theater by a \"mother ship\" based on a 57,000-ton hull used for OFT's proposed medium-sized aircraft carrier. The potential lower-cost ship designs outlined above can be assessed in terms of cost, capability, technical risk, homeporting arrangements, and potential impact on the shipbuilding industrial base. The lower-cost ship designs can be evaluated based on cost, capability, technical risk, homeporting arrangements, and impact on the shipbuilding industrial base. While these designs may have lower unit procurement costs compared to current plans, a comprehensive assessment would consider development, design, procurement, operation, support, and disposal costs. Developing a large Navy ship can cost billions of dollars, so stopping a project that has already been developed and designed can have significant financial implications. The cost implications of different ship design options include development, design, procurement, operation, support, and disposal costs. Developing a large Navy ship can cost billions of dollars, so switching to a lower-cost design may save money in the long run if procured in large numbers. Switching to a new, lower-cost ship design could save money in the long run if procured in large numbers, but stopping an existing ship program for this new design may result in additional development costs. The earlier a program is stopped, the sooner a lower-cost alternative could reach the break-even point financially. Switching to a new, lower-cost ship design could save money in the long run if procured in large numbers. Stopping an existing ship program for this new design may result in additional development costs, but the earlier in the process it is stopped, the sooner a lower-cost alternative could reach the break-even point financially. If a lower-cost ship can utilize existing technologies, development costs could be reduced through the learning curve process. If a lower-cost ship can use existing technologies, development costs could be reduced through the learning curve process, decreasing shipyard labor hours required to build the design. This could result in substantial cost savings compared to the more expensive ship design. The number of shipyard labor hours required to build a ship design decreases as workers become more familiar with it. The difference in cost between a planned design and a lower-cost alternative may be smaller if ships have already been built to the planned design. The break-even point for the lower-cost design will be further into the production run if the planned design is already in production. A lower-cost alternative design may have a smaller cost difference if ships have already been built to the planned design. The break-even point for the lower-cost design will be further into production if the planned design is already being produced. Additionally, if the lower-cost design can be procured at a higher annual rate, it could benefit from greater spreading of fixed overhead costs and move down the learning curve more quickly. If a lower-cost design can be procured at a higher annual rate than the currently planned design, it could benefit from greater spreading of fixed overhead costs and move down the learning curve more quickly. Navy ships can remain in service for many years, with different classes having varying lifespans. Ship procurement costs are a significant part of the budget. Reducing a ship's life-cycle O&S cost can involve design features that increase procurement cost. Personnel costs are a significant component of ship O&S costs. Reducing a ship's life-cycle O&S cost may require design features that increase procurement costs. Personnel costs, including crew size reduction through automation, are a significant component of ship O&S costs. Reducing crew size through automation can increase ship procurement costs if the added technology is more expensive than building extra crew-related spaces. Maintenance costs can also be reduced by using more durable materials or increasing the size of certain ship spaces. Reducing crew size through automation can increase ship procurement costs if the added technology is more expensive than building extra crew-related spaces. Maintenance costs can also be reduced by using more durable materials or increasing the size of certain ship spaces. Alternative ship designs may have lower procurement costs but higher life-cycle O&S costs due to incorporating features that increase maintenance accessibility. Choosing such a design over the current plan may not necessarily reduce total Navy costs. Alternative ship designs may have lower procurement costs but higher life-cycle O&S costs due to features that increase maintenance accessibility. Choosing such a design may not reduce total Navy costs as expected. Life-cycle O&S cost of conventionally powered ships includes fuel costs, unlike nuclear-powered ships. The procurement cost of a nuclear-powered ship includes the cost of the nuclear fuel core, which is not the case for conventionally powered ships. The fuel core for a nuclear-powered attack submarine in 2004 cost about $158 million and is designed to power the ship for its entire 33-year expected life, while for a nuclear-powered carrier, the core cost about $300 million in 2004. The cost of the nuclear fuel core for a nuclear-powered ship is included in the procurement cost. In 2004, the fuel core for a nuclear-powered attack submarine cost about $158 million and is designed to power the ship for its entire 33-year expected life, while for a nuclear-powered carrier, the core cost about $300 million in 2004. This cost is higher than conventionally powered ships, but the nuclear-powered ship will incur no fuel-related O&S costs over its lifetime. The nuclear core in 2004 cost $300 million to power a ship for half of its 50-year life. A nuclear-powered submarine or carrier is more expensive to procure but incurs no fuel-related costs over its lifetime, unlike conventionally powered ships. This difference in fuel costs results in a smaller overall cost difference between nuclear-powered and conventionally powered ships. When comparing nuclear-powered and conventionally powered ships, the difference in cost is smaller when considering procurement and life-cycle O&S costs together. This is due to the absence of fuel-related costs for nuclear-powered ships over their lifetime. The cost difference becomes even smaller if the price of oil is high during the conventionally powered ship's life. The cost difference between nuclear-powered and conventionally powered ships is smaller when considering procurement and life-cycle O&S costs together. If the cost of oil is high during the conventionally powered ship's life, the difference in cost becomes even smaller. Higher oil costs in the future could make nuclear power more cost-effective for powering ships. The higher the cost of oil in the future, the more cost-effective nuclear power may be compared to conventional power for powering ships. In theory, if oil costs are high enough, the total ownership cost of a nuclear-powered ship could be less than that of a conventionally powered ship. Nuclear-powered ships have higher end-of-life disposal costs than conventionally powered ships. If the cost of oil is high enough, the total ownership cost of a nuclear-powered ship could be less than that of a conventionally powered ship. Nuclear-powered ships have higher end-of-life disposal costs due to the need to defuel, cut out, and seal up the reactor compartment for transport to a storage area at the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington state. Nuclear-powered ships have higher end-of-life disposal costs compared to conventionally powered ships. The cost for a nuclear-powered submarine is around $30-35 million, while for a carrier it could be as high as $570 million. Lower-cost ship designs are generally less capable, except for the Tango Bravo SSN which may match the Virginia-class design in capability. The reduced-cost Tango Bravo SSN, under the Navy-DARPA program, may have capabilities equal to the Virginia-class design. Ship payload, detectability, survivability, mobility, and numbers are key aspects of naval operations. The Navy-DARPA Tango Bravo program aims to develop a reduced-cost SSN with advanced technologies. Ship payload, detectability, survivability, mobility, and numbers are crucial aspects in naval operations. As a Navy combat ship decreases in size, its total payload tends to decrease, making the smaller ship proportionately less capable than larger ships. As ship size decreases, payload tends to decrease more quickly, making the smaller ship not just less capable than the larger ship, but proportionately less capable. This effect is due to factors like propulsion, where as ship size increases, the amount of horsepower needed decreases, leaving more room for payload. As ship size increases, the amount of horsepower needed for propulsion decreases, allowing for more payload capacity. For example, a 40,000-ton carrier can carry about two dozen aircraft, while a 100,000-ton carrier can carry more. A smaller aircraft carrier has a reduced capacity for aircraft compared to a larger carrier. Transferring the air wing from a medium-sized carrier to a larger one can increase the number of sorties per day due to the larger carrier's capabilities. A smaller aircraft carrier has limited aircraft capacity compared to a larger carrier. Transferring an air wing from a medium-sized carrier to a larger one can increase daily sorties due to the larger carrier's capabilities. Additionally, reducing ship size can impact payload capacity and equipment capabilities. Reducing ship size can impact payload capacity and equipment capabilities. For example, a carrier smaller than a certain size may not be able to operate certain aircraft, while a smaller surface combatant may lack large radars, sonars, missile-launching tubes, or guns. This can result in a decrease in total cost as payload decreases more rapidly than ship size. Reducing ship size can impact payload capacity and equipment capabilities. A smaller carrier may not be able to operate certain aircraft, while a smaller surface combatant may lack large radars, sonars, missile-launching tubes, or guns. This can lead to higher total procurement costs if unit costs are reduced by shifting to smaller ships. The total cost of putting combat-related equipment to sea can increase as ship size decreases. Reducing unit procurement costs by using smaller ships may result in higher total procurement costs if fleet payload is constant. If crew size and fuel consumption do not decrease proportionately with ship size, total fleet operation and support costs could also rise. The OFT report suggests that new technologies could allow for greater payload capacity in smaller surface combatants. The OFT report argues that new technologies could increase payload capacity in smaller surface combatants by using precision-guidance technology to reduce weapon size while maintaining effectiveness. The use of precision-guidance technology allows for smaller weapons to be effective on 1,000- and 100-ton surface combatants, increasing payload capacity without reducing capability. Technology improvements could also lead to a reduction in sensor weight and volume. Supporters of larger ships argue that careful design can make them no more detectable by enemy sensors than smaller ships. They also claim that larger ships built to military standards are better equipped for survivability. Supporters argue that larger ships, designed carefully, can be as undetectable as smaller ships by enemy sensors. Larger ships built to military standards are more survivable and can withstand hits better than smaller ships. They can continue operations after being hit or not sink, unlike smaller ships. Supporters of smaller ships or those built with commercial-like hulls argue that larger ships designed to military survivability standards may be more survivable and able to continue operations after being hit. However, they believe that making larger ships less detectable increases their cost, and a fleet of smaller ships could overwhelm the enemy with numbers. Supporters of smaller ships or ships with commercial-like hulls argue that larger ships designed for military survivability may be more resilient. However, they believe that increasing the stealth of larger ships raises costs, and a fleet of smaller ships could overwhelm the enemy with numbers. Supporters of smaller ships argue that overwhelming the enemy with a large number of targets can disrupt their target-tracking capabilities. They suggest that fleet survivability is more important than individual ship survivability, and a fleet of smaller ships may have superior overall survivability. Additionally, they propose that U.S. leaders may be hesitant to use expensive, highly advanced ships. Supporters of smaller ships argue that fleet survivability is more crucial than individual ship survivability. They suggest that a fleet consisting of smaller ships may have superior overall survivability. Additionally, they propose that U.S. leaders may be reluctant to use expensive, highly capable Navy ships in high-threat situations to avoid risking damage or loss, which would reduce the ships' effectiveness. Some leaders may avoid using expensive Navy ships in high-threat situations to prevent damage or loss, which could reduce their effectiveness. Equipping submarines with nuclear propulsion plants changes their mobility and operational capabilities significantly. Without nuclear power, submarines are considered submersibles for limited use. Equipping a submarine with a nuclear propulsion plant fundamentally changes ship mobility, allowing for extended submerged endurance. Without nuclear power, submarines are considered submersibles for limited use. Adding nuclear power to a submarine creates a true submarine, designed for extended periods below the surface. An Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) system, like a fuel-cell or closed-cycle diesel engine, can increase the stationary or low-speed submerged endurance of a non-nuclear-powered submarine to up to two or three weeks. However, it does not significantly improve the high-speed submerged endurance. An AIP system can extend the submerged endurance of a non-nuclear-powered submarine to up to two or three weeks, but it does not improve high-speed endurance. Non-nuclear-powered submarines have a high-speed endurance of 1 to 3 hours due to battery limitations. A non-nuclear-powered submarine has a high-speed submerged endurance of 1 to 3 hours, limited by battery capacity. In contrast, a nuclear-powered submarine can stay submerged for weeks or months, operating at high speeds as needed. A nuclear-powered submarine can remain submerged for weeks or months, operating at high speeds whenever needed, while a non-nuclear-powered submarine has a high-speed submerged endurance of 1 to 3 hours, limited by battery capacity. Non-nuclear submarines are not well suited for missions requiring long, completely stealthy transits or extended submerged periods in the theater of operation. The text discusses the limitations of non-nuclear-powered submarines, particularly in terms of their submerged endurance for long, stealthy missions. The report suggests transporting these submarines to overseas theaters of operation aboard a transport ship to address these limitations. The OFT report proposes transporting AIP submarines into overseas theaters of operations aboard a transport ship. This allows for the submarines to be deployed without alerting others to their presence, unlike SSNs in carrier strike groups. The OFT report suggests deploying AIP submarines in overseas theaters of operations aboard a transport ship to maintain secrecy. This strategy allows the submarines to operate without alerting opposing forces, unlike SSNs in carrier strike groups. SSNs can be detached from the strike group and redirected to another theater for a different mission, enabling them to achieve military effects in multiple theaters simultaneously. The effectiveness of an AIP submarine in a carrier strike group's theater of operations depends on the submarine's daily operations and potential conflict scenarios. Adding nuclear power to aircraft carriers has less impact compared to the strategic advantages of deploying AIP submarines secretly on transport ships in overseas theaters. This allows submarines to operate without alerting opposing forces and achieve military effects in multiple theaters simultaneously. The effectiveness of an AIP submarine in a carrier strike group's theater of operations depends on its daily operations and potential conflict scenarios. Nuclear-powered carriers can respond to urgent crises with high-speed transits over long distances without the need for refueling, allowing them to commence combat operations immediately upon arrival. The effects of adding nuclear power to carriers are significant, allowing for high-speed transits over long distances without the need for refueling. This enables immediate commencement of combat operations upon arrival and more internal volume for aircraft fuel and ammunition storage, prolonging combat sustainability. Adding nuclear power to carriers allows for high-speed transits without refueling, enabling immediate combat operations and increased storage for fuel and ammunition. Higher-speed ships like the LCS or recommended carriers and combatants can shift locations rapidly, making them harder to track and target. Advocates of higher-speed ships argue that their increased capability to shift locations rapidly makes them harder to track and target, while skeptics question the benefits of speeds exceeding 30 knots. Additionally, proponents of a larger fleet advocate for lower-cost ship designs to increase the number of ships available for deployment. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that having more ships would allow for better global presence and simultaneous crisis response. They suggest that a fleet with a greater number of less-capable ships could offer more flexibility in various situations. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that a fleet with more ships would enhance global presence and crisis response capabilities. They suggest that a fleet with a greater number of less-capable ships could provide more flexibility in various situations, avoiding unnecessary high daily operational costs. Additionally, they argue that the force's capability increases with the number of nodes in network-centric warfare theory. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that having more ships would offer flexibility in responding to situations with the right amount of naval capability, avoiding high operational costs. They believe that increasing the number of ship nodes in network-centric warfare theory would enhance the total capability of the force. Increasing the number of ship nodes in a network enhances the total capability of the force. Some argue for a shift to more distributed force designs using advanced technologies, while others defend a smaller fleet of more expensive, capable ships for global deployment. U.S. military forces should shift to more distributed force designs rather than a fleet of fewer, more expensive ships for global deployment. The Navy has increased the fraction of the fleet deployed at any given time to mitigate the effects of having a limited number of ships. The Navy argues that current ship designs provide adequate flexibility for creating naval formations with appropriate capability for various situations, even with a smaller number of more expensive ships when considering aircraft, unmanned vehicles, and distributed sensors. The Navy argues that current ship designs offer flexibility for naval formations and capability for various situations. A fleet with fewer, more expensive ships could still engage in network-centric warfare effectively. Lower-cost options, such as AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines, may pose technical risks for the Navy. The Navy's current ship designs provide flexibility for naval formations and capability for various situations. Lower-cost options like AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines, Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarines, high-speed carriers, and smaller surface combatants may pose technical risks due to new technologies and design challenges. Smaller ships could offer a wider range of homeporting options. The Navy's current ship designs offer flexibility for naval formations. Smaller ships like the Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarine, high-speed carrier, and surface combatants may face technical risks due to new technologies. Homeporting smaller ships can provide more options due to limitations in berthing spaces and water depth. Homeporting nuclear-powered ships can be more complex than conventionally powered ships due to unique requirements. Forward-homeporting a Navy ship in a foreign country can be politically challenging, especially if the ship is nuclear-powered and there are anti-nuclear sentiments. Lower-cost ship designs could impact naval formations. Lower-cost ship designs could impact the shipbuilding industrial base by changing the total volume of Navy shipbuilding work or the distribution of that work among various shipyards. Lower-cost ship designs could affect the shipbuilding industrial base by changing the total volume of Navy shipbuilding work or the distribution of that work among various shipyards, depending on the total funding available for Navy ship procurement. The impact of shifting to lower-cost ship designs on the total volume of Navy shipbuilding work depends on the funding available for Navy ship procurement. Three scenarios are possible: no change in funding leads to no substantial change in shipbuilding work volume, using lower-cost designs to build the same number of ships reduces the total volume of work, and a decrease in funding results in reduced shipbuilding work volume. The shift to lower-cost ship designs may affect the total volume of Navy shipbuilding work based on funding availability. Three scenarios are possible: no change in funding leads to no substantial change in work volume, using lower-cost designs to build the same number of ships reduces the total volume of work, and increased funding enables an increase in work volume. The shift to lower-cost ship designs could impact Navy shipbuilding work volume based on funding availability. Lower-cost designs may make Navy ships more cost-effective, potentially increasing funding for ship procurement and boosting the total volume of work. This could affect the distribution of shipbuilding work among different shipyards, including the construction of a Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarine by General Dynamics' Electric Boat or other shipyards. The lower-cost ship designs in this report could impact the distribution of shipbuilding work among various shipyards, including General Dynamics' Electric Boat and Northrop Grumman Newport News. The division of work for building submarines may change if both shipyards are involved in the program. Electric Boat (GD/EB) and Northrop Grumman Newport News (NGNN) may have a different division of work for building AIP-equipped non-nuclear submarines. Ingalls shipyard at Pascagoula, MS, part of Northrop Grumman Ship Systems (NGSS), could also be involved in building these submarines for export. An AIP-equipped non-nuclear submarine could be designed and built by GD/EB or NGNN, or by non-nuclear shipyards like Ingalls at Pascagoula, MS. This could impact U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers who rely on work from nuclear submarine and aircraft carrier programs. NGNN is the only U.S. yard capable of building large nuclear-powered carriers. If AIP submarines were procured instead of nuclear-powered submarines, it could reduce work for U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers who rely on Navy's nuclear submarine and aircraft carrier programs. NGNN is the only U.S. yard capable of building large nuclear-powered carriers. Medium-sized conventionally powered carriers could be built by NGNN or other yards like Ingalls. NGNN is the only U.S. yard capable of building large nuclear-powered carriers. Medium-sized conventionally powered carriers could be built by NGNN, Ingalls, or other shipyards with experience in building merchant-like hulls. Small, high-speed carriers using an SES/catamaran hull design might also be constructed. A merchant-like hull could be built by NGNN, Ingalls, or other shipyards with experience in building such hulls. Avondale shipyard near New Orleans and GD/NASSCO in San Diego could also be potential builders. Building conventionally powered carriers instead of nuclear-powered ones may reduce work for U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. An SES/catamaran hull design could be built at various shipyards with experience in such hulls. Procuring conventionally powered carriers instead of nuclear-powered ones may decrease work for U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. A carrier nuclear propulsion plant is equivalent to five submarine nuclear propulsion plants in terms of work provided. DDG-1000 destroyers are to be built at NGSS (particularly Ingalls) and General Dynamics' Bath. The Navy's nuclear submarine and aircraft carrier programs provide significant work to manufacturers. A carrier nuclear propulsion plant equals five submarine nuclear propulsion plants in terms of work. DDG-1000 destroyers are to be built at NGSS and General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works. Other ships like SCD, FFG(X), or gunfire support ships could also be built at these yards or others like Avondale or NGNN. The Navy's nuclear submarine and aircraft carrier programs provide significant work to manufacturers. DDG-1000 destroyers are to be built at NGSS and General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works. Smaller surface combatants like LCS and 1,000- or 100-ton surface combatants could be built at various yards including Marinette Marine, Bollinger Shipyards, Austal USA, and others. The LCS program involves building two versions of the ship at different shipyards, including Marinette Marine, Bollinger Shipyards, and Austal USA. Sections 122, 123, and 124 of H.R. 5122 would limit procurement costs for aircraft carriers, LHA(R) class ships, and LPD-17 class ships. The House Armed Services Committee aims to control rising costs and production delays in defense acquisition programs by limiting procurement costs for specific ship classes in H.R. 5122. This includes establishing a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program.

The House Armed Services Committee aims to control rising costs and production delays in defense acquisition programs by limiting procurement costs for specific ship classes in H.R. 5122. There is internal DOD pressure to develop follow-on weapons systems that may lead to an over-reliance on expensive ''mega'' systems, resulting in fewer platforms being purchased and higher operational tempos. The House Armed Services Committee aims to control rising costs and production delays in defense acquisition programs by limiting procurement costs for specific ship classes in H.R. 5122. This could result in fewer platforms being purchased, leading to a ''high demand, low density'' situation with higher operational tempos and increased stress on military personnel. The Navy's shipbuilding plan is commended for addressing future force structure needs. The House Armed Services Committee aims to control rising costs and production delays in defense acquisition programs by limiting procurement costs for specific ship classes in H.R. 5122. The committee applauds the Chief of Naval Operations for developing the Navy's future force structure and long-term shipbuilding plan, but expresses concerns about the affordability and feasibility of the plan. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the affordability and feasibility of the Navy's long-term shipbuilding plan, which requires a significant increase in funds and assumes cost growth can be avoided in ship acquisition programs. The Navy's long-term shipbuilding plan requires a substantial increase in funds, which may be challenging to obtain during anticipated federal spending reductions. The plan also relies on ship acquisition programs avoiding cost growth, raising concerns about its affordability and feasibility. The committee is concerned about the affordability of the Navy's long-term shipbuilding plan and the excess capacity in the U.S. shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base. They direct the Secretary of the Navy to report on managing capacity. The committee is concerned about the excess capacity in the U.S. shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base and directs the Secretary of the Navy to report on managing capacity to make Navy shipbuilding more affordable.

The report highlighted the Navy's ship cost estimates as inaccurate and unrealistic for numerous ship classes nearing completion of construction. The committee is deeply concerned about the Navy's ship cost estimates, noting that they have been inaccurate and unrealistic for numerous ship classes nearing completion of construction. Ship cost estimates delivered to the committee in prior years were found to exclude certain known shipbuilding costs, making them inaccurate from the start. The committee recommends improving the process for establishing ship cost estimates. The committee recommends revising the process for deriving ship cost estimates to ensure all major known elements are included. Sections 122, 123, and 124 of the bill would impose cost limitations on three current ship classes based on the Navy's latest cost estimates. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to revalidate cost estimates for CVN-21, ships in the LHA Replacement program, and eight other ship classes to ensure accuracy and confidence in the cost estimates.

(Page 71) The report also addresses the DDG-1000 program. The Secretary of the Navy must submit revalidated cost estimates for the LHA Replacement program and San Antonio class amphibious ships by July 1, 2006. The report should include all known and anticipated major cost elements. The committee does not believe the DD(X) program is affordable and the Navy had to reduce the number of next-generation destroyers from 32 to 7 to make the program affordable. The committee does not believe the DD(X) program is affordable as the Navy had to reduce the number of next-generation destroyers from 32 to 7 to make it feasible. Reducing the requirements for the DD(X) could allow for a smaller, less expensive destroyer to be procured in greater numbers. The committee does not believe the DD(X) program is affordable due to the reduced number of next-generation destroyers. They support the construction of up to two DD(X)s to demonstrate technologies for future, more affordable combatants. The committee does not believe DD(X) will be procured in sufficient numbers to meet operational needs. They support building up to two DD(X)s to showcase technologies for future, more affordable combatants. The budget request did not include funds for the maritime technology program aimed at reducing naval ship construction costs. The committee supports building up to two DD(X)s to showcase technologies for future combatants. The budget request contained no funds for the maritime technology program, aimed at reducing naval ship construction costs by enhancing efficiency and competitiveness. Since the late 1970s, the Navy has considered capital for facility investments as an allowable cost on contracts. In the past three years, the Navy and industry have agreed to specific recapitalization contracts. The committee supports showcasing technologies for future combatants by building up to two DD(X)s. The Navy has considered capital for facility investments as an allowable cost on contracts since the late 1970s.

Section 121 of S. 2766 authorizes funding for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers and Section 123 increases the cost limit on CVN-77 to $6,057 million. Section 121 of S. 2766 authorizes incremental funding and EOQ purchases for long-lead components of CVN-21 class aircraft carriers. The Senate Armed Services Committee noted that low shipbuilding rates were driving up costs, leading to a downward spiral in shipbuilding rates. The Services Committee, in its report on S. 2766, highlighted concerns about the low shipbuilding rates driving up costs and creating a downward spiral. Stable ship requirements, increased funding in the shipbuilding budget, and flexibility for funding large capital ships are seen as crucial to reversing this trend. The committee also expressed worries about cost growth on the CVN-77 program and urged the Navy and shipbuilder to find ways to improve. The committee emphasizes the importance of stable ship requirements, increased funding in the shipbuilding budget, and flexibility for funding large capital ships to reverse the trend of low shipbuilding rates driving up costs. Concerns were raised about cost growth on the CVN-77 program, with procurement delays, excess inflation, and material escalation identified as significant contributors. The shipbuilder aims to achieve savings in the CVN-21 class program through a stable procurement plan and economic order quantity procurement. The shipbuilder aims to improve affordability of future aircraft carriers by addressing procurement delays, excess inflation, and material escalation. They propose savings through a stable procurement plan and economic order quantity material procurement for CVN-79 and CVN-80.

New procurement cost caps can be adjusted for inflation and other factors. The amendment in Section 122 does not allow the Secretary to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions impacting the shipbuilding program of record. The report states that the amendment in Section 122 does not give the Secretary authority to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions impacting the shipbuilding program of record. However, the Secretary is directed to include an assessment of any negative impact of congressional action on program costs in the annual written notice to the congressional defense committees regarding changes to cost limitations. The conferees direct the Secretary to include an assessment of any negative impact of congressional action on program costs in the annual written notice to the congressional defense committees regarding changes to cost limitations for the CVN-21 class budget. Many uncertainties remain with regard to completion of CVN-21 design and construction, which will impact cost during the next 15 years of performance on the program. The Navy's risk-balanced assessment of the cost for completing design and construction of the future class of nuclear powered aircraft carriers includes uncertainties that will impact costs over the next 15 years. An amendment allows adjustment to the cost limitation for non-recurring design and engineering to reduce risk in the design effort. The Navy is expected to manage program execution within the budget estimate. The amendment allows adjustment to the cost limitation for non-recurring design and engineering to reduce risk in the Navy's execution of the program. Compliance with this provision may require procurement cost trade-offs that could impact system performance, safety, crew quality of life, and other important factors in the design and construction of the CVN-21 class. The conferees understand that compliance with the provision may require procurement cost trade-offs that could impact system performance, safety, crew quality of life, and other important factors in the design and construction of the CVN-21 class. The Secretary must notify the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives before implementing any cost-driven reduction that would negatively affect safety or crew quality of life. The Secretary must notify Congress before making any cost-driven reductions that could impact safety, crew quality of life, or the program's ability to meet requirements. The report clarifies that the amendment does not grant the Secretary authority to adjust limitation amounts. The Secretary must notify Congress before making any cost-driven reductions that could impact safety, crew quality of life, or the program's ability to meet requirements. The amendment does not grant the Secretary authority to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases attributable to congressional actions. The conferees direct the Secretary to include an assessment of any negative impact of congressional action on program costs in the annual notice to Congress regarding changes to cost limitations for the shipbuilding program. The LHA-6 budget represents the Navy's risk-balanced assessment for completing the future LHA Replacement ship.

The House Appropriations Committee emphasized the importance of controlling costs in ship design for the Navy's long-range shipbuilding plan. The House Appropriations Committee emphasized the importance of cost control in ship design for the Navy's long-range shipbuilding plan, highlighting concerns about the Navy's lack of a plan or initiatives to meet cost targets. The House Appropriations Committee emphasized the importance of cost control in ship design for the Navy's long-range shipbuilding plan. Navy leadership agrees on the necessity of cost control but has not provided a plan or initiatives to meet cost targets. The Committee encourages the Navy to set firm cost targets, develop specific initiatives for cost control, and sign contracts to reduce cost growth. The report recommended reducing the Navy's FY2007 procurement funding by $141.4 million to cover cost growth on prior ship procurements. The Committee remains concerned about the lack of cost control in Navy shipbuilding programs and recommends reducing the Navy's FY2007 procurement funding by $141.4 million to cover cost growth on prior ship procurements. The Committee remains concerned about the lack of cost control in Navy shipbuilding programs and recommends reducing the Navy's FY2007 procurement funding by $141.4 million to cover cost growth on ships procured in prior years. The report highlighted the gap between the Navy's public statements on cost controls and the actual programmatic and contractual actions needed to achieve that objective. The Committee expressed concerns about the Navy's lack of cost control in shipbuilding programs, citing a $867.9 million overrun in the CVN-77 production effort over the next 3 years. Congressional legislation is needed to raise the current cost cap on the program. The Navy is facing cost overruns in shipbuilding programs, including the CVN-77 aircraft carrier and Virginia class submarines. Congressional legislation is required to raise the cost cap on the CVN-77 program. The fiscal year 2007 budget includes funds for cost growth in the U.S.S. Texas and the U.S.S. North Carolina is performing below Navy expectations. The current cost performance on the Virginia class submarines is jeopardizing the Navy's capabilities. The current cost cap on the Virginia class submarines is jeopardizing the Navy's ability to meet performance goals and increase production rates. The Committee is unwilling to provide additional funding for cost overruns without a detailed plan for cost control. The Committee is hesitant to allocate more funds for cost overruns in shipbuilding programs without a clear plan for cost control. They recommend a reduction in funding for various programs to address the issue. The Committee recommends reducing funding for Completion of Prior Year Shipbuilding Programs by $141,400,000 to address cost overruns. This reduction should be allocated to specific programs, including CVN-77, SSN-777, SSN-776, SSN-775, and the LPD-17 class. One option to control rising Navy ship procurement costs is to increase annual ship-procurement funding. The Navy's proposed FY2007 budget suggests increasing annual ship construction funding to around $14.4 billion per year in constant FY2007 dollars to address rising ship procurement costs. However, increasing funding significantly may be challenging due to finite defense funding, potentially requiring cuts to other Navy or DOD priorities. The Navy aims to increase annual ship construction funding to $14.4 billion per year in constant FY2007 dollars. However, raising funding levels may be difficult due to limited defense funding, potentially necessitating cuts to other Navy or DOD priorities. Efforts to operate more efficiently have not fully offset rising costs in other areas, such as personnel-related expenses. Alternative funding approaches for new Navy ships may need to be considered. The Navy has been working to operate more efficiently to save money for procurement programs, but rising costs in other areas like personnel expenses have offset these savings. One option to increase ship procurement is to modify how new ships are funded in the budget, potentially using incremental funding or advance appropriations. This could marginally increase the number of ships procured for a set amount of money. Possible changes to fund new Navy ships in the budget include incremental funding, advance appropriations, and multiyear procurement (MYP). These options could increase the number of ships procured but may raise concerns about Congress's oversight and funding responsibilities. The report suggests using multiyear procurement (MYP) in Navy ship-procurement programs to potentially increase the number of ships procured. However, this option may limit DOD's and Congress's flexibility in adjusting ship-procurement plans in response to changing strategic and budgetary needs. The report suggests using multiyear procurement (MYP) in Navy ship-procurement programs to potentially increase the number of ships procured. However, not all Navy ship-procurement programs may meet the legal requirements for MYP, and greater use of MYP could limit flexibility in adjusting ship-procurement plans in response to changing circumstances. Another option is to change the acquisition strategy for building certain Navy ships, such as consolidating the construction of DDG-1000 destroyers at a single yard to reduce costs. Changing the acquisition strategy for building Navy ships, such as consolidating construction of DDG-1000 destroyers at a single yard, could save $3 billion for building 10 ships, but may lead to the second yard exiting the business. This would leave the Navy with a single source for building that type of ship, limiting future flexibility. Shifting to a single-yard acquisition strategy for building Navy ships could save $3 billion for 10 DDG-1000s, but may result in the second yard exiting the business. This would leave the Navy with a single source for building that type of ship, limiting future flexibility in competition and design innovation. Making greater use of competition in Navy ship acquisition could prevent the Navy from using competition or benchmarking to spur design innovation, constrain costs, maintain production quality, and ensure adherence to scheduled delivery dates. This change in acquisition strategy would involve using competition between shipyards in awarding contracts for building follow-on ships in each class, representing a return to Navy practices in the 1980s. Employing competition in Navy ship acquisition involves using competition between shipyards to award contracts for building follow-on ships in each class, resembling Navy practices from the 1980s. This approach requires a high annual procurement rate for the ship class to ensure financial stability for the yards involved. Employing competition in Navy ship acquisition involves awarding contracts for building follow-on ships, similar to Navy practices in the 1980s. This approach requires a high annual procurement rate for the ship class to ensure financial stability for the yards involved. The government must be willing to have contract awards potentially lead to a yard permanently withdrawing from building that type of ship, leaving the Navy with a single source for future ships. The government can reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs by eliminating excess capacity among yards building Navy ships or increasing other types of work done by those yards. This would prevent contract awards from leading to a yard permanently withdrawing from building that type of ship, potentially leaving the Navy with a single source for future ships. One option to reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs is to eliminate excess capacity among yards building Navy ships or increase other types of work done by those yards. This could include construction of ships for other U.S. government agencies or commercial ships, and overhaul and repair of Navy or other U.S. vessels. One option to reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs is to increase other types of work done by those yards, such as construction of ships for other U.S. government agencies or commercial ships, and overhaul and repair of Navy or other U.S. vessels. Another option is to improve operating efficiency by incorporating more advanced design and production processes and equipment. The National Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP) Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) aims to improve the operating efficiency of yards building Navy ships by incorporating advanced design and production processes. A DOD report from May 2005 compares the efficiency of U.S. shipyards to foreign ones and makes recommendations for improvement. Another option is to build Navy ships without certain features. The Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) aims to improve operating efficiency of yards building Navy ships. A DOD report compares efficiency of U.S. shipyards to foreign ones and makes recommendations for improvement. One option is to build Navy ships without some planned equipment, which may reduce capabilities but can be added later. Building Navy ships without planned equipment may reduce capabilities but can be added later, potentially deferring costs into the future. Adding equipment to an in-service ship may be more expensive than building it during the original construction process. The ship's lost capability could be restored by adding equipment, but this may increase the procurement total cost in the long run. Another option is to build Navy ships in foreign shipyards to reduce construction costs. The strategy of adding equipment to restore lost capability on Navy ships during construction could increase procurement costs in the long run. Building ships in foreign shipyards to reduce costs is an alternative option, but there are restrictions on constructing vessels or major components in foreign shipyards according to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7309. The provision of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7309 prohibits the construction of vessels or major components in foreign shipyards for the armed forces, with exceptions allowed for national security interests. The President can authorize these exceptions, but Congress must be notified, and a 30-day waiting period is required before any contracts can be made. Inflatable boats and rigid inflatable boats are exempt from this provision. The President can authorize exceptions to the prohibition on construction of vessels in foreign shipyards for national security interests. Congress must be notified, and a 30-day waiting period is required before contracts can be made. Inflatable boats and rigid inflatable boats are exempt from this provision. The annual DOD appropriations act includes a provision for Navy shipbuilding, stating that funds are available for construction in U.S. shipyards only. The RAND Corporation report provides further discussion on this topic. The RAND Corporation report discusses the increased cost of Navy ships today compared to the past and suggests ways to reduce these costs."
