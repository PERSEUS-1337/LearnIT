The Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to allow the Corporation to insure agricultural producers in the US against unavoidable causes of loss for their crops. The Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to allow the Corporation to insure agricultural producers in the US against unavoidable causes of loss for their crops, including drought, flood, hail, wind, frost, winterkill, lightning, fire, excessive rain, snow, wildlife, hurricane, tornado, insect infestation, and plant disease as determined by the Board. The Federal Crop Insurance Act allows the Corporation to insure agricultural producers against various unavoidable causes of loss for their crops, including excessive rain, snow, wildlife, hurricane, tornado, insect infestation, and plant disease. Insurance coverage does not extend beyond the period the insured commodity is in the field, with the definition of \"field\" including the environment in which aquacultural species are produced. The insurance coverage for agricultural producers protects against loss in yield, covering 75 percent of the average yield of the commodity on the insured farm. The term \"field\" includes the environment for aquacultural species production. Insurance offered to agricultural producers provides protection against yield loss, covering 75 percent of the average yield on the insured farm. Average yields may be adjusted by the Board to ensure fairness among farms in the same area and under similar conditions. The Corporation offers lesser levels of yield coverage, including 50 percent coverage, with adjusted average yields for fairness among farms in the same area. The Corporation provides lesser levels of yield coverage, including coverage at 50 percent of the recorded or appraised average yield, with adjusted yields for fairness among farms in the same area. The Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service may provide insurance coverage based on adjusted yields for commodities, rather than recorded or appraised yields by the Corporation, to cover against loss in yield. Insurance coverage may be provided by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service for commodities based on adjusted yields, rather than recorded or appraised yields by the Corporation. Additional premiums for this insurance will be set by the Board to accurately reflect the increased risk involved. Additional insurance under this subsection requires an extra premium set by the Board to accurately reflect increased risk and cover potential losses. The premium cannot be subsidized and must establish a reserve for unforeseen losses. Coverage levels exceeding 75 percent are also available. The Corporation may offer coverage exceeding 75 percent of the average yield in a growing area, if variations in yield are deemed normal. The premium for additional insurance must accurately reflect increased risk and establish a reserve for unforeseen losses. The Corporation may provide coverage above 75 percent of the average yield in a growing area if normal yield variations have not led to loss claims. The maximum coverage level available to producers is generally limited to 75 percent of the recorded or appraised average yield. The Corporation limits coverage to 75 percent of the average yield, with exceptions for normal yield variations. The projected market price option must be at least 90 percent of the commodity's market price. Insurance is provided for uninsured losses. Insurance provided under this subsection shall not cover losses due to neglect, malfeasance, failure to reseed, or failure to follow guidelines. The subsection excludes losses caused by neglect, malfeasance, failure to reseed, or failure to follow good farming practices. The Board has the authority to limit or deny insurance based on the risk involved. Agricultural income in certain counties may not be covered by insurance. The Board may limit or refuse insurance based on risk. Insurance may not be provided for agricultural commodities in counties where income from the commodity is insignificant, except for farms in specific producing areas. The Board may limit or refuse insurance based on risk for agricultural commodities in counties where income from the commodity is insignificant, except for farms in specific producing areas. The Corporation shall report annually to Congress the results of its operations for each insured commodity and establish a price level for each commodity offered insurance starting from the 1992 crop year. Annual reports are required by the Corporation to be submitted to Congress on the operations for each insured commodity. Starting from the 1992 crop year, a price level for each commodity on which insurance is offered must be established by the Corporation, not less than the projected market price determined by the Board. Insurance coverage can be obtained by producers based on a price election equal to or less than the level set by the Board. Insurance coverage for each commodity is offered at a price not less than the projected market price determined by the Board. Producers can obtain coverage based on a price election equal to or less than the Board's established level, quoted in dollars per acre. SEC. 3. LATE PLANTING COVERAGE. Late planting coverage under Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act allows producers to plant after the final planting date for a commodity by up to 25 days, with a reduction in yield guarantee for each day planted late. Late planting coverage under Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act allows producers to plant a commodity up to 25 days after the final planting date, with a reduction in yield guarantee for each day planted late. Late planting coverage under Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act allows producers to plant a commodity up to 25 days after the final planting date, with a reduction in yield guarantee for each day planted late. Producers are presumed to have this coverage unless they opt out by notifying the Corporation. Additional amounts may be provided to offset the insurer's increased risk for offering this coverage. Late planting coverage is automatically included in a basic insurance policy for producers on a farm unless they choose to waive it. If offering late planting coverage would significantly increase premiums and deter participation, it will be offered as a separate endorsement. SEC. 4. PREVENTED PLANTING COVERAGE. Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include prevented planting coverage for producers on a farm. This coverage applies if producers are unable to plant a crop due to excess moisture, drought, or other natural disasters, providing them with 50 percent coverage. The Federal Crop Insurance Act now includes prevented planting coverage for producers on a farm, offering 50 percent coverage if they are unable to plant a crop due to excess moisture, drought, or other natural disasters. Producers have the option to plant a substitute crop instead of an insured crop, with the value of the substitute crop offsetting the remaining coverage. The Federal Crop Insurance Act offers prevented planting coverage for producers on a farm, allowing them to plant a substitute crop instead of an insured crop to offset the guaranteed level of coverage. Producers have the option to waive prevented planting coverage if they choose. The Federal Crop Insurance Act provides prevented planting coverage for producers on a farm, allowing them to plant a substitute crop to offset the guaranteed level of coverage. Producers are presumed to have this coverage unless they choose to waive it. If offering prevented planting coverage separately would discourage participation, it can be offered as a separate endorsement. SEC. 5. ELIMINATION OF PENALTY FOR DE MINIMIS YIELDS. The Corporation will establish a procedure where producers with disaster losses won't have deductions from indemnity payments if the market value of production is less than harvesting costs. SEC. 6. YIELD AVERAGES. Section 508A(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include yield coverage based on a producer's actual proven crop yields over 4 to 10 crop years. The Corporation will establish a minimum level of insurance protection for those covered. The Corporation will establish a minimum level of insurance protection for covered producers based on actual proven crop yields over 4 to 10 crop years. Transitional yield data may only be used to establish a yield for producers on a farm to the extent necessary. The Corporation will establish a minimum level of insurance protection for covered producers based on actual proven crop yields over 4 to 10 crop years. Transitional yield data may only be used to establish a yield for producers on a farm to the extent necessary, especially for those with reduced yields due to natural disasters. Producers must establish actual production history for the first 4 crop years on the farm to determine yield coverage under this section. If producers operate a new parcel of land, they may elect to use yields from previous crop years for crop insurance purposes. For crop insurance purposes, producers on a farm can use previous yield history or transitional yield data for new parcels of land, based on actual production history. Producers can choose to use previous yield history or transitional yield data for new parcels of land for crop insurance purposes. The Corporation will adjust Nonstandard Classification procedures to accommodate producers. The Corporation will adjust Nonstandard Classification procedures to account for producer yield declines due to recurrent natural disasters, defining transitional yield as the countywide average used to establish a yield for producers on new parcels of land. The Corporation will adjust Nonstandard Classification procedures to account for producer yield declines due to recurrent natural disasters, defining transitional yield as the countywide average used to establish a yield for producers on new parcels of land."
