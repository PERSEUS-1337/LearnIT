Additionally, they will identify topics for meetings and conferences, make recommendations for data collection, and enhance research and management protocols for the Great Lakes ecosystem. The Great Lakes Research Council will participate in meetings, workshops, and conferences on research issues, recommend data collection methods, establish a comprehensive data base, and ensure timely dissemination of research findings. The Great Lakes Research Council aims to advise on data collection methods, establish a comprehensive data base, and ensure timely dissemination of research findings. The Council is comprised of a research manager with extensive knowledge and scientific expertise. The Great Lakes Research Council, comprised of research managers from various agencies, aims to advise on data collection methods and ensure timely dissemination of research findings. The Council utilizes existing mechanisms like the Great Lakes Research Inventory for information sharing. The Great Lakes Research Council includes agencies like the EPA, NOAA, USCG, USFWS, and other relevant federal departments. Non-Federal employees can also serve as ex officio members.
