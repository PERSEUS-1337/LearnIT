    "content": "The U.S. teen birth rate has been declining since the 1950s, reaching a record low in 2018. Factors contributing to this decrease include reduced teen sexual activity and increased use of contraceptives among sexually active teens. The influence of any single factor is not fully known. Despite the decline in the teen birth rate, Congress remains interested in the issue due to its high social and economic costs. Disparities in teen birth rates persist among different racial and ethnic groups and across states. Despite the decline in the teen birth rate, Congress continues to be concerned about the issue due to its social and economic costs. Disparities in teen birth rates persist among different racial and ethnic groups and across states. The report discusses Congress's support for programs aimed at preventing teen pregnancy. Data on teen births are different from data on pregnancies, with the teen birth rate referring to the number of live births per 1,000 teen girls aged 15 through 19. This report discusses Congress's support for programs aimed at preventing teen pregnancy. The teen birth rate refers to live births per 1,000 teen girls aged 15-19, while the teen pregnancy rate includes pregnancies per 1,000 teen girls aged 15-19, including live births, abortions, and fetal losses. Birth data cover nearly every birth in the US, while pregnancy data are estimates based on various reporting systems. The teen pregnancy rate includes pregnancies per 1,000 teen girls aged 15-19, encompassing live births, abortions, and fetal losses. Birth data cover nearly every birth in the US, while pregnancy data are estimates based on various reporting systems and surveys. The CDC and the Guttmacher Institute publish teen pregnancy rates a year or two after birth data is reported. In 2018, there were approximately 3.8 million births in the United States, with about 180,000 (4.7%) to teenagers aged 15 to 19. The CDC tracks birth rates by age and other characteristics of birth mothers. The CDC tracks birth rates by age and other characteristics of birth mothers. In 2018, there were approximately 3.8 million births in the United States, with about 180,000 (4.7%) to teenagers aged 15 to 19. The U.S. teen birth rate peaked in 1957 at 96.3 and then decreased in most years from the 1960s through the 1980s. From 1991 onward, the teen birth rate declined except in two years, 2006 and 2007, dropping by 72% from 1991 (61.8) to 2018 (17.4). The U.S. teen birth rate declined significantly from 1991 to 2018, dropping by 72% to a historical low of 17.4 births per 1000 teens aged 15 to 19. The rate saw a 58% decline from 2007 to 2018, with less than 2% of teens giving birth in 2018. The teen birth rate in the U.S. dropped significantly from 1991 to 2018, reaching a historic low of 17.4 births per 1000 teens aged 15 to 19. The rate declined by 58% from 2007 to 2018, with less than 2% of teens giving birth in 2018. The CDC began tracking subgroup data for teens in the 1960s, showing higher birth rates for older teens compared to younger teens. In 2018, birth rates for 15- to 17-year-olds and 18- to 19-year-olds were the lowest on record. Repeat teen births have also declined significantly, with a nearly 54% decrease from 2004 to 2015. In 2018, birth rates for 15- to 17-year-olds and 18- to 19-year-olds were the lowest on record. Repeat teen births declined by nearly 54% from 2004 to 2015, with the highest prevalence among Hispanic youth. Teen mothers have been less likely to be married in recent years. The rate of repeat teen births was highest among Hispanic, followed by non-Hispanic black and white youth. Declines in repeat births were largest among black teens, followed by Hispanic and white teens. Unmarried teen birth rate decreased from 31.0 per 1,000 in 2010 to 16.0 per 1,000 in 2018. Despite overall decline, certain racial and ethnic groups still have high teen birth rates. In 2018, the unmarried teen birth rate decreased to 16.0 per 1,000 from 31.0 per 1,000 in 2010. Certain racial and ethnic groups still have high teen birth rates, with Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens having more than double the rate of non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander teens. In 2018, the teen birth rate decreased for all racial and ethnic groups, with Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens having more than double the rate of non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander teens. The rates declined more for certain groups compared to others over the years. From 2007 to 2018, the teen birth rates declined significantly for all racial and ethnic groups. The rates fell by 55% for non-Hispanic white teens, 40% for non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens, 58% for non-Hispanic black teens, 73% for non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander teens, and 65% for Hispanic teens. In 2018, teen birth rates varied considerably by state and territory, with Massachusetts having the lowest rate at 7.2 and Arkansas the highest at 30.4. Non-Hispanic black and Hispanic teens had higher birth rates despite experiencing greater declines compared to non-Hispanic white teens from 2007 to 2018. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by state and territory. Massachusetts had the lowest rate at 7.2, while Arkansas had the highest at 30.4. Eighteen states had rates below 15 per 1,000 teens aged 15 to 19. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by state and territory. Eighteen states had rates below 15 per 1,000 teens aged 15 to 19, with California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin among them. Ten states had the highest rates, including Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia. The territories' rates ranged from 19.3 in Puerto Rico to 34.4 in Guam. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by state and territory. The rates ranged from 19.3 in Puerto Rico to 34.4 in Guam. From 2007 to 2018, the teen birth rate decreased in each state or territory by 19% to 67%. Teen birth rates have declined in rural areas but remain higher than urban areas. The U.S. teen birth rate, although decreasing, is still higher than that of most other industrialized countries. In 2018, teen birth rates decreased in each state or territory by 19% to 67%. Rates in rural areas, although declining, remain higher than in urban areas. The U.S. teen birth rate is still higher than most other industrialized countries, with economic conditions and income inequality potentially playing a role. The U.S. teen birth rate of 18.8 in 2017 was 50% higher than the United Kingdom's rate of 12.6. Reasons for the high U.S. teen birth rate compared to other industrial countries are not fully understood, but economic conditions and income inequality may be factors. Research suggests that contraceptive use among teens is higher in other developed countries. Multiple trends have contributed to declines in U.S. teen pregnancy and birth rates. Research suggests that contraceptive use among teens is higher in other developed countries compared to the United States. Over the period from the 1990s through 2007, the risk of teen pregnancy decreased primarily due to improved contraceptive use, including an increase in the use of certain contraception methods, an increase in the use of multiple methods of contraception, and substantial declines in foregoing contraception. Research indicates that the risk of teen pregnancy decreased from the 1990s through 2007 due to improved contraceptive use, including an increase in the use of certain methods like condoms, multiple methods of contraception, and a decrease in foregoing contraception. The risk also decreased among younger teens aged 15 to 17 due to decreased sexual activity. More recent declines in teen pregnancy risk have been attributed to increasing contraceptive use among sexually active teens from 2007 through 2014. Substantial declines in teen pregnancy risk have been attributed to increased contraceptive use among sexually active teens, including the use of various methods such as long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) and the withdrawal method. Economic and social factors may influence teen behaviors regarding sex. From 2007 to 2014, teens increased their contraceptive use, including long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) and the withdrawal method. Economic and social factors may influence teen behaviors regarding sex, with some attributing the long-term decline in teen birth rates to the recession that began in 2007. Behavioral changes in teens, such as abstaining from sex or using contraceptives, have been influenced by factors like expanded educational opportunities for women and improvements in contraceptive technology. Some suggest that the recession starting in 2007 played a role in the long-term decline in teen birth rates, as teenagers became more cautious witnessing economic difficulties in their families. Despite this, the teen birth rate continued to decrease post-recession and during economic expansions. The decrease in teen births during economic downturns is attributed to teenagers being more cautious due to economic difficulties in their families. Factors like social media and increased internet use also contribute to the decline in teen birth rates. The MTV show 16 and Pregnant has been linked to more rapid declines in teen childbearing rates. Teen birth rates have declined, possibly due to factors like economic difficulties, social media, and the influence of the MTV show 16 and Pregnant. Observers suggest that teen pregnancy prevention programs may also be contributing to the decrease in teen births. The study found that teens changed their behavior after watching the show 16 and Pregnant, with some increasing contraceptive use. Teen birth rates continued to decline even after the show's peak ratings, leading to speculation about the role of teen pregnancy prevention programs in this trend. Teen pregnancy has significant costs for families and society, as teen parents often have lower education levels and higher poverty rates than their peers. Teen pregnancy has high costs for families and society. Teen parents have lower education levels and higher poverty rates. For example, many teen girls drop out of high school due to pregnancy, teen mothers often live below the poverty level, and a majority receive public benefits within the first year of their child's birth. Teen parents face challenges such as lower education levels and higher poverty rates. For instance, many teen girls drop out of high school due to pregnancy, and about 7 out of 10 teen mothers who move out of their family's household live below the poverty level. Additionally, over 60% of teen mothers receive public benefits within the first year after their children are born. These factors limit teen parents' economic self-sufficiency and may contribute to the increased likelihood of teen pregnancy. Teen parents often come from disadvantaged backgrounds, with lower education levels and higher poverty rates. This can lead to limited economic self-sufficiency and increase the likelihood of teen pregnancy. Teen sexual activity, even among those who do not become pregnant, can also increase risks. Teen mothers often come from more disadvantaged backgrounds than those who delay childbearing, with parents who receive public welfare benefits and have lower education levels. Teen sexual activity can increase the risk of STIs, leading to long-term health issues. Adolescents aged 15 to 19 have high rates of STIs. Teen childbearing can also impact the offspring, with children of teenage mothers having poorer outcomes. Teen pregnancy can lead to higher rates of STIs among adolescents aged 15 to 19, with long-term health consequences. Children of teenage mothers are more likely to have chronic medical conditions, use public health care, have lower school readiness scores, perform poorly in school, give birth during their teen years (females), and be incarcerated (males). Teen pregnancy can result in poorer outcomes for children, including chronic medical conditions, reliance on public health care, lower school readiness scores, poor academic performance, early childbirth for females, and incarceration for males. Additionally, there are societal impacts and cost savings associated with preventing unintended teen pregnancies. The Power to Decide conducted a study on the societal impacts of teen childbearing, estimating a total savings of $4.4 billion from 1991 to 2015 by avoiding unintended pregnancies during the teen years. This analysis considered cost savings to public programs like Medicaid for labor and delivery, postpartum care, infant care, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. The analysis estimated a total savings of $4.4 billion from 1991 to 2015 by averting births to teenagers, considering cost savings to Medicaid for labor and delivery, postpartum care, and infant care, as well as benefits from programs like TANF, SNAP, and WIC. Further research on the impacts of decreased teenage pregnancy and childbearing is recommended."
