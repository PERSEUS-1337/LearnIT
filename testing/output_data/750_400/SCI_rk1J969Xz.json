This work introduces a global meshing strategy and training procedures to overcome data limitations in image geolocation inferencing. This work introduces a novel global meshing strategy and training procedures to improve image geolocation inferencing. Delaunay triangles are shown to be effective for geolocation in low volume scenarios compared to state-of-the-art models using quad trees and more training data. Incorporating additional information can improve geolocation inference model performance. Delaunay triangles are effective for geolocation in low volume scenarios compared to quad trees. Time of posting, user albuming, and other metadata can improve geolocation accuracy by up to 11% for country-level and 3% for city-level localities. Advancements in deep learning have expanded the capabilities of machine learning in computer vision, allowing for more in-depth analysis of contextual information in images. This progress enables researchers to ask complex questions, such as determining the geographic location of a ground-level image, which remains a challenging task. Incorporating additional information like time of posting and metadata can enhance geolocation accuracy. Recent methods and complex models have enabled deeper examinations of contextual information in images, allowing researchers to ask challenging questions like determining the geographic origin of a ground-level image. However, estimating the location of an image is difficult due to uneven distribution of geo-tagged image data globally, which complicates model design and choice. The challenging task of estimating the geographic origin of images is complicated by uneven distribution of geo-tagged image data globally, leading to model complexity and design challenges. Additional issues include conflicting data and ambiguity of geographic terms. The work focuses on content-based image geolocation, identifying the geographic origin of ground-level images amidst challenges like conflicting data and ambiguous geographic terms. With the rise of image-based social media platforms, understanding the geographic context behind images is crucial. The work presented focuses on content-based image geolocation, identifying the geographic origin of ground-level images in the context of the increasing use of images and mixed-media in social data. Geolocation information in images can be incomplete or stripped, making it a relevant and challenging problem to solve. In the context of mixed-media data, inferring geographic context from images without geolocation information is a significant problem. Various approaches have been considered for geolocation from image content. The text discusses the challenges of inferring geographic context from images without geolocation information. Various approaches for geolocation from image content are considered, including a review by Brejcha & \u010cad\u00edk (2017) and the use of global geolocation from ground-based imagery BID19. Instance-level scene retrieval is also mentioned for geolocation of imagery BID6 BID18. The paper builds on recent work in global geolocation from ground-based imagery BID19, utilizing a multi-class approach with one-hot encoding. Instance-level scene retrieval is used for geolocation of imagery BID6 BID18, querying previously geotagged imagery to assign a geolabel based on image similarity to the database. Further, BID18 utilizes feature maps for mesh-based classifier for nearest-neighbors scene retrieval. The text discusses geolocation of imagery using BID6 and BID18, which query geotagged imagery to assign a geolabel based on image similarity. BID18 builds on previous work by utilizing feature maps for mesh-based classifier for scene retrieval. Additionally, prior work includes data sampling strategies for large-scale classification problems in social media applications, with a focus on biased class selection during training of deep learning models. In prior work, data sampling strategies for large-scale classification problems in social media applications have been explored. Kordopatis-Zilos et al. (2016) focused on weighted sampling of minority classes and biased class selection during deep learning model training. Sampling methods, such as random noising, were used to allow models to see more examples of rare classes. Researchers also considered sampling to ensure individual users are only seen once per training epoch. Image regularization allows models to see more examples of rare classes, with concerns about sampling in social media applications. Sampling is done without respect to the user, raising concerns about latent variables and communities in geolocation. The first model focuses on geolocation for image content, while the second set of models incorporates time information. In this work, sampling is performed without respect to user, images are selected randomly. The models considered include geolocation for image content (M1), models incorporating time information (M2), and models using user-album inputs (M3). The study explores alternative geolocation methods and the use of time and user information to enhance geolocation accuracy. Data is collected from YFCC100M BID17. The study contributes by considering alternative geolocation methods using time and user information (M2 and M3). Data is collected from YFCC100M BID17, with training and validation on a subset of geolabeled imagery. The assumption is made that the ground truth GPS location is accurate. The data used for the study is derived from YFCC100M BID17, with training and validation on a subset of geolabeled imagery. PlaNet, on the other hand, used a larger dataset for model development. Each YFCC100M image has associated metadata including user-id and posted-time. The YFCC100M dataset contains metadata for each image, including user-id and posted-time. The global-scale geolocation model described in the study is similar to PlaNet's classification approach. The globe is subdivided into a grid for spatial analysis. The global-scale geolocation model described in the study uses a classification approach similar to PlaNet's. The globe is divided into a grid for spatial analysis, with images being classified based on their true GPS location and time of posting. The study uses a classification approach to form a mesh of classification regions based on true GPS location and time of posting. The prior distribution for image longitude differs by the time of day an image is posted, with images typically far from zero longitude at 21:00 UTC. The study utilizes a Delaunay triangle-based meshing architecture to classify imagery based on true GPS location and time of posting. The prior distribution for image longitude varies by the time of day, with images typically far from zero longitude at 21:00 UTC. The study uses a Delaunay triangle-based meshing architecture to classify imagery based on GPS location. The mesh assigns a probability distribution of geo-labels for input imagery, different from PlaNet's quad-tree mesh approach. The triangular mesh is deployed to capture Earth's geometric features more adaptively. The study utilizes a triangular mesh to classify imagery based on GPS location, capturing Earth's geometric features adaptively. Unlike PlaNet's quad-tree approach, the triangular mesh can easily capture water/land interfaces without additional refinement. However, it lacks refinement level information compared to a structured quad-tree approach. Cells are controlled to manage mesh refinement. The triangular mesh used in the study captures water/land interfaces without additional refinement compared to quadtree meshes. However, it lacks refinement level information present in a structured quad-tree approach. Cells are adaptively refined based on the number of examples they contain. The study uses adaptive mesh refinement to control mesh refinement based on the number of examples in each cell. Three meshes were generated with different options, and the geolocation classification mesh can be adjusted by modifying parameters. The study utilized adaptive mesh refinement to generate three meshes with different options. The geolocation classification mesh can be adjusted by modifying parameters to control the maximum and minimum number of cells in each mesh cell. The mesh structures were selected to cover a range of mesh parameters, with fine P replicating the mesh parameters used by PlaNet. The study used adaptive mesh refinement to create three different meshes with varying parameters to adjust the geolocation classification mesh. The meshing parameters for the three meshes studied were selected to cover a range of structures, with fine P aiming to replicate PlaNet's parameters. The mesh structures included Coarse 8000 1000 538, Fine 5000 500 6565, and Fine P 10000 50 4771. The study utilized adaptive mesh refinement to create three different meshes with varying parameters for geolocation classification. The fine mesh outperformed the coarse mesh, with the fine P mesh aiming to replicate PlaNet's parameters. The meshes were generated with different datasets and methodologies. The study used adaptive mesh refinement to create three meshes for geolocation classification. The fine mesh, generated with 14M images, better represents geographic regions compared to the coarse mesh. The Inception v4 neural network was deployed for mesh-based classification. The study utilized adaptive mesh refinement to create three meshes for geolocation classification, with the fine mesh showing better representation of geographic regions. The Inception v4 neural network architecture was used to develop the mesh-based classification geolocation model. The study developed a mesh-based geolocation model (Model M1) using a softmax classification approach. Cells are labeled based on the cell centroid in latitudelongitude, with geolocation specified as the lat/lon centroid of the image population. Significant improvements are expected for coarse meshes. The study developed a mesh-based geolocation model (Model M1) using a softmax classification approach. An alternate approach is used to compute the \"center-of-mass\" of the training data in a containing cell, improving accuracy for coarse meshes. The cell centroid on the coast of Spain is shown to be inaccurate, leading to higher errors in geolocation predictions, especially in high-density population regions. Models are evaluated by calculating the distance between predicted and ground-truth GPS coordinates. The study developed a geolocation model using a softmax classification approach. Errors in predictions are higher in high-density population regions. Models are evaluated by calculating the distance between predicted and ground-truth GPS coordinates using a great-circle distance formula. Error thresholds of 1 km, 25 km, 200 km, 750 km, 2500 km are utilized. The study evaluates a geolocation model by comparing predicted and ground-truth GPS coordinates using a great-circle distance formula. Error thresholds of 1 km, 25 km, 200 km, 750 km, 2500 km are used to represent different localities. The study uses distance thresholds of 1 km, 25 km, 200 km, 750 km, 2500 km to represent various localities. Each YFCC100M image includes user id and posting time data. Model M2 utilizes posting time for analysis. The one-hot encoding Zik represents image geolocation classes. Softmax 1 output indicates strong evidence for geolocation class membership. The data includes user id and posting time, used in model M2. Zik is the one-hot encoding for image geolocation classes. Softmax 1 output provides evidence for geolocation class membership. The hypothesis is that there is time-dependence after conditioning on image content. The hypothesis in model M2 is that there is time-dependence after conditioning on image content. To incorporate time, related variables are added to the geolocation model output. Each image's fit probabilities are filtered to keep only the top 10 entries, with the rest set to 0. Model M3 simultaneously geolocates multiple images. Model M3, depicted in FIG2, utilizes Bidirectional LSTMs to geolocate images from a single user by leveraging information from other images posted by the user. This approach capitalizes on correlations within a user's image collection, unlike previous methods that relied on human-created albums. Model M3 in FIG2 uses Bidirectional LSTMs to geolocate images from a single user by leveraging correlations within the user's image collection. The approach borrows information from other images posted by the user to aid geolocation. The research question is whether this less informative organization of images can achieve success similar to previous methods. Images are grouped into albums of size 24. In M3, images by a single user are organized sequentially in time with no specific further organization. The research question is whether the success observed by BID19 extends to this less informative image organization. All user images are grouped into albums of size 24, with padding and masking utilized if needed. During training, a user is limited to a single random album per epoch. Album averaging, as considered by Weyand et al. (2016), assigns images in an album to a mesh cell based on the highest average probability. During training, a user is limited to a single random album per epoch. Album averaging assigns images in an album to a mesh cell based on the highest average probability, increasing accuracy by borrowing information across related images. A similar idea is applied to user images, determining the location based on the maximum average probability across all images associated with the user. The method of album averaging assigns images to mesh cells based on the highest average probability, increasing accuracy by borrowing information across related images. Similarly, for user images, the location is determined based on the maximum average probability across all images associated with the user. LSTM on a time-ordered sequence of images was also considered, but did not significantly improve performance beyond just adding time to the model. In addition to user-averaging, there is no optimization controlling class frequencies to be unbiased. LSTM on a time-ordered sequence of images was considered but did not significantly improve performance beyond just adding time to the model. The output of M1 is filtered to output only the top 10 mesh cell probabilities, re-normalized to sum to 1. Training of M2 and M3 was only done on the validation data of M1. Time inputs are concatenated to filtered and normalized outputs at (1). The output of M1 is filtered to output only the top 10 mesh cell probabilities, re-normalized to sum to 1. Training of M2 and M3 was only done on the validation data of M1. Time inputs are concatenated to filtered and normalized outputs at (1) and a new training step is implied. Meshing parameters are investigated to understand the sensitivity to mesh adaptation, showing a trade-off between fine-grain and coarse-grain geolocation. The results of mesh adaptation show a trade-off between fine-grain and coarse-grain geolocation. There is an improvement in large granularity geolocation with coarse mesh and better performance at finer-granularities with fine mesh. The impact of classifying on the centroid of training data is compared to using the cell centroid for class labels. The study observed a trade-off between fine-grain and coarse-grain geolocation. The coarse mesh showed improved large granularity geolocation, while the fine mesh performed better at finer-granularities. The impact of classifying on training data centroid versus cell centroid for class labels was compared, showing a dramatic improvement for the coarse mesh and modest improvement for the fine mesh. The BID20 model was used with indoor-outdoor label deliminations to filter geolocation inference on outdoor imagery without re-training the geolocation model. Results from the study show a 4-8% improvement in accuracy for region/country localities using the BID20 model with indoor-outdoor label deliminations. The geolocation model was not re-trained on outdoor imagery, but used as a filtering operation during inference. Testing on Im2GPS data yielded positive results tabulated in TAB3. Results from the study show a 4-8% improvement in accuracy for region/country localities using the BID20 model with indoor-outdoor label deliminations. The Im2GPS testing data is utilized to test the model on 237 images provided by BID6, showing a significant boost in performance. The BID6 work results are tabulated in TAB3 for all meshes, showing improved performance with YFCC100M training data on Im2GPS testing set. The M1 classification model outperforms BID19 with less training data and regions, exceeding PlaNet for large regions. Time usage enhances geolocation accuracy, with 24.20% of images geolocated within 200 km. The coarse mesh M1 model outperforms PlaNet with less training data and regions, showing improved geolocation accuracy with the use of time. Time usage results in a slight gain in accuracy, with 24.20% of images geolocated within 200 km. The advantage of using time can be seen across all error calculations and is statistically significant. The use of time in the coarse mesh model improves geolocation accuracy, with 24.20% of images geolocated within 200 km. This advantage is consistent across error calculations and statistically significant. The error difference between using time (M2) and not using time (M1) is tested with a Wilcoxon-Signed-Test for paired observations. The difference in errors between using time (M2) and not using time (M1) is statistically significant, with a p-value < 10^-16 in favor of using time-inputs. The distribution of errors is mean shifted, but not uniformly to lower error. The difference in errors between using time (M2) and not using time (M1) is statistically significant (p-value < 10^-16). The distribution of errors is mean shifted, but not uniformly to lower error. Time input models have lower-bias class probabilities, with a median error of 1627 km for M1 and 1262 km for M2. Cross-entropy was optimized in training for both models. The median error for coarse mesh e1 is 1627 km, while for e2 it is 1262 km. Time input models show lower-bias class probabilities, with cross-entropy optimized in training for both models. KL-Divergence is calculated to minimize class biases in validation predictions. KL-Divergence is used to minimize class biases in time-input models during training. \"User-Averaging\" is included in the results as a simple method that is more accurate than predicting individual images with M1 or M2, but it biases cell count frequency. The KL-divergence of the model output class frequencies compared to the true class frequencies in validation are in TAB5. \"User-Averaging\" is incorporated into results as a simple method that is more accurate than predicting individual images with M1 or M2, but it biases cell count frequency. Improved accuracy can come with higher bias when using the average probability vector to predict a user's image. When predicting a user's image, using the average probability vector can lead to higher bias in class frequencies. Albums provide a better approach to reduce bias, with LSTMs on user albums showing the lowest bias. Different models were compared for accuracy at various spatial resolutions, with coarse and fine mesh having different numbers of triangles across the globe. The training method includes bias-reducing cross-entropy optimization, resulting in LSTMs on user albums having the lowest class bias. Different models were compared for accuracy at various spatial resolutions, with coarse and fine mesh having different numbers of triangles across the globe. Time meta information is concatenated with M1 output for album creation using user-id and containing 24 images. The best observed accuracy in column is bold. Coarse Mesh and Fine Mesh Best Possible are not actual models, but represent the best possible accuracy if every image was given the right class. Conditioning on latent variables can improve geolocation models. Using time of day in the models increases accuracy and lowers bias. Time of day is a weak addition to Inception-like results, but useful for improving accuracy. Using time of day in geolocation models can improve accuracy and reduce bias. This approach was found to be statistically significant and beneficial for both coarse and fine mesh models. Additionally, considering indoor/outdoor scenes in images can further enhance geolocation accuracy. Using time information improves geolocation accuracy and meshes, with outdoor scenes yielding better results. Future work could involve incorporating the probability of an image being outdoor into the model. Accounting for indoor/outdoor scenes in images improves validation accuracy. Future work could involve incorporating the probability of an image being outdoor into the model to optimize results. Increasing granularity of a grid reduces accuracy at country and regional levels but improves accuracy at street and city levels. Street level geoinferencing is not practical with a coarse mesh. The model can optimize results by weighting time or other meta data more heavily. Increasing grid granularity reduces accuracy at country and regional levels but improves accuracy at street and city levels. Street level geoinferencing is not practical with a coarse mesh, suggesting a fine mesh would perform better. However, there is no guarantee that a fine mesh is superior for geolocation at resolutions larger than 25 km. The study compared the performance of coarse and fine meshes for geolocation at different resolutions. A coarse mesh was found to be superior for 200 km resolutions. Using a Delunary triangle-based mesh allowed for accurate models with fewer training examples. Images were split into training and validation sets for the study. The study found that a coarse mesh is superior for 200 km resolutions and using a Delunary triangle-based mesh allows for accurate models with fewer training examples. Images were divided into training and validation sets for the study. The study divided images into training and validation sets, with 12.2M and 2.7M images respectively. Validation data for model M1 was further split for training models M2 and M3. Training large models required a specific procedure to overcome challenges with softmax classification. Training large models with a high number of output classes required a specific procedure to overcome challenges. The approach involved training a pre-trained model with Adagrad, increasing training examples each epoch, and biasing classes by oversampling minority classes. The model training approach involved training a pre-trained model with Adagrad BID3, increasing training examples each epoch by 6%, biasing classes by oversampling minority classes, and reducing class bias after each training cycle. The final model was trained with SGD, using a linearly decreasing learning rate reduced at 4% with each epoch, without class biasing and with the full dataset per epoch. The initial value of the learning rate varied for each model (between 0.004 and 0.02). The values of those hyperparameters were empirically determined. The final model was re-trained with a reduced bias using SGD and a linearly decreasing learning rate. Hyperparameters were empirically determined, and M2 was trained with He initializations and Adaboost iterations. Early stopping was used to detect validation accuracy decrease. The M2 model is trained using He initializations and Adaboost iterations, followed by ADAM with learning rates of 0.005 and 0.001. Early stopping is used to detect a sustained decrease in validation accuracy. The generality of the M1 classification model is demonstrated by performing a query-by-example on the 2K random Im2GPS dataset. The M2 model is trained using He initializations and Adaboost iterations, followed by ADAM with learning rates of 0.005 and 0.001. The generality of the M1 classification model is demonstrated by performing a query-by-example on the 2K random Im2GPS dataset, showing an image of the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood. Each image is given a categorical indicator variable, and there exists a latent class distribution assumed constant between training, testing, and application. The latent class distribution p i is assumed constant between training, testing, and application. The last layer output from networks is a softmax model for classification distribution. If training is done well, the KL-divergence between q and p should be low. The last layer output from networks is a softmax model for classification distribution. When comparing models, accuracy is preferred but unbiased models are also considered. The KL-divergence between q and p should be low if training is done well. Additionally, the entropy of p and q is also taken into account."
