    "content": "Public and private health care spending is increasing due to factors like rising health insurance enrollment and an aging population. The tax subsidies in the Internal Revenue Code for health care provision are often overlooked in budget discussions, as they result in revenue foregone through preferential tax treatment. Congressional focus on health-related tax expenditures is important. Implicit subsidies in the Internal Revenue Code for private and publicly provided health care, in the form of tax expenditures, are often overlooked in public debates. Congressional attention to health-related tax expenditures is crucial, raising questions about their value and changes over time, especially since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act. Tax expenditures related to health are often overlooked in public debates. Questions arise about their value, changes over time, and comparison to total revenue collected. The size of health tax expenditures relative to discretionary and mandatory health program outlays is also of interest. Additionally, the growth of federal support for health through direct outlays versus revenue losses from tax expenditures is a topic for consideration. This report analyzes historical data on health-related tax expenditure estimates published by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to understand changes in tax expenditures relative to total revenue collected and the size of health tax expenditures compared to discretionary and mandatory health program outlays. It also examines whether federal support for health has grown more through direct outlays or indirectly through revenue losses attributable to tax expenditures. This report analyzes historical data on health-related tax expenditure estimates published by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) at the budget function level. For more detailed information on individual tax expenditures, refer to CRS Committee Print CP10001. For detailed information on individual tax expenditures, refer to CRS Committee Print CP10001 and CRS Report R44012 for broader analysis and comparisons by budget function. The report relies on the tax expenditure definition and estimation methodology used by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) as defined in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The tax expenditure definition and estimation methodology used by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) is based on the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. JCT defines tax expenditures as revenue losses due to special provisions in Federal tax laws. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) defines tax expenditures as revenue losses attributable to special provisions in Federal tax laws, causing a divergence from measured income under a modified Haig-Simons baseline definition. Certain tax provisions result in revenue forgone from this baseline. Tax expenditures are revenue losses from special provisions in Federal tax laws that diverge from measured income. The Joint Committee on Taxation categorizes these provisions by budget function and publishes estimates during each session of Congress. The Joint Committee on Taxation categorizes tax expenditures by budget function, such as health, commerce, housing, and energy. These provisions represent revenue forgone from the income tax system and are published annually during each session of Congress. The Department of the Treasury also maintains its own list of tax expenditures organized by budget function. The Joint Committee on Taxation categorizes tax expenditures by budget function, including health, commerce, housing, and energy. The Department of the Treasury also has its own list of tax expenditures organized by budget function. The health budget function used by JCT for tax expenditures is broader than the one used for outlays by agencies like OMB, due to historical practices and the challenge of categorizing cross-cutting health provisions. The Joint Committee on Taxation categorizes tax expenditures by budget function, including health. The way JCT organizes tax expenditures is broader than the health budget functions used by agencies like OMB, partly due to historical practices and the challenge of categorizing cross-cutting health provisions. Tax expenditures are categorized by budget area, forms outlined in the 1974 Budget Act, and by academic researchers in various ways. Economists evaluate tax expenditures for their impact on social policy and economic spending programs. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzes tax expenditures based on forms outlined in the 1974 Budget Act, such as exclusions, exemptions, deductions, preferential tax rates, and tax credits. Economists evaluate tax expenditures for economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity, providing insights for Congressional decision-making. Tax expenditures are evaluated by economists based on economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity to aid Congressional decision-making. For example, tax expenditures in health insurance can correct some market inefficiencies while creating others. Exclusions and deductions in tax expenditures may affect tax progressivity by benefiting filers based on their top marginal income tax rate. Tax expenditures in health insurance can correct market inefficiencies but may undermine tax progressivity. Administering social policy through the tax code has advantages for lower-income households but could increase tax filing complexity. The tax code could have an advantage in administering social policy targeted towards lower-income households due to reported income and family size on tax forms. However, using the tax code for social programs may increase complexity and costs. Administering tax expenditures as direct spending programs could be easier for beneficiaries and reduce administrative costs. JCT currently identifies 14 health tax expenditures. The tax code may increase complexity and costs in administering social policy. Administering tax expenditures as direct spending programs could be easier for beneficiaries and reduce administrative costs. JCT currently identifies 14 health tax expenditures, totaling $234.0 billion in FY2016. In FY2016, health tax expenditures are estimated to amount to $234.0 billion, with the largest tax expenditure being the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance (ESI). This provision is also the largest tax expenditure in the federal tax code. The largest health tax expenditure in FY2016 is the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance (ESI), which is also the largest tax expenditure in the federal tax code. The annual tax expenditure for ESI is estimated to increase from $145.5 billion to $169.4 billion from FY2015 to FY2019. The second largest health tax expenditure is for subsidies for insurance purchased in the exchanges, with an estimated annual tax expenditure increase. From FY2015 to FY2019, the annual tax expenditure for the ESI tax exclusion is projected to increase from $145.5 billion to $169.4 billion. The second largest health tax expenditure is for subsidies for insurance purchased in the exchanges, with an estimated increase from $29.6 billion to $84.8 billion. These tax provisions subsidize private health insurance costs and government health program benefits. The annual tax expenditure for Advanced Premium Tax Credits (APTCs) is estimated to increase from $29.6 billion to $84.8 billion. Health-related tax expenditures serve various purposes and subsidize private health insurance costs and government health program benefits. Other provisions aim to reduce the cost of private activities with positive spillover benefits to society. Some health tax provisions aim to reduce the cost of private activities with positive spillover benefits to society, such as exclusion of interest on state and local government private activity bonds for nonprofit hospitals and itemized deduction for charitable giving to qualified nonprofit health organizations. These provisions have origins in legal doctrine or definitions of income at the time of adoption and may have been indirectly affected by other policies. Some older health tax provisions have origins in legal doctrine or definitions of income at the time of adoption and may have been indirectly affected by other policies. For example, the itemized deduction for charitable giving to nonprofit health organizations is a subcomponent of the tax treatment of larger categories of activity. The earliest forms of income tax had larger exemptions, making it difficult to imagine the breadth of these older tax provisions during their enactment. The ESI tax exclusion, originating in 1918, allowed employer payments for individual health coverage to be deductible as a cost of doing business. Regulatory rulings on employer health contributions had conflicting outcomes under a 1954 revision of the Internal Revenue Code. The ESI tax exclusion, originating in 1918, allowed employer payments for individual health coverage to be deductible as a cost of doing business. The role of the ESI exclusion was significantly expanded during and after World War II by administrative decisions and policies that froze wages, but not employer-sponsored fringe benefits. The Internal Revenue Code Act of 1954 explicitly excluded these contributions from income.

JCT data on health-related tax expenditure estimates from FY1974 to FY2019 show changes in provisions over time. The JCT analyzes health-related tax expenditure estimates from FY1974 to FY2019, showing changes in provisions over time. The number of provisions within the health category has changed as provisions expired or were added. Medicare-related tax provisions are analyzed separately through FY2014. Multiple tax expenditure provisions are combined to track changes in tax expenditures in this budget function. The JCT analyzes health-related tax expenditure estimates from FY1974 to FY2019, showing changes in provisions over time. Medicare-related tax provisions are analyzed separately through FY2014, with multiple provisions combined to track changes in tax expenditures in this budget function. The JCT analyzes health-related tax expenditure estimates from FY1974 to FY2019, showing changes in provisions over time. Health-related tax expenditures have increased by 43.0% in real terms from FY2004 to FY2014. Health-related tax expenditures have increased over time, with a 43.0% increase from FY2004 to FY2014 in real terms. The annual tax expenditure value for health-related provisions has also shown growth, with positive rates after the enactment of the ACA in 2010. The annual value of health tax expenditures is estimated to increase from $210.4 billion in FY2015 to $296.2 billion in FY2019, with an estimated total of $234.0 billion in FY2016. The annual value of health tax expenditures is projected to rise from $210.4 billion in FY2015 to $296.2 billion in FY2019, with an estimated total of $234.0 billion in FY2016. Factors contributing to this growth include changes in demographics, rising health care costs, and policy changes affecting the cost of health-related tax expenditures. The net growth of health-related tax expenditures, totaling $234.0 billion in FY2016, is influenced by factors like demographic changes, increasing health care costs, and policy changes impacting the cost of these expenditures. Medicare-related tax expenditures were previously calculated based on benefits exceeding insurance payments, excluding all Medicare benefits from income tax. Before FY2015, JCT identified Medicare-related tax expenditures as the value of benefits exceeding insurance payments. Medicare benefits are excluded from income tax, but a positive tax expenditure was measured if insurance benefits exceeded premiums paid. For example, a positive tax expenditure for Medicare Part D indicated that insurance value exceeded premiums. JCT measured positive tax expenditures for Medicare insurance benefits when they exceeded enrollees' payments. Tax expenditures for Medicare increased over time, with a 10.2% annual increase from FY1987 to FY2014. Before FY1987, tax expenditures for Medicare were minimal, indicating benefits were roughly equal to payments. Medicare-related tax expenditures increased over time, with a 10.2% annual increase from FY1987 to FY2014. Before FY1987, tax expenditures for Medicare were minimal, indicating benefits were roughly equal to payments. The annual value of Medicare insurance to beneficiaries increased at rates higher than payments over time, with Medicare provisions estimated to be 26.8% of total health tax expenditures. Health-related tax expenditures have also increased from 1.9% of total revenue in FY1974 to 8.4% in FY2014. The value of health-related tax expenditures has increased significantly over the years, from 1.9% of total revenue in FY1974 to 8.4% in FY2014. In FY2019, health tax expenditures are estimated to be 7.7% of total revenue collected. Tax expenditure values alone do not provide a complete picture of tax policies. Health tax expenditures have generally increased at a rate greater than total revenue collections, estimated to rise from 6.4% in FY2015 to 7.7% in FY2019. The ACA imposed various taxes to raise revenue, including the Cadillac tax, individual mandate, employer mandate, and medical device tax, along with a 3.8% unearned income Medicare contribution tax. The ACA imposed several taxes to raise revenue in the health field, including the Cadillac tax, individual mandate, employer mandate, and medical device tax, along with a 3.8% unearned income Medicare contribution tax for higher-income taxpayers. However, the revenue raised by these provisions is small compared to total health tax expenditures. The ACA imposed various taxes to raise revenue in the health sector, including the Cadillac tax, individual mandate, employer mandate, and medical device tax, as well as a 3.8% unearned income Medicare contribution tax for higher-income taxpayers. The revenue generated by these provisions is relatively small compared to total health tax expenditures. The OMB classifies a narrower set of activities under its health budget function compared to JCT's categories for tax expenditures. The comparison between outlays and tax expenditures could be useful for analyzing changes in expenditures. The comparison between outlays and tax expenditures is useful for tracking federal support to the health sector and household health expenses over time. Medicare and Medicaid costs are mostly mandatory outlays, with administrative costs funded separately. Tax expenditures can track federal support to the health sector and household health expenses over time. Medicare and Medicaid costs are mostly mandatory outlays, while health research and veterans' health care are funded through discretionary spending. Health-related tax expenditures historically exceeded health discretionary outlays. Health-related tax expenditures historically exceeded health discretionary outlays, but were still much less than health mandatory outlays, which primarily consist of funding for Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Mandatory outlays for health have increased as a percentage of GDP over the years. Health-related tax expenditures have historically exceeded health discretionary outlays, but were still much less than health mandatory outlays. Mandatory outlays for health have increased as a percentage of GDP over the years, reaching 5.0% in FY2014. Health discretionary outlays remained relatively stable between 0.3% and 0.5% of GDP from FY1974 to FY2014. Health tax expenditures have grown from 0.3% of GDP in FY1974 to 1.5% in FY2014, with discretionary outlays ranging from 0.3% to 0.5% of GDP over the same period. The appendix provides a description and legislative origins of each health tax expenditure provision identified by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) identifies the legislative origins of health tax expenditure provisions. JCT stopped classifying Medicare-related provisions after FY2015. Some health tax expenditures are long-standing in the Internal Revenue Code, with historical rationales possibly different from current policy effects. Origins could stem from past legal definitions or administrative rulings. Some tax expenditure provisions have historical origins in past legal definitions or administrative rulings, which may differ from their current policy effects.
