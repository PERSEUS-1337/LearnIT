The \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" aims to establish a standard for labeling foods produced using genetic engineering, including fish, to inform consumers about the production process. Congress recognizes the material changes in genetically engineered food and the right of individuals to know if their food was produced using genetic engineering. The Food and Drug Administration requires labeling of over 3,000 ingredients, additives, and processes, while more than 60 countries have laws mandating labeling of genetically engineered food for various reasons. More than 60 countries, including the United Kingdom, European Union, South Korea, Japan, Brazil, Australia, India, China, and other key trading partners, have laws mandating disclosure of genetically engineered food on labels. Codex Alimentarius, the UN food standards organization, allows governments to decide on labeling genetically engineered foods. In 2011, Codex Alimentarius adopted a text allowing governments to decide on labeling genetically engineered foods, which can preserve economic value in exports and sensitive markets. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require clear disclosure of genetically engineered ingredients in food, with exceptions for restaurant food, medical food, and certain other foods. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require clear disclosure of genetically engineered ingredients in food, with exceptions for restaurant food, medical food, and certain other foods. This paragraph outlines specific exemptions for food served in restaurants, medical food, food produced using genetically engineered vaccines, and food processed with genetically engineered aids or enzymes. The paragraph defines genetic engineering as a process involving nucleic acid techniques or fusion of cells beyond the taxonomic family. It outlines exemptions for food produced using genetically engineered vaccines or processed with genetically engineered aids or enzymes. Genetic engineering involves in vitro nucleic acid techniques or cell fusion beyond the taxonomic family for creating food intended for human consumption. Genetic engineering for food involves overcoming reproductive barriers using techniques not used in traditional breeding. Genetically engineered food is produced intentionally through genetic engineering or the reproduction of engineered organisms. Genetically engineered ingredient is a material derived from an organism produced through genetic engineering, regardless of detectable molecular or cellular changes. Genetically engineered ingredient is a material derived from an organism produced through genetic engineering, without regard to detectable molecular or cellular changes. Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act includes provisions regarding the use of genetically engineered ingredients in food. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include provisions on the use of genetically engineered ingredients in food. Guaranty provisions are also added to protect individuals from penalties for violations related to misbranded food. No person shall face penalties for violations involving misbranded food if they provide a guaranty signed by a US resident from whom the food was received in good faith. To avoid penalties for misbranded food violations, a recipient must provide a signed guaranty from a US resident stating that the food is not genetically engineered. To avoid penalties for misbranded food violations, a recipient must provide a signed guaranty stating that the food is not genetically engineered. This exclusion from penalties applies regardless of how the recipient uses the food. The exclusion from penalties for misbranded food violations applies to recipients who provide a signed guaranty that the food is not genetically engineered, regardless of how the food is used. No person can avoid responsibility for violating food safety regulations. No person can avoid responsibility for violating food safety regulations by entering into a contract that shifts liability to another party. This includes using the food as an ingredient, repacking the food, or producing the food. The text discusses the prohibition of shifting responsibility for misbranded food through contracts, with specific terms defined. Additionally, it mentions an amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding false guaranties. In subsection (c), the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is further amended to address unintended contamination issues. Section 303(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to address unintended contamination issues related to misbranded food involving genetically engineered materials. Section 301(c) addresses misbranded food involving genetically engineered materials, specifically when contamination occurs unintentionally with non-genetically engineered food produced by an agricultural producer. The Secretary must promulgate proposed regulations within 1 year of the enactment of the Act regarding unintentional contamination of non-genetically engineered food by genetically engineered materials in agricultural production. This provision does not apply if contamination is due to the negligence of the producer. The Secretary must establish labeling requirements for compliance with unintentional contamination of non-genetically engineered food by genetically engineered materials in agricultural production within 1 year of the Act's enactment. This provision excludes agricultural producers if contamination results from their negligence."
