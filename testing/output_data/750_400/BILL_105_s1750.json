They establish achievable benchmarks for each plan and program to verify progress objectively. The purpose of benchmarks in the program is to verify progress objectively through specific, measurable goals or objectives. The benchmarks in the program aim to measure progress objectively by establishing specific, measurable goals related to arrests, extradition, eradication of drug-related crops, and money-laundering within a fixed timeframe. The high-level contact group must establish specific goals for arrests, extradition, eradication of drug-related crops, and money-laundering within a set timeframe, to be completed within 60 days after certification. The high-level contact group must set specific goals and deadlines for various activities related to drug control, to be completed within 60 days after certification.

In the following year, a report describing the progress made by the country in meeting the benchmarks must be included in the report submitted to Congress.

It is the sense of Congress that this also applies to Mexico. The President must report to Congress on countries' progress in meeting established benchmarks, with emphasis placed on each benchmark for certification the following year. Congress suggests convening a high-level contact group for Mexico in 1998, with provisions applying to the group's activities. A high-level contact group should be convened for Mexico in 1998, with provisions from the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 applying to the group's activities and certification of Mexico in 1999."
