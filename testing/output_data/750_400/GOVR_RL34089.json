    "content": "Both chambers of Congress have passed legislation to reauthorize expiring programs at the FDA and expand the agency's authority. The bills are the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act (S. 1082) and the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (H.R. 2900). These bills represent the most comprehensive FDA legislation since 1997. The primary focus is renewing FDA's authority for key user fee programs set to expire. The FDA legislation represented by S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 is the most comprehensive since 1997. It focuses on renewing FDA's authority for key user fee programs set to expire. FDA urged Congress to complete reauthorization efforts before August 1, 2007. The FDA urged Congress to reauthorize the User Fee Act and the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act before August 1, 2007 to avoid layoffs due to funding uncertainty. FDA is using reserve funds to prevent layoffs, resulting in a hiring freeze and affecting employee morale. The FDA is using reserve funds to prevent layoffs and a hiring freeze due to funding uncertainty, affecting employee morale. Bills are being considered to reauthorize expiring authorities related to pediatric pharmaceuticals. The bills being considered would reauthorize expiring authorities related to pediatric pharmaceuticals, along with addressing other issues of concern to Congress and the public. The FDA, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, regulates the safety of human foods, animal feeds, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, medical devices, and animal drugs. The FDA, under the Department of Health and Human Services, regulates the safety and effectiveness of human foods, animal feeds, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, medical devices, and animal drugs. Premarket approval is required for products regulated for effectiveness, while products regulated only for safety may have little FDA oversight. The FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of human foods, animal feeds, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, medical devices, and animal drugs. Products regulated for effectiveness require premarket approval, while those regulated for safety may have little FDA oversight. The agency has the authority to withdraw unsafe products from commerce. Media coverage has highlighted safety issues with food, drugs, and medical devices. The FDA has the authority to inspect production facilities and enforce good manufacturing practices. It can withdraw unsafe products from the market. Media coverage has raised concerns about the safety of food, drugs, and medical devices, prompting congressional attention on FDA's performance and funding. The 110th Congress is focusing on balancing the agency's role in expediting safe and effective products to market. The 110th Congress is focusing on balancing the FDA's role in expediting safe and effective products to market, ensuring product safety, and protecting public health. The FDA's role is to ensure the safety and effectiveness of products on the market, collecting user fees from manufacturers to speed up the process. Some question the agency's reliance on these fees, calling for increased appropriations instead. Congress has passed measures authorizing FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers to speed up product approval. Some question the agency's reliance on these fees, calling for increased appropriations. Efforts to reauthorize PDUFA and MDUFMA are underway, with these fees representing a significant portion of FDA's budget. Efforts to reauthorize PDUFA and MDUFMA, which are the largest sources of FDA's user fee revenue, are already in progress. PDUFA is expected to generate $339,195,000, and MDUFMA $47,500,000, accounting for 87% of FDA's user fee revenue and 19% of its total budget in FY2008. PDUFA and MDUFMA fees will generate $339,195,000 and $47,500,000, accounting for 87% of FDA's user fee revenue and 19% of its total budget in FY2008. PDUFA was enacted in 1992 and reauthorized twice, allowing FDA to collect fees from drug companies for new product application reviews. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 authorized the FDA to collect fees from companies for drug and biological product reviews. MDUFMA, enacted in 2002, established user fees for medical device applications and incorporated performance goals for premarket device reviews. MDUFMA, enacted in 2002, aimed to reduce FDA premarket review times by establishing user fees for medical device applications. It also included performance goals for various types of premarket device reviews and allowed third-parties to conduct establishment inspections. The expiring authorities within MDUFMA are related to user fees and associated performance goals. In 1997, Congress gave FDA a tool, in BPCA, to encourage pediatric drug research by offering extended marketing exclusivity in exchange for trials investigating pediatric dosage levels and potential side effects of \"adult\" medications in children. In 1997, Congress enacted the BPCA to incentivize pediatric drug research by offering extended marketing exclusivity in exchange for trials investigating the effects of adult medications on children. This was followed by the codification of requirements for studying pediatric populations in new drug applications through PREA in 2003. The BPCA and PREA provide incentives for studying pediatric drug use. Developing medical devices for children is less profitable and more challenging than for adults due to lower demand and physical differences. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 address the critical need for pediatric medical devices, offering incentives for studying pediatric drug use and developing devices for children, which is less profitable and more challenging than for adults due to lower demand and physical differences. The need for pediatric medical devices is critical due to children's unique physical attributes and environmental influences. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 provide incentives for manufacturers to develop these devices and give the FDA authority to require postmarket studies for continued safety and efficacy. The legislation (S. 1082 and H.R. 2900) incentivizes manufacturers to create pediatric medical devices and grants the FDA authority to mandate postmarket studies for ongoing safety and effectiveness. Adverse effects of medical products may not surface until after a product is on the market, either due to delayed manifestation or rarity, requiring extensive use to be recognized as drug-related. The legislation (S. 1082 and H.R. 2900) aims to encourage pediatric medical device development and gives the FDA power to require postmarket studies for safety. Adverse effects may take years to appear or be so rare that widespread use is needed for recognition. Provisions in the bills strengthen the FDA's data collection system for identifying issues that require action. The legislation (S. 1082 and H.R. 2900) aims to strengthen the FDA's data collection system for identifying issues that require action, including provisions for postmarket studies on pediatric medical devices. Medical journals tend to publish positive clinical trial results, while manufacturers may be hesitant to disclose negative findings to avoid alarming customers. The legislation aims to strengthen the FDA's data collection system and provide new authorities for requiring manufacturers to take action. Medical journals typically publish positive clinical trial results, while manufacturers may be reluctant to disclose negative findings. In 2004, concerns were raised about the safety and effectiveness of FDA-approved biomedical products with undisclosed negative trial results. In 2004, Congress raised concerns about the safety and effectiveness of FDA-approved biomedical products with undisclosed negative trial results. Legislation such as S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 includes provisions for public registration of clinical trials and posting results. FDA utilizes advisory committees for independent advice on human and veterinary drugs, biological products, and medical devices. Public access to negative trial results gained traction with the introduction of S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, which include provisions for public registration of clinical trials and posting results. FDA utilizes advisory committees for independent advice on drugs, biological products, and medical devices, with recommendations that may or may not be followed. Conflict of interest concerns are raised regarding the credibility and usefulness of these committees. In 2006 and 2007, media reports highlighted bias in FDA advisory committees favoring drug approval and conflicts of interest among committee members. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to address these issues by revising FDA's approach to conflicts of interest among advisory committee members. In 2006 and 2007, media reports revealed bias in FDA advisory committees towards drug approval and conflicts of interest among committee members. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to address these issues by revising FDA's approach to conflicts of interest among advisory committee members. The year 2000 marked a slowdown in new drug and biologic submissions to regulatory agencies globally, leading to an investigation by the FDA in 2004 to understand the decline in innovative medical products submitted for approval. In 2004, FDA investigated the decline in innovative medical products submitted for approval, noting the rising difficulty of product development. It called for modernizing scientific tools and harnessing bioinformation for evaluation and prediction of product safety and effectiveness. The report highlighted the challenges in medical product development and called for modernizing scientific tools to evaluate safety and effectiveness. Legislation proposes creating a nonprofit to support the FDA in these efforts. High prescription drug costs in the US have led some consumers to seek medications from foreign sources. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose the creation of a Reagan-Udall Foundation to support the FDA in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical products. The high cost of prescription drugs in the US has led some consumers to seek medications from foreign sources, but current law tightly regulates drug importation to maintain safety standards. The law tightly regulates drug importation to maintain safety standards, allowing only manufacturers to import prescription drugs. Some lawmakers are exploring ways to enable access to lower-priced medications from foreign sources while ensuring product safety. One title of S. 1082 was written to allow and regulate some importation of prescription drugs. The law restricts drug importation to manufacturers only. Lawmakers are considering ways to allow access to cheaper medications from foreign sources while ensuring safety. S. 1082 includes a title for regulating prescription drug importation, but an amendment requiring HHS Secretary certification may nullify the importation language. FDA has regulated food safety since 1906, evolving with food science advancements. The FDA has regulated food safety since 1906, evolving with food science advancements. Recent outbreaks of foodborne illness have raised concerns about food safety among members of Congress. The FDA has regulated food safety since 1906, evolving with food science advancements. Recent outbreaks of foodborne illness have raised concerns among members of Congress. S. 1082 addresses some issues in food safety reform that Congress may consider, along with two comprehensive FDA reauthorization and reform bills. Many members are concerned about domestic and imported food safety. S. 1082 and two FDA reform bills address key issues in food safety reform, but not always in the same way. Topics covered include prescription drug user fees, medical device user fees, pediatric drugs and devices, drug safety, clinical trials databases, conflicts of interest, and importation. The remaining sections of this report contain descriptions of key FDA programs addressed in the bills, certain programs considered but not included, and links to relevant CRS reports. Topics include prescription drug user fees, medical device user fees, pediatric drugs and devices, drug safety, clinical trials databases, conflicts of interest, importation of prescription drugs, Reagan-Udall Foundation, office of the chief scientist, food safety, and miscellaneous provisions in one bill or the other. FDA's authority to collect user fees under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act will expire on October 1, 2007. FDA's authority to collect user fees under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) will expire on October 1, 2007, unless Congress reauthorizes the program. PDUFA, enacted in 1992, provides FDA with fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers to expedite the review process for drug applications. PDUFA, enacted in 1992, provides FDA with fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers to expedite the review process for drug applications. The program will expire on October 1, 2007, unless Congress reauthorizes it. PDUFA restricted the use of collected funds to new product review and established performance goals for review times, resulting in decreased application review times. PDUFA, enacted in 1992, provides FDA with fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers to expedite the review process for drug applications. The program restricted the use of funds to new product review and set performance goals for review times. Congress reauthorized PDUFA in 1997 and 2002, allowing FDA limited authority to use some fees for postmarket drug safety activities. In 1992, PDUFA was enacted to expedite drug application reviews with fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers. Congress reauthorized PDUFA in 1997 and 2002, allowing FDA limited authority to use some fees for postmarket drug safety activities. Discussions for a 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization have focused on postmarket drug safety, with S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 including Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2007 to reauthorize fees for application, establishment, and product fees. The 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization focuses on postmarket drug safety, with S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 including Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2007. Both bills reauthorize fees for application, establishment, and product fees, covering both prescription and nonprescription drugs. They also expand the list of postmarket safety activities that fees could be used for, including adverse event data collection systems and improved analytical tools. The bills for Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2007 would cover applications for both prescription and nonprescription drugs, adding postmarket safety activities and increasing requirements for adverse event reporting to the HHS Secretary and the public. Both Senate and House bills aim to establish fee revenues of $393 million annually with adjustments. The House bill extends beyond the Senate's in terms of data collection systems and analytical tools. Both bills aim to increase adverse event reporting requirements to the HHS Secretary and the public, establish fee revenues of $393 million annually with adjustments, and amend methods for inflation and workload adjustments. The House bill would exempt orphan drugs marketed by companies with less than $100 million from certain fees. The House bill proposes adjustments for inflation, workload, and rent-related costs in fee collection for drug applications. It also includes a new section for fees to fund advisory review of drug advertisements, with voluntary pre-release review by manufacturers. The House bill proposes adjustments for inflation, workload, and rent-related costs in fee collection for drug applications. It also includes a new section for fees to fund advisory review of drug advertisements by companies with less than $100 million in gross worldwide revenue. The new fees would be voluntary for manufacturers requesting pre-release reviews, with FDA responses being advisory. Only manufacturers requesting reviews would be assessed the fees, which include an advisory review fee and an operating reserve fee. The Senate bill would codify certain core elements of the prescription drug user fee program within the FFDCA. The Senate bill proposes new fees for manufacturers requesting advisory reviews, including an advisory review fee and an operating reserve fee. It would also require the Secretary to submit annual reports to Congress and consult with various stakeholders for PDUFA reauthorization.

Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorization of FDA user fees for medical devices through FY2012. They include provisions for fee amounts, annual establishment fees, registration fees, and 30-day fees. The bills would lower fee amounts for FY2008, with an 8.5% annual increase through FY2012. Government entities would be exempt from establishment fees, with H.R. 2900 extending this waiver to Indian tribes. The Secretary could increase the establishment fee in FY2010 by an additional 8.5% if fewer than 12,250 establishments paid the fee in FY2009. The bills would extend the requirement for medical device-related direct appropriations from FY2007 to FY2012. They would also amend a provision regarding excess fees collected for a fiscal year. The bills would extend the requirement for medical device-related direct appropriations from FY2007 to FY2012 and amend a provision regarding excess fees collected for a fiscal year. Additionally, fees collected between FY2008 and FY2011 would be considered in aggregate, with a reduction in fees in the final year only if the amount collected in the four-year period exceeded the authorized amount. H.R. 2900 would also authorize the appropriation of specific funds. H.R. 2900 would authorize the appropriation of specific sums from FY2009 to FY2012 for postmarket safety information on medical devices. It would also eliminate the provision allowing the Secretary to adjust premarket notification fees annually to reach a target amount. The bills would authorize specific appropriations for postmarket safety information on medical devices and make changes to premarket notification fees. They would reduce fees for small businesses, remove asset considerations for small business qualification, and allow foreign firms to qualify as small businesses. Both bills aim to reduce fees for small businesses, eliminate asset considerations for small business qualification, and allow foreign firms to qualify as small businesses. They also introduce a new refund policy for modular applications withdrawn before final FDA action, with the Secretary having sole authority over refund decisions. Annual reports are required to be filed through FY2012. Both bills introduce a new refund policy for modular applications withdrawn before final FDA action, with the Secretary having sole authority over refund decisions.

Both bills, S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, aim to expand device producer participation by requiring electronic filing for registration. S. 1082 includes a feasibility requirement for electronic information receipt. FDA has approved products for adult use without testing in children, leading to off-label prescribing for younger patients. Off-label prescribing of adult-approved products for children can lead to ineffective treatment or incorrect dosages due to unique side effects in children. Drug effectiveness can vary in children based on factors like organ maturation and development, affecting drug metabolism and usefulness. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies by adding six months to market exclusivity for compliant products. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies by adding six months to market exclusivity for compliant products. It also requires pediatric studies for off-patent products to assess safety and effectiveness, with funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes pediatric studies for off-patent drugs and reauthorizes exclusivity provisions for another five years. It also allows FDA to refer manufacturers who decline pediatric studies to the Foundation for the NIH. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes pediatric studies for off-patent drugs and reauthorizes exclusivity provisions for another five years. It allows FDA to refer manufacturers who decline pediatric studies to the Foundation for the NIH. In 1998, FDA published the Pediatric Rule mandating manufacturers to submit pediatric testing data with new drug applications. In 1998, FDA published the Pediatric Rule mandating pediatric testing data submission with new drug applications. A federal court invalidated the rule in 2002, leading to the enactment of the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA) by Congress. PREA covers drugs and biological products, including provisions for deferrals, waivers, and required pediatric assessments for approved products. The Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA) covers drugs and biological products, with provisions for deferrals, waivers, and required pediatric assessments. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would reauthorize the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) for another five years, encouraging research on off-patent products and strengthening labeling requirements based on pediatric studies. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would reauthorize BPCA for another five years, encouraging research on off-patent products and strengthening labeling requirements based on pediatric studies. A key difference is the period of exclusivity, with S. 1082 proposing a reduction to three months for drugs with over $1 billion in annual gross U.S. sales. Both bills would also expand FDA's authority under PREA. The difference between S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 lies in the period of exclusivity for drugs with over $1 billion in annual gross U.S. sales. While H.R. 2900 maintains the current six-month exclusivity period, S. 1082 proposes to reduce it to three months. Both bills aim to expand FDA's authority under PREA by strengthening standards for pediatric assessments of new drugs and biologics. One key distinction is that H.R. 2900 would eliminate the provision linking PREA's authorities to BPCA. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand FDA's authority under PREA by strengthening standards for pediatric assessments of new drugs and biologics. H.R. 2900 would eliminate the provision tying PREA's authorities to BPCA, while S. 1082 would maintain that connection. Additionally, both bills include legislation to encourage medical device manufacturers to develop pediatric products. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand FDA's authority under PREA by strengthening standards for pediatric assessments of new drugs and biologics. The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 would amend FFDCA by modifying the humanitarian device exemption (HDE) for medical device manufacturers to develop pediatric products. The Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 would amend the FFDCA by modifying the humanitarian device exemption (HDE) for manufacturers developing medical devices for small patient populations. This exemption allows marketing without proving effectiveness, aiming to assist patients with rare diseases. The legislation aims to encourage manufacturers to develop medical devices for small markets, assisting patients with rare diseases. It exempts some manufacturers of pediatric devices for small populations from the general HDE prohibition on selling a device for more than its costs. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 extend the exemption through 2012 and 2013, respectively. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to extend the exemption for manufacturers of pediatric medical devices to sell their products for more than the costs through 2012 and 2013, respectively. Both bills also require funding for research on pediatric medical devices and collaboration between the FDA Commissioner and other agency heads to expand research and development in this area.

They also require funding for research on pediatric medical devices and collaboration between the FDA Commissioner and other agency heads to expand research and development. Additionally, both bills mandate the establishment of a contact point or office to help pediatric medical device developers locate funding and a demonstration project to promote pediatric device development. Both bills, S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, focus on promoting pediatric device development through demonstration projects and grant funding. They require coordination with NIH and FDA, reporting of effectiveness, and annual funding authorization of $6 million for FY2008. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to promote pediatric device development through grants and demonstration projects. They require coordination with NIH and FDA, reporting of effectiveness, and annual funding authorization of $6 million for FY2008. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose authorizing $6 million annually from FY2008 to FY2012 to promote pediatric device development. They expand the focus of the Office of Pediatric Therapeutics and Pediatric Advisory Committee to include pediatric medical devices. The bills also require a plan for pediatric medical device research and development, incorporate postmarket surveillance measures, and expand the Secretary's authority for postmarket studies on class II or III pediatric medical devices. The bills propose expanding pediatric medical device research and development to relevant congressional committees and amending the FFDCA to include postmarket surveillance measures. They would give the Secretary authority to require postmarket studies for pediatric medical devices with safety controls, indicating studies may be necessary for devices used in pediatric populations and may exceed the 36-month limit to assess impact on pediatric populations. H.R. 2900 specifies that postmarket studies may be required for pediatric medical devices with safety controls, exceeding the 36-month limit if needed to assess impact on pediatric populations' growth and development. It also includes a dispute resolution provision for manufacturers to request a review to protect public health. H.R. 2900 includes a dispute resolution provision for manufacturers to request a review to protect public health. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires manufacturers to demonstrate a new drug's safety before FDA approval. The Harris-Kefauver Amendments added product effectiveness requirements in 1962. The manufacturer of a new drug must demonstrate its safety to the FDA for approval. The Harris-Kefauver Amendments in 1962 added effectiveness requirements. The FDA cannot guarantee complete safety of any drug, but assesses if it is safe enough when used correctly. The FDA cannot guarantee complete safety of any drug, but assesses if it is safe enough when used correctly. A rare adverse effect may not occur until a large number of individuals have taken a drug. Researchers have found that some widely used drugs were more dangerous than expected. In recent years, concerns have been raised about the safety of some widely used drugs, leading to questions about industry transparency and FDA's ability to address postmarket safety issues. FDA requested the Institute of Medicine to evaluate its drug safety practices, resulting in a 2006 report. The FDA faced challenges with industry transparency and its ability to address postmarket safety concerns. In response, the Institute of Medicine conducted a 2006 report evaluating the agency's organizational culture, science, regulation, communication, and resources. Consumers, health experts, and Congress sought ways to enhance FDA's actions to protect the public, resulting in proposed legislation such as S. 1082 and H.R. 2900. The 2006 report addressed the FDA's organizational culture, science, regulation, communication, and resources. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose new authorities for the FDA to identify and correct postmarket drug safety issues through public-private partnerships. The proposed bills aim to enhance FDA's postmarket drug safety oversight by establishing new authorities and expanding existing ones. Both Senate and House bills require the Secretary to create public-private partnerships for developing a postmarket risk identification system using electronic databases. FDA currently lacks the authority to mandate postmarket studies after initial approval, but it does recommend conducting them for products on the market. The Senate and House bills propose a strengthened authority and set of procedures to support FDA's postmarket safety activities, including the creation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) and public-private partnerships for developing a postmarket risk identification system using electronic databases. The Senate and House bills propose a strengthened authority and set of procedures to support FDA's postmarket safety activities, including the creation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Both bills would authorize the Secretary to require sponsors to submit a proposed REMS, with the House bill emphasizing pre-approval to ensure the benefits outweigh the risks of the drug. The House and Senate bills propose strengthened FDA authority for postmarket safety activities, including requiring sponsors to submit a proposed REMS. The House bill emphasizes pre-approval to ensure drug benefits outweigh risks, while the Senate bill focuses on signals for REMS determination. The Secretary can require a REMS after a drug is approved based on new safety information. The determination must be based on a serious risk signal and the need to assess or mitigate the risk. This authority covers new indications, generic products, and supplemental applications. All REMS must include certain core elements. Both bills propose that the Secretary can require a REMS for drugs based on serious risk signals to assess or mitigate risks. REMS must include core elements like timeframes, patient instructions, and distribution restrictions. Waivers for certain medical countermeasures are allowed. The REMS proposed by S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would include core elements such as timeframes, patient instructions, and distribution restrictions. Waivers for certain medical countermeasures during public health emergencies are allowed. The Senate bill would also provide access to drugs with REMS for off-label use in serious or life-threatening conditions. The Senate bill would establish a mechanism to ensure access to drugs with REMS for off-label use in serious or life-threatening conditions during public health emergencies. It includes structured follow-through, dispute resolution, and enforcement processes. Reviews of approved REMS would be conducted at specified times, with detailed procedures for review and assessments outlined in both the Senate and House bills. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose adding authority for structured follow-through, dispute resolution, and enforcement for REMS. They require reviews of approved REMS at specified times and establish a Drug Safety Oversight Board to resolve disputes. The bills also mandate evaluations by the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee. Both the Senate and House bills propose establishing a Drug Safety Oversight Board with federal government scientists and health care practitioners to resolve disputes between the Secretary and a product's sponsor.
