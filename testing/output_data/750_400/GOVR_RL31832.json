    "content": "Legislation to rewrite and reauthorize the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) may be considered in the 111th Congress. In the 110th Congress, various bills were introduced addressing penalties, enforcement, diversion of goods, and integration of export control data. The EAA controls sensitive dual-use goods and technologies with civilian and military applications, including those that can contribute to nuclear, biological, and chemical weaponry proliferation. The EAA, which expired in 1989, has been periodically renewed. The Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) provides authority for export controls on sensitive dual-use goods and technologies, including items that can contribute to the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weaponry. The EAA, which expired in 1989, has been periodically reauthorized and the export licensing system created under its authority is currently continued by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), which expired in 1989, has been periodically reauthorized and the export licensing system created under its authority is currently continued by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The EAA is the statutory authority for the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which regulate exports of dual-use commodities, software, computers, and technology by item, country, and recipient. The Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) is the statutory authority for the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in the Department of Commerce. These regulations control exports of dual-use commodities, software, computers, and technology based on item, country, and recipient entity. The EAA focuses on regulating exports of civilian goods and technology with military applications, known as dual-use items. The Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) regulates exports of dual-use items based on item, country, and recipient entity. Some stakeholders advocate for liberalizing U.S. export regulations to enhance American companies' international competitiveness in high-technology sales. The Export Administration Act of 1979 regulates exports of dual-use items, with some stakeholders pushing for liberalization of U.S. export regulations to boost American companies' international competitiveness in high-technology sales. Some Members of Congress and U.S. business representatives advocate for liberalizing export regulations, while others, including national security analysts, argue that some controls should be tightened to address foreign threats to U.S. national security. This report discusses the evolution of the Export Administration Act in the 20th century and its major features. Members and national security analysts believe that the liberalization of export controls in the past decade has increased foreign threats to U.S. national security. They suggest tightening some controls and urge Congress to carefully consider further liberalization. The report discusses the Export Administration Act, its evolution, major features, types of controls, Commerce Control List, export licensing procedures, and issues related to maintaining export controls under IEEPA. It also highlights controlled commodities in export control discussions. Competing business interests are also discussed. The evolution of export controls in the 20th century is discussed, including the types of controls authorized by the Export Administration Act, the Commerce Control List, and export licensing procedures. It also addresses issues related to maintaining export controls under IEEPA and highlights controlled commodities in export control discussions. Competing business and national security perspectives on contentious themes in the export control debate are also examined. The curr_chunk discusses the history of export controls in the U.S., focusing on the evolution of policy after WWII and during the Cold War. It also delves into the impact of export controls on the economy and business, as well as the controllability of technology. Export controls in the U.S. have been a policy element for almost a century. After WWII, a new era of extensive peacetime export control policy began, with a focus on Soviet-Bloc countries during the Cold War. The Export Control Act of 1949 was enacted to address the new security threat, allowing for controls on scarce goods to protect U.S. industry and the economy. The Export Control Act of 1949 (P.L. 81-11) established a peacetime export control system to address security threats. It identified three reasons for imposing export controls: short-supply controls to prevent the export of scarce goods impacting U.S. industry, foreign policy controls to promote U.S. foreign policy, and national security controls to restrict exports for security reasons. The President used foreign policy controls to promote U.S. foreign policy, including regional stability, human rights, anti-terrorism, missile technology, and chemical and biological warfare. National security controls restricted exports of goods and technology that could enhance the military capability of countries threatening U.S. national security. This export control regime was established alongside a multilateral counterpart. The establishment of post-war U.S. export controls aimed to restrict the export of goods and technology that could enhance the military capability of countries posing a threat to national security. A multilateral control regime was also set up with NATO allies to manage the transfer of critical technology and promote technological development. The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) was established in 1949 to manage the transfer of critical technology among NATO allies. The Export Control Act was renewed multiple times without significant changes due to the perceived threat during the U.S.-Soviet era. The Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) was established in 1949 to manage technology transfer among NATO allies. The Export Control Act was renewed several times without major changes until the U.S.-Soviet era of \"detente\" in the late 1960s, leading to a reexamination and revision of the export control system. This period saw political pressure for some liberalization of export controls, culminating in the passage of the Export Administration Act. With the onset of the U.S.-Soviet era of \"detente\" in the late 1960s, a reexamination and revision of the U.S. export control system occurred. The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the Export Control Act of 1949, leading to a shift towards less restrictive export controls. The act was rewritten in 1979 and forms the basis of the current export control system. The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the Export Control Act of 1949, leading to less restrictive export controls. The act was rewritten in 1979 and amended in 1985, with further liberalization in following years. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 marked a shift in the external threat to the United States. The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the Export Control Act of 1949, leading to less restrictive export controls. The act was amended in 1985, following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, which marked a shift in the external threat to the United States. There have been calls to revamp the act to enhance exports, focus on current national security threats, or increase penalties for violations. The George H.W. Bush Administration streamlined the export control system, but calls for revamping the law persist to enhance exports, focus on current security threats, or increase penalties for violations. The dissolution of CoCom in 1994 and its replacement by the Wassenaar Arrangement in 1997 changed the export control environment, with more liberal practices raising questions about the effectiveness of U.S. exports. The dissolution of CoCom in 1994 and its replacement by the Wassenaar Arrangement in 1997 significantly changed the export control environment, leading to questions about the effectiveness of U.S. export controls in achieving national security objectives and the fairness of unilateral controls to American industry. Congress has struggled to agree on measures to reform the Export Administration Act. Congress has been unable to agree on measures to reform the Export Administration Act since the 101st Congress. Export controls were extended through temporary measures and Executive Order No. 12924 in 1994. There are debates on the effectiveness of U.S. export controls in achieving national security objectives and their impact on American industry. Export controls under the Export Administration Act were extended through temporary measures and Executive Order No. 12924 in 1994. There are debates on the effectiveness of U.S. export controls in achieving national security objectives and their impact on American industry. Legislation passed in 2000 extended the EAA. Legislation passed in 2000 extended the Export Administration Act until August 20, 2001, temporarily removing the need to operate the export control system under IEEPA powers. Export control authority has since been operating under IEEPA provisions pursuant to Executive Order 13222 issued on August 17, 2001. Legislation to rewrite the Export Administration Act has been introduced recently. Legislation passed in 2000 extended the Export Administration Act until August 20, 2001, temporarily removing the need to operate the export control system under IEEPA powers. Export control authority has since been operating under IEEPA provisions pursuant to Executive Order 13222 issued on August 17, 2001. Legislation to rewrite the Export Administration Act has been introduced in recent Congresses. In the 104th Congress, the House passed the Omnibus Export Administration Act of 1996 (H.R. 361) on July 16, 1996. In the 104th Congress, the House passed the Omnibus Export Administration Act of 1996 (H.R. 361) on July 16, 1996. Legislation for export control was introduced in subsequent Congresses, but no significant action was taken. In the 106th Congress, the Export Administration Act of 1999 (S. 1712) was introduced by Senator Michael P. Enzi. The Senate Banking Committee unanimously voted to report the legislation to the Senate floor, but action was not taken due to concerns about national security. Export control legislation was reintroduced in the 107th Congress. Senator Michael P. Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 1999 (S. 1712) in the 106th Congress. The Senate Banking Committee unanimously voted to report the legislation to the Senate floor, but action was not taken due to concerns about national security. In the 107th Congress, Senator Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 2001 (S. 149), which was favorably reported for consideration by the Senate. In the 107th Congress, Senator Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 2001 (S. 149), which was favorably reported for consideration by the Senate and passed with amendments. The House International Relations Committee also held hearings on EAA and export controls in 2002. The Export Administration Act of 2001 (S. 149) was debated and passed with amendments by the Senate. The House version, H.R. 2581, was introduced with additional provisions related to oversight of nuclear transfers to North Korea. On July 20, 2001, Representative Benjamin Gilman introduced the House version of the Export Administration Act, H.R. 2581, which included provisions related to oversight of nuclear transfers to North Korea. The House International Relations Committee passed the legislation with 35 amendments on August 1. The House Armed Services Committee further amended H.R. 2581 on March 6, 2002, and reported it out by a vote of 44-6. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence held hearings on the legislation but did not make any changes. The House Armed Services Committee (HASC) and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) received H.R. 2581 through sequential referral. HASC further amended and reported out the legislation by a vote of 44-6. HPSCI held hearings but did not alter it. The Administration supported S. 149 and opposed House attempts to revise it. In the 108th Congress, Representative Dreier introduced EAA legislation (H.R. 55), identical to S. 149, but no action was taken on it. In the 108th Congress, Representative Dreier introduced EAA legislation (H.R. 55), identical to S. 149, but no action was taken on it. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has also been used periodically to attempt to amend the export control regime, with the House version of NDAA 2005 (H.R. 4200) containing provisions related to dual-use export controls. The House version of NDAA 2005 (H.R. 4200) included provisions requiring a license for dual-use goods controlled under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) for technology and items on the Militarily Critical Technology List (MCTL). This was in response to a DOD study noting that some MCTL technologies were not controlled under the EAR or ITAR. The House version of NDAA 2005 included provisions requiring licenses for dual-use goods controlled under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and Militarily Critical Technology List (MCTL) in response to a DOD study. The second provision would have required exporters to obtain licenses for items controlled under EAR or ITAR if the destination had previously exported such items to China. The House NDAA 2005 included provisions for licenses for dual-use goods controlled under EAR and MCTL. Another provision required licenses for items controlled under EAR or ITAR if the destination had previously exported such items to China. The House expressed concern about potential transfer of U.S. goods or technology to China. The House NDAA 2005 included provisions for licenses for dual-use goods controlled under EAR and MCTL. There were concerns about potential transfer of U.S. goods or technology to China, but these provisions were not included in the final conference report signed by the President in October 2004. In the 109th Congress, a bill to revise the Export Administration Act was introduced by Representative Henry Hyde in December 2005. In the 109th Congress, a bill introduced by Representative Henry Hyde aimed to revise and extend the Export Administration Act, focusing on penalties, enforcement, and U.S. relations with multilateral control regimes. The bill did not represent a comprehensive overhaul of the 1979 EAA but included targeted changes that all sides could support. It also proposed a two-year extension of the expired EAA from the date of enactment. The 109th Congress bill aimed to revise the Export Administration Act, focusing on penalties, enforcement, and U.S. relations with multilateral control regimes. It included targeted changes and proposed a two-year extension of the expired EAA. Legislation in the 110th Congress sought to amend enforcement and penalty structures of the Act. Legislation introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to amend enforcement and penalty structures of the Export Administration Act. Bills were proposed to integrate export control information into electronic filing systems and target countries of diversion concern. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to amend enforcement and penalty structures of the Export Administration Act, integrate export control information into electronic filing systems, and target countries of diversion concern. H.R. 6828 also required an investigation of BIS' validated end-user program. The GAO is set to investigate BIS' validated end-user program. Legislation in the 110th Congress, including S. 3445 / H.R. 7112, aimed to amend export control laws. H.R. 7112 was passed in the House in 2008. In 2009, Rep. Sherman introduced the Export Control Improvements Act (H.R. 3515) with provisions on export controls. On August 1, 2008, H.R. 7112 was introduced and passed in the House under suspension of the rules. In July 31, 2009, Rep. Sherman introduced the Export Control Improvements Act (H.R. 3515) with provisions on export controls enforcement and diversion control. The title on export enforcement does not amend the enforcement section of the expired EAA. The draft legislation introduced on export controls enforcement grants additional authority for Export Administration Regulations under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. The draft legislation introduced grants additional enforcement authority for Export Administration Regulations under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, allowing for investigations, search, detention, and seizure of goods by the Department of Commerce in the United States and abroad. The bill grants additional enforcement authority for Export Administration Regulations under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, allowing for investigations, search, detention, and seizure of goods by the Department of Commerce in the United States and abroad. It also authorizes search, detention, and seizures at U.S. ports of entry or exit and overseas with the concurrence of the Secretary of Homeland Security. Additionally, the Secretary of Commerce is directed to publish and update best practices guidelines for effective export control compliance programs, and the bill includes new language governing the use of funds for undercover investigations and operations. Title 1 of H.R. 3515 aims to streamline licensing requirements, embargoes, and data collection rules for exporters and shippers into the Automated Export System. It also includes provisions for confidentiality, undercover investigations, and audit/reporting requirements. Title 1 of H.R. 3515 aims to integrate licensing requirements, embargoes, and data collection rules for exporters and shippers into the Automated Export System. It includes provisions for undercover investigations, audit/reporting requirements, and programming the AES to prevent improper shipments by notifying filers of export control issues. The Export Declaration (SED) is required by Customs for export clearance. The AES is programmed to include export control data and notify filers of potential export control issues to prevent improper shipments. Concerns about evasion of U.S. export controls through transhipment hubs have been raised, with instances of sensitive goods being diverted to unauthorized destinations. The issue of evasion of U.S. export controls through transhipment hubs, particularly in the United Arab Emirates, first surfaced in 2006 with reports of sensitive goods being diverted to Iran for military use in Iraq. This led to licensing requirements on certain entities and raised concerns about the UAE's export control regime. In response, the BIS proposed creating a new 'Country Category C' to address these issues. The revelation of evasion of U.S. export controls through transhipment hubs, particularly in the UAE, led to licensing requirements on certain entities. The BIS proposed a 'Country Category C' for countries of diversion concern, but no country was designated as Category C. H.R. 3515 would legislate the 'Category C' concept for diversion concerns. H.R. 3515 proposes a 'Category C' concept for countries of diversion concern regarding items subject to the EAR to Iran. The President must identify countries of concern within 180 days, designating them as possible or definite diversion concerns. The bill proposes a 'Category C' concept for countries of diversion concern regarding items subject to the EAR to Iran. Countries must be identified within 180 days and designated as possible or definite diversion concerns. If a country does not cooperate or improve its export control system within 12 months, it will be designated as a Destination of Diversion Concern. The bill would require the Administration to initiate government-to-government contacts to strengthen a country's export control system. Failure to cooperate within 12 months would result in designation as a Destination of Diversion Concern, with additional licensing requirements and stricter reviews. The government's involvement in transhipments, reexportations, or diversions would lead to a country being listed as a diversion concern, triggering additional licensing requirements and stricter reviews. The legislation also includes a provision for an annual report on transfers of dual-use U.S. technology to concerning countries and entities. President Obama initiated a review of the U.S. export control system in 2009. The legislation includes a provision for an annual report on transfers of significant dual-use U.S. technology to concerning countries and entities. President Obama initiated a review of the U.S. export control system in 2009, with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates announcing key elements of the reform agenda in 2010. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates announced key elements of the administration's agenda for reform of the export control system in a speech on April 20, 2010. The proposed 4-pronged approach includes creating a single export control licensing agency, adopting a unified control list, establishing a single integrated information technology system, and creating a database of sanctioned and denied parties. Secretary Gates proposed a 4-pronged approach to reform the export control system, including creating a single licensing agency, adopting a unified control list, establishing an integrated IT system with a database of sanctioned parties, and setting up a single enforcement coordination agency. The changes would be implemented in three phases, with legislative action required for the final phase. The administration's blueprint aims to reform the export control system by harmonizing the Commerce Control List with the U.S. Munitions List, creating a tiered control structure, standardizing licensing processes, and establishing an \"Enforcement Fusion Center.\" The changes would be implemented in three phases, with the final phase requiring legislative action. The administration's blueprint aims to reform the export control system by harmonizing the Commerce Control List with the U.S. Munitions List, creating a tiered control structure, standardizing licensing processes, and establishing an \"Enforcement Fusion Center.\" Phase II would implement a harmonized licensing system with two identically structured tiered control lists, aiming to achieve a significant reduction in license requirements. Phase II of the export control system reform would implement a harmonized licensing system with two identically structured tiered control lists, aiming to significantly reduce license requirements. Certain items may be moved from the munitions list to the dual-use list, unilateral controls on some items would be reviewed, and consultations with multilateral control regimes partners would take place to adjust controls on certain items. The new export control system would debut in Phase III. In Phase III of the export control system reform, items would be moved from the munitions list to the dual-use list, requiring congressional notification. Unilateral controls on certain items would be examined, and consultations with multilateral control regimes partners would occur to adjust controls. The proposal includes establishing a single licensing agency, merging harmonized control lists, consolidating enforcement activities under a Primary Enforcement Coordination Agency, and implementing a single IT system for licensing and enforcement. Secretary Gates predicted the 3-phase reform in his speech. In Phase III of the export control system reform, a single licensing agency would be established, control lists would be merged, enforcement activities would be consolidated under a Primary Enforcement Coordination Agency, and a single IT system for licensing and enforcement would be operational. Secretary Gates predicted the 3-phase plan will unfold over the next year, but many questions remain unanswered. Some proposals would require legislative action. The 3-phase plan for export control system reform, outlined by Secretary Gates, is expected to unfold over the next year. Some proposals may require legislative action, particularly in Phase II which involves changes to the structure of control lists. Multilateral consultations would also be necessary for changes to the CCL and USML, derived from the Wassenaar Dual-Use List and Munitions List. Changes to the structure of the control lists in Phase II of the export control system reform may require legislative consent and multilateral consultations. The placement of the proposed licensing agency within existing departments or as an independent entity is still undetermined. The proposed licensing agency for export controls is still undetermined, with options to place it within existing departments or as an independent entity. Common principles in efforts to renew legislation include types of export controls, licensing procedures, review process, and enforcement procedures. The EAA renewal efforts focus on export control provisions, including types of controls, licensing procedures, review process, and enforcement procedures. Dual-use export controls have been in place since the 1949 Act, restricting items based on national security, foreign policy, and domestic economic impact. Items on the Commerce Control List (CCL) are categorized based on these criteria. The 1949 Act established U.S. dual-use export controls based on national security, foreign policy, and domestic economic impact. Items on the Commerce Control List (CCL) are controlled for national security and foreign policy reasons, with different standards determining licensing policies. The 1979 Act further restricted exports of goods or technology. The 1979 Act expanded export controls to restrict goods or technology that could enhance military capabilities of other countries, impacting national security. Items on the Commerce Control List (CCL) are controlled for national security and foreign policy reasons, with different standards determining licensing policies. National security control items fall under the National Security licensing requirement of the Export Administration Regulations. The Export Administration Regulations control the export of goods or technology that could enhance military capabilities of other countries, impacting national security. National security control items are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and are approved if they are determined to be destined for civilian use or would not significantly contribute to the military potential of the country of destination. The Export Administration Regulations control the export of goods or technology that could enhance military capabilities of other countries for national security purposes. Licenses for controlled items are reviewed case-by-case and approved if destined for civilian use or not significantly contributing to the military potential of the destination country. The Secretary of Defense identifies goods and technology for control, periodically reviewing and revising the list, including the Military Critical Technology List (MCTL). The Secretary of Defense and other agencies identify goods and technology for national security control. The Military Critical Technology List is maintained for this purpose, consistent with the Wassenaar Arrangement. U.S. controls do not cover items related to nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile proliferation, or countries under anti-terrorism controls. The Military Critical Technology List (MCTL) is a national security control list that aligns with the Wassenaar Arrangement. U.S. national security controls exclude items related to nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile proliferation, as well as countries under anti-terrorism controls. Items controlled for national security reasons undergo a foreign availability assessment to determine if they are readily accessible from sources outside the United States. Items controlled for national security reasons undergo a foreign availability assessment to determine if they are readily accessible from sources outside the United States, in alignment with anti-terrorism controls and foreign policy purposes. The Secretary, in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense and other relevant agencies, continuously evaluates the foreign availability status of items subject to export control for national security reasons under the 1979 Act. The 1979 Act charges the Secretary, along with the Secretary of Defense and other agencies, to assess whether items under export control for national security reasons are readily available from foreign sources. Requests for foreign availability determinations can be made by license applicants or initiated by the Secretary. If a determination is made, the item must be decontrolled, unless the President determines it would harm national security. The Export Administration Act (EAA) allows for foreign availability determinations to be requested by a license applicant or initiated by the Secretary. If the Secretary determines foreign availability, the item must be decontrolled, unless the President decides it would harm national security. The President can then negotiate with control partners to eliminate the availability. The EAA also established an Office of Foreign Availability to assist in making determinations and reporting to Congress on operations and improvements. The Export Administration Act allows for foreign availability determinations to be requested by a license applicant or initiated by the Secretary. If the Secretary determines foreign availability, the item must be decontrolled, unless the President decides it would harm national security. The President can then negotiate with control partners to eliminate the availability. The bill also created an Office of Foreign Availability to gather data for the Secretary to make foreign availability determinations and report to Congress on operations and improvements. The Office of Technology Evaluation now conducts foreign availability determinations, and the Emerging Technology and Research Advisory Committee was created in September 2008. The Office of Foreign Availability no longer exists. The Office of Technology Evaluation now conducts foreign availability determinations. The Emerging Technology and Research Advisory Committee was created in September 2008 to assist in determining technologies for the control list and streamlining the CCL. The Emerging Technology and Research Advisory Committee was created to involve university experts in determining technologies for the control list and streamlining the Commerce Control List (CCL). BIS conducted a systemic review of the CCL in 2007-8 and plans to review 1/3 of the list each year. On May 22, 2009, BIS issued a final rule lifting certain licensing requirements on uncooled thermal imaging cameras to 36 U.S. allied countries. On May 22, 2009, BIS issued a final rule lifting licensing requirements on uncooled thermal imaging cameras to 36 U.S. allied countries. The rule decontrolled low to mid-market night vision cameras not incorporated into military commodities and tightened controls on higher-end thermal imaging cameras. The rule tightened export controls on mid-market night vision cameras not incorporated into military commodities and higher-end thermal imaging cameras. Exporters must report transactions to BIS semi-annually. Concerns remain about the time taken to resolve issues with BIS engagement. The rule tightened export controls on mid-market night vision cameras not incorporated into military commodities. Exporters must report transactions to BIS semi-annually. Concerns remain about the time taken to resolve issues with BIS engagement, with some expressing frustration over the lengthy process. The concept of mass market status was proposed in EAA legislation introduced in the 106th and 107th Congress, highlighting the need for more efficient mechanisms to address foreign availability concerns. The concept of mass market status was proposed in EAA legislation introduced in the 106th and 107th Congress, defining it as applying to items produced or made available for sale in large volume or to multiple buyers. Neither the 1979 EAA nor current regulations provide for decontrol of items based on mass market criterion. The EAA legislation introduced in the 106th and 107th Congress proposed mass market status for items produced or made available in large volume. Criteria for mass market status included distribution manner, conduciveness to commercial shipping, and usefulness without modification. This feature was controversial and seen as a stumbling block in negotiations over the bill. The EAA legislation introduced in the 106th and 107th Congress proposed mass market status for items based on distribution manner, commercial shipping conduciveness, and usefulness without modification. This feature was controversial and seen as a stumbling block in negotiations over the bill due to concerns about wholesale decontrol of sensitive items. The EAA authorizes the President to control exports for promoting foreign policy objectives, complying with international obligations, or deterring and punishing terrorism. The EAA authorizes the President to control exports for promoting foreign policy objectives, complying with international obligations, or deterring and punishing terrorism. Foreign policy controls are in place for various purposes including anti-terrorism, regional stability, crime control, United Nations sanctions, unilateral embargoes, non-proliferation agreements for chemical, biological, nuclear weapons, and missile technology. Foreign policy controls must be renewed yearly. The Export Administration Act (EAA) imposes limitations on foreign policy controls, requiring annual renewal and clear objectives to be reported to Congress. It mandates negotiations to eliminate foreign availability of controlled items, compliance with international obligations, and treaty enforcement. The Export Administration Act (EAA) mandates annual renewal with clear objectives reported to Congress. It directs negotiations to eliminate foreign availability of controlled items, compliance with international obligations, and treaty enforcement. Additionally, a license is required for exporting certain items to countries supporting international terrorism. Foreign policy controls do not apply to sales of medicine, medical supplies, food donations, seeds, and water resource equipment for basic human needs. The Export Administration Act mandates annual renewal with clear objectives reported to Congress, including negotiations to eliminate foreign availability of controlled items and treaty enforcement. A license is required for exporting certain items to countries supporting international terrorism. Foreign policy controls do not apply to sales of medicine, medical supplies, food donations, seeds, and water resource equipment for basic human needs. Controls on sales of agricultural products and medicines have been further amended by the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. End-use or end-user controls are also administered as foreign policy controls. Controls on sales of agricultural products and medicines have been amended by the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Catch-all controls require a license for export of any item if it will be used for nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological purposes. Under the Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative (EPCI) of 1991, catch-all controls in Part 744 of the EAR require a license for export of any item if it will be used for nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological proliferation activities. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains an end-user list of entities subject to EPCI. Certain entities in Russia, China, Pakistan, India, Israel, and designated foreign terrorist organizations face a presumption of denial for licenses. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains an end-user list of entities requiring licenses subject to EPCI. Current regulations prescribe a presumption of denial for licenses to certain entities in Russia, China, Pakistan, India, and Israel and to foreign terrorist organizations as designated by the Secretary of State. The 1979 EAA authorized restriction on the export of goods and technology to protect domestic industry from shortages of scarce materials and the potential inflationary impact of foreign demand. Few short-supply controls remain in force. The 1979 EAA authorized restrictions on exports to protect domestic industry from shortages of scarce materials and inflationary impacts. Short-supply controls include crude oil, petroleum derivatives, unprocessed western red cedar, and horse exports by sea. The EAA legislation in the 107th Congress did not include short-supply control authority. The Bureau of Industry and Security administers the license application process, reviewing 21,213 applications worth $72.1 billion in FY2008. The Bureau of Industry and Security administers the license application process, reviewing 21,213 applications worth $72.1 billion in FY2008. BIS approved 84% of applications, denied 1.0%, and returned 15%. Dual-use technology licenses were valued at $21.9 billion, representing 1.7% of total U.S. exports in FY2008. In FY2008, the Bureau of Industry and Security reviewed license applications worth $72.1 billion, including $50.2 billion for crude oil exports in exchange for refined petroleum. Dual-use technology licenses accounted for $21.9 billion, 1.7% of total U.S. exports. China received the most controlled goods with 1,990 licenses approved worth $2.7 billion. In FY2008, applications for licenses were referred to other government agencies for evaluation, extending the review process. The average processing time for referred license applications was 27 days, down from 28 days in FY2007. China was the largest destination for controlled goods with 1,990 licenses approved worth $2.7 billion. Chemical manufacturing facilities and equipment had the greatest number of approved license applications in FY2008, totaling 2,212 applications valued at $294 million. The 1979 EAA directed the Secretary of Commerce to create a control list. The 1979 EAA directed the Secretary of Commerce to create a control list known as the Commerce Control List (CCL), which includes items controlled for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply purposes. The CCL incorporates the control lists of multilateral non-proliferation regimes. The Commerce Control List (CCL) is a list of specific goods, technology, and software controlled by the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply purposes. It includes ten categories such as nuclear materials, electronics, computers, telecommunications, and marine items. The Commerce Control List (CCL) is a list of specific goods, technology, and software controlled by the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). It consists of ten categories including nuclear materials, electronics, computers, telecommunications, and marine items. Each category is further divided into functional groups like equipment, materials, software, and technology, with each controlled item having an export control classification number (ECCN). The Commerce Control List (CCL) categorizes controlled items into sensors, navigation and avionics, marine, and propulsion systems. Each item is assigned an export control classification number (ECCN) based on functional groups like equipment, materials, software, and technology. Currently, there are around 500 ECCN listings, and nearly all U.S.-origin commodities are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Currently, there are about 500 ECCN listings on the Commerce Control List (CCL). U.S.-origin commodities are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), meaning they may be restricted based on end-use or end-user. Items on the CCL may be eligible for license exceptions, allowing exports without prior approval. A commodity may be restricted based on end-use or end-user, even if not on the CCL. Items on the CCL can be exported without prior approval but may require a license for high-risk or controversial products. Commodity jurisdiction (CJ) determines export restrictions. Exporters need prior approval for certain exports, which come with due diligence and record-keeping requirements. Some products may require a license even when shipped to a friendly nation due to the risk of diversion or controversial nature. Commodity jurisdiction (CJ) determines if a product is dual-use or a munition, with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls making the classification. Some exporters prefer dual-use classification for less restrictive controls. The Commodity Jurisdiction (CJ) process determines whether a product is considered dual-use or a munition, dictating the regulatory regime. Exporters may seek a dual-use classification to avoid stricter controls, submitting their product for a BIS commodity classification if it doesn't match an existing listing on the Commerce Control List (CCL). This classification request signifies the exporter's belief that the item falls under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) jurisdiction. Exporters can request a BIS commodity classification for dual-use goods that do not match an existing CCL listing. BIS must refer these requests to State and Defense under certain criteria, but this process has been criticized for low referral numbers and lack of clear criteria. BIS is required to refer commodity classification requests to State and Defense under certain criteria, but this process has been criticized for low referral numbers and lack of clear criteria. In 2005, out of 5,370 requests processed, only 10 were referred to State and Defense, and renewed referral criteria had not been developed. In 2008, GAO highlighted jurisdictional disagreements and coordination problems between State and Defense due to minimal coordination and differing interpretations of regulations. Despite recommendations, the departments have not resolved these disputes or improved coordination processes. The jurisdictional disputes and coordination problems between State and Defense departments are often due to minimal coordination and differing interpretations of regulations. Despite recommendations, these issues have not been resolved, leading to exporters determining restrictions and governmental review processes. The EAA and EAR establish policies for license application reviews and dispute resolution procedures. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the EAA establish policies and procedures for reviewing license applications and resolving interagency disputes. Executive Order 12981 grants the Secretary of Commerce the authority to review and determine the disposition of export licenses, with other departments also having review authority. The procedures for resolving interagency disputes regarding export licenses were established by Executive Order 12981. The Secretary of Commerce has the power to review and determine the disposition of licenses, with other agencies also having review authority. Agencies may waive their right to review certain license applications, and the Secretary must seek additional information within nine days of application registration. The Secretary of Commerce has the authority to review and determine the outcome of export licenses, with other agencies also having review authority. Agencies may waive their review rights for certain applications. Within nine days of application registration, the Secretary must seek additional information, refer the application to other agencies, ensure correct security classification, return unnecessary applications, grant or deny the application. If another agency reviews the application, they must request additional information within 10 days. The reviewing agency must request any additional information from the Secretary within 10 days. After reviewing the file, the agency must recommend approval or denial within 30 days, providing justification for a denial. Failure to provide a recommendation within 30 days results in the agency being deemed to have waived its review rights. The agency must recommend approval or denial of the application within 30 days of receipt, providing justification for a denial. Failure to provide a recommendation within 30 days results in the agency being deemed to have no objection. The license application is subject to actions that can pause the process. A three-level interagency dispute resolution mechanism was created in 1995, with the Export Administration Review Board at the top tier. The Export Administration Review Board (EARB) is the top tier of a three-level interagency dispute resolution mechanism created in 1995. It consists of the Secretary, Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy, with non-voting members like the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of Central Intelligence. Other agency heads may also participate as needed. The Export Administration Review Board (EARB) was created in 1995 and consists of the Secretary, Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy, with non-voting members like the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of Central Intelligence. The Board may invite other agency heads to participate. Under the EARB is the Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP), chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration, with relevant assistant Secretaries and officials from represented agencies. The Operating Committee (OC) of the ACEP is the third tier with representatives from agencies. The Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP) is chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration and consists of relevant assistant Secretaries and officials from represented agencies. The Operating Committee (OC) of the ACEP, made up of representatives from the listed departments, is where the dispute resolution process begins. The Chair, selected by the Secretary of Commerce, reviews recommendations and informs the examining departments of the decision within 14 days. The Chair of the Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP) is selected by the Secretary of Commerce and serves as the Executive Secretary. The dispute resolution process starts with the Operating Committee (OC), and the Chair informs departments of decisions within 14 days. Departments can appeal to the ACEP within five days, and a decision is made within 11 days of the appeal. The appeal process for agency recommendations involves appealing to the ACEP within five days, with a decision made within 11 days. If a department head disagrees with the ACEP decision, they can appeal to the Secretary within five days, and the EARB must decide within 11 days. Further appeals can be made to the President within five days. The interagency appeal process for agency recommendations involves appealing to the ACEP within five days, with a decision made within 11 days. A department head of a dissenting agency may appeal to the Secretary within five days, and the EARB must decide on the application within 11 days. Further appeals can be made to the President within five days. The process must be completed within 90 days of the application registration, but there is no set time frame for Presidential consideration of a license decision. BIS's denial of an export license must be supported by specific considerations and modifications. The interagency appeal process for export license decisions must be completed within 90 days of application registration. BIS's denial of a license must be supported by specific considerations and modifications, with an explicit appeal procedure outlined in the EAR. One possible basis for appeal is foreign availability assessment. In FY2008, BIS reported that 422 cases were escalated to the OC, and a further 20 were examined by the ACEP. President George H.W. Bush extended export regulations by executive order when the 1979 EAA expired in September 1990. In FY2008, BIS reported 422 cases escalated to the OC and 20 examined by the ACEP. President George H.W. Bush extended export regulations by executive order when the 1979 EAA expired in September 1990, invoking emergency authority under IEEPA. President Clinton reimposed controls under IEEPA in 1994 after two temporary EAA extensions. A major restructuring of export control regulations was published in 1996. President Clinton extended the authority of the 1979 Act until August 20, 2001, and emergency controls were renewed by President George W. Bush. Deficiencies in maintaining export controls under IEEPA authority were noted, including the lapse of enforcement agents' police power with the EAA. President Clinton extended the authority of the 1979 Act until August 20, 2001, and emergency controls were renewed by President George W. Bush. However, deficiencies in maintaining export controls under IEEPA authority were noted, including the need for enforcement agents to obtain Special Deputy U.S. Marshal status. Under IEEPA, enforcement agents must obtain Special Deputy U.S. Marshal status to function as law enforcement officers, consuming limited resources better used on enforcement. IEEPA does not allow the President to limit federal court jurisdiction or extend the EAA's denial of judicial review. It also lacks a confidentiality provision for protecting information on export license applications and enforcement. Additionally, IEEPA does not authorize the executive to discourage compliance with foreign boycotts. The IEEPA does not permit the extension of the EAA's denial of judicial review. It also lacks a confidentiality provision for protecting information on export license applications and enforcement. Additionally, the executive is not authorized to discourage compliance with foreign boycotts. Critics argue that the US sends the wrong message by not enacting appropriate legislation, despite urging other countries to strengthen their export control laws. The United States has been criticized for not enacting appropriate legislation to discourage compliance with foreign boycotts against friendly countries. Critics argue that this diminishes U.S. credibility, despite urging other countries to strengthen their export control laws. The International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act (P.L. 110-96) was signed by President Bush on October 16, 2007. The International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act (P.L. 110-96), signed by President Bush on October 16, 2007, increased criminal penalties to $1 million or up to 20 years' imprisonment for natural persons, and raised civil penalties to $250,000. The International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act, signed by President Bush on October 16, 2007, raised criminal penalties to $1 million or up to 20 years' imprisonment for natural persons, and civil penalties to $250,000. The act also imposed equivalent penalties under the EAA for violations involving national security controls. The International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act, signed by President Bush on October 16, 2007, raised criminal penalties to $1 million or up to 20 years' imprisonment for individuals and civil penalties to $250,000 for violations involving national security controls. Controversial exports have included telecommunications, advanced electronic equipment, precision machine tools, guidance technology, aerospace technology, synthetic materials, and specialized manufacturing equipment. The curr_chunk discusses technologically advanced goods and technologies, including high-performance computers capable of complex digital operations. It also mentions specialized manufacturing and testing equipment used in aerospace and jet engine technology, synthetic materials, and more. Congressional attention has recently focused on these advancements. The curr_chunk focuses on high-performance computers (HPCs) capable of complex digital operations. HPCs encompass a range of technologies including supercomputers, workstations, mainframes, microprocessors, and software. Performance is measured in millions of theoretical operations per second (MTOPS), with actual performance varying based on the operations performed. The benchmark for gauging HPC computing performance was previously measured in MTOPS, but a new standard called adjusted peak performance (APP) was approved in 2005. This new standard calculates computing power based on the adjusted peak rate at which digital computers perform. The Wassenaar Arrangement approved a new standard for calculating computing power in 2005, known as adjusted peak performance (APP) measured in weighted teraflops (WT). The control level is set at 0.75 WT, controlling high-end proprietary HPCs used for advanced research and development. The control level for computing power is set at 0.75 WT, replacing the previous benchmark level. Restrictions on U.S. exports have been in place since the advent of HPC technology. The control level for computing power is set at 0.75 WT, replacing the previous benchmark level of 190,000 MTOPS from January 2002. Export restrictions on HPCs have been in place since the technology's inception, but some argue that due to rapid advancements and foreign availability of comparable models, these restrictions are impractical. During the Clinton and Bush Administrations, HPC export thresholds were raised multiple times, with the last change in January 2002 increasing the threshold for exports to Tier 3 countries to 190,000 MTOPS. This decontrol process significantly impacted BIS regulations. The MTOPS level for HPC exports was last changed in January 2002 by the Bush Administration, raising the threshold to 190,000 MTOPS for exports to Tier 3 countries. This decontrol process had a significant regulatory impact on BIS, reducing the number of license applications for computer assemblies and hardware. Despite the switch to the WT metric, changes in control levels still require notification under Title XII (B) of Division A of the National Defense. In 1993, there were over 11,000 license applications for computer assemblies and hardware, which dropped to 14 in 2003. Despite the switch to the WT metric, changes in control levels still require notification under Title XII (B) of Division A of the National Defense Authorization Act of 1998. The National Defense Authorization Act of 1998 imposed special conditions on the export of high performance computers, requiring prior notification for exports above the MTOPS threshold to Tier III countries. Approval from multiple Secretaries is needed for these exports, along with post-shipment verification and notification to Congress of any MTOPS threshold adjustments. The National Defense Authorization Act of 1998 imposed special conditions on the export of high performance computers above the MTOPS threshold to Tier III countries. Approval from multiple Secretaries is required, along with post-shipment verification and notification to Congress of any threshold adjustments. Encryption is essential for secure electronic message transfer in e-commerce. Encryption is crucial for secure electronic message transfer in e-commerce. An adjustment in MTOPS threshold levels was made in the 107th Congress to repeal NDAA98 provisions. Encryption technology's civilian importance led to control authority transfer from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce in 1996. This technology is central to cryptography and could impact military code-breaking capabilities. The transfer of control authority of encryption technology from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce in 1996 has led to the decontrol of retail encryption products and technology, allowing for export to western countries and non-governmental end-users in other countries. Since 1996, there have been multiple decontrols of encryption items and technology, leading to the progressive decontrol of retail encryption technology. Retail encryption products can now be exported to western countries and non-governmental end-users in other countries through a license exemption. Licenses are still required for countries covered by anti-terrorism controls. Stealth technology incorporates materials, shapes, and structures to protect against electronic detection, falling into two categories. Stealth technology uses materials, shapes, and structures to protect against electronic detection. It can deflect radar signals or absorb them to prevent detection. Export controls are strict due to the sensitivity of stealth-related commodities. Certain stealth materials can deflect or absorb radar signals to prevent detection. Export controls are strict due to the sensitivity of stealth-related commodities, with concerns over potential dissemination and U.S. leadership in this technology. The Department of State reclassified certain stealth-related technology as munitions in the 1990s due to concerns over potential export. Congress has debated the effectiveness of controlling exports of commercial communications satellites and monitoring foreign launch operations to prevent disclosures of missile secrets. In 1998, the Cox Committee found that U.S. satellite manufacturers transferred missile design information and skills to China improperly. In 1998, the Cox Committee found that U.S. satellite manufacturers provided missile design information and skills to China through improper transfer of launch failure analysis. Congress debated how strictly to control exports of commercial communications satellites and the effectiveness of monitoring foreign launch operations to prevent disclosures of missile secrets. Exports of satellites were licensed by the Department of Commerce from late 1996 until March 1999, when authority was returned to the Department of State. The Department of Commerce licensed exports of satellites until March 1999 when authority was transferred to the Department of State. The satellite industry claims that this transfer has caused licensing delays and lost sales, leading to lobbying efforts to reverse export controls to Commerce. Commercial communication satellites may contain sensitive technology like positioning thrusters and signal encryption. The satellite industry has lobbied to reverse export controls to Commerce due to licensing delays and lost sales from regulatory uncertainty. Commercial communication satellites may contain sensitive technology controlled under the U.S. Munitions List. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11 contained a provision for transferring commercial satellite technology. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11 (H.R. 2410) allows for the transfer of commercial satellite technology from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List with congressional approval. This includes manufacturing technology for missiles, aircraft engines, and arms. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11 allows for the transfer of commercial satellite technology from the USML to the CCL with congressional approval. This includes manufacturing technology for missiles, aircraft engines, and arms, which is becoming more sophisticated with advanced computer software and circuitry. The industry has expressed concerns about the lack of multilateral controls over sales of this equipment, particularly regarding China. The industry has raised concerns about the lack of multilateral controls over sales of advanced technology, especially regarding China. A technology assessment recommended decontrolling certain products to China and Taiwan. \"Hot section\" technology is crucial for jet aircraft development and production. A technology assessment recommended decontrolling certain 5-axis simultaneously controlled machine tools to China and Taiwan, as they are crucial for jet aircraft development and production. The U.S. Munitions List controls technology developed by the Department of Defense, while technology in commercial aircraft is regulated by the Department of Commerce. Concerns were raised in Congress about decontrolling sensitive technologies in the civilian aviation industry. The civilian aviation industry has raised concerns about the possible decontrol of sensitive technologies, seeking a \"carve-out\" to prevent certain items from being decontrolled. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls has been asserting jurisdiction over civilian aircraft parts, causing worry among industry stakeholders. Section 17(c) of the EAA addresses the export of standard equipment certified by the FAA in civil aircraft to non-controlled countries. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls has been asserting jurisdiction over civilian aircraft parts and components, including a non-FAA component in the aftermath of the QRS-11 case. This is causing concern in the civilian aviation industry, which is seeking a \"carve-out\" to prevent decontrol of sensitive technologies. In response to concerns over DDTC asserting jurisdiction over civilian aircraft parts, legislation (H.R. 3633) was introduced to clarify that civil aircraft equipment, parts, components, or technology eligible for export from a country other than a controlled country shall be subject to export controls exclusively under this act. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) clarified the interpretation of Section 17(c) of the Export Administration Act (EAA), stating that civil aircraft parts and components are under Commerce jurisdiction. This came after concerns were raised about the jurisdiction of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) over civilian aircraft parts. Representative Manzullo introduced legislation (H.R. 3633) to ensure that civil aircraft equipment eligible for export airworthiness approval falls under the EAA controls. The DDTC released a new rule clarifying that Commerce will have jurisdiction over parts and components of civil aircraft that are standard equipment and not considered significant military equipment under the EAA. This eliminates the need for suppliers to submit these parts for approval. The new rule clarifies that Commerce will have jurisdiction over standard parts and components of civil aircraft, eliminating the need for suppliers to seek approval for these items. Export of technology and know-how to foreign nationals within the U.S. is regulated by the Export Administration Regulations. Exports of technology, know-how, and non-encryption source code to foreign nationals within the U.S. are regulated by the Export Administration Regulations. A license is required for a U.S. entity to transfer technology to a foreign national in the U.S. if the same transfer to the foreign national's home country would require a license. Deemed exports were not mentioned in the 1979 EAA, but House versions of EAA in the 107th Congress aimed to define deemed exports as falling under the act's jurisdiction. In response to the need for a U.S. entity to obtain a license to transfer technology to a foreign national in the United States, deemed export licenses have become a significant part of BIS activity. In FY2007, BIS reviewed 1,056 deemed export licenses, with nearly 57% of them being for Chinese nationals. In FY2007, BIS reviewed 1,056 deemed export licenses, with nearly 57% for Chinese nationals. BIS established a rule-making procedure in response to an Inspector General's report to alter the standard governing foreign nationals subject to export controls based on country of birth. In response to an Inspector General's report, BIS established a rule-making procedure to change the standard for foreign nationals subject to export controls from country of citizenship or permanent residency to country of birth. Foreign nationals from controlled destinations could exploit loopholes by establishing permanent residency in a third country. Under Secretary of Commerce David McCormick announced this change in December 2005. In December 2007, BIS released the report of the Deemed Export Advisory Commission (DEAC), which assessed the deemed export regulatory regime based on country of citizenship or permanent residency, not place of birth. In December 2007, BIS released the report of the Deemed Export Advisory Commission (DEAC), recommending a \"trusted entity\" program for academia and industrial entities to streamline deemed export applications. The program would evaluate an applicant's probable loyalties based on various factors including country of birth and current citizenship. The Commission recommended a \"trusted entity\" program for academia and industrial entities to qualify for a streamlined deemed export application process. This program would evaluate an applicant's probable loyalties based on factors such as country of birth, prior country of residence, and current citizenship. Additionally, the Commission suggested streamlining terminology in the deemed export regulations and establishing an outside panel of experts for an annual review of technologies on the Commerce Control List. The Commission recommended evaluating eligibility for a deemed export license based on factors like country of birth, prior residence, and current citizenship. Industry criticized the recommendations as unmanageable for the government and difficult for compliance. BIS sought feedback on the scope of technologies on the Commerce Control List in May 2008. The DEAC recommendations on the Commerce Control List faced criticism from industry and research community for being unadministerable for the government and difficult for industry to comply with. BIS sought feedback on deemed export controls and criteria for assessing country affiliation for foreign nationals in May 2008. The Emerging Technologies and Research Advisory Committee (ETRAC) has started addressing these issues. The DEAC recommendations on the Commerce Control List faced industry and research community criticism for being unadministerable and difficult to comply with. BIS sought feedback on deemed export controls and criteria for assessing country affiliation for foreign nationals. The Emerging Technologies and Research Advisory Committee (ETRAC) has begun addressing these issues, focusing on the tension between commercial and national security concerns in export administration legislation debates. The tension between commercial and national security concerns in export administration legislation debates is a principal theme. Reform of the current export control system is favored by many for business competitiveness in the global marketplace, while others prioritize national security. Many support reform of export controls for business competitiveness, while others prioritize national security by focusing on controlling exports to potential threats like terrorists and violators of human rights. Controversies arise over technology control and the effectiveness of multilateral regimes. The U.S. industry's abilities to export are impacted by effective controls on potential exports to security threats like terrorists, human rights violators, and weapons proliferators. Controversies arise over technology control, multilateral regimes, licensing processes, and the economic impact of export controls. The EAA debate includes disputes over foreign availability, mass market provisions, and the controllability of technology. Industry groups are actively involved in the debate. The EAA debate includes disputes over foreign availability, mass market provisions, and the controllability of technology. Industry groups consider these provisions as key benefits of potential EAA legislation, arguing that the flow of technology cannot be effectively controlled. Industry groups supporting EAA legislation believe that foreign availability and mass market concepts are crucial, arguing that unilateral controls will not prevent other countries from obtaining advanced technology. They claim that current multilateral controls on dual-use articles are ineffective. According to advocates, unilateral controls on cutting-edge technology are ineffective as \"countries of concern\" can obtain it from other nations. They argue that current multilateral controls are ineffectual and only harm American businesses, while foreign businesses benefit from new markets. Unilateral export controls are seen as increasingly unworkable in a globalized economy. The current export control system is seen as ineffective and unworkable in a globalized economy. American businesses suffer from unilateral controls, while foreign businesses benefit from new markets. Component parts are manufactured worldwide, making it easy to obtain them from other sources if needed. The export control system is outdated in a globalized economy where component parts are manufactured worldwide. Purchasing managers are reducing dependence on American components due to delays in licensing procedures. Critics are concerned about arguments for mass market and foreign availability. Managers at Daimler Chrysler Aerospace have been instructed to reduce reliance on American components for defense and space technology products due to delays in licensing procedures. Critics are worried about industry proponents' arguments for mass market and foreign availability, fearing that the mass market standard could undermine the entire U.S. control regime by decontrolling items that could be used for proliferation purposes. Critics argue that the mass market standard proposed by industry proponents could nullify the U.S. control regime by decontrolling items that could be used for proliferation purposes. They believe that almost any product, including dual-use items, could qualify for mass market status, allowing controlled countries to purchase items from rogue buyers. Industry proponents claim that robust export industries enhance national security. The EAA legislation in the 106th Congress allows the sale of items that controlled countries can purchase from rogue buyers. Industry argues that national security is boosted by strong export industries due to changes in defense procurement and research. Military now buys many off-the-shelf items and relies more on external research and development. The military's approach to defense procurement and research has shifted from conducting technical research in-house to purchasing off-the-shelf items and relying on commercial applications. Industry argues that selling current technology is crucial for national security, as it generates funds for future technology development and prevents foreign firms from gaining market share and surpassing American firms. Industry argues that selling current technology is crucial for national security to prevent foreign firms from gaining market share and surpassing American firms, which could potentially affect the quality of technology available for national security purposes. Critics reject this argument, stating that the United States does not need a streamlined export process that will not impede exports. Industry argues that a streamlined export process is needed to prevent foreign firms from surpassing American firms in technology, which could impact national security. Critics disagree, stating that selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states does not promote national security. They point to the risk of technology being used against the United States or its allies, citing the example of Iraq in the 1980s. The United States does not promote national security by selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states. This technology, if sold to unstable regimes, could be used against the US or its allies in the future. The reliance on the civilian sector for R&D is a result of declining defense budgets in the 1990s. Some argue that R&D for defense capabilities should be funded within the military. In the 1980s, Saddam Hussein was seen as a counterweight to Iran, but later used technology against Kuwait and allied forces in the Persian Gulf War. The reliance on civilian R&D is due to reduced defense budgets in the 1990s. Some argue that defense-related R&D should be funded within the Defense Department to control technology access. Industry groups highlight the challenge of export control systems keeping up with rapid technological advancements. Defense capabilities should be funded within the Defense Department to maintain control over technology to certain nations. Industry groups and observers point to the rapid rise in computing power as a challenge for export control systems. One national security analyst argues that attempting to control computing power is not feasible or effective, as it hinders market opportunities for R&D. The distinction between supercomputers and commodity computers has become blurred due to increasing computing speeds and networking advances. The rapid rise in computing power poses a challenge for export control systems. Attempting to control computing power is deemed ineffective and self-defeating by a national security analyst, as it hinders market opportunities for R&D. The distinction between supercomputers and commodity computers has blurred due to increasing computing speeds and networking advances. Microprocessors can be linked to create servers with capabilities that breach export thresholds, potentially approaching those of a supercomputer. The ability to cluster commodity computers to multiply computing power erodes restrictions on high-performance computing access, despite efforts to control exports of high-end technology. The Defense Science Board highlighted the challenge of restricting access to high-performance computing due to the clustering of commodity computers. Some believe the US can control access by limiting exports, as American-made computers are seen as superior and offer better networking and service. Control advocates argue that these distinctions are significant in maintaining qualitative superiority. Control advocates argue for restricting access to high-performance computer technology by limiting exports of American-made computers. They believe that American products are perceived as superior, offering better networking and service at a competitive price. They emphasize the importance of qualitative differences and the challenges faced by engineers in networking parallel processing systems. Monitoring and verifying the end-use of controlled technology is a policy that has been attempted. Control advocates argue for restricting access to high-performance computer technology by limiting exports of American-made computers. They emphasize the importance of qualitative differences and the challenges faced by engineers in networking parallel processing systems. One policy that has been attempted to monitor and verify the end-use of controlled goods is the post-shipment verification requirement on the export of HPCs mandated by Sec 1213 of NDAA98. This section requires a verification for computers destined for tier III destinations, including China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel, and other nations in areas of regional instability. The post-shipment verification requirement (PSV) on the export of high-performance computers (HPCs) to tier III destinations, including China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel, and other nations in areas of regional instability, is mandated by Sec 1213 of NDAA98. Lawmakers are particularly concerned about exports of HPCs to China, where access to U.S. HPC exports is restricted. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has found that the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has made limited efforts to monitor or verify compliance with export license terms and conditions. The GAO reported that China restricts access to facilities containing U.S. HPC exports, and BIS has made limited efforts to monitor compliance. Monitoring HPC exports to China is challenging due to ties between Chinese state-owned enterprises and the military. The U.S. participates in multilateral export control regimes, with the Wassenaar Arrangement being the principal one for dual-use goods and technology. The United States participates in the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) on Dual-Use Goods and Munitions, a multilateral export control regime for dual-use goods and technology. The WA dual-use control list aligns with U.S. CCL items subject to national security controls. The Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) on Dual-Use Goods and Munitions was established in 1996 as the successor to the Coordinated Committee (CoCom). The WA control list aligns with U.S. CCL items for national security controls. The United States also participates in other proliferation control regimes like the Australia Group, Missile Technology Control Regime, and Nuclear Suppliers Group, each with common control lists and reporting requirements. The United States participates in four proliferation-related control regimes: the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group. These groups have national discretion, a common control list, and require regular reporting. Member nations control exports under their own laws, known as national discretion. Unlike CoCom, these organizations do not review export licenses before granting them. Members pledge to disclose export licensing decisions and consult with each other. The Wassenaar Arrangement, like other proliferation-related control regimes, operates under national discretion with a common control list. Members pledge to disclose export licensing decisions and consult on sensitive licenses, but operate by consensus and lack institutional structures. Some groups adhere to a \"no undercut\" provision, but are limited in effectiveness. Some observers criticize the Wassenaar Arrangement for its reliance on consensus among member states, which they argue leads to ineffective control measures. Critics point out that the minimal reporting requirements hinder effective pre-export consultation, as only notification of a sale is mandated. Some critics argue that the Wassenaar Arrangement is ineffective due to its reliance on consensus among member states, leading to minimal reporting requirements that hinder pre-export consultation. Industry representatives emphasize the need for effective multilateral controls to ensure all states adhere to export policies. Industry representatives stress the importance of effective multilateral controls for export policies, particularly criticizing unilateral export policies towards China. They argue that adherence to export controls by all capable states is crucial for their effectiveness. The lack of consensus among Wassenaar Arrangement countries on technology transfer limits to China is highlighted, with domestic controls and minimal multilateral constraints seen as detrimental to American companies. The debate over export policies, especially regarding exports to China, lacks consensus among Wassenaar Arrangement countries. Industry spokesmen criticize the U.S. for strict licensing policies towards China without convincing allies to follow suit. Proponents of tighter restrictions argue for America's historical leadership in export controls and non-proliferation efforts. Industry spokesmen fault the U.S. for strict licensing policies towards China without convincing allies to follow suit. Proponents of tighter export restrictions argue for America's historical leadership in export controls and non-proliferation efforts, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to lead in order to persuade other nations to follow suit. The original EAA was adopted in 1949, along with the establishment of CoCom. Efforts to strengthen the Wassenaar Arrangement, CoCom's successor regime, require the U.S. to lead by example in tightening export restrictions. Adherents believe that adopting controls first and persuading other nations to follow is the most effective negotiating strategy, as relying solely on consensus-based policies is deemed ineffective and harmful to national security. Adherents argue that adopting controls first and persuading other nations to follow is the most effective negotiating strategy in multilateral fora. They believe a strategy based solely on consensus is ineffective and harmful to national security. Industry spokesmen and advocates agree on the need to strengthen multilateral controls, but consensus is lacking on which goods and countries pose a threat. The need to strengthen multilateral export controls is recognized by industry spokesmen and advocates, but consensus is lacking on which goods and countries pose a threat. The dilemma arises when there is no agreement on target countries, leading to the question of whether the United States should impose controls unilaterally. The export control dilemma arises from a lack of consensus on target countries, particularly China. The debate revolves around balancing non-proliferation goals with economic benefits and national security concerns. The dilemma in U.S. export control policy towards China involves balancing economic benefits and national security risks associated with exporting sensitive technologies to China. Some in the business community argue that current controls are too stringent and have hindered technology transfers to China in recent years.
