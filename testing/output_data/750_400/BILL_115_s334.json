Congress acknowledges that hydraulic fracturing has been a widely used practice in the United States for over 60 years in numerous wells. The Ground Water Protection Council has recognized the proactive and preventive nature of current state regulations on oil and gas activities. The Ground Water Protection Council released a report in May 2009 stating that current state regulations for oil and gas activities are environmentally proactive. All oil and gas producing states have regulations in place to protect water resources. The 2004 EPA study found no evidence of drinking water contamination from hydraulic fracturing, and the 2009 Ground Water Protection Council report noted a lack of evidence of water resource harm from oil and gas regulations. The 2009 report by the Ground Water Protection Council found no evidence of drinking water wells contaminated by fracture fluid from fracked formations, and a resolution by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission stated that states have comprehensive laws and regulations to ensure water resource protection during hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing in deep and shallow formations poses a risk to groundwater. A 2009 resolution by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission stated that states have laws and regulations to ensure safe operations and protect drinking water. Lisa Jackson, Administrator of the EPA, testified before the House Oversight Committee in May 2011. Hydraulic fracturing operations are safe and states have found no verified cases of groundwater contamination associated with the process. Lisa Jackson, Administrator of the EPA, testified that there is no proven case where fracking has affected water. Bureau of Land Management Director Bob Abbey stated in 2011 that there is no evidence of adverse effects from the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Activities related to hydraulic fracturing, such as surface discharges, wastewater disposal, and air emissions, are already regulated at the Federal level under various environmental statutes, including portions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Activities related to hydraulic fracturing, such as surface discharges, wastewater disposal, and air emissions, are regulated at the Federal level under environmental statutes like the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and Clean Air Act. Congress has chosen not to include hydraulic fracturing in underground injection regulations. In 2011, the Secretary of the Interior announced plans for new Federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing on Federal land. In 2011, the Secretary of the Interior announced plans for new Federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing on Federal land. A 2012 study by the Energy Institute at the University of Texas found no evidence of chemicals from hydraulic fracturing fluid in aquifers. The University of Texas at Austin study found no evidence of hydraulic fracturing chemicals in aquifers. The Ground Water Protection Council report describes state regulations for oil and gas industry growth. The Council and State Oil and Gas Regulatory Exchange released a report on State Oil and Gas Regulations focusing on protecting water resources. States have improved groundwater protection laws in response to industry growth. The term \"Federal land\" in this Act includes public lands, National Forest System land, Bureau of Reclamation land, and Corps of Engineers land. State authority is also addressed in the Act. The State has sole authority over regulations for well treatment using fluids under pressure with propping agents to enhance oil, gas, or geothermal production on State land. Federal land is also subject to similar regulations.
