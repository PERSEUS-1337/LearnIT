    "content": "In this work, the authors address challenges in probabilistic topic modeling by incorporating language structure through a neural autoregressive topic model combined with a LSTM-based language model. This approach aims to better estimate the probability of a word in a given context by considering word order and local collocation patterns. In this work, a neural autoregressive topic model is combined with a LSTM-based language model to incorporate language structure. The LSTM-LM learns word representations accounting for word order, while the TM learns a latent representation from the entire document. The LSTM-LM captures language complexities like syntax and semantics, while the TM uncovers thematic structures in document collections. This approach combines two paradigms to learn word meanings from occurrences. ctx-DocNADE combines a topic model and a language model to learn word meanings from occurrences, especially in settings with limited context or smaller training corpora. Incorporating external knowledge into neural autoregressive topic models via a language modeling approach improves word-topic mapping on smaller or short-text corpora. This extension of DocNADE is named ctx-DocNADEe. The novel neural autoregressive topic model variants with neural language models consistently outperform state-of-the-art generative topic models in terms of generalization, interpretability, and applicability over long-text. Probabilistic topic models like LDA, RSM, and DocNADE variants are commonly used to extract topics from text collections and predict word probabilities in documents. These models learn latent document representations for NLP tasks but do not consider word order, representing context as a bag of words. Probabilistic topic models like LDA, RSM, and DocNADE variants extract topics from text collections and predict word probabilities. They learn latent document representations for NLP tasks but ignore word order, representing context as a bag of words. To improve this, there is a need to incorporate word order and language structure in topic models. Traditional topic models like LDA, RSM, and DocNADE variants extract topics from text collections but ignore word order, representing context as a bag of words. To improve this, there is a need to incorporate word order and language structure in topic models. In this particular setting, the two sentences have the same unigram statistics, but are about different topics. On deciding which topic generated the word \"bear\" in the second sentence, the preceding words \"market falls\" make it more likely. Traditional topic models like LDA, RSM, and DocNADE variants extract topics from text collections but ignore word order, representing context as a bag of words. In this particular setting, the two sentences have the same unigram statistics, but are about different topics. The word \"bear\" in the second sentence is likely generated by a topic related to stock market trading, indicated by the preceding words \"market falls.\" Language structure, syntax, and semantics are also disregarded in topic models. Traditional topic models like LDA, RSM, and DocNADE variants extract topics from text collections but ignore word order, representing context as a bag of words. The word \"bear\" in the second sentence is likely generated by a topic related to stock market trading, indicated by the preceding words \"market falls.\" Language structure, syntax, and semantics are also disregarded in topic models. BID23 have shown that a deep contextualized LSTM-based language model (LSTM-LM) is able to capture different language concepts in a layer-wise fashion. Recent studies have integrated deep contextualized LSTM-based language models to capture language concepts in a layer-wise fashion, focusing on syntax and semantics at a document level. Recent studies have integrated deep contextualized LSTM-based language models to capture language concepts in a layer-wise fashion, focusing on syntax and semantics at a document level. However, LSTM-LMs do not capture semantics at a document level, leading to the development of models integrating latent topics to improve global dependencies in language models. Recent studies have integrated deep contextualized LSTM-based language models to capture language concepts in a layer-wise fashion, focusing on syntax and semantics at a document level. In contrast, models like TCNLM BID32 have focused on improving LMs with global dependencies using latent topics, while DocNADE variants BID12 BID8 learn word occurrences across documents but are based on the Bag of Words assumption. In contrast to models like TCNLM BID32, DocNADE variants BID12 BID8 capture word occurrences across documents but ignore language structure. LSTM-LM introduces language structure into neural autoregressive topic models, accounting for word ordering, language concepts, and long-range dependencies. The proposed neural topic model, named ctx-DocNADE, incorporates language structure via LSTM-LM to accurately predict words based on global and local contexts. The proposed neural topic model, ctx-DocNADE, combines joint word and latent topic learning in a unified framework to accurately predict words based on global and local contexts. It offers complementary semantics by incorporating language structure via LSTM-LM. The model captures the usage of terms like \"fall\" in different contexts, such as the stock market. The Estimator (ctx-DocNADE) combines joint word and latent topic learning to capture complementary semantics. It shows the usage of \"fall\" in the context of stock market trading, highlighting the challenge of learning from contextual information in settings with short texts and few documents. In stock market trading, the term \"fall\" is discussed in the global context of semantic views. Learning from contextual information is challenging in settings with short texts and few documents due to limited word co-occurrences, significant word non-overlap, and a small training corpus. Distributional word representations like word embeddings have shown to capture semantic and syntactic relatedness effectively in NLP. Traditional topic models struggle with short texts due to limited word co-occurrences and significant word non-overlap. However, word embeddings have shown impressive performance in capturing semantic and syntactic relatedness in words, overcoming these limitations. For example, traditional models may not infer relatedness between word pairs like \"falls\" and \"drops\" in short text fragments. In NLP tasks, word embeddings have shown impressive performance in capturing semantic relatedness in short texts. Traditional topic models struggle with limited word co-occurrences and non-overlap, but word embeddings can infer relatedness between word pairs like \"falls\" and \"drops\" in short text fragments. Related work has integrated word embeddings to improve information in short texts. In the distributed embedding space, word pairs show semantic relatedness. Previous work integrated word embeddings to enhance information in short texts, but ignored language structure like word ordering and syntax. DocNADE and its extensions outperform LDA and RSM topic models in perplexity. Incorporating distributed compositional priors in DocNADE involves using pre-trained word embeddings via LSTM-LM to enhance topic learning on smaller corpora or short texts. This approach considers word ordering and syntax, addressing limitations of previous models like LDA and RSM. Incorporating distributed compositional priors in DocNADE involves using pre-trained word embeddings via LSTM-LM to enhance topic learning on smaller corpora or short texts.

Two extensions are proposed: ctx-DocNADE introduces language structure with LSTM-LM, while ctx-DocNADEe incorporates external knowledge with pre-trained word embeddings. The proposed extensions of the DocNADE model, ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe, incorporate language structure and external knowledge respectively. They account for word ordering, syntactical and semantic structures, long and short term dependencies, and external knowledge to overcome limitations of BoW-based representations. The ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe models incorporate language structure and external knowledge to address limitations of BoW-based representations. They consider word ordering, syntactical and semantic structures, long and short term dependencies, and external knowledge in each document. The ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe models use LSTM-based components to incorporate language structure and external knowledge, improving upon BoW-based representations by considering word ordering, syntactical and semantic structures, long and short term dependencies, and external knowledge in each document. In ctx-DocNADE, word vectors are influenced by hidden vectors from LSTM-based components. The weight matrix W encodes topic information for hidden features, with each column vector representing a word. The embedding layer in the LSTM component is randomly initialized in this unified network. In the unified network, the embedding layer of the LSTM component is randomly initialized, extending DocNADE to consider word ordering and language concepts through context-dependent representations. The second version adds distributional priors by initializing the LSTM embedding layer with a pre-trained matrix E and weight matrix W. The second version of the unified network, ctx-DocNADEe, incorporates distributional priors by initializing the LSTM embedding layer with a pre-trained matrix E and weight matrix W. Algorithm 1 and Table 1 compare the log p(v) for a document v in three settings: Doc-NADE, ctx-DocNADE, and ctx-DocNADEe. In DocNADE, the tied weights in matrix W allow for reusing the linear activation a in every hidden layer, reducing computational complexity. The embedding matrix E and weight matrix W are used in the ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe models. In DocNADE, the tied weights in matrix W allow for reusing the linear activation in every hidden layer, reducing computational complexity to O(HD). The computational complexity in ctx-DocNADE or ctx-DocNADEe is O(HD + N), where N is the total number of edges in the LSTM.
