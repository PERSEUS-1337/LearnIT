Overall federal tax revenues have remained stable at around 17.7% of GDP since 1946. Tax revenue has fluctuated over the years, with corporate tax revenue decreasing to 1.3% of GDP and projected to rise to over 2.4% as the economy improves. Overall federal tax revenues have remained stable at around 17.7% of GDP since 1946. Individual tax revenues have also shown stability, averaging around 8.1% of economic output. Payroll tax revenue has increased from 1.4% to 6.0% of GDP, while excise tax revenue has decreased from 3.1% to 0.5% of GDP. The corporate tax revenue has decreased in importance relative to other sources, dropping from 32.1% of federal tax revenue in 1952 to 8.9% today. Individual and payroll taxes have remained stable, with individual tax accounting for 42.2% and payroll tax for 9.7% of federal revenue in 1952. The corporate tax revenue has decreased in importance, now accounting for 8.9% of federal tax revenue, while individual and payroll taxes generate 41.5% and 40.0% of federal revenue, respectively. The decline in corporate tax revenues can be attributed to factors such as tax rate changes and the size of the tax base. The decline in corporate tax revenues, now accounting for 8.9% of federal tax revenue, may be due to factors such as tax rate changes and the size of the tax base. The amount of revenue collected from any tax depends on the tax rate and the tax base, which can be influenced by factors like the number of firms operating in the corporate form and corporate profitability. The decline in corporate tax revenues is influenced by tax rate changes and the size of the tax base. Factors like the number of firms operating in the corporate form and corporate profitability impact the tax base. The analysis suggests that both lower tax rates and a reduced tax base have contributed to the decline in corporate tax revenue. The decline in corporate tax revenue is influenced by lower tax rates and a reduction in the corporate tax base. The effective tax rate has decreased from 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010, contributing to the decline in revenue. The analysis suggests that both factors have played a role in the decrease in corporate tax revenue. The effective corporate tax rate has decreased from 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010, leading to lower tax revenue. This decline is attributed to a reduction in the top statutory rate from around 50% in the 1950s to 35% currently. The decrease in the average effective tax rate is driven by three main factors: reduction in the top statutory rate from 50% in the 1950s to 35% currently, allowing corporations to claim an investment tax credit between 1962 and 1986, and special tax credits and deductions determining the effective rate. The effective corporate tax rate is influenced by credits, deductions, and tax benefits, with reductions in the statutory rate leading to lower effective rates. From 1962 to 1986, corporations could claim an investment tax credit, reducing their effective tax rate. Since 2004, Section 199 deductions have been available for certain activities, mainly in domestic manufacturing. Since 1962, corporations could claim an investment tax credit, reducing their effective tax rate. Since 2004, Section 199 deductions have been available for certain activities, primarily in domestic manufacturing. Changes to depreciation rules also contributed to reduced effective tax rates. The Section 199 deduction, along with changes to depreciation rules, has helped reduce effective tax rates in the domestic manufacturing industry. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 brought tax depreciation closer to physical depreciation, but temporary enhancements like \"bonus depreciation\" in 2002 and 2009 were introduced to stimulate the economy. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 brought tax depreciation closer to physical depreciation. Bonus depreciation was temporarily enhanced in 2002 and 2009 to stimulate the economy. Other factors like inflation and corporate tax credits have had small effects on effective corporate tax rates. According to economists Alan Auerbach and James Poterba, factors like inflation and corporate tax credits have had small effects on effective corporate tax rates. However, the main drivers of falling effective tax rates have been accelerated depreciation and the investment tax credit. Despite a general decline over time, there were spikes in the average effective corporate tax rate above the 35% statutory rate around 2000 and 2007. The net effect of other factors on effective corporate tax rates has been small compared to accelerated depreciation and the investment tax credit. There were spikes in the average effective tax rate above the 35% statutory rate around 2000 and 2007, coinciding with recessions and businesses experiencing losses. Businesses can use current losses to offset income from previous years, reducing their average effective tax rate. In 2007, during a recession, businesses faced losses and could carry back losses to reduce taxes paid in previous years. However, in severe economic downturns, a two-year carryback period may not be sufficient for firms to fully utilize current losses, resulting in higher taxes for struggling corporations. This leads to an increase in overall average tax rates. In response to high taxes during recessions, Congress extended the carryback period from two years to five years in 2002 and 2008 to stimulate the economy. This led to a decline in corporate tax revenue as the nonfinancial corporate tax base shrank. The decline in corporate tax revenue is not solely due to lower effective tax rates, but also because of the shrinking nonfinancial corporate tax base. This is attributed to an increasing share of business income being generated by partnerships and S corporations, which are not subject to the corporate income tax system. Instead, income earned is distributed directly to individual business owners and taxed according to the individual income tax system. The tax base has shrunk as more business income is generated by partnerships and S corporations, which are not subject to corporate income tax. Instead, income is distributed to individual owners and taxed through the individual income tax system. C corporations generated 78% of business income in 1980, but by 2007, they only accounted for 44%, while partnerships' share rose from 3% to 28%. The distribution of business income shifted from C corporations to partnerships and S corporations, leading to a smaller corporate tax base and a drop in corporate tax revenues. In 1980, C corporations generated 78% of business income, but by 2007, they only accounted for 44%. Meanwhile, partnerships' share rose from 3% to 28% and S corporations' share rose from 1% to nearly 17%. The shift in business income distribution from C corporations to partnerships and S corporations led to a smaller corporate tax base and a drop in corporate tax revenues. C corporations' share of all businesses decreased from 17% in 1980 to 6% in 2007, while S corporations became more popular, especially after the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The distribution of businesses changed over time, with C corporations decreasing from 17% in 1980 to 6% in 2007, while S corporations increased in popularity, representing 12% of businesses in 2007, up from 4% in 1980. Legislation in 1986 incentivized businesses to organize as S corporations by setting lower tax rates. The tax rate for S corporations was reduced to incentivize businesses to organize as such, leading to an increase in their popularity. By 2007, S corporations represented 12% of businesses, up from 4% in 1980. The profitability of firms in the corporate sector has decreased, affecting the tax base. The profitability of firms in the corporate sector has decreased, impacting the tax base. Economists use the profit to net assets ratio to measure how well resources are being utilized to generate profits. Corporate profitability has declined since 1966. The profit to asset ratio measures how well the corporate sector utilizes resources to generate profits. Corporate profitability has declined significantly since 1966, impacting the tax base. Economists attribute this decline to falling profitability rather than changes in the average tax rate. Corporate profitability peaked in 1966 and has since fallen over two and a half times. Economists Auerbach and Poterba found that this decline in profitability has been more significant than changes in the average tax rate in affecting corporate taxes. The reasons for the decline in profits could be attributed to a shift within the corporate sector towards more volatile industries, leading to an increase in the number of corporations experiencing losses. The decline in nonfinancial corporate profitability over time could be due to shifts towards more volatile industries, younger firms with lower initial profits, and potential profit shifting out of the United States. The decline in nonfinancial corporate profitability may be attributed to a shift in the age of corporations towards younger firms, potential profit shifting out of the United States, and the fraction of corporations experiencing losses. An increasing collection of research has documented evidence of profit-shifting among multinational corporations, with firms incentivized to reduce income for tax purposes, leading to declining corporate tax revenues over the last six decades. Corporate tax revenues have been declining for the last six decades, with economists attributing this trend to three primary factors: decreasing average effective corporate tax rates, changes in tax treatment of investment and capital recovery, and an increasing fraction of business activity being shifted for tax purposes. The decline in corporate tax revenues over the last six decades can be attributed to three main factors: decreasing average effective corporate tax rates, a shift towards pass-through business structures like partnerships and S corporations, and a decrease in corporate sector profitability. The shift towards pass-through business structures like partnerships and S corporations has led to a decline in corporate tax revenues. This trend, along with decreasing corporate sector profitability, has eroded the corporate tax base. This is relevant in the ongoing tax reform debate focusing on reducing statutory rates and broadening the tax base. The decline in corporate tax revenues is attributed to the shift towards pass-through business structures and decreasing corporate sector profitability, leading to erosion of the tax base. The focus of the tax reform debate is on reducing statutory rates and broadening the tax base by eliminating deductions and credits, potentially allowing for a revenue-neutral reduction in the top statutory corporate tax rate. The effective tax rate is typically lower than the statutory tax rate, indicating the possibility of reducing the top corporate tax rate in a revenue-neutral manner by broadening the tax base. Research suggests that reducing the top corporate rate from 35% to 25% would require eliminating all corporate tax expenditures and making changes to tax preferences for noncorporate businesses. Reducing the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 25% would involve repealing corporate tax expenditures, changing tax preferences for noncorporate businesses, and implementing other business tax reforms to broaden the tax base. This may lead to some business activity shifting back to the corporate sector and potentially expanding the domestic corporate tax base by reducing profit shifting to low-tax countries. Some business tax reforms may lead to business activity returning to the corporate sector and expanding the domestic corporate tax base by reducing profit shifting to low-tax countries.
