TREATMENT OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PLANS.\" is a condensed summary of a specific section related to liability treatment for certain multiple employer plans. If an eligible employer elects, within 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, to have any liability of the employer with respect to the applicable pension plan determined under subsection (b), they can do so. Otherwise, the liability will be determined under subsection (c). If an eligible employer elects within 180 days after the enactment of the Act, they can spin off their portion of assets and liabilities to a separate plan. Otherwise, their liability will be determined under a different subsection. The applicable pension plan can be treated as spun off to an eligible plan effective January 1, 2006. The employer's liability will be determined by the eligible spunoff plan instead of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the applicable pension plan. The employer's liability for an eligible spunoff plan will be determined by the plan itself, in lieu of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the applicable pension plan. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 amendments will not apply to eligible spunoff plans. The liability of employers electing spinoff for eligible spunoff plans is exempt from certain Pension Protection Act of 2006 amendments until the plan ceases to be eligible or January 1, 2017. The employer maintaining the plan is liable for ongoing contributions to the eligible spunoff plan on the same terms as under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. The employer must contribute to the spunoff plan in accordance with ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, replacing any other liabilities to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the pension plan. The employer's contribution to the spunoff plan must comply with ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, replacing any other liabilities to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the pension plan. The spunoff plan's compliance with ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code is essential, including the interest rate application for pension plans. The spunoff plan must comply with ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, including the interest rate application for pension plans. The third segment rate determined under section 303(h)(2)(C)(iii) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 applies to eligible spunoff plans for certain plan years. For plan years starting after December 31, 2007, the third segment rate from the Pension Protection Act of 2006 applies to eligible spunoff plans. If the plan terminates under ERISA before the specified date, the interest rate used will be different. For eligible spunoff plans, the interest rate used for termination liability will be determined based on the code added by amendments, instead of the usual rate. If the plan terminates before December 31, 2010, the employer's liability will be calculated according to specific assumptions and methods under ERISA. The liability of the employer for maintaining a plan after termination under section 4062 of ERISA will be determined based on specific assumptions and methods. This liability will replace any other obligations to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the pension plan. The employer's liability for a terminated pension plan under ERISA will be determined based on specific methods and assumptions, replacing any other obligations to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the pension plan. If an applicable pension plan is terminated under ERISA, an eligible employer not making the election in subsection (b) will be liable to the corporation for the plan's unfunded benefit liabilities as of December 31, 2005. An eligible employer not electing to transfer unfunded benefit liabilities to a spunoff plan will be liable to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for a portion of the adjusted unfunded benefit liabilities of the applicable pension plan as of December 31, 2005. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"adjusted unfunded benefit liabilities\" for transferring to a spunoff plan. It clarifies that the interest assumption should be based on specific rates.

The term \"allocable portion\" refers to the portion of an applicable pension plan's liabilities and assets that corresponds to an eligible employer's share of the plan's excess liabilities, determined as if no election had been made under subsection (b). The \"allocable portion\" is the portion of a pension plan's liabilities and assets that corresponds to an eligible employer's share of the plan's excess liabilities. An eligible employer is one that participated in a multiple employer plan after January 1, 2000."
