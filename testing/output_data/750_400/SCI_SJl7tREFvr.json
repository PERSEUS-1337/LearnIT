It involves transitioning memory states to age positive keys and prevent overfitting in neural networks. The memory dropout neural model aims to increase diversity in latent representations stored in an external memory by aging positive keys to prevent overfitting. It incorporates a normalized latent representation in the long-term memory to create a neighborhood of similar memory entries. The neural encoder generates a latent representation h in a hidden layer, which is normalized and incorporated into long-term memory M. Memory entries form a neighborhood based on similarity, with positive or negative entries depending on class labels. An external memory augments the neural encoder's capacity by preserving long-term latent representations. The memory network includes arrays K and V to store keys and values, respectively. The memory network, with arrays K and V storing keys and values, is augmented by external memory M to enhance the neural encoder's capacity. The memory module includes arrays A and S to store age and variance of each key.

A differentiable Gaussian Mixture Model is used to parameterize positive memories, generating a new positive embedding h. The differentiable Gaussian Mixture Model parameterizes positive memories by location and covariance matrix. Sampling from this distribution produces a new positive embedding h. The positive keys are a subpopulation of memory keys represented as a linear superposition of Gaussian components centered at positive keys with variances stored in the array S.

KVRN performs best in the Scheduling Entity F1 domain with 62.9%. The gains obtained by MANN+MD may be due to the explicit penalization of redundant keys during training, as shown in the correlation of keys in memory. The correlation of keys in memory networks is studied to understand the gains obtained by MANN+MD. Keys in memory tend to become redundant as training progresses, as shown by the Pearson correlation analysis. Initially, all models exhibit low correlations as keys are randomly assigned. The Pearson correlation analysis shows that keys in memory networks become more redundant as training progresses. Initially, all models have low correlations due to random initialization. MANN and KVRN exhibit increasing correlation values over time, indicating more redundant keys are stored. In contrast, MANN+MD maintains low correlation values that stabilize around step 25,000, suggesting the use of memory dropout. Using memory dropout in MANN+MD leads to diverse representations in the latent space, encouraging the overwriting of redundant keys.

Comparing Entity F1 scores for MANN and MANN+MD models during training with different neighborhood sizes shows the advantage of memory dropout for reducing overfitting. Disabling traditional dropout for inputs and outputs isolates the contribution of memory dropout. During training, using memory dropout (MANN+MD) leads to a more conservative performance but better Entity F1 scores compared to not using memory dropout (MANN). However, during testing, MANN shows higher Entity F1 scores, indicating overfitting to the training dataset and difficulty generalizing to the testing dataset. During testing, MANN+MD shows better Entity F1 scores compared to MANN, indicating a 10% average improvement. Different neighborhood sizes exhibit similar trends, with distinct Entity F1 scores based on memory dropout usage. Large memories with memory dropout enhance KB encoding. During testing, models using memory dropout technique showed better Entity F1 scores compared to those without, resulting in a 10% average improvement.
