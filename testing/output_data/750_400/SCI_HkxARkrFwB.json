Storing all embedding vectors for words in a dictionary requires significant space and may strain systems with limited GPU memory. Two methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, are proposed for storing word embedding matrices during training. Our approach, word2ket and word2ketXS, utilizes quantum computing-inspired methods to store word embedding matrices efficiently during training and inference. This results in a significant reduction in storage space required for embeddings without compromising accuracy in natural language processing tasks. Our approach, word2ket and word2ketXS, utilizes quantum computing-inspired methods to store word embedding matrices efficiently during training and inference. This achieves a hundred-fold or more reduction in storage space required for embeddings with almost no drop in accuracy in natural language processing tasks. Word embedding methods like word2vec and GloVe use vector representations of words to convert human language into a continuous space suitable for neural network processing. These vectors are much smaller than the vocabulary size and are not necessarily sparse or orthogonal. Word embedding methods like word2vec and GloVe use vectors of dimensionality much smaller than the vocabulary size to represent words. These vectors capture semantic relationships between words and allow downstream neural network layers to be of width proportional to the vector dimensionality, not the vocabulary size. The d \u00d7 p embedding matrix needs to be stored in GPU memory for efficient access during processing. The embeddings used in word2vec and GloVe are of smaller dimensionality than the vocabulary size, allowing neural network layers to be proportional to the vector dimensionality. The d \u00d7 p embedding matrix must be stored in GPU memory for efficient access. Vocabulary sizes can be large, reaching d = 10^5 or 10^6, with embedding dimensionality ranging from p = 300 to p = 1024 in current systems. The embedding matrix in neural network models is a significant part of the parameter space, with vocabulary sizes ranging from 10^5 to 10^6 and embedding dimensionality from 300 to 1024. In classical computing, information is stored in bits, while in quantum computing, a qubit is described by a two-dimensional complex unit-norm vector. In quantum computing, a qubit is fully described by a two-dimensional complex unit-norm vector, allowing for exponential dimensionality of the state space through entanglement of interconnected qubits. Entanglement in quantum computing allows interconnected qubits to create a state space of exponential dimensionality, unlike classical bits which are always independent. Entanglement in quantum computing allows interconnected qubits to create a state space of exponential dimensionality, represented by C 2n instead of C 2 n. Quantum bits cannot be decomposed into individual qubit states, unlike classical bits which are always independent. While quantum registers can be approximated classically, the loss of representation power does not significantly impact NLP. In this paper, two methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, are proposed for efficiently storing word embedding matrices during NLP machine learning algorithms. The loss of representation power when approximating quantum registers classically does not significantly affect NLP tasks. The proposed methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, efficiently store word embedding matrices for NLP tasks. These methods operate independently or jointly on word embeddings, offering high efficiency in storing the matrix. Empirical evidence from NLP tasks supports the effectiveness of the new word2ket embeddings. The new word2ket embeddings offer high space saving rates with little impact on downstream NLP model accuracy. They operate independently or jointly on word embeddings, providing efficient storage of the embedding matrix. The tensor product space of separable Hilbert spaces V and W, denoted as V \u2297 W, is constructed using ordered pairs v \u2297 w, where v \u2208 V and w \u2208 W. The tensor product space V \u2297 W is a separable Hilbert space constructed using ordered pairs v \u2297 w, where v \u2208 V and w \u2208 W. The inner product between v \u2297 w and v \u2297 w is defined as a product of individual inner products v \u2297 w, v \u2297 w = v, v w, w. The norm of v \u2297 w is equal to the product of the norms of v and w, making a tensor product of two unit-norm vectors a unit norm vector in V \u2297 W. The tensor product space V \u2297 W in Hilbert space has properties of addition and multiplication. The norm of v \u2297 w is equal to the product of the norms of v and w, making it a unit norm vector in V \u2297 W. A vector in a tensor product space is often called a tensor. The tensor product space V \u2297 W consists of equivalence classes of pairs v \u2297 w, with {\u03c8 j \u2297 \u03c6 k } forming an orthonormal basis. The dimensionality of V \u2297 W is the product of the dimensions of V and W. In tensor product spaces, the Kronecker delta is used to form an orthonormal basis. The dimensionality of V \u2297 W is the product of the dimensions of V and W. Tensor product spaces can be created by multiple applications of tensor product, with arbitrary bracketing. The tensor product space H = U \u2297 V \u2297 W can be created with arbitrary bracketing, as tensor product is associative. In Dirac notation, a vector u \u2208 C 2n is written as |u and called a ket. Tensor order 3 of n refers to a tensor product space with countable orthonormal basis. Some sources may refer to n as the degree or rank of a tensor, but here we use tensor rank similar to matrix rank. In quantum computing, a vector u \u2208 C 2n is represented as |u, called a ket with a countable orthonormal basis. The tensor product space contains vectors of the form v \u2297 w, but it may not always be possible to express v \u2297 w + v \u2297 w as \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8 for some \u03c6 \u2208 V, \u03c8 \u2208 W. The tensor product space contains vectors of the form v \u2297 w and their linear combinations, some of which cannot be expressed as \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8. For example, a specific vector cannot be decomposed as required due to incompatible coefficients. The tensor product space includes vectors like v \u2297 w and their linear combinations, some of which cannot be expressed as \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8. Tensors of rank greater than one are called entangled, and the maximum rank in spaces of order higher than two is unknown. A p-dimensional word embedding model with a d-token vocabulary involves a mapping f : p. In tensor product spaces, tensors of rank greater than one are called entangled. The maximum rank in spaces of order higher than two is unknown. A p-dimensional word embedding model involves a mapping f : p, which captures semantic information from the language corpus it is trained on. In word embedding models, a d-token vocabulary is mapped by a function f : p to a p-dimensional real Hilbert space to capture semantic information. The function is represented as a collection of vectors indexed by i, typically in a d \u00d7 p matrix M. Each word's embedding v \u2208 R p is represented as an entangled tensor in word2ket using a tensor of rank r and order n. In practical implementations, word embeddings are represented as vectors in a matrix. In word2ket, embeddings are entangled tensors with a rank r and order n, where the resulting vector has dimension p = qn. The space complexity is O(rq log q log p), with q \u2265 4 to avoid loss of information. The tensor of rank r and order n is used with vectors v jk \u2208 R q. The resulting vector v has dimension p = q n, taking rnq = O(rq log q log p) space. It is recommended to use q \u2265 4 to avoid information loss. Inner products of embedding vectors can be calculated without explicitly computing the q n-dimensional vectors, taking O(rq log q log p) time. The calculation of inner product between two p-dimensional word embeddings, v and w, represented via word2ket takes O (rq log q log p) time and O (1) additional space. In most applications, a small number of embedding vectors need to be made available for processing through subsequent neural network layers. For a batch consisting of b words, the total space requirement is O (bp + rq log q log p). Reconstructing a single p-dimensional word embedding vector from a tensor of rank r and order n takes O (rn log 2 p) arithmetic operations. To facilitate parallel processing, the tensor product space is arranged into a balanced tensor product tree. The proposed method for word embeddings involves arranging the tensor product space into a balanced tensor product tree for parallel processing, reducing sequential processing time to O(log 2 n). This approach requires O(bp + rq log q log p) arithmetic operations, compared to traditional word embeddings which require O(rp). The proposed method involves arranging word embeddings into a balanced tensor product tree for parallel processing, reducing sequential processing time to O(log 2 n). This approach allows for gradients to be defined with respect to individual elements of vectors v jk. The proposed method arranges word embeddings into a balanced tensor product tree for parallel processing, reducing sequential processing time to O(log 2 n). Gradients can be defined with respect to individual elements of vectors v jk. To address potential high Lipschitz constant of the gradient, LayerNorm is used at each node in the tree. The balanced tensor product tree arranges word embeddings for parallel processing, reducing sequential time complexity. To address high Lipschitz constant of the gradient, LayerNorm is used at each node. Linear operators A and B map vectors from V to U and W to Y respectively, with A \u2297 B being a linear operator mapping V \u2297 W to U \u2297 Y. In the context of the balanced tensor product tree, linear operators A and B map vectors from V to U and W to Y respectively. A \u2297 B is a linear operator that maps vectors from V \u2297 W to U \u2297 Y through its action on simple vectors and linearity. The tensor product of linear operators is bilinear, represented as an mn \u00d7 mn matrix in the finite-dimensional case.

In text summarization experiments, a single d \u00d7 p matrix was used to create vectors for d-word vocabulary. The encoder-decoder sequence-to-sequence architecture with bidirectional RNN encoder and attention-based RNN decoder was implemented in PyTorch-Texar for training models on the GIGAWORD dataset. Internal layers had a dimensionality of 256 and a dropout rate of 0.2, with training done for 20 epochs. The best model epoch was selected using the validation set for reporting results. In text summarization experiments, the encoder and decoder had internal layers with a dimensionality of 256 and a dropout rate of 0.2. Models were trained for 20 epochs using PyTorch-Texar on the GIGAWORD dataset. The best model epoch was selected based on the validation set. Different dimensionality values were tested, with word2ket achieving a 16-fold reduction in trainable parameters at the cost of a 2-point drop in Rouge scores. The results in Table 1 show that word2ket can achieve a 16-fold reduction in trainable parameters with a drop of Rouge scores by about 2 points. On the other hand, word2ketXS offers over 100-fold space reduction while reducing the Rouge scores by only about 0.5. Therefore, in the evaluation on the remaining two NLP tasks, the focus was on word2ketXS. The study compared word2ket and word2ketXS, showing that word2ketXS is more space-efficient with a 34,000 fold reduction in trainable parameters. It was found to offer over 100-fold space reduction while only reducing Rouge scores by about 0.5. The evaluation then focused on word2ketXS for German-English machine translation using the IWSLT2014 dataset. The BLEU score was used to measure performance with different embedding dimensions.

For German-English machine translation using the IWSLT2014 dataset, the BLEU score was used to measure performance with different embedding dimensions. The results in Table 2 show a drop in BLEU score for reductions in parameter space. The study explored embedding dimensions ranging from 100 to 8000, with varying tensor order and matrix dimensions.

The study utilized the DrQA model on the SQuAD dataset, training for 40 epochs and achieving a test set F1 score. By increasing the tensor order in word2ketXS to four, a 0.5 point drop in F1 score was observed with a 1000-fold saving in parameter space for storing embeddings. The study found that increasing the tensor order in word2ketXS to four resulted in a 0.5 point drop in F1 score, but with a significant 1000-fold saving in parameter space for storing embeddings. Additionally, for order-4 tensor word2ketXS, there was a nearly 10^5-fold space saving rate with a drop in F1 score by less than two points. The study investigated the computational overhead of word2ketXS embeddings, finding that using tensors of order 2 increased training time from 5.8 to 7.4 hours, and using tensors of order 4 increased it to 9 hours on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. The study found that using tensors of order 4 increased training time to 9 hours on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU, despite the memory footprint decrease in the word embedding part of the model. The study showed a significant reduction in memory footprint for word embeddings in sequence-to-sequence models, while other parameters like weight matrices were not compressed. Transformer models like BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and Sparse Transformers still require large memory during inference. During training, memory is dominated by storing activations in all layers for gradient calculations. Transformer models like BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and Sparse Transformers require large memory due to their parameters, with word embeddings taking up a significant portion. During training, memory is dominated by storing activations in all layers for gradient calculations. Transformer models like BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and Sparse Transformers require large memory due to their parameters, with word embeddings taking up a significant portion. RoBERTa BASE has 30% of parameters dedicated to word embeddings, which contribute to memory footprint during training. Decreasing memory requirements is crucial given current hardware limitations for training and inference. To reduce memory usage during training, various approaches have been proposed for decreasing the memory footprint of networks, including dictionary learning, word embedding clustering, and bit encoding. This is essential due to current hardware limitations for training and inference. Various methods have been proposed to decrease the memory requirements of neural networks, such as dictionary learning, word embedding clustering, bit encoding, and quantization of floating point numbers. Techniques like pruning and quantization have been used to compress models for low-memory inference and training sparsity. An optimized method for uniform quantization of floating point numbers in the embedding matrix has been proposed recently to compress models for low-memory inference. Various approaches, including sparsity and low numerical precision, have been suggested for low-memory training. Fourier-based approximation methods have also been used for approximating matrices. However, none of these methods can match the space-saving rates achieved by word2ketXS. In contrast to other methods like sparsity and low numerical precision, word2ketXS achieves superior space-saving rates in matrix approximation. Other approaches, such as bit encoding and parameter sharing, have limitations in space saving for architectures with limited storage capacity. Methods like Andrews (2016), Gupta et al. (2015), and May et al. (2019) have space-saving limitations for 32-bit architectures. Suzuki & Nagata (2016) and PCA-based methods offer higher saving rates but are limited by vocabulary size and embedding dimensionality. Arora et al. (2018) have used tensor product spaces for document embeddings."
