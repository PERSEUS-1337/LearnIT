    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Math and Science Incentive Act of 2005\". Congress finds that the United States needs a strong scientific and technical enterprise, which requires producing more scientists and engineers. The education system must encourage students to study science and mathematics and pursue related careers, as current performance in these fields lags behind international peers. The United States needs to recommit to leadership in science, mathematics, and engineering, especially with advances in areas like nanotechnology. The current performance of US students in these fields lags behind international peers, and more students need to pursue science and mathematics careers. The country is still benefiting from past investments in research and education, but that capital is being depleted. The United States must recommit to leadership in science, mathematics, and engineering, particularly with advancements in nanotechnology. Implementing a loan forgiveness program to attract students to STEM careers, including teaching, can help maintain technological leadership. Establishment of program for STEM loan forgiveness.
