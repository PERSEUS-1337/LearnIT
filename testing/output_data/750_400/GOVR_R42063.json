Unemployment may not immediately decrease when the economy picks up after a recession due to firms keeping underutilized employees on payroll to avoid costs of layoffs and rehiring. This delay in hiring can allow employers to meet rising demand without increasing their workforce. One reason why unemployment may not decrease significantly when economic growth resumes after a recession is that firms may have underutilized employees on their payrolls to avoid costs of layoffs and rehiring. This allows employers to initially increase output without hiring more workers by raising the productivity of existing employees, temporarily boosting labor productivity growth. However, once current labor capacity is fully utilized, output growth can only match the rate of productivity growth until firms start adding more workers as the economic expansion progresses. During a recovery, firms can increase output without hiring more workers by raising productivity. This boosts labor productivity growth temporarily. Output growth is limited by productivity growth until firms start adding workers. Employment rises when real GDP growth exceeds labor productivity growth, leading to a decrease in the unemployment rate. During economic expansion, output growth depends on labor supply and productivity rates. If real GDP growth surpasses labor productivity growth, employment increases, lowering the unemployment rate. Economist Arthur Okun's \"Okun's law\" highlights the inverse relationship between GDP growth and unemployment rates, a widely accepted concept in economics. In the long run, there is a negative relationship between changes in real GDP growth rates and unemployment, as highlighted by economist Arthur Okun in the early 1960s. \"Okun's law\" states that stable unemployment rates require real GDP growth to be about equal to potential output growth. This concept is widely accepted in the economics profession. Okun's law, expanded upon by economists, states that stable unemployment rates require real GDP growth to be about equal to potential output growth. Potential output is the economy's capacity to produce goods and services when resources are fully utilized, determined by potential productivity and labor supply at full employment. The rate of growth in potential output is determined by potential productivity and labor supply at full employment. When the economy is at full employment, the rate of growth of potential output equals the rate of growth in potential productivity and the labor supply. If the rate of GDP growth falls below the rate of labor force growth, there is an output gap. In a high unemployment rate, actual GDP falls short of potential GDP, creating an output gap. If GDP growth lags behind labor force growth, not enough new jobs will be created, leading to a rise in unemployment. Conversely, if output growth exceeds labor force growth, new jobs will be created to meet rising demand. If the rate of output growth exceeds the rate of labor force growth, new jobs will be created to meet rising demand, leading to a decrease in the unemployment rate. If GDP growth exceeds the combined growth rates of the labor force and productivity, the unemployment rate will fall in the long run. Policymakers may find it useful to know the rate of GDP growth for planning. The unemployment rate will rise if GDP growth does not exceed the combined growth rates of the labor force and productivity. Policymakers need to know the rate of GDP growth to plan stimulus policies. The civilian labor force grew at an average annual rate of 1.6% between 1950 and 2000. Between 1950 and 2000, the civilian labor force grew at an average annual rate of 1.6%. The growth rate has slowed since then and is expected to continue doing so partly as a result of the aging of the baby-boom generation. Between 2000 and 2010, the annual rate of labor force growth fell to 0.8%. It is projected to fall further, to 0.7% per year on average, between 2010 and 2020. The labor force growth rate has slowed since 2000, falling to 0.8% annually. It is projected to further decrease to 0.7% between 2010 and 2020. Productivity growth rates varied between 1947-1973 at 2.8% annually and 1973-1995 at 1.4% annually. Productivity growth rates have varied over time, with periods of acceleration and slowdown. Between 1947 and 1973, productivity grew at 2.8% annually, slowing to 1.4% between 1973 and 1995. From 1995 to 2005, it accelerated to 2.9% per year, but since 2005, it has slowed to 1.6% annually. Real GDP growth above 2.5% is needed to reduce the unemployment rate. Productivity growth has varied over time, with rates slowing to 1.4% between 1973 and 1995, then accelerating to 2.9% from 1995 to 2005. Since 2005, it has slowed to 1.6% annually. Real GDP growth above 2.5% is necessary to lower the unemployment rate. According to Okun's law, a 1 percentage point decline in unemployment requires GDP to grow approximately 2 percentage points faster than potential GDP. According to Okun's law, a 1 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate requires real GDP to grow approximately 2 percentage points faster than potential GDP. It may take some time for the unemployment rate to start declining after an economic recovery. Following an economic recovery, there is often a delay before the unemployment rate starts to decline. It took varying amounts of time for the unemployment rate to trend downward after the end of different economic contractions, ranging from over a year to as little as five months. This delay has led to some periods being labeled as \"jobless recoveries.\" The unemployment rate often takes time to decline after an economic recovery, ranging from over a year to as little as five months. This delay has led to periods being labeled as \"jobless recoveries.\" The current recovery is closer to the high-end of this range, with the unemployment rate starting to decline 12 months after the 2007-2009 recession. The unemployment rate can take time to decline after an economic recovery, ranging from over a year to as little as five months. The current recovery is closer to the high-end of this range, with the unemployment rate starting to decline 12 months after the 2007-2009 recession. The pace of decline in the unemployment rate has varied after different postwar recessions, with the slowest decline occurring after the recession that ended in November 2001. After various postwar recessions, the unemployment rate's decline varied in pace. The slowest decline occurred after the November 2001 recession, taking about 3\u00bd years for a half percentage point drop. In contrast, the expansion following the July 1981-November 1982 downturn saw a quicker decline in the unemployment rate. The expansion following the July 1981-November 1982 downturn began with the highest unemployment rate of the postwar period (10.8%). It took only eight months for the unemployment rate to fall more than one percentage point (to a still high 9.4%). A debate recently broke out over the applicability of Okun's law to changes in economic growth and the unemployment rate. Following a period of high growth rates early in the recovery, the unemployment rate stalled at about 5.5%. The unemployment rate fell from 10.8% to 9.4% in eight months. There was a debate on Okun's law and economic growth. Slow GDP growth in 2011 led to a stall in unemployment rate at 9.0%. Output growth increased in the fourth quarter, leading to a drop in unemployment rate to 8.5%. In 2011, the unemployment rate stalled at 9.0% due to slow GDP growth. It dropped to 8.5% in December 2011 after output growth accelerated in the fourth quarter. The decline in unemployment was greater than expected based on GDP growth. The unemployment rate dropped to 8.5% in December 2011, which was greater than expected based on GDP growth. Bernanke suggested that this temporary disconnect may have compensated for an earlier deviation from Okun's law. In 2011, the unemployment rate dropped to 8.5%, higher than expected based on GDP growth. Bernanke suggested this may have compensated for a previous deviation from Okun's law. Researchers at the New York Federal Reserve Bank found that Okun's law underpredicted the actual decline in the unemployment rate during recovery periods after previous recessions. The unemployment rate rose beyond expected levels during recovery periods after previous recessions, indicating a deviation from Okun's law. Some variation in the relationship between economic growth and unemployment rates may be due to the stage of the business cycle. Owyang and Sekhposyan suggest that back-of-the-envelope calculations may be more reliable during recessions than recoveries. Based on their analysis, Owyang and Sekhposyan suggest that the relationship between economic growth and unemployment rates may vary based on the business cycle. They caution against relying too heavily on simple calculations to relate changes in unemployment to output growth. In contrast, Ball et al estimated that increases and decreases in output have the same effect on unemployment, supporting Okun's law. The relationship between changes in the unemployment rate and output growth should be viewed as an approximation rather than a precise calculation. Ball et al found that increases and decreases in output have a consistent effect on unemployment, supporting Okun's law. They also showed that Okun's law remained valid during recent jobless recoveries, with the relationship between output and unemployment gaps aligning with predictions. The rule-of-thumb applies to both recoveries and recessions, with Okun's law remaining valid during recent jobless recoveries. Large output gaps persisted in the three jobless recoveries from 1990-1991, 2001, and 2007-2009 recessions. Researchers believe Okun's Law is a rare macroeconomic relationship that holds true. The recoveries from the 1990-1991, 2001, and 2007-2009 recessions showed large output gaps persisting into jobless recoveries. Researchers believe Okun's Law is a strong and stable macroeconomic relationship, although deviations are sometimes exaggerated. According to economist Robert J. Gordon, potential output has grown at an average annual rate of 3.4% since 1875. However, he predicts a slower growth rate of 2.4% over the next 20 years due to diminishing gains from information technology investments and declining labor force growth. Gordon predicts a slower growth rate of 2.4% in potential output over the next 20 years due to diminishing gains from information technology investments and declining labor force growth. Economists Basu and Fernald also discuss the impact of household net worth decline during the 2007-2009 recession on future growth. Economists Basu and Fernald suggest that a decline in household net worth during the 2007-2009 recession may lead to a larger supply of labor in the near term, temporarily boosting potential output growth. They also anticipate that disruptions in financial markets will constrain growth. The drop in wealth may lead to a larger supply of labor, temporarily boosting potential output growth. Disruptions in financial markets are expected to constrain growth. Weidner and Williams studied the relationship between economic growth and past recoveries. Weidner and Williams analyzed the relationship between economic growth and past recoveries, finding that potential output growth varied significantly. They estimated that potential GDP growth was rapid during the 1960s-1980s expansions but more moderate during the recoveries from the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions. The uncertainty in estimating growth in potential output is highlighted by the offsetting factors affecting markets. The economists analyzed potential output growth during past recoveries, noting rapid growth in the 1960s-1980s but more moderate growth in the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions. They estimated potential GDP growth at 2.1% during the Great Recession recovery, with higher growth likely leading to a decrease in unemployment. The Congressional Budget Office regularly forecasts potential output growth. The recovery from the Great Recession had a sluggish 2.1% growth rate due to slow labor force growth. Real economic growth above 2.1% could lower unemployment. The Congressional Budget Office projected a 2.2% annual growth rate for the overall economy from 2012 to 2022, lower than the 3.3% rate between 1950 and 2011. This lower projection is mainly due to reduced potential labor force. The CBO forecasted a 2.2% annual growth rate for the overall economy from 2012 to 2022, lower than the 3.3% rate between 1950 and 2011. This lower projection is mainly due to reduced potential labor force growth, with retirements among baby-boomers being a significant factor. The annual average growth rate of real GDP is expected to stay below the growth rate of potential output until 2018. The CBO projected a reduced potential labor force growth rate from 1.5% (1950-2011) to 0.5% (2012-2022) due to increasing retirements among baby-boomers. The annual average GDP growth rate is expected to remain below potential output growth until 2018. Unemployment is estimated to stay above 8.0% until 2014, then fall to 5.9% by 2017 as the output gap narrows."
