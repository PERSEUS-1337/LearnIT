    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on Instructional Level Assessment Pilot Program. The Secretary will award grants to up to ten State educational agencies for pilot programs to assess students with disabilities below grade-level proficiency and provide quality instruction. Grants will be for a 3-year period, and States must submit an application for the grant. The grants will be awarded to State educational agencies for pilot programs to assess students with disabilities below grade-level proficiency and provide quality instruction. The grants will be for a 3-year period, and States must submit an application for eligibility. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State must be determined by the Secretary to not need intervention in implementing requirements, have developed alternate assessments, and identify at least 5 local education agencies. The State must have developed alternate assessments and identified at least 5 local education agencies to be eligible for a grant under this section. The agency applying for the grant must provide guidance to the participating local education agencies on selecting students for the pilot. The pilot program will involve a diverse mix of rural and urban districts, small and large districts, and provide guidance on selecting students, assessment tools, and data collection. The pilot program requires scientifically valid assessment tools, data collection, assurance of response to intervention approach, and monitoring of local education agencies. The pilot program ensures quality instruction for all students and oversight of local education agencies, including monitoring of documentation by the IEP Team to identify students for participation. The pilot program limits student participation to 0.5% of the total population in each local educational agency and requires the IEP Team to identify students for participation. The pilot program limits student participation to 0.5% of the total population in each local educational agency and requires the IEP Team to determine if the alternate assessment to modified achievement standards is appropriate for the student and obtain parental consent before assessment. The pilot program limits student participation to 0.5% of the total population in each local educational agency. The IEP Team must determine if the alternate assessment to modified achievement standards is appropriate for the student and obtain parental consent before assessment. Students in the pilot program must receive data-driven, quality instruction in the grade-level content in the subject areas to be assessed. The IEP Team is required to examine the student's testing data, formative assessments, student work, IEP progress notes, and data. The pilot program ensures students receive quality instruction in grade-level content for the subject areas to be assessed. The IEP Team examines testing data, formative assessments, student work, and other data to determine if the student is performing significantly below their current grade level. The IEP Team uses various data sources to determine a student's instructional level, including assessments, student work, IEP progress notes, response to intervention data, and teacher recommendations. They assess if the student is performing three or more grade levels below in reading or math using reliable instruments. Additionally, they administer assessments based on the student's instructional level. The IEP Team uses reliable assessments to determine a student's instructional level in reading or math. Based on this assessment, targeted interventions are developed to address identified gaps in the student's learning. The IEP Team uses instructional level assessments to develop targeted interventions that address identified gaps in a student's learning in reading and math. Accountability measures ensure that assessment data is not used to determine proficiency levels. The data from instructional level assessments cannot be used to determine student proficiency levels or school progress under the Act. Each local education agency must provide reports. Assessments under this Act cannot be used to measure school progress. Local education agencies must compile reports on student proficiency levels and progress towards grade level proficiency. The pilot program assesses student's instructional level proficiency and progress towards grade level proficiency using alternate or regular academic achievement standards and a valid assessment. States must report on the number of students in the pilot and progress towards closing the proficiency gap. The pilot program requires State education agencies to submit an annual report to the Secretary detailing student participation and progress in closing the proficiency gap between instructional and grade level proficiency. Data collected will inform a report to Congress on the number of students in the pilot and changes in proficiency levels. The Secretary will use data collected to inform a report to Congress on student participation in the pilot program and changes in proficiency levels. $5,000,000 is authorized for grants under this section for fiscal year 2008."
